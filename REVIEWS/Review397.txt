		<shortDescription>Best Disney film ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well... No. Not quite. It's not the 'conventional classic' that everyone loves and adores (see: Aladdin, The Lion King) and will show their children and their children's children. But that's just it. How anybody can deny that this is a fantastic film is beyond me.Okay, it's in no way true to the story. But who cares? This is a Disney FILM. It's hardly setting out to be a serious piece of literature-to-film.It's just... breathtaking. Not just the animation (which is some of the most accomplished from Disney to date, whilst we're on the subject), but the characterisation and pace of story. Frollo is, arguably, the most evil Disney villain ever committed to celluloid. Here, Disney touches on dark themes never before explored in their animated feature lengths; the main one being lust. The scene with 'Hellfire' is truly chilling.Quasimodo is a brilliant Disney hero. His alienation is easy to relate to, and yet he's still alien enough for one to feel so sorry for him. He's just so tragic. His unrequited love for Esmerelda as she runs off with someone cooler and better looking is something we can all relate to. I quite like how the ending is part conventional for Disney and part not. Yes, the pretty heroine gets the knight in shining armour, but at the same time the real leading man doesn't have to be paired off with a beautiful leading girl in order to end up happy.The voices are really talented- the notable standout for me being Kevin Kleine as Phebus, and Esmerelda is arguably one of the best things Demi Moore has ever done. I also adore, against most people's opinions, the gargoyles. Yes, they're a bit OTT, but that's what Disney sidekicks are all about, and they provide essential comedy balance for the darkness of the film.The Hunchback Of The Notre Dame may not be the most authentic film storyline-wise, but it is dark, touching, scary, poignant, funny, chilling, moving (it never fails to leave me in floods of tears) and is one of the few Disney films that can stand alone from Disney as a wonderful piece of cinematography in it's own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney grows up, and it is good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into the theater to see this movie, my friend and I (who are "cynical" teenage movie critics) honestly expected to be disappointed, especially after the relatively blah Pocahontas. When the movie was over 90 min. later, we both ran frantically to go buy the CD and read the book (which, actually, was rather different than the movie, but hey.).I am 17 years old; I grew up watching The Little Mermaid and Aladdin. When Disney released this movie, which dealt with extremely heavy subject matter in an extremely tasteful manner, I jumped for joy. During the entire movie, I was amazed and spellbound. The music was also fantastic, by the way, as was the cinematography (although those crowd scenes begin to look really fake after a while). That scene where Quasimodo holds Esmerelda up in front of the rose window and yells, "Sanctuary!" still gives me chills.This is not a movie for children in any way, shape or form. I think the only problem with Hunchback is the fact that Disney refused to accept that this is a serious, relatively adult motion picture and would not make any animated movie, no matter how serious, without obnoxiously cute little critters (i.e., the gargoyles) bouncing around to entertain the kiddies, or huge marketing campaigns at McDonald's, etc. As some others have written on here, it's pretty obvious this movie isn't for kiddies from its subject matter.But anyone over 13 who's willing to think as well as be entertained when watching a Disney movie would probably love Hunchback.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Disney Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney adapts the famous novel by Victor Hugo into their 34th animated feature, telling the story of the lonely, deformed Quasimodo, the secluded bellringer of Notre Dame, who lives by himself in Notre Dame's church towers, with only three stone gargoyles named Victor, Hugo (get it?), and Laverne for company. At the gargoyles' playful urging, Quasi sneaks away from the church one day to attend the Festival Of Fools, and makes his first real human friend in the beautiful gypsy girl, Esmeralda. But soon, after Quasimodo is ridiculed by the crowd for his appearance, he and Esmeralda find themselves in trouble with Quasimodo's wicked stepfather, Frollo, the ruler of Notre Dame. With help from his three gargoyle friends, as well as the kind soldier Captain Phoebus (who has fallen in love with Esmeralda), it's up to Quasimodo to save Esmeralda and the town of Notre Dame itself from Frollo's evil control.... If you've been reading some of my other reviews, then you know by now that I'm a big fan of Disney animated features: "Snow White," "Fantasia," "Tarzan," and "Atlantis," to name but a few (and I do plan on reviewing more Disney films in the future). But now that I've just gotten reacquainted with Disney's 1996 film, "The Hunchback Of Notre Dame," finally released on DVD, I know now beyond the shadow of a doubt that this beautiful animated film is indeed my favorite Disney feature of them all (okay, so "Fantasia" arguably remains the best *animated* of the lot, but it certainly didn't have an actual plot). I don't think I've ever cried so much during a Disney movie. "The Hunchback Of Notre Dame" is, quite simply, a glorious triumph for Walt Disney Productions.Granted, the Disney team have "Disney-ized" Hugo's original novel, such as turning it into a musical, including sidekick stone gargoyles that come to life, as well as the obligatory happy ending, but no matter. This is a truly wonderful animated film through and through that will touch you right down to your very soul. It's very well-written, surprisingly dark at times, gorgeously animated, very funny AND very dramatic at turns, with a first-rate voice cast including Tom Hulce, Demi Moore, Kevin Kline, Tony Jay &amp; Jason Alexander, and beautiful, memorable songs by Alan Menken &amp; Stephen Schwartz. And I promise you, there won't be a dry eye in the house at the film's end, mark my words. HOW, in Heaven's name, did the Academy overlook "Hunchback Of Notre Dame" altogether in 1997? Not even any nominations for the music! Absolutely outrageous. Perhaps with the five previous Disney films in a row being honored by the Academy, from "The Little Mermaid" through "Pocahontas," the Academy simply wanted to take a break from nominating Disney films, not realizing how truly brilliant "The Hunchback Of Notre Dame" was. How very unfortunate that "Hunchback" had to fall victim to the Academy's ignorance that year.Still, it takes nothing away from the remarkable achievement that this Disney film is. Against all the odds, the Disney team transformed Victor Hugo's novel into a truly lovely tale for all ages to enjoy. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll enjoy the music, you'll be moved. Step aside, "Beauty And The Beast"---"The Hunchback Of Notre Dame" is the REAL Disney masterpiece from the last few years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's Miracle of a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A risky wedding of wholesome classic animation, to adult and often dark-themed material. The risk paid off and the result is one of the greatest achievements of Disney Studios.The animation here is first rate and the entire thing is shot like a live-action film with some incredible long shots, great theatrical panning and even at one point, during Quasimodo's song "Out There" a realistic camera flare (I did a double take the first time I saw it!) Hunchback is filled with all sorts of great "tricks" like this. Lighting effects here are nothing short of magnificent ? often subtle they sometimes change in an instant dramatically altering the mood of the piece. Frodo's demonic song "Hellfire" is perhaps one the most sinister and frightening moments to emerge from Disney and the animators let loose. The prologue to the movie alone is a minor masterpiece and, like Beauty and the Beast, marvelously prepares us for the whirlwind of a story to take place.The complaints about the singing and dancing gargoyles Victor, Hugo and Laverne, are simply wrongheaded. I read the Hugo classic too, and know they're not in there. What the complainants fail to realize is these gargoyles live only in Quasimodo's imagination. He invented these companions to ease an otherwise tortured, lonely, friendless life. The culmination of all of this becomes obvious in the spectacular song "A guy like you" which finishes with pigeons flying and hearts and banners and ribbons and Quasimodo being celebrated and then BAM immediately upon the conclusion of the final notes, the room becomes the same dark, dank, splintering tower filled with relics, junk and heartbreak. It's one of the movie's most shattering effects. While deserved praise goes to the animators and crew, the voice talent here is, in my opinion, Disney's very best. Tom Hulce goes to the very soul of Quasimodo and gives a performance that is as poignant and shattering as anything he has done (Hulce also happened to be the best Hamlet I've ever seen.) Certain lines ("I am a monster, you know") will ring in my ear forever. Hulce has a beautiful voice and renders "Out there" with such abandon and vigor it makes my hair stand on end. In the quiet "Heaven's light" (which sequences into a stunning shot of the bells frantically ringing the opening theme), Hulce brings a fragility to such lines as "no face as hideous as my face, was ever meant for Heaven's light" that only a heart of stone would not be moved. Switching from pathos to rage, Hulce lets us feel the hidden rage and danger that this character also possesses. It is a truly remarkable performance.Demi Moore, Kevin Kline, Tony Jay, Paul Kandel ? and the rest of the cast all sound at the top of their game creating wonderful and vivid characters. Alan Menkin and Stephen Schwartz get to the heart of the matter with score and songs ? a sound ? that are as integral a part of the telling of this story as the animation and voices. Hunchback is a miracle of a movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. . .I mean, Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is an inspired piece of filmmaking. After POCAHONTAS, many of my friends were disillusioned with Disney films, so I went to see it with just one other person (usually we go in groups of at least 4). I was awestruck. The movie is a perfect blend of all the things that make Disney such a respected name: beautiful music, breathtaking animation (a perfect blend of hand drawn and computer), entertaining for adults and kids alike (though this may not be a movie for the youngest of the young), and an intelligent and well-executed script. Paying proper respect to the story as written yet making the necessary refinements to make it a children's movie, this script (note how I carefully avoided a dangling participle), is one of the finest adaptations of a novel for the screen I have ever seen. And for those who thought the ending lost all of its tragic bite, I have one serious question for you: Why exactly DID Esmerelda choose Phoebus over Quasimodo? Think about it.

		<shortDescription>Very good music!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just read a comment that this movie has a lot of bad songs. I absolutely disagree - there may be some weak parts of script or so, but music is indeed very, very good. Alan Menken made a masterpiece, as usual! The orchestration, score, everything, not to mention good voices of characters. But it is true that maybe this story isn't exactly meant for children, although Disney tried to make it closer to a child's ear and eye. I also think that the animation was really good - much more expressive than some of newer Disney's movies that were made almost entirely by computers. It's a pity that Hunchback wasn't more successful - it certainly deserved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deliciously Dark, and Touchingly Religious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so impressed by this movie. The animation is gorgeous and a lot of the subject matter profound. Many critics have complained about the talking gargoyles messing up the movie and taking it further away from Hugo's original novel, but the only problem I have with them is their song (A Guy Like You), which attempts "Be Our Guest" and "Under the Sea" status, but really does lack the melody. Other than that, they fit right in with Hugo, who told in his novel that Quasimodo would sit for hours holding solitary converse with the statues. Of course, this was all in his mind, but hello, so are the gargoyles in the movie. No one else ever sees them talking or moving (with the exception of Djali), and they are animated to give Quasimodo some friends, just as he did on his own in the book. Of course, there are many other parts of the movie that are WAY different from the book, but not as many people complain about them, so I won't mention them. The main reason I love this movie is the villain, Frollo, played to perfection by Tony Jay. His sinister atmosphere and lust for Esmerelda are elements of the like we have never seen in any other Disney movie, prior to or after Hunchback. The song "Hellfire" is the crown jewel of the movie, and makes the entire thing worth watching. I was so surprised by the graphic lyrics and animation of this scene, and could do nothing but yell "THIS IS Disney!!!!!!!!!!" But it was a good surprise, not a bad one. Frollo is decidedly the deepest, and most evil of all Disney villains, and is definitely my favorite.The music in this movie is also the best that Disney has ever produced. Though the songs are not as catchy as those found in other memorable Disney movies, they are nonetheless the most powerful. In this movie, we find large-scale choral music in Latin, huge orchestral works, religious themes, and Broadway/Classical style arrangements that put most of the other Disney movies to shame. It truly is magnificent.I definitely recommend this movie to all audiences, and I give it a 10/10. This is the Disney movie that deserved an Oscar nomination more than any other, and it is a shame that it has been so underplayed and all but disowned by Disney since its release. SEE THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original film The Hunchback of Notre Dame was one of the saddest and most dramatic films ever. Now, Victor Hugo's original vision is put with color from disney, and it is still dramatic and sad, but it amazingly works into the Dinsey family fold, even if it is erotic, killing and weird. Great fun in voices from Thomas Hulce, Demi Moore, kevin Kline, Tonyt Jay and Jason Alexander as a gargoyle. One of the better animated films to come around in the 90's. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a surprise of a pleasant Disney film, in my opinion this is the last real great (hand drawn)animated Disney movie. I was eleven when this film was release and I saw it in the theater, I was just absolutely in love with this film. Still to this day I like watching it. It has such a beautiful story, a bit different from the original Hunchback of Notre Dame book, but they had to make it family friendly. Not to mention that the soundtrack to The Hunchback of Notre Dame is just so beautiful and awesome, the best since The Lion King. This is just such a charming and magical film, I can't see someone not falling in love with it.Quasimodo is a disfigured man who was raised by the evil and cruel Frodo who only keeps him to save himself from eternal damnation. One day Quasimodo goes down to the big fair and bumps into a beautiful gypsy, Esmeralda, who doesn't judge him by his looks but by his charming and kind personality. But when she saves him from the crowd's cruelty, she is a fugitive on the run now, but Quasimodo helps her and falls in love with her. But a new soldier, Phoebus, has also fallen for her and she has for him too, but they all must stick together in order to survive the cruel flames of Notre Dame.The Hunchback of Notre Dame is just such a great film to watch, it's a great family movie for the afternoon. It's such a touching story, it could even bring a few tears to your eyes, and some fun comedy to uplif the story. I loved the old man who is constantly in a trap of some sort and his line every time he gets free "I'm free! I'm free!", then he gets back in the same situation "Dangit!", that was funny. The cast was perfect and seemed to have a lot of fun with their characters. I highly recommend this film, it's a great Disney treasure.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Disney magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, in my opinion, is pure Disney magic. If you ask me, Frollo (voice of Tony Jay) was truly diabolical. On the other hand, Quasimodo (voice of Tom Hulce) and Esmeralda (voice of Demi Moore) were truly meant to be friends. I really enjoyed the music, especially "Someday," by All-4-One. "Out There" was good, too. In my opinion, Tom Hulce can really sing. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed Hugo's (voice of Jason Alexander) and Quasimodo's singing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this film that's pure Disney magic to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Disney-animated films of the '90s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not a kid-pleaser like "The Little Mermaid", Disney's rendering of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is in every way its equal. The Victor Hugo classic story about Quasimodo, disfigured outcast in medieval Paris who becomes a hero, surprisingly lends itself well to an animated re-enactment with songs. The drawings are handsome and active, very flashy, and the direction is tight if a bit frantic (were they afraid a slower pace would turn children off?). The production is beautiful, compensating I think for the lack of jokes (the gargoyle sidekicks not withstanding) and one really memorable song. The music is still quite good, and the celebrity voices (de rigeur these days) are expressive. The editing is a bit choppy, turning the proceedings into a cartoon hyperbole, but this is a captivating story and good, solid entertainment. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not too long ago, my sister watched Aladdin a lot. I thought the music was pretty good, and I wanted to check out more music by Alan Menken. I found Hunchback. I vaguely recalled scenes I had seen when I saw it at the theater (I was 5 or 6 then), so I wanted to remember what exactly happened in it. I listened to some of the music from it, and I was hooked. "Bells of Notre Dame" and "Topsy Turvy" continually play in my head (and I continually play them on the piano).I honestly think this movie is the best film I have ever seen. The music is fantastic, the animation is great, and the story is touching and heartwarming. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's one of the best movies i've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of the most moving movies I have ever seen. There were parts where I cried. I thought one of the coolest things about this movie was the introduction of Quasimodo. Not that part with Frollo almost drowning him, but the part where he comes out to check on the bird. The first time you see his face, it doesn't hit you as horrifying at all. Then, you see him talking to the little bird, and you realize how sweet and kind this guy is. I fell in love with him right there. By the way, I actually like his smile, I think it's cute. Anyways, you start to really identify with the character when he's sad about only being able to watch the festival. You start to see more emotion in this character and you feel for how alone he is and you feel so sorry for him. But, Quasimodo's ability's astound me. I know that his enormous strength is realistic after 20 years of ringing those heavy bells, but when he breaks the pillars before going to rescue Esmeralda, that was awesome. I like the gargoyles too, that was pretty neat. This is one of those classic Disney movies that you will never forget. Anybody who gives this movie less than a ten is nuts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Disney Film Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" in the cinema when it first came out and I was about 5 or six years of age. I didn't think much of it, but having revisited it after all these years, I am convinced that this is Walt Disney Studios' most amazing effort yet. Despite the fact that it ignores much of its somber source material (understandibly), it is an incredible film on any level and certainly not one to be missed.In case you're unfamiliar with the story, the film centers around the, well, Hunchback of Notre Dame: Quasimodo. Kept high up in the bell tower of the cathedral because of his hideous appearance by his cruel master Judge Claude Frollo (one of Disney's best villains), Quasi longs to be outside in the real world. After being convinced by his gargoyle friends to venture out into the world on the Festival of Fools, Quasi is beaten and humiliated because of his appearance, but is saved by the beautiful gypsy dancer Esmeralda. Frollo wishes to rid the city of the "gypsy scum" and Esmeralda is forced to take sanctuary inside the cathedral, where she befriends Quasi. To complicate matters, Captain of the Guard Phoebus has fallen in love with Esmeralda and so has Frollo. Phoebus defies Frollo's wishes to kill innocent gypsies and becomes, like Esmeralda, a fugitive, who is forced to hide in the cathedral as well under the protection of Quasimodo. However, once Frollo finds out the Quasi has been helping those who Frollo hates, it leads to an all out battle on the steps of Notre Dame, with a heart-pounding climax and bittersweet resolution.This is by far Disney's best film, with beautiful animation, amazing voice talents, and a wonderful (if not completely faithful) story. Highly Recommended! WARNING: Some material in this film may be too intense for young children; there is talk of hell, damnation, a woman being trampled to death on the steps of the cathedral, a man being publicly humiliated, whipping, and suggestive material. Parent be cautioned.Rating-****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most beautiful, in-depth Disney film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I just want to say this movie is extremely underrated. It didn't get all that much hype when it came out. I think a lot of people didn't like this movie for the reason they didn't like Pocahontas- it doesn't have your typical, falling in love, boy gets girl Disney ending. Actually, having the Disney label on it makes people upset when they see it because they expect a Disney plot. Peel the Disney label off, however, and you will find a wonderful, beautiful, heartfelt movie with probably the best music Disney has ever made. The music is actually on par with Broadway music, such as phantom of the opera. I could easily see is being in a top notch play. It also has the most beautiful animation a Disney movie has ever had. In fact, there were some points that I actually thought a scene was a photographs. However-this movie is not for young kids. It is not scary, but the themes are much to complex for them to understand. The humor is also to complex for young children and some older ones. Its very subtle and you probably wont catch it the first time seeing it. Their is one scene where you can see Belle walking with a book, the magic carpet being shaken, and Puumba about to be roasted all together in the background. The villain in this movie, Judge Claude Frollo, is probably the most evil Disney villain ever created. He is complex and so twisted that he thinks the evilness he is doing is right. On top of that, he is an archdeacon, a worshipper of God. The song, "Hellfire" is the most compelling, greatest song in the whole movie. It just shows how purely evil and lustful Judge claude frollo is and how he struggles with himself on what is right and wrong. 1 scene that shows his evilness is when he uses some ants living under a block to demonstrate the gypies(whom he wants to illiminate,) hiding in their underground lair, the court of miracles. First he squishes three ants that are on top of the block and says that he has destroyed the gypsies one by one. He then picks up the block and shows the rest of the ants to Pheobus (who later becomes esmereldas love) and tells him that despite his efforts, the gypsies have thrived in their secret lair, like the ants thriving under the block. When Phoebus asks him what he is giong to do about it, Judge Claude Frollo's face twists into a grin and he slams the block back down on top of the ants, to demonstrate him destroying the gypsies within their secret lair. but what is most sickening is after he slams the block down he twists it, as if merely killing the ants weren't enough, he has to twist the block to cruelly kill them. Another significant scene is when he sets a house on fire and locks people inside them. Phoebus manages to rescue this one family. However, the next scene is a shot of the city all around Notre dame, every single house on fire, and a gigantic cloud of smoke rising from the entire city. If you haven't figured it out, this scene shows all the people who are locked in their houses burning alive because of Claude frollo. It shows his immense evilness and power. But fret not- kids probably will not catch on to this, they will just think the city is on fire, but they will not make the connection that people are still in the house. However, the older kin , teenagers and older, will catch onto this. This scene is what struck me so hard as to name Judge Claude frollo as the most evil Disney villain in my opinion. This movie is dark (for Disney), clever, complex, and has an excellent plot and moral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney Goes Dark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently rediscovered this film and have realized one thing : that this film is Disney's most darkest film yet. The film is based on Victor Hugo's lavish novel that disney tries to sugar up without losing its edge. The film's subject matter ranges from understanding others to even dark things such as racism. This film is not for the younger fans due to sequences such as The villans blatantly sexual obcession for Esmerelda or the even more depressing sequence of Quasimodo's mother dying. The songs remind you of Baz Lurhman's Moulin Rouge and by the time your done you can't get them out of your head. My suggestion is to rent this film along with Beauty an the Beast for an even more enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

The three of them find themselves ranged against Frollo's brutality and his attempts to eliminate the Court of Miracles . But the hunchback will tolerate no harm coming to her , not even if it comes from his own master .This Walt Disney retelling of Victor Hugo's ever popular novel with classical characters such as an appropriately gorgeous gypsy who performs a bewitching dance in front of delighted spectators and a deformed bell ringer . Best cartoon updating in which is combined hand-drawn animation with 3D scenes ; it is infused with songs , sweep , a love story , drama , multi-plane effects and an attempt at capturing a degree of spirited Hugoesque detail . However , this movie is considered to be one of the darkest Disney animated features along with The Black Cauldron and the Brave Little Toaster . Good drawings from Quasimodo character , the Hunchback in Hugo's eponymous novel , reflecting perfectly his contortions and expressive gestures . In addition , overwhelming camera work that pans through the Parisian buildings , Notre Dame and the Palace of Justice . There are several computer generator frames and digital images , such as all the bells appearing throughout the movie are 3D-rendered , also when Quasimodo was sliding down the flying buttress and when he was rappelling down from Notre Dame to save Esmeralda , the background flames are one good example of CGI , during the "Topsy Turvy" sequence, the confetti and the crowd of hundred people during the "Hellfire" sequence ; at the flames scenes that big and appearing too fast were hard to animate traditionally , so probably the animators used computer generated images for this . This properly melodramatic and fun flick packs a colorful cinematography , impressive images and is full of computer animation and CGI backgrounds . Blue and red colour were used to symbolize good and evil, respectively , Quasimodo's and Esmerelda's disguising cloaks are blue while the firelight Frollo is near as he plots evilly to himself reflects off his face as red . The sweeping musical score was provided by the great Alan Menken , furthermore a lot of Latin chants heard throughout the movie are adapted from actual Gregorian chants, including the Dies Irae , a portion can be heard in the scene where Frollo kills Quasimodo's mother. This 34th full length animated film from Walt Disney was stunningly directed by Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale , being followed by another and inferior Disney sequel .This is an animated remake of several earlier films , including the followings : 1923 silent vintage take on by Wallace Wolsey with Lon Chaney Sr ; classic version by William Dieterle (1939) with Maureen O'Hara , Charles Laughton , Edmond O'Brien and Cedric Hardwicke ; 1956 update by Jean Delannoy with Anthony Quinn , Gina Lollobrigida and Alain Cuny . And subsequently realized for TV as 1982 rendition with Anthony Hopkins , Derek Jacobi and Lesley-Anne Down and 1998 by Peter Medak with Salma Hayek and Mandy Patinkin .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reinventing Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading all of the negative comments on this movie, and it just baffles me how people can't really see the big picture here (no pun intended) Though Disney has enchanted us in the past with sickly sweet renditions of timeless fairytales in the past, I think that it's a good thing that Disney embark on creating a more dark and looming satire.Now although I am a huge advocate of Disney it's no mystery that they have turned storylines around on mostly all of their movies. I dont think I have seen one of their animated features, that was derived from a story that they didn't change the plot around on. And though most of us know that Sleeping Beauty's original story didn't include 3 good fairies, nor did Beauty and the Beast feature singing Dishware or Gueston (sp), but we still loved those movies regardless, and that it because they were well done. So in saying all of that, why should this one be any different. It didn't follow the Hunchback's novel completely but it doesn't mean that it was horrible. On the contrary, I admire Disney for trying to reninvent themselves by attempting this challenge.Of course there are alot of things in the book that MUST be taken out of the movie in order for the movie to remain children-friendly. Let's face it the story of the Hunchback is definately one of the darkest, and the combination of religion,lust,and racism which is major concept in the book, needs to be toned down. It is even painful to me, a young adult to stomach alot of what is portrayed in the original Hunchback. I know that children couldn't possibly understand what the real lessons of the book were trying to portray.However, I believe that Disney reformed this story as to not really narrate the book as I think it was made to prove a point, and to educate children on the cruelty of society in general.The second time i saw this film, i had rented it and watched it with a three year old girl that I was nannying at the time. Her mother wanted her to see it but I was reluctent to subject the little girl to the darkness of the message. Regardless of everything, I do think this film is more of a FAMILY film, than a CHILDREN'S film. If children are going to see this, then they need a parent to watch it with them. Through out the entire movie the little girl reacted the exact same way that I am sure Disney wanted her to. She would constantly ask me questions like. "Why do people make fun of Quazi, he is a nice guy", and "That Frollo man is so mean to people". Regardless of the inacuracies to the book, the little girl was learning a lesson. Don't judge a book by it's cover, and be kind to your fellow man.I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I thought it to be very well done, and the music was outstanding. "The Bells of Notre Dame" give me a chill everytime I hear it sung, and there was a good blend of humor, and drama. Disney, once again hits the nail on the head, and it's one that I am going to be adding to my Christmas list in the future.Enough said!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most Disney movies I get tired of after being forced by my younger siblings to watch them a hundred times in a row. However, there are several Disney movies I never get sick of, and Hunchback is at the top of that list, followed closely by Sleeping Beauty (which, incidentally, has Tchaikovsky's ballet&gt; as background music), Mulan, Tarzan, and Beauty and the Beast.There's a lot of symbolism in Hunchback that kids (and many adults too) just won't get. If I were to analyze this movie in an essay I would have a field day. Also, Alan Mencken's score is as close to the voice of God as anything has gotten since the days of composers such as Beethoven and Mozart. The only other composer who has recently written music of that caliber is Hans Zimmer (Prince of Egypt, Road to El Dorado)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Disney Classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been my favorite of Disney since I was a little girl, and it still remains to be. I have always been hooked by the amazing storyline (yes, I have read the book), and when I was young, and still yet, the plot never ceases to amaze me.The animation blows me away every time I watch it. All of the characters are very well designed and animated, and although many characters are 2-D, you can see that the shading is magnificent. The surprising amount of darkness that is in the movie always kept my interest.My only discouragement is with the gargoyles. I am very well aware that this is (mainly) a children's movie, but the rest of the setting, plot, storyline, and everything else is dark, deep, and sensual. Then these talking stones pop in and assume the comic relief position. Yeah...doesn't seem to fit well for me. But the rest is absolutely wonderful, and it continues to be my favorite Disney movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest Disney of all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There can be no denying that Walt Disney studios have produced many good animated films, especially in the last decade, but, without a doubt, The Hunchback of Notre Dame is the best. It deals with adult themes of love, insanity, isolation, desire and corruption, all in a way that still gives the viewer - children and adults alike - an enjoyable viewing experience.The characters are all wonderfully voiced and virtually faultless in development and style. Best of all, though, is the music, composed by Alan Menken and sung by the characters of the film. The running theme of the bells of Notre Dame in the music is a great device, and you will have the songs in your head for days.Very highly recommended, 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent adaptation of Hugo's novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I'm sure many others will disagree with me, I've always found this movie to be an excellent adaptation of Victor Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris. Though there are certainly many obvious deviations from the novel, most of them can be forgiven.This is technically a children's movie, but it's certainly more mature than many other Disney movies, particularly in Frollo's not-very-subtle lust for Esmeralda and the cruel treatment of Quasimodo that reveals maybe a little too much of the darker side of human nature. Though many of the novel's darker parts are left out and the usual Disney trademarks included (characters breaking into song and dance, talking gargoyles), the subject matter makes this movie more appropriate for an older age group. It's a shame that Hunchback of Notre Dame isn't one of Disney's more popular movies, but it's certainly understandable that parents would prefer their children to watch something more lighthearted like Cinderella.As for the score, it's certainly one of Disney's better ones, and that's saying quite a lot. Many of the songs, particularly 'God Help the Outcasts', 'Out There', 'Hellfire/Heaven's Light', are filled with both exuberant happiness and heartbreaking wishfulness and despair. The soundtrack is definitely worth its price, as is the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MR. DISNEY, HIMSELF, WOULD BE PROUD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because I've read how the original "Fantasia" was his attempt to meld classical music with cartoon animation for the audiovisual pleasure of the average person. And, though it was a box-office flop in the beginning, time has ultimately proven Walt's faith justified. Well, I am unalterably certain that he would have felt doubly rewarded, in the case of "HOND." This is the closest I've ever seen an animated feature come to being a grand opera! *Possible spoilers.* The villainy of Frollo; the cat-and-mouse love that develops between Phoebus and Esmeralda; and the strong, quiet, often-tragic heroism of Quasimodo. No matter how many times I watch the video of this movie, I never come away from it with dry eyes. And, for a middle-aged guy like myself to shamelessly admit that isn't easy! In short, I think this version of "Hunchback of Notre Dame" indisputably deserves four stars. And, any armchair reviewer who gives it less is a heartless Philistine!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't as good as Beauty and the Beast, but it is miles better than the Black Cauldron and Home on the Range, which are probably the weakest Disney movies I've seen. Stop criticising it, because it is unfaithful to the book. There are some parts of the book, that just wouldn't work, like the character of Clopin, if he was the same as he was in the book he would be too frightening for kids. Don't get me wrong, it is an amazing book, but a very complex one as well. Of course, it is more adult than most Disney movies, but it means it is mature, and I found it a dark, powerful, poignant and really chilling film, if in comparison to other Disney movies is slightly disappointing. The IMDb rating for this movie is far too low, it deserves a 7.0 to be honest. The animation is fantastic, so crisp and smooth. Notre Dame has never looked so magnificent, even in real life. The highlight was Quasimodo saving Esmeralda from getting burnt at the stake, accompanied by a hauntingly-beautiful Dies Irae. The characters are also well done, and so is the theme-driven story, and the themes are very mature and complex. Speaking of the characters, I know all of them had changed, but they were so well-developed, unlike Black Cauldron. Quasimodo was poignantly voiced by Tom Hulce, and his character is possibly the most sensitive character in Disney history. Esmeralda was brilliantly voiced by Demi Moore, who brought a little bit of herself into the role. She is feisty and beautiful. When you look into her eyes, you instantly know how wrong Frollo is about her. I have always loved her hair, but her chief beauty are her eyes, a beautiful colour and filled with such sadness. Frollo is a very complex villain, and the sinister timbre of Tony Jay's voice flawlessly matched that. The sequence in front of the fireplace was a definite highlight and gave me goosebumps, as well as his death scene. He looked evil! Then there is Clopin, a very underrated and relevant character. Paul Kandel voiced him marvellously and his singing was out of this world. Pheobus was the most changed character, but Kevin Kline was really funny here. I liked the gargoyles, they were very funny. However, my only criticism about this movie, is to do with them. I liked their song "Guy Like You" but it was misplaced. It should have been put there 20 minutes earlier, not when Paris is burning down. The songs are on the whole just brilliant, and the score so powerful and emphatic! The magnificent opening is the best beginning to a Disney movie. "Out there" is very heartfelt, and "Topsy Turvey" is great fun. "God help the Outcasts" is hauntingly beautiful. The only song I had a problem with was the song in the Court of Miracles, because I couldn't hear a word they were singing, and I loved "Someday" and "Heaven's Light". Some bits made me laugh, but there were plenty of scenes that made me cry, especially when Quasimodo thinks Esmeralda is dead, and he is seen comforting her body. Really poignant! In conclusion, a brilliant movie, with one of the most poignant endings in an animated film. 9/10, though it was so close to a 10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

The Hunchback of Notre Dame is one of my favorite movies. It's filled with romance , action , humor , drama , and suspense. The songs are the best, from the famous music composer Alan Menken.There are so many different varieties. From "Out There" to "Topsy Turvy" to "Hellfire" to "God Help The Outcasts" . The story is great too. It is about a mysterious , shy bell ringer named Quasimodo who wants to be in the outside world , but it is forbidden by his evil , master Frollo who killed his mother when he was a baby.Quasimodo finally enters the outside where he meets a gypsy girl named Esmerelda.The most unlikely of heroes , Quasi has to fight to protect Paris from Frollo.It includes famous voices too , Tom Hulce (Quasimodo) , Kevin Kline (Phoebus) , Jason Alexander (Hugo) , and Demi Moore (Esmerelda).The Hunchback of Notre Dame will be one of your favorite Disney movies , i assure you.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual, dark animated entry from Disney.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Hugo's classic story The Hunchback Of Notre-Dame does not seem the kind of source Disney studios would usually turn to for their animated movies. This is by far the darkest, most complex, in some ways most sexual, of the Disney cartoons. It's quite heavy-going for kids, with a plot that encompasses many themes from loyalty to desire, cruelty to revenge. There's still evidence of the treacly Disney influence, including a trio of extremely irritating gargoyles who provide resistible comic relief. Also, Quasimodo has been prettified by the animators so that he remains mis-shapen but has a certain cuteness, and the book's wonderfully tragic ending has been altered to make for a much happier conclusion.One night in Paris, the chief protector Frollo (frighteningly voiced by Tony Jay) kills a gypsy woman on the steps of Notre-Dame only to discover that in her arms she holds a baby. He contemplates killing the child too, for it is a grossly disfigured and hideous creature, but he is persuaded to spare the youngster and raise it as his own. Frollo decides to force the child to live within the bell tower of Notre-Dame, where he raises it out of sight from the eyes of the world. 20 years on, the baby has grown into Quasimodo (voiced by Tom Hulce), an agile, sensitive, ridiculously devoted hunchback whose views and thoughts have been twisted his whole life by the devious teachings of his master, Frollo. During the annual Festival of Fools, Quasimodo ventures for the first time into the streets of the city but is mistaken as an entrant in the king of fools contest, which he wins, though the victory parade turns sour and cruel. Quasimodo is rescued from humiliation by the beautiful gypsy girl Esmerelda (superbly voiced by Demi Moore), much to the ire of Frollo. Frollo, pretending to despise the gypsy girl though in truth he desires her to be his, literally razes Paris to the ground in his efforts to find her. But, once he has finally captured her she chooses death rather than to fulfil his desires, and at the very moment Frollo attempts to burn her at the stake, Quasimodo finally sees the error of his master's teachings and swings to Esmerelda's rescue.The animation is quite splendid, with fantastic views of historic Paris and some excellent characters (Esmerelda is the most beautiful of all Disney's animated female characters, and Frollo is a truly scary addition to the studio's long line of villains). The music and songs are excellent, too (the scoring during the scene where Quasimodo shins up the walls of Notre-Dame, having just saved Esmerelda from a fiery death, is memorably stirring). However, The Hunchback Of Notre-Dame has a couple of flaws which prevent it from attaining the heights of Beauty And The Beast and The Lion King. For one thing, it forgets that it is a film primarily intended for children and features some over-complicated - even confusing - plotting and vocabulary (how many kids films can you name that contain words like "consternation" and "licentious"?) For another, the film repeatedly cops out by counterbalancing its darker and crueler elements with compensatory, almost apologetic, niceties (the gargoyles being the prime example). The Hunchback Of Notre-Dame is a flawed but fascinating film and it is to be hoped that one day the folks at Disney will be bold enough to try something as dark and mysterious as this again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adult Themes Handled Incredibly Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be the strangest review you read today...but, I will say that this movie is underrated! Some people have complained about the dark, lustful nature of the Frolo villain, saying it made the movie less appropriate for kids.All I can say is...don't underestimate kids. I mean, just because a theme is dark and troubling doesn't mean it can't be handled in an age-appropriate manner if done correctly.I was a little girl once, about fourteen or so. I went to a Catholic school. And I could relate to this song in so, so many ways. I didn't end up burned at the stake, but there are other ways to hurt a person. We've all heard the stories...and it's not only boys.And since I had nowhere to turn and no one believed me, you have no idea how many times I listened to this song in my room. Just so I could feel slightly less alone. Long story short, I think that Disney performed a public service here. In creating this movie, they hid a little message that could help kids survive...in between all the layers of sugar and silly singing gargoyles. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down? I think that was also in a Disney movie. All I know is, it was medicine I needed at the time, and I'm glad I got it.&#xfeff; So this remains one of my favorite children's movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves much more attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always this movie that almost no kids watch. They know about Ariel, Aladdin, Belle, Snow White, Cinderella, but almost never Quasimodo or Esmeralda. Even the bird from The Lion King gets more recognition than this. I find it a pity, as this is one of the cases where the "Disney" brand works against the company. But I cannot argue. This movie is not for young kids. Whereas the few little ones who watch it might enjoy it, chances are that they will not be able to appreciate this film fully. The voice-acting is great here, as with all other Disney films I have watched. I just want to point out one instance, when Quasimodo is singing "Heaven's Light" and toying around with his miniature figurines. The moment I saw him pick his up, I bawled like a kid. I don't know why, but at that time I was so emotional. Maybe I just felt the effects of Frollo's brainwashing and emotional abuse of Quasimodo throughout the years- it utterly twisted his self perception, and he really does think that he is unworthy of anything other than abuse. I'm sure other Disney fans like me are aware that Disney is pushing out 3D format for some of the selected movies. First up was TLK, which, I concede, I can't argue against that. Next comes BATB, which I also concede to. I do hope that they have this film in mind for the future. It probably won't be the next one straight after BATB(probably Aladdin or TLM would have their chance first), but wow... the special effects in this film. The moment I thought of 3D, I knew this film would be my first choice. Well, this and Tarzan(nothing like skating acrobatics being performed on tree trunks), but I feel this movie has more potential.In conclusion, if you are old enough to read this, do watch it. You may or may not enjoy it as much as I do, but it won't be a waste of resources.Last kudos to the voice actors before I stop, and of course I must mention "Hellfire". Straight up one of the best music Disney ever came up with. This song is only just tying with "Tale As Old As Time" in my book, and they are from entirely different genres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawless sanctuary masterpiece from and Disney's darkest picture since The Black Cauldron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney has pulled off some great masterpieces including The Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Pinocchio, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. They've done it again in making their own version of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", based on the novel by Victor Hugo.The story takes place in Notre Dame, Paris 1482 where a deformed hunchback named Quasimodo, who desires to be outside of the church before being told by his adoptive father Frollo that "out" there is filled with cruel people who might scorn him. Despite being told to stay inside forever, Quasimodo cheered on by his gargoyle friends Victor, Hugo, and Laverne, decides to take part in the festivities, where he meets the lively gypsy girl Esmeralda and the handsome soldier Phoebus. The three of them find themselves ranged against Frollo's cruelty and his attempts to destroy the home of the gypsies, the Court of Miracles. And Quasimodo must desperately defend both Esmeralda and the very cathedral of Notre Dame.For such a take on the novel, Disney had succeeded in making this film a lot darker (similar to that of Richard Rich's The Black Cauldron) by capturing the tone of the book while having a pervading atmosphere of racial tension, religious bigotry and mob hysteria. The story is absolutely touching it would bring you tears throughout the film, the music/songs by Alan Menken are memorable and original, the animation is unbelievably lovely along with the solid character animations, the characters are likable and the voice acting is nice.The Hunchback of Notre Dame is yet another masterpiece that kids and families would love. If you come across an original fantasy Disney movie, then this is worth checking out.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that a lot of people dislike Hunchback, but I seriously can't see why. This film, just like The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, is a flawless Disney masterpiece. It has entertainment on every level, a dark story about sin and death, references to traditional religious values, and well-placed humor by the animated gargoyles. Overall, it's a lot of fun. All the characters seem to have essentially the same story, having a heart of gold but being violently mistreated, but seconds after their appearance on screen, you feel as though you know and relate to them. The music is stunningly intelligent for one of these hand-drawn gems, having sort of a mysterious sound as beautiful and abrasive as one of Quasi's bells. 10/10 Skip the reviews and see this movie for yourself. A definite recommend.</fullReview>

Also, the music adds the trademark Disney Charm. I find this movie to be different from every other Disney movie. It certainly delves deeper into the love lives of the characters. The song "Hellfire" almost earned the movie a PG rating for its lyrics and the animation shown during the song. It is the only Disney song I can think of that directly references lust. All in all, the movie is original but still retains the famous Disney charm that enables it to capture the hearts of children and adults everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, darker Disney (and a real treat--musically)Not for children!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first viewing of Disney's The Hunchback... left me speechless for hours. I was absolutely blown away by the stunning score and songs, the unbelievable visual panoramas, and the strong characterizations. Musically, the movie cannot be dismissed, and I'm still bothered by the fact that the film Emma managed to snag the Oscar that year. Hunchback's time period score is brilliant, incorporating Gregorian Chant and latin text in songs that are quite memorable, contrary to what some have said. The songs don't have the simplistic melodies of Under the Sea, but songs like Hellfire, Out There, God Help The Outcasts, and the opener are magical in their own rights. The movie is not for children, mainly because the dialogue, and themes are so dark.(should have been rated PG at least) The movie blatantly shows the dangers in mixing religion and good/evil. It's amazing to see how Disney succeeded in tackling the most difficult of issues: religion. Everybody can find something to relate to in this movie. I found Quasimodo to be the most complicated character on the big screen that I have ever seen. So many emotions, and so many choices to make. Does he long for the returned love of the girl of his dreams, or does he long for the love of freedom. In the end, the decision of freedom becomes the more important of the two, and the theme of sacrificing one's personal happiness for the happiness of others is a theme that's never been executed better by Disney. Congratulations Disney, for taking risks and succeeding with a film that will live on in the hearts of many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, horrible book adaption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, it seems to be impossible for directors to stay true to Victor Hugo's book when making it into a film. I've seen at least 4 adaptations and none of them got the story even halfway right.This one takes the cake though.Not only has the story been changed at every turn (a happy ending? seriously?) but all the main characters have been turned into their exact opposite. Esmeralda, a naive and frail young girl, becomes a confident and witty woman. Quasimodo, in the book an antisocial, mean 18 year old (who is also, inconveniently, deaf - no way Disney would keep that little detail) becomes a cuddly stuffed animal who helps little birds learn how to fly. Claude couldn't possibly stay a priest of course. This isn't really unusual, as far as I know all versions before 1956 either made him a judge or left out his obsession with Esmeralda and Disney is almost always a few decades behind morally. But that they left out almost every redeeming character trait he possesses in the book, that he kills Quasimodo's mother and tries to throw Quasi down a well instead of adopting the monstrous child of unknown origin when everyone else thinks it's a demon, that he doesn't even show a hint of the romanticism that overwhelms him in the last third of the book (when he isn't threatening Esmeralda with death and/or rape that is), that instead of his fierce intellect and curiosity it is the lust for power that dominates his actions, this is unforgivable. And of course, perhaps the most absurd move, as much ridiculous as it is typical of Disney, Phoebus, the insensitive, dumb, opportunistic soldier who gets way more attention than he deserves due to his good looks, becomes the knight in shining armor - literally!That being said, some of the scene were actually very intense and well-crafted. When liquid fire was running out of every hole of the cathedral, when Claude was hunting Quasimodo's mother through snow-covered Paris to a choir singing "Dies Irae", the song "Hellfire", these were the moments when the film, despite all its alterations, came pretty close to the dramatic and dark atmosphere of the book.All in all I would say this is indeed the best film version of "Notre Dame de Paris" - as the book was originally called, without much focus on the hunchback, who in the book is only the 4th most important character - mainly because the other version are pretty bad.One last thought: When I first watched the film, my reaction was: Talking gargoyles? Really? But then it occurred to me: The gargoyles aren't actually becoming alive for their friend Quasimodo, Disney in its dark cynicism made the poor, lonely Quasimodo imagine things to cope with his pain. His psyche is wounded by the constant ostracism and the emotional torture at Claude's hands to the point where it desperately makes up friends to gain at least some feeling of being loved. This is so wonderfully twisted. I have to watch the film again to check whether any of the other characters actually interact with the gargoyles and if yes, how much ambiguity there is in these scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you love the book... this is a penance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this bowdlerisation of one of my favourite novels is probably the nearest I will ever get to a medi?val-style penance such as wearing a hairshirt.I'm giving the film 4 stars for the quality of the animation: the cityscapes and the cathedral are beautifully realised. There are a few (very few) moments of expressionistic power: the 'Hellfire' sequence in particular reminded me of Musorgskii's 'Night on the Bald Mountain' in 'Fantasia', and suggests the story's real tragic, passionate heart, but... It's *not* my beloved 'Notre Dame de Paris'.What it is is a sanitised, smugly 'feel-good' fable with a happy ending, trying to hitch a ride on a masterpiece by stealing a few character-names and concepts from the novel. It is heavily indebted to previous film versions which were also far from faithful. It follows the 1923 and 1939 films (which were prevented from depicting the clergy 'disrespectfully' by the NAMPI 'Thirteen Points' and the Hays Code respectively) in turning the Frollo brothers into a 'good' Archdeacon and an 'evil' secular judge, with the latter having Claude's tortured passion for Esmeralda. (Never mind the fact that without a conflict over his priestly vows of celibacy, this plot line is weakened drastically.) 'Judge' Frollo here even looks like Cedric Hardwicke from the 1939 film, down to his chaperon hat, although here he has at least been named Claude. (In the 1923 and 1939 versions, the sexually repressed 'evil' brother was Jehan, which is hilarious if you know the book!) This film also follows Hugo's stage version, 'La Esmeralda' (1835) and the 1923 film in de-sleazing Ph?bus and making him the romantic lead. (SPOILERS AHEAD) The death of the young mother, hitting her head on the steps, in the prologue seems to me to borrow from Pquette's death near the end of the novel. In turn, I wonder if the scene of the burning of the miller's cottage influenced Roland Emmerich's 'The Patriot' (2000)? While these changes are understandable in trying to make a film derived from a very adult novel palatable for children (and I appreciate that I'm *not* the target audience), I wonder *what was the point*? Surely it would have been better to write an *entirely original* story to express the desired themes, than tack it on to a classic? My fear is that it may have 'poisoned the well' for some younger viewers when it comes to approaching the book at a later stage. For one thing, it turns the novel on its head by making a smarmy, shallow playboy into a dashing romantic lead, and the almost Dostoevskian, intellectually brilliant but sexually and emotionally tormented young tragic hero/anti-hero into a sneering villain old enough to be his father! One of the most infuriating scenes is the adoption of Quasimodo. In the book, he is placed in the Cathedral as a foundling, aged about 4. Claude Frollo, already a priest at 19-20, adopts him out of genuine compassion, because he himself has just been orphaned and left with the care of his baby brother. The replacement of this deeply moving scene with a horrific crime is a grotesque distortion of character and tone. My sole consolation is a personal fantasy of the book's Claude anathematising the entire Disney Corporation in full solemn ritual, with bell, book and candle. (I rather think he'd enjoy doing it, too!) I now have this nightmare of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy starring as 'The Krazy Karamazov Brothers': it no longer seems impossible...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No mere animation cartoon ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't laugh that this is a mere animation cartoon.It is a really wonderful story and with excellent images. This story was written by Victor Hugo. Quasimodo, who is the main character of this story, was not allowed to go down from the top of Notre Dame by his foster father.But one day, he decided to get down from there anyway following the advice of his friends, who were actually stone statues. Then he met Esmeralda, who was a graceful gypsy girl. I think that it is pity that Esmeralda didn't love Quasimodo, but Quasimodo had a really strong character and he was very brave. As well as telling a great story, the animation used in this film is great. I really love this film. I hope that this film will be watched by many people. So I can strongly recommend it to you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Disney Film with One Major Flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this film 10/10 even with its major flaw because it's a fantastic, mature and cinematic experience like none other. Before I mention the bad, I'll talk about the amazing.Hunchback is a very notable story by French author Victor Hugo (who also wrote another novel-turned-musical Les Miserables) about a young man with a severe birth defect that causes his back to bend and hunch, and to also have a disfigured face. I have not read the original book, but I know that the ending (and some minor character elements) are different from the film, but I like the film anyway, and I think the changes are fine.So Quasimodo has been raised in the Notre Dame cathedral by a Justice named Frollo (in the original novel, he was a priest). He works as a bell-ringer and desires to go outside the church for just one day.When a Gypsy festival rolls into town, he decides to escape into it and explore, but when his disfigurement is discovered to not be a disguise, everyone immediately turns on him, and he is basically beaten until a kind, open minded performer named Esmerelda rescues him.The main theme of this movie is acceptance. Gypsy (or Romani) have been very much segregated and judged by their race, even to this day, and until very recently, people with severe physical deformities were considered freaks of nature and were either locked away, or exhibited in circuses. While the original novel was very critical of the church, the Disney film is balanced. The head priest of Notre Dame considers the church a place of sanctuary and non-judgment, which shows the accepting nature of the church, while Frollo uses his Christianity as a tool to control Quasimodo and the Gypsies, and ostracize them from society, which shows the darker hidden side of the church. The final scene in the film, after the climax where Quasimodo rescues Esmerelda from execution despite his love being unrequited, shows him exiting the church shelter properly and coming into full sunlight, being accepted into society with the hug from a young girl. It's a beautiful moment enhanced by the great music, the other best thing about this movie.The music is amazing. The opening theme "Bells of Notre Dame" is one of the best openings in any movie ever, on par with the "Circle of Life", if not better (Dat Final Note). Every song (except one, which I'll get to later) is amazing. Esmerelda's solo song 'Children of God' is a fantastic song full of emotion, contrasting the difference of faith between upper class Christianity and lower class Christianity ("I ask for wealth" vs "God Help my People") The fact songs this good and this significant to Christianity, from Disney, a company that goes out of its way to avoid referencing religion in most other films (Hunchback and Mulan are the only Disney films I can think of that have religion-based characters in them)shows how much thought and effort, and how much risk, was placed on this film.Now, I have to talk about the bad, the only bad in this film...The Gargoyles.Victor, Hugo and Laverne are the worst comic relief characters ever, to the point that they almost ruin the message that the rest of the film is trying to achieve. It's like they were shoehorned in by different writers to the rest of the script to form a 'safety net' so that kids would have a bit of fun. I have a feeling that a lot of animation directors think that kids only respond to comedy and have no reaction to dramatic tension, which is complete and utter bullshit. Everyone loves the Lion King and the death of Mufasa. The people who have seen Iron Giant love that film, and there's hardly any comedy in that. Kids love Adventure Time and Avatar, and Batman, and although there is occasional comedy in those shows, all of them are primarily dramas. Disney needs to get their heads out of their asses and realize that not every movie needs comic relief, and the comic relief in Hunchback almost ruined the movie (it did ruin it for a lot of people). I sincerely believe that if the Gargoyles were either toned down or gotten rid of completely, the film will be much better and much more highly regarded (the only people who would dislike it in that case would be the novel purists, and fair enough I say)But despite the horribleness of the gargoyles, they can be overlooked due to the awesomeness that is the rest of the film. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see some great old animated drama, or some great music, and this film delivers and surpasses that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I actually really liked this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan of Disney. I'm just throwing that out there when I write this, I mean they have made some likable movies that are enjoyable for both kids and adults but then again I believe they think with their wallets more than anything else (Just look at the straight-to-DVD Sequels!). Then why did I watch this then, you may ask? because from every indication I could see, this is not typical Disney.The plot is that after a Judge named Frollo kills a gypsy family and nearly drowns their deformed baby (brought to you buy THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!) A priest is there to stop him and Frollo takes this baby to be raised in the Bell Towers of Notre Dame. 20 Years later this deformed baby named Quasimodo bows to every word Frollo says until one day he escapes to The Festival of Fools. Once there he at first is accepted until then he is mocked and hurt but a gypsy girl named Esmeralda saves him.As a Captain comes home to Paris to resume his duties he falls in love with Esmeralda and Frollo wants her captured, he also falls in love with her as does Quasimodo because she was the only one who is kind to him. So as this love... square is going on (does that term exist? Well no matter I'm using it) Frollo searches high and low for her to accuse her of witchcraft and burn her at the stake.I love the animation for this movie. At the time it might seem like standard animation but the atmosphere it gives off (especially if you look at the Hellfire sequence) is incredible. You feel the emotions that these characters go through even in the background of what's going on.Then there is the music. My favourite song was definitely Hellfire but all the others were good too, the only one I didn't like was the one sung by the Gargoyles (...ugh! I'll come back to THAT!). I would definitely say this movie is worth it for the soundtrack alone.Frollo, I think is the most interesting villain I have ever seen in a children's movie. The character of "does horrible things and yet tries to convince himself that he is a good and honest man"... That is really interesting. I mean I like all the characters (maybe Pheobus is bland but that's it) but Frollo really stands out as the villain in this one.Okay onto the complaints. The Gargoyles. This is something I'm sure most people will bring up as something they didn't like. For a movie that was considered to be pushing the boundaries this is very pandering to the kids. These characters are just annoying, I wouldn't have minded if they were just in Quasimodo's imagination but at the end of the movie they are revealed to be very much real.I would say out of all the Disney animated movies that I have seen and/or remember - this is my favourite. I love the animation, music and characters. This isn't typical Disney (I know that without seeing too much of their other stuff) but if your kids are about 10 or something then I'd suggest they check this out. I can see people not liking it because as I said this is pushing boundaries and that does put a lot of people off. Then again if you're okay with boundaries for family films being pushed then this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just short of greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not Hugo, but the Disney version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) is a wonderful film in its own right. Save for some awkward 1990s CG in the background every now and then, the animation is glorious and the colors are deep and rich like a medieval tapestry. The musical score and numbers are among Disney's most underrated. The characters are all memorable, from the soulful Quasimodo to the kind but tough Esmeralda to the evil Frollo, one of the greatest and most unsung of all Disney villains.Were it not for one factor, this film would be a masterpiece and that is the juvenile humor which creeps into this overall somber and dark movie. The gargoyles are the most obnoxious comic relief possible, and their anachronistic, cartoony nature does not gel with this story of oppression and sin. It's obvious the executives were frightened by the film's darkness, fearful that there wasn't enough kiddie appeal, so they forced this creative mistake upon the filmmakers.It's a shame, but overall, this is still a fine picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney took a risk by creating their darkest film ever at the time, but this is fantastic piece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is very well made featuring great songs, beautiful animation, strong emotion, a good message, one of Disney's best villains, great atmosphere, and great writing. It is way different than anything they have ever done. It is covered with a dark atmosphere that no other Disney film has. It makes the film so good, but that is the main thing people have to complain about it. Many people say that it is to adult for children. Yes this is the most adult Disney animated film ever, but that really is a good thing. Kids should enjoy this for its darkness. Kids always watch these happy film where everything is great. If you show them this film it will give them something they have never seen before, and evolve their taste in movies a bit. Songs in this are just great. Animation is some of Disney's finest. The two parts that best show this is when it starts raining, and the climax. The animation is wonderful. Judge Frollo is one of Disney's most interesting villains, and his song "Hellfire" is one of the best song sequences ever put to film. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is one of Disney's best films.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do read the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is inevitable, of course, that the Disney rendition of the Hunchback be a severely scaled down, dumbed down version of Hugo's dark, sad, and hauntingly beautiful story. I understand: Disney is just trying to make a cartoon for kids, for goodness' sake! But the fact remains that Hugo's novel about unrequited love becomes reduced to a farcical mixed salad of song and dance.What I regret most is the change and simplification of the characters. In the novel, Phoebus is a womanizer and a coward, a despicable fop who seduces Esmeralda, then leaves her to the gallows in order to protect his own advantageous marriage to a woman of nobility. Esmeralda herself is a shallow, foolish girl, utterly unable to comprehend the men around her and the motives behind their actions; it is no surprise that Phoebus finds it extremely easy to manipulate her, while Frollo and Quasimodo, men who genuinely love her, have their pleas fall on deaf ears. And Frollo -- my God, Frollo! Ever since I read the book at the age of 10 (on a dull rainy afternoon at my grandmother's house), I thought Esmeralda was really stupid to turn him down. Of the three men, he was the most deserving, with his profound passion for her, his powerful intellect, his deep and complex personality, his devotion, his readiness to sacrifice everything for the woman he loved. I admit that it is disturbing that in the end, Frollo would rather see Esmeralda dead than in the arms of another man, but Esmeralda herself seems to be more concerned about his bald spot than about the selfish and possessive nature of his love. Me, I would go for Frollo, with all his faults.So if you liked the cartoon, trust me -- you won't regret reading the book. It's a real feast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The message is there, the magic is not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is one of the most spread messages that parents and teachers send to kids: beauty is only skin deep... And so is ugliness.Disney already used this phrase only 5 years before making "The Hunchback of Notre Dame". It was in "Beauty and the Beast", which was an adaptation of an old French tale. Coincidentally, the directors (Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise) are the same for both movies.Here, Disney creators stay within the same culture, but they use a more mature and serious title instead: Victor Hugo's "Notre Dame de Paris". And that's where the danger was. How can you take a very serious, mature and dark story and make it suitable for young children? We can say, once we see the final product, that is a success, but it is far from being a masterpiece like "Beauty".Some very serious themes remain from the original story. The characters (at least those who are portrayed on screen) are the same and they're very well pictured. Quasimodo, who is one of the best animated interpretations of physical ugliness since a very long time, never sends a doubt that he is one of the most gentle men of Paris. Gypsy dancer Esmeralda reveals her hot beauty without sinking into the too-sexy or the scandalous. Courageous captain Phoebus is nice too, as he shows himself as somebody who do the right thing instead of instinctively obeying to the orders.Evidently, gypsy-hating judge Claude Frollo is here too, but as a much darker and creepier role than portrayed in the book. There isn't a single moment in the movie where Frollo isn't accompanied by darkness, rain, fire, or any other element which portrays evil. Sometimes, he is simply too much dark and terrifying to be cast in what is supposed to be a children's/family movie. In a sense, he recalls me Judge Doom in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit".Such a movie wouldn't have been released by Disney if there weren't any comic stuff inserted. This time, the mood enhancers are the three gargoyles who accompany Quasimodo in his bell-tower. They mostly succeed in their laugh delivering mission, but they often say ridiculous lines, such as "You're human, with the flesh, and the hair, and the navel lint." and act in ridiculous situations, such as a poker game which is an excuse for a freewheeling love song.Talking about the songs, they're not astonishing. They're often located in the wrong moments and the soundtrack won't get any Billboard hit. It's a serious downfall after the success of songs belonging to previous movies. In "Little Mermaid", there's "Under the Sea". In "Beauty and the Beast", there's "Be my Guest". In "Aladdin", there's "A Whole New World". In "The Lion King", there are "Circle of Life" and "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" (thanks Elton). In "Pocahontas", there's "Colours of the Winds". In "The Hunchback", there is... That's the point: there's nothing.Animation is good, but not everywhere. The city of Paris lacks of a magic touch, but Notre Dame is superb. The basilica is drawn on a monumental scale and becomes a divine entity, with the help of some quotes, particularly from Phoebus' part. The Gothic architecture and the windows are a feast for the eyes. Fire effects are also remarkable."The Hunchback of the Notre Dame" is not a disaster, but it's a sign that Disney has jumped the shark. That's what happens when you run out of fairy tales or children's books in order to get a storyline. But the message is here and children should have lessons to learn here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hunchback of Notre Dame is fun, incredibly dark, mature, well made, and featuring music that is almost too catchy and brilliant, this is the movie YOU SHOULD show you kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched The Hunchback of Notre Dame again for the first time since I was probably 7. I am very glad I did. I always thought Hunchback was equal to other Disney movies from the 90's (The Disney Renaissance) This is incorrect. It is perhaps the best.Fun and upbeat yet able to climb to levels of incredible darkness, Hunchback is not just a great kids movie but a great movie. The music is grandiose and epic and the lyrics are very well written.The animation is out of this world. Colorful and beautifully hand drawn with added in CGI makes it look even more stunning. The movie animates itself almost as if it is camera movie down the streets of Paris itself which draws in the viewer even more. There is also MUCH attention to detail for both comedic and artistic effectIf Disney has really sold out now, then there must have been a point before that because this movie is edgy. This is the movie you SHOULD show your kids. It addresses how your inner self is what really distinguishes a man from a monster, political corruption, lust, and death in a very literal way. Even some of the humor is fairly dark. I love this about it. It is very dark yet able to be very light and the darkness leads up to a really touching and well deserved happy ending that is not just a cheesy Disney ending. These are the kinds of movies that children SHOULD be seeing. Not dreck like The Nut Job. As pretentious as it may sound, I invite you to look back on what may be considered a childhood memory of a film for many yet this time through older eyes. I bet you will be surprised by what you see.The only flaw I think the movie has is having the gargoyle actually be alive in the end. It would have been much more clever if they were just Quasimodo's imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hunchback of Notre Dame is one of the best Disney animated movies ever. It's also one of the darkest. And that's why love it. Best parts: The animation is fantastic. Everything feels grand, huge, and epic. The characters are great, especially the villain, Frollo. He's very intimidating and very complex. The darkest parts, especially Hellfire, make this film unique and very special. I forgot to mention that the choir is AWESOME! It makes everything epic and dark like something from Lord of the Rings. Parts that don't work: The comedy in this movie is hit and miss, and the gargoyles are annoying as heck. If you're a fan of the original Victor Hugo novel, you're probably not going to like it. But I didn't really mind the changes they made, especially the ending where Quasimodo and Esmeralda lives. It's dark, epic, and very unique for a Disney film. I highly recommend Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty underrated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't say the animation is the best, but it certainly has the... bells to have one of the most gripping and messed up story lines in a Disney movie. And that's saying a lot. The bitter Judge Claude Frollo, voiced by the legendary Tony Jay, controls Paris with extreme prejudice. Now, he does have his superiors, but he has little regard for them. And as the movie progresses, it becomes more evident. After murdering a gypsy mother and almost murdering her son, Frollo is persuaded to spare and raise him, naming him Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) meaning "half man" or whatever. The music is very good, and usually fits the situation well, ranging from dark and intense to optimistic and heroic. Did I say I wasn't too big on the animation? Well, what would this movie be without it? I admit it's pretty comical at times. Especially with the gargoyles, Victor, Hugo and Laverne (Charles Kimbrough, Jason Alexander, and Mary Wickes, respectively). Aside from them, my favorite supporting character is jester Gypsy Clopin. (Paul Kandel) He's really the life of a party; everything about him is entertaining. The gargoyles act as mentors for Quasimodo, a shy hunchback shunned by society. Quasimodo fears, yet admires the world outside the sanctuary of Nortre Dame. Gypsy Esmerelda (Demi Moore) and Captain Phobeus (Kevin Kline) take sympathy on the unique creature, and help Quasi stand up to Frollo and become a hero accepted by those outside Nortre Dame. Frollo is one of the most sinister villains in animation. He claims to be virtuous, but he is ignorant and blind to the madness within! He wants nothing more than to kill all gypsies and would burn everything to do so. He gives us all sorts of insane animated scenes, ranging from burning an innocent family in a windmill, to trying to "smite the wicked and plunge them into the fiery pit!" Most ironically of all, he's a pervert. He tries to seduce Esmerelda, the one thing he hates more than anything. You really come to despise Frollo for his manipulative nature, but admire Tony Jay for his fantastic portrayal of him. I can say without fear, this movie is the most underrated masterpieces that Disney has produced, and in my opinion, the best story-driven Disney cartoon. I rate this a full ten stars, something I'll rarely do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Delightful Winner from the Disney Renaissance!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a 1996 animated film released by Walt Disney Pictures and was the 34th animated feature film in the Walt Disney Classics cannon. Set in 15th century Paris, this "Disney-fied" version of Victor Hugo's classic novel is the story of Quasimodo (voiced by Tom Hulce), the lonely bellringer and hunchback who lives in the bell tower of Notre Dame with his evil guardian Judge Claude Frollo (voiced by Tony Jay) who assumes the responsibility of the parental figure to atone for his sin after Frollo killed Quasimodo's mother and unsuccessfully attempted to drown him as a baby, seeing him as an "unholy demon." Twenty years later, Quasimodo, being isolated from the rest of the world, soon gets the desire to want to go to the Festival of Fools after being told that "life's not a spectator sport" by a trio of gargoyles named Victor (voiced by Charles Kimbrough), Hugo (voiced by Jason Alexander from "Seinfeld"), and Laverne (voiced by Mary Wickes), who are Quasimodo's only true friends. Once he gains the courage to go to the festival, he meets the gypsy Esmeralda (voiced by Demi Moore) and her pet goat Djali (voiced by Frank Welker), who helps Quasimodo from being further humiliated by the townspeople against Frollo's orders. After this, Frollo, having a seething hatred for gypsies, orders for the soldiers of Paris led by the noble Captain Phoebus (voiced by Kevin Kline) to make sure that she stays in the bell tower (serving as her prison) and that if she escapes, Frollo will have her killed. When this movie was released to theaters back in the summer of '96, it was promoted and advertised as another typical Disney movie aimed at kids. However, this film tackled a number of heavy religious topics and remains the only Disney film ever made to tackle the subject of religion. In fact, this movie nearly became the second Disney movie following "The Black Cauldron" to receive a PG rating from the MPAA because of the dark and grim themes of the film. Still, this movie holds up well and is definitely a Disney classic. While a lot of material was altered and left out of Hugo's novel, it still has a good story, good characters, and another great music score from 4-time Academy Award winning composer Alan Menken ("The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast," "Aladdin"), and lyricist Stephen Schwartz. The soundtrack to this film is a must have if you love Disney music or Orchestral music as this is by far one of the best Disney soundtracks of all time. Frollo's song "Hellfire" is right up there with Scar's "Be Prepared" and Ursula's "Poor Unfortunate Souls" as the best Disney villain songs of all-time. If you haven't seen this movie by any chance and you are looking for a good movie to watch with the entire family then I highly recommend this one! Great movie with an even greater message of looking inside a person's heart rather than judging the outward appearance. Rating: 10/10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disney Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hunchback of Notre Dame continues the Disney Renaissance of the 90's that began with the Little Mermaid. This Disney classic is richly animated, has some dark, but straight-forward themes, and tells a wonderful, classic story. My only qualm about this movie is those childish gargoyles. But I liked the characters especially this romance triangle between Quasimodo, the gypsy, and the rogue knight. I loved the music and songs by Alan Menken and they fit right in with the rest of the magical songs of Disney.Gary Trousdale's and Kirk Wise's film is an animated take on Victor Hugo's classic novel. This story is about a deformed hunchback named Quasimodo who at the urge of his loyal gargoyle companions, goes out to save Paris along with the beautiful gypsy Esmeralda and the rogue knight from the evil archbishop of Notre Dame.This film has an impressive voice cast. Led by the magnificent voices of Tom Hulce, Jason Alexander, Kevin Kline, and Demi Moore, the voice work is really good and they all do a wonderful job giving each character their own emotions.Overall, this is a wonderful Disney film even though it just stops short of making it to the top-tier of Disney Animation. Even though this film garnered a G-rating, this film may be a little scary and dark for younger children. This is a great children's film that the entire family would enjoy. The animation is crisp and the songs are mainly memorable. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Feelings About This Movie For Kids...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie came out, I eventually saw it with some of my friends, and though my mother watched it as well, she never added it to our Disney movie library. I always wondered why not, because I loved the music. Now that I am a parent myself and recently watched this again, I understand. There are several pros and cons to this movie, so I will try to outline what I think of it.Pros: Amazing animation and wonderful songs. Also, most of the voice casting is excellent (including the late Mary Wicks as one of the gargoyles). The songs are both memorable and well-written, and the animation is breathtaking! Cons: Now, for an adult, this film has nothing scandalous or inappropriate, however, for a child, I don't agree. The very sexual nature of Esmeralda, from her dancing to her being lusted after by the judge, is definitely not kid-friendly. I mean, why is there all of this sexual tension in a kids movie? Also, the movie is nearly nothing like the book (which is a classic!). However, the book is rather dark, so I can understand lightening it up for kids. But, overall, this movie is rather dark, scary, and a bit too sexual for my tastes (at least for younger children).Overall, this movie has many pros and several cons. My daughter is 4, so she doesn't notice the cons as much (though she definitely prefers the lighter Disney movies like Mary Poppins and Cinderella), but I don't think I am comfortable letting her watch this movie a whole lot. To me, it is not the kind of Disney movie that I am a big fan of, though there are parts about it that I love! All in all, it's up to each parent to decide about this movie, but I would advise to let your kids be a bit older before letting them watch this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Hunchback" ranks as one of Disney's most underrated animated films to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney has a history of producing some dark films. "The Black Cauldron" (1985) was the first Disney animated feature to be given a PG rating by the MPAA for a reason. Disney also has a history of showing young audiences some scary stuff in the past. Remember the evil queen's beggar disguise in "Snow White" or the "Night on Bald Mountain" sequence in "Fantasia"? Those scenes were memorably creepy. Disney has made some dark and more adult stuff before, but none more so than their 34th full- length animated feature, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (1996). Think of this movie as a darker and more complex version of "Cinderella" (1950). It tells the story of a deformed person named Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) who is forced to stay in the bell tower of Notre Dame by his evil guardian, Frollo (Tony Jay). His only friends are three gargoyles who come to life when no one else is around. One day, Quasimodo goes out of the bell tower to go to the Festival of Fools, a celebration of all kinds of misfits, against Frollo's wishes. When Frollo's guards publicly humiliate Quasimodo in the middle of the festival, a gypsy named Esmeralda (Demi Moore) comes to his defense just as Frollo orders for her to be arrested. But luckily, Esmeralda escapes using her magic tricks that are considered illegal. Now, Frollo is on the hunt for Esmeralda determined to "put her to justice" (though she really didn't do anything wrong). Little does Frollo know that Esmeralda has befriended Quasimodo and (as Frollo would put it) "cast him under a spell". She teaches Quasimodo that it's okay to be different and that gypsies aren't bad people like Frollo claims that they are. Frollo's Captain of the Guard, Phoebus also befriends these two secretly through other various circumstances since he does not approve of the actions committed by Frollo. Will these three be able to put an end to Frollo's madness? The most fascinating character in "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" has got to be the main antagonist, Frollo. Without question, I would easily consider Frollo one of the most complex, adult characters ever concocted by Disney. I find it brilliant that he always tries to justify any crimes he commits by claiming that it's all part of God's plan. I also find it clever that he thinks Esmeralda has put a spell on him since he has two intriguing and assuredly sinister plans lined up for when he captures her. He will either burn her at the stake so he can be "cured" of this spell he claims he's under or force her to become romantically involved with him to cure his underlying lust for her. You wouldn't think that this is a Disney flick I'm talking about just based on how I'm describing him, but to be honest, that's why I think he's such a special villain. The drawing and animation in "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is simply sensational. The environments that are brought to life in this film really feel epic because of the scope and detail of the animation. Much like "Beauty and the Beast" (1991), one needs to simply look at the film first hand in able to truly appreciate the skilled craft and expertise that was put into the film's animation. The music is also spectacular, praise in particular goes to the strong work of the choir for again making everything happening on screen feel so epic in scope. The best songs in this film have got to be "Hellfire" and "The Bells of Notre Dame" because they have that elegant and epic quality to them. In addition to that, these songs keep the story moving along as the best musical numbers should. My only personal criticism is that I would have liked to see this film go even darker. The reason for that is because the storytellers here did such a good job at taking a story with adult subject matter and churning it into something palatable for kids. They did so well in fact that I would have edited out the parts with the gargoyles and the slapstick moments since they're more dramatically distracting than helpful to the plot. I think had the gargoyles and slapstick stuff that was meant to appeal to the kids been taken out, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" would easily rank as one of the finest pictures ever put out by Disney. As it is though, the criticisms don't matter too much since I already think that this is Disney's most underrated animated feature since "Alice in Wonderland" (1951). In addition to being a visual marvel to feast my eyes on and a pleasure to listen to with such killer songs, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" does an exceptional job at teaching kids the importance of tolerating people of a different culture, religion, race, and visual appearance. This is a remarkable achievement, one of the studio's finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's darkest and most audacious masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)Disney, the studio that gave birth to animation, has given us such classic as Pinocchio, Fantasia and Beauty and the Beast; films of such joy and power, many containing stern moral messages for the young viewers (Pinocchio, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King)...However, never before or since has Disney so daringly steered from its safe boundaries, as with The Hunchback of Notre Dame, a film of such maturity, depth and darkness that you almost forget it was made by the same studio that brought us Aladdin four years earlier...Not even the Shakespearean tones of Disney's previous masterpiece, The Lion King, made way for the audacity of adapting Victor Hugo's 1831 dark and haunting novel...The story revolves around Quasimodo, a deformed bellringer at the Notre Dame Cathedral, his vicious guardian, Judge Claude Frollo, a bigot who has a burning desire to eradicate all gypsies from Paris...The other main character is Esmeralda, a beautiful, street-smart gypsy, who befriends Quasimodo.Frollo, is enchanted by Esmeralda, he experiences erotic desires towards her, but cannot understand why he is drawn towards someone so 'inferior'...The character of Frollo reminds me of the sadistic Nazi, Amon Goeth, in Schindler's List, who is attracted to his beautiful maid, but he still lashes out at her, because she is a Jew...Never has a mainstream animated film, tackled issues of racism, xenophobia and mob hysteria...Frollo's visions of demons and sexual longings towards Esmeralda during a breathtaking sequence in the film must be particularly startling for younger viewers...The film has its shares of humour, particularly from Quasimodo's friendly gargoyles, and a number of joyous songs...While not as dark as Hugo's depressing novel, this is a very intense film for younger viewers and credit to Disney for taking such a risk...An overlooked masterpiece.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney at its darkest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, the most underrated Disney film. The film has really good music,voice acting, and great animation. The film is obviously based on the Victor Hugo novel of the same name. Tom Hulce's performance as the sympathetic Quasimodo is great, Esmerelda is the sexiest Disney character to date, and Frollo. What can I truly say for Frollo, played by Tony Jay. He is a great voice actor and this is his best performance. In the original novel, Frollo was a priest, not a judge. However, if he was a priest, the movie would be BANNED(as a kid's movie). I love it when he sings "Hellfire", one of the best Disney songs in my opinion. Frollo is a very evil Disney villain. Npot only is he a hypocrite, he is also a very lustful man. The film explores lust, religion and deformity just to name a few. The movie is also pretty funny. This film is an Disney Renaissance Classic. Besides, how many Disney films can you name that mention eternal damnation as one of the main subject matters? All in all, great film. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more I think about this version and the more often I see it, the better it gets.Allan Menken wrote some of his most mature music. Wonderful choral passages in keeping with the Gothic and religious settings.Quasimodo's friends (the gargoyle's) represent a more serious undercurrent of madness. In the novel the poor hunchback is completely crazy. His only friends are the religious reliquaries in the cathedral.Major changes made from the novel. Clopin was originally a character named Gringoire, a failed poet who is picked up by the criminal element of the city and condemned to death. He is saved by Esmeralda.Phaebus was a horrid self-centered cad in the book. He just wants to get into Esmeralda's skirts.Frolo is a priest in the novel. An otherwise good man driven to sin by his lust for Esmeralda. Here his tragic downfall is made less by de-frocking him and making him some kind of politico.The novel ends with Esmeralda tortured and hung as a Witch. Quasimodo steals her corpse and brings it into a crypt in the graveyard, and seals himself up in the crypt to die with her. Hugo tells us their skeletons are found centuries later with his curled up at her feet like a dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and Dark: Disney at its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, this is a magnificent movie, and with the exception of Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, the best movie Disney ever made. The animated rendition of Hunchback of Notre Dame, although marketed as a family film, is a cover for vastly more adult themes rarely touched upon in the likes of Disney movies. The combination of the wonderful, colorful animation and the dark subtlety of more sophisticated adult themes is absolutely brilliant, a combination that Disney needs to return to. Its recent movies lack this children-adult crossover that made Hunchback of Notre Dame a masterpiece. The music is most definitely the best aspect of the movie. The score is beautiful--Alan Menken is a genius--and gave the movie an air of power lacking in most other films. As for songs, it has some of the best and worst. The worst are just garishly tacky kid songs inserted in overcompensation for the overbearing darkness. Fast forward these. Yet the best songs in the movie are some of the best in the genre of Disney movies. Bells of Notre Dame, the song that covers the opening sequence, God Help the Outcasts, and Hellfire, are stunning. Hellfire is my favorite Disney song of all time. Dedicating an entire song to Claude Frolo's repressed sexual desire surpasses brilliance. Besides, the melodic quality is dark and gorgeous. Classic. Absolutely classic. I admit that when I first saw this movie in theaters at age nine, I was not particularly fond of it. Then I saw it years later as a teenager and loved it. It is truly a movie for a mature audience, which I feel makes it one of the best. Disney really needs to make more movies of this calibur that are able to transcend the mold of a kid movie and become something greater for all ages. Hunchback of Notre Dame is the underrated hidden masterpiece of Disney and never achieved the recognition it truly deserves. Buy it, own it, and cherish it. It will be the jewel of your Disney collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly, one of the best Disney films out here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are just no words capable of expressing how about feel about this great film. This is one of the best Disney films of the 90s, one of the best films in Disney's 70+ years of film-making, and possibly one of the best films ever.It was bizarre move when Disney choose Victor Hugo's "Notre Dame de Paris" (Notre Dame of Paris), otherwise known internationally as "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," as the basis for their 34th full-length animated feature. The original novel isn't something that is normally thought of as being something for children: such a dark and depressing tale. But in the 90s, Disney were pioneers and innovators, and it was a bold move when they decided to make this film.And it all worked. Here is perhaps one of the beautiful animations Disney has produced (heck, this is from the same guys who brought us "Beauty and the Beast"), featuring excellent artwork and stunning scenes. The animators actually went to Paris and made sketches of the actual Notre Dame cathedral to ensure accuracy. And what efforts! Fifteenth Century Paris is brought to life -- full of laughter and festivity...poverty and injustice. You will marvel at the Gothic splendor of Notre Dame cathedral, which is very detailed.But at the heart of all this is good story. Here is one of the most tender tales out there. Hugo enthusiasts have cringed at the changes Disney has made from the original novel. But this movie has the spirit of Hugo. The original novel was about social issues, about injustice and religion. And Disney does a great job of addressing these themes, yet making this movie tolerable for family viewing. Added to the movie are the themes of about looking part appearances in favor of what lies inside. This "Man vs. Monster" theme is embodied in the hideous but kind-hearted and courageous Quasimodo.Quasimodo is a not so typical hero, and he and a cast of memorable characters are the players in this powerful, moving tale. You will be shocked by the crowd's treatment of Quasimodo during the Feast of Fools scene. Entertained by the brave antics of Phoebus, captain of the guards. Amazed by the courage of the beautiful Gypsy Esmarelda to help him. You will also be repulsed by the villainous Claude Frollo -- perhaps the most frightening, and more complex, foe in any Disney movie. There has never been a foe like him before -- so cruel, so pitiless, so obsessively lustful to the point of wanting to destroy someone -- and yet so devout and religious. You will be overwhelmed at the final fight scene near the end. And you will be touched by the ending, in which a young girl approaches the monstrous-looking hunchback and gives him her hand, and inspired and uplifted when he is carried away by a joyous, cheering crowd -- the crowd that once rejected him.The music plays a vital role in telling the story. Before he gave us "Wicked," Stephen Swartz lovingly composed these amazing songs. "The Bells of Notre Dame" is subtle and haunting, "Topsy Turvy" is upbeat, and "Heaven's Light" and "Children of God" are tender and touching. In this film is also "Hellfire" -- so intense, so heart-pounding, dark, mature, and yet so powerful, the best Disney villain song ever. Adding to the songs is Alan Menken's beautiful score, which makes good use of classic choirs; from the haunting, mysterious Gregorian chants in the beginning, to the glorious chorus in the end.This movie is dark, it's mature. It's inspiring and it's powerful. It is simply a beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hunchback of Notre Dame is the best movie EVER!!!(Disney Or Not)I Luv how its not your average plot line.There are lots of suspense,twists and turns.It definitely one of the more exciting Disney movies!The music is one of the best parts of the whole movie!Its so beautiful!The characters that Victor Hugo created are simply amazing!They are so unique and out of the ordinary.Each one has such a complex personality!Quasimodo is the most kind-hearted and beautiful person you could ever meet.If Victor Hugo didn't wrote his wonderful novel Notre Dame De Paris,Notre Dame probably would been the same today if he didn't.I especially love how he wrote the book to preserve the memories of Notre Dame.He is "The Man Who Saved Notre Dame".A true genius! I had to read the original novel in french in Grage 7.(French Immersion) My first thoughts were,Oh jeez...This is so stupid!Why do we have to read this novel in french?!?It's going to be SOO boring...But as a began to actually read the novel,I fell in love with the complex characters and unusual plot line.At the time,I had no idea it was a movie until my teacher made us watch the musical "Notre Dame De Paris".I was completely immersed.The music was stunning!I immediately started searching for the songs on YoutTube and thats when I came a across the Disney version.I ordered it from the library and watched it continuously.It was definitely one of the Disney movies ever.My fav part would have to be when Quasimodo holds Esmeralda above his head and claims her sanctuary.I always find when they torture Quasimodo very sad and emotional.I feel SOO sorry for him!(Who Wouldn't???)Its been a while since Grade 7 but its still my fav movie.I've kinda evolved in to a "Hunchback-A-Holic"...Hehe...I collect anything to do with the story.Unfortuatly,I was 2 when the movie released so now is very hard to find merchandise for the movie...ARG!I've read the original novel "Notre Dame De Paris" countless times since then and I know Disney changed several things for the novel but we should appreciate how much effort and work that went into this movie.Disney didn't work on this film for 1.2 million hours just for it to get bad reviews.Sure,they left out a bunch of key characters and Frollo looks 40 years older than he's supposed to but I think its still a cute story with a touching message.I'm not saying I'm happy with the changes they but I have seen WAY worse.(2002,It's not even in the right time,Its set in 1771.Its really screwed)I personally love the tragic ending.It makes the story unique and "one in a million" but its Dsiney and all Disney movies have a "happily ever after".If you want a version that is close to the real story,I suggest "Notre Dame De Paris"(1998)It's a famous french rock opera.Its pretty close.There's an animated version by "Jetlags Productions"(1996).Its pretty good too.It includes Gringoire and Fleur De Lys along with the rest of the main characters.There's also another animated version thats semi-close(2005).It includes the basic original story.I know Disney's not even close to the real story but I Luv it for what it is.Disney worked really hard on this Masterpiece and I think they definitely deserve more credit then for their work.I Luv The Hunchback Of Notre Dame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Animated American Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's "The hunchback of Notre Dame" is truly a Disney Masterpiece that I believe will still be seen as such a hundred years from now.The animation, character design, backdrops, script and storyline are enough to shock any critic into loving this movie, but what really makes this film is it's unusual dark-themes, the voice talents of some of the greatest modern legends to date, and, especially, the music.Each magnificent song is masterfully written to flow in with the script to create a non-stop musical exhilaration from start (with the song "The Bells of Notre Dame") to finish that even a left-brained person will feel themselves soar along with the story. In my opinion, the best songs are those with the operatic church-lithurgy choir mixed in with the whole, such as "Hellfire," "The Bells of Notre Dame," and the music accompanying the story throughout the whole film, such as in the scene where Quasimodo rescues Esmerelda from a fiery death near the end.The Broadway-worthy singing voices of Tom Hulce, Jay Alexander, and all the other characters are a refreshing breath of air as well as a surprise for the close celebrity-talent watching critic like me. I am still stunned that most of the singing voices are the actual actors themselves singing, and not a voice-over.What a beautiful celebration of Victor-Hugo's centuries-old masterpiece! I am very glad it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Musical Score, but I don't know for the life of me why it didn't win it, or why it wasn't nominated for "Best Picture." In my book, it deserves every Oscar available. It remains, and will remain, my all-time favorite movie up to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only saw the film once as a young girl, and found it confusing and sad. I couldn't really follow the plot, and found the film very sad and scary at times.But upon finally re-watching it, I have seen this film in a whole new light. It is beautiful... and dark, and truly captures the spirit (though it differs greatly from it) of Victor Hugo's novel.The greatest characters in the film are Quasimodo and Frollo... Quasimodo, because he symbolizes an innocent, beautiful soul, trapped within a deformed, misshapen body; and Frollo, because he is so evil and cruel, you hate him from the very moment you see him. (And I like it when villains are detestable and not likable.) One can just hate Frollo for everything he does.... From assaulting and accidentally killing Quasimodo's mother... for plotting to kill Quasimodo... for lusting after Esmeralda... for everything Frollo does, makes him as demonic and frightening as Chernabog from "Fantasia", and the Horned King from "The Black Cauldron." Villains like this are what make people want to see the heroes come out on top. (In Chernabog's case, the church bells are what defeats him... because Christianity is the devil's weakness.) The plot and animation in "Hunchback of Notre Dame" rival every other Disney film that came out after it. It's so dark, and so beautifully drawn, it makes one miss the days of Disney animation.I guarantee viewers of "Hunchback of Notre Dame" will get goosebumps while watching this.... Especially during the songs; "The Bells of Notre Dame" and "God Help the Outcasts." Tears are most likely guaranteed as well, especially when Quasimodo holds Esmeralda on the church tower and screams, "Sanctuary!" One of the finest musicals with Catholic themes... I say it would only rival with "Sound of Music" as the best Catholic musical.Very dark and might be scary for little ones, but worth a watch. Of anything, you will love the song "Topsy Turvy." 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the book by Victor Hugo, but I do understand that, as the other adaptations of theirs, this has been "Disney-fied", gotten something of a heavy dose of sugar injected, to direct its aim toward children. In spite of this, it's actually quite watchable for those of us who aren't, anymore. The tone has a lot of maturity, and the themes are universal. The plot is very good, well-written and it develops nicely throughout the entire feature. Colors are used effectively. At the same time, the visuals are rather naturalistic and realistic, all the way. The dialog is well-done. The comedy works, and a lot of it is enjoyable to the older audiences, as well. The DVD holds a cute special feature or two, and none of them are bad. The game isn't the best of these Disney DVD games. Casting surprised me, Kline and Moore both suit their parts and as with Gibson in Pocahontas, and much more so, Williams in Aladdin, first-mentioned actor gets some of his recognizable traits transferred to his animated alter ego. Alexander is a lot more tolerable than he was in The Return of Jafar, in fact, he's downright funny, herein. The music isn't bad at all. This has moments of creativity and energy like that of Aladdin, which is still my favorite Disney animated musical. The dramatic portions are effective, and the 3D elements are masterfully done. I recommend this to any fan of Disney's feature-length musical cartoons, young and old alike. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney takes us to Notre Dame and its gorgeous cathedral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 34th animated Disney "classic" is a little better that the earlier "Pocahontas", but still far from being one of the great Disney classics.Although this movie has some great designs and sceneries, in many ways most of the designs haven't got the same creativity or brilliance from the older classics. However, the era when Disney started to go downhill was just beginning, because this was followed by much worst Disney movies. But that's another story...The gargoyles are exaggerated characters. The idea of talking gargoyles is a little too much for me, just like Grandmother Willow (the talking tree from "Pocahontas"). But this isn't the only negative thing about this movie. I dislike some of the humor used on it. Not that there's something wrong with its humor, it's just not very convincing, that's all.I also think that this movie is too dark. This isn't the darkest Disney movie ever, but it is very close to that. Nevertheless, this movie is quite creepy in some parts.The good side of this movie is, for example, the majestic Cathedral of Notre Dame, which is extremely well drawn, causing the same impact as seeing it in reality. The sound of the bells singing is formidable. Some of the songs from this movie are catchy (others not so). Some characters are great, such as Clopin (the puppeteer), Quasimodo, Phoebus (a funny and brave character) and the beautiful gypsy Esmeralda.Also, the moments with Quasimodo and Esmeralda are usually good. The various sceneries and angles of view of both Paris and the Cathedral of Notre Dame are amazing and stunning (including some views of the cathedral from the clouds), which makes them one of the best things about this movie.The evil Minister Claude Frollo is, of course, cruel and hateable, very hateable in fact, but a good villain. Tony Jay makes an even better voice job with Frollo than with Monsieur D'Arque.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen so much pathos in a Disney movie in my life. When it first came out in 1996, I was only in the second grade, but I acutely understood Quasi's pain from his social isolation. I had undiagnosed Asperger syndrome, and although I didn't understand why at the time, on an emotional level I felt just like him - acutely lonely, self-loathing and like I couldn't do anything right. There were days when I would shut myself up in my room and watch the movie two or three times in a row, and my family members scolded or made fun of me for it. I didn't want to tell them why I was so obsessed with this movie, and as I moved along in school, I became ashamed of it and didn't watch it again for ten years, not once, and avoided any thought of it. But when a girl in my class brought it into the senior lounge for everyone to watch, I saw it as I had never seen it before. Everything came flooding back, but I now understood why I had felt that way. I also rediscovered the amazing music in this movie - an emotional roller-coaster of a score that is frightening, beautiful, shatteringly, heartrendingly sad, and so uplifting you feel your heart is going to burst. Quasimodo is one of the most magnificent Disney characters ever put on film. He is grotesque, but he has an asymmetrical grace and tenderness of movement that makes him distressingly human and sympathetic, made even more so by the astonishing voice performance of Tom Hulce, who is the very voice and soul of Quasimodo. This movie also has, in my opinion, the greatest Disney villain ever, Claude Frollo, voiced by the equally magnificent late actor Tony Jay. Never mind that Disney made him a judge and not a priest like in the Victor Hugo novel; his insane lust for Esmeralda and his pious but utterly selfish sense of morality are retained and dealt with so that most children will not even pick up on the lust factor, obvious as it is to most adults. In the Victor Hugo novel, pretty much every main character dies at the end, but in this movie, Quasimodo get so utterly screwed over by life, the people in it, and the unrealization of his potential as a human being, that it would be a crime not to give him a happy ending where he is accepted and loved by others, trite and clichd as some cynics may think that is. See this movie at all costs. You may be disturbed by how much it moves you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Enchanting--But The Content....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Hunchback of Notre Dame," I feel, is a fantastic movie for the older Disney audience. It's a step away from the typical Disney princess movies and deals with content that is not often discussed in movies (i.e.: religion, deformity, and major violence). It's not a bubbly movie about talking animals, pretty birds, and fluffy things that Disney movies are mostly associated with (which is not necessarily a bad thing!) and teaches a powerful lesson in radical ways. I enjoyed this different step forward, however, I think that the "G" rating is very misleading because the movie definitely contains content that is not suited for younger audiences; it should be "PG". I first saw this movie when I was seven years-old and there was content that I couldn't understand and that my father did not want to discuss with me (such a Frollo's lust for Esmeralda, which is clearly an adult topic). The associations with religion, the devil, sin, and other heavy religious/Catholic matter is not always meant for younger audiences and should be left for mature audiences that understand the situation, but I understand Disney's way of lightening up the content with comedic characters and situations (but that does not take away from the original plot). Overall, this movie is fantastic (great animation, story, and memorable characters). But people, especially parents, should be warned that there is content that is not suited for younger children, so they should wait until they are a bit older or be beside them to explain the movie so they understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent story masterfully told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first of all I must comment the (Tom Hulce) voice-actor of Quasimodo his singing-voice is just awful and makes a well written and composed song pretty... how can I say this... bad! except from Hulces singing-voice he voices Quasimodo very well. the other voice actors also do a great job of bringing life to the characters.but except for that one song the music is excellent and makes the movie very dramatic and sometimes silly dramatic but thats just sometimes.The animation is also great even though 1 or 2 sequences fells a bit twitchy and stuff like that.Now comes my BIG complain! I mentioned early that sometimes the music gets silly dramatic and thats because of the story and screenplay of the film it just doesn't live up to the films cinematography and audio. Its not a bad story its just not a good story even though it uses very strong themes such as being an outsider and behind an ugly outside there is a beautiful inside.Despite the many flaws this film still feels epic, warm and last but not the least very well made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's last great animated feature to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although none have truly embraced the full scope of Victor Hugo's sweeping novel (although the 1956 version comes close), there's never been a bad version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Disney's 1996 version is one of the very best. It has its flaws, but it's still the studio's last great animated feature, with a visual audacity and a surprising darkness that's often breathtaking. It may opt for an even happier ending than usual, but there's plenty of real dramatic power here. Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz's mostly excellent score may have the odd crowd-pleaser that lowers the tone a tad, but there's a striking and powerful grandeur of ambition to many of them ? after all, who'd have expected a Disney villain to sing of his tortured sexual desire (Heaven's Light/Hellfire) and of his burning need to either screw the heroine or kill her? The computer enhanced crowd scenes and the sweeping three-dimensional camera-work are amazing to see, the design is superb and there's an intelligent use of colour and weather that the studio's subsequent efforts seemed to lose. Only the wiseacre gargoyle sidekicks feel out of place, although the film at least discreetly suggests that they are mere figments of Quasimodo's imagination. One of the most impressive of Disney's animated features, and certainly the most undervalued.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor rebuttal, and one more spoiler.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as comic actors like Robin Williams and Billy Crystal like to do serious high-brow stuff for their own personal sense of variety, so, too, did Disney Studios with this animated masterpiece. Yes; the resurgence they began with "Little Mermaid" peaked here. BUT, THAT DOESN'T MEAN DISNEY WILL BE STUCK IN THE NEXT VALLEY, FOREVER! As for the trio of smart-aleck gargoyles? I think the comic relief they provided was vitally important to keeping the film from getting _too_ morbid! What's more, I _prefer_ the happy ending of this film to the dismal one in any other adaptation of HOND. If I want to wallow in tragedy, all I have to do is read the front page of any newspaper!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hellfire, dark fire...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no way this movie should be taken lightly. Watching it recently with a friend opened my eyes to the blatant sexual, fundamental religious and racial themes of the movie which, to be perfectly honest, are too much for children below 11 to possibly grasp. The songs are far more telling than the action, as the lyrics give rise to the sexual conflicts within certain characters. The scene in which Frolo is singing at the fire place and an image of Ezmerleda is dancing in the fire has obviously sexual connotations and he's even singing about "this burning desire"! The fact that the movie does not end with the traditional 'the guy gets the girl' is another indicator at the level of maturity needed to watch it. True, no one 'good' dies, but Quasimodo does not end up with Ezmerelda, as one would expect (the song 'A Guy Like You', for example). There's my two pence. I simply think it deserves more credit than it's given, as a serious piece of animation. Truly above Watership Down!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much-touted animation is NOT stunning but it is decent, and Hellfire is great song which beautifully captures Frollo's tortured passion. Of course modern Disney films must have forced nod to feminism - in Mulan feminine woman is laughable clown, but tomboy saves the day, making "women's" work is slavery, being a soldier is fine - and thus Esmeralda fights better than trained soldier Phoebus, but she is also pretty and pure-hearted - unlike many others, I see no facial similarities between her and her voice actress, Demi Moore. However, characters of Frollo and Phoebus are wildly twisted and destroyed from their original forms. In Victor Hugo's book, Frollo does not persecute gypsies or try to kill or abuse Quasimodo. Actually, he is not sadist at all - when Esmeralda is tortured, madly obsessed Frollo tortures himself and tries later drag Esmeralda out of the death-chamber. Disney's Frollo is evil through and through, without any interesting shades. Hugo's handsome young Phoebus is a bully - he just tries to get in Esmeralda's skirts, insults deformed Quasimodo, knows that "witch" Esmeralda is innocent (long story) and instead of telling the truth, he lets to kill the girl in the end. Disney's de-sleazed Phoebus is genuinely sympathetic and heroic character, but why on Earth call him Phoebus?! Adding the fat jokes to pollute the story about "inner beauty" does not help, either..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-rounded family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When he kills a gypsy woman, evil judge Claude Frollo spares the life of the child by allowing the local priest to take him in to the Notre Dame cathedral to hide his ugly, deformed figure from the world. As a teenager, young Quasimodo longs to be out of his bell tower and down with the normal people ? his statue friends just aren't cutting it anymore. Joining a carnival in disguise, Quasimodo is exposed and held up for ridicule by all in attendance and it is only the kindness of gypsy girl Esmeralda that spares him. This act of defiance against the mob sees Esmeralda targeted by Frollo, who already has made it his aim to take care of the gypsy "problem", and sees her relying on Quasimodo to return her kindness.Although I'm not a massive fan of the all-singing, all-wholesome Disney cartoons I must confess that when I'm in the mood they can be good fun and quite engaging. And so it was with this film even if it wasn't that impressive. The basic story is one of the ugly outcast, tolerance and not judging books by covers ? all Disney staples in regards themes. It is engaging enough stuff and although it doesn't have a real depth to it, it does have a surprising amount of darker material and ideas within it. The characters are mostly well drawn and the film allows the comic sidekicks to be sidekicks and doesn't allow easy jokes to dominate the story (although they provide amusement when given the chance). The songs are quite grand and engaging (with the exception of the horrid syrup that plays over the final credits) and although none of them stuck in my mind they did the job.The animation is solid although it is hard for me to view fairly because I am watching it from ten years in the future after big leaps have been made. That said it all looks good and the attention to detail is impressive. The cast are mostly good. Personally I didn't like Hulce that much. I accept that he had to be a teenage boy but his voice is too soft and I didn't really buy the pain that was supposed to be in his character. Moore is a bit better mainly because her voice has more character. Jay is menacing and effective while Kline is pretty good in the hero role. Support from Alexander, Kimbrough, Clopin and others is mostly very good.Overall this is a fun family film that isn't as sharp or as deep as it could have been but pretty much does everything well. The story is good and engaging, the cast are mostly good, the songs are fitting and the animation is colourful and fun. Well worth seeing for Disney fans and a good film to watch with a young family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that made me officially secular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not for some attempts typical of Disney at that time to make it more friendly for children, this could have been one of their best films; a dark drama documenting corruption within the Roman Catholic church in 1502 France. While it does execute that very well with Frollo, and does feature some of the darkest moments in Disney films (Hellfire is my favorite Disney villain song), I did take off points for the gargoyles, which failed pretty hard as comic reliefs (even more than Dinky and Boomer from The Fox and The Hound), and I was disappointed at how they made Frollo seem not highly devout (which you'd think they'd do for a religious judge), but the latter was less impacting of my score than the former. Of course they made some bad decisions, but it was FAR from deserving a Razzie nomination for Worst Written Film Grossing over $100 Million. Was 1996 a year for absolutely awesome movies that all happened to have formidably stellar writing, or were the people at the Razzies more ticked off about the comic reliefs than I was? Regardless, you might not enjoy the gargoyles, but you will appreciate the messages and themes it has. As I said in the title, I knew that I was going to be secular for the rest of my life, so that I could pass myself off as religiously tolerant, and so I wouldn't be the gypsy or gypsy hunter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quasimodo, a deformed boy lives at the top of the belltower and is kept in isolation as society would not welcome him. His dream is to live like an ordinary person, but Lord Frollo (the villain) won't allow it. He was a dictator much like Hitler and easily the most evil of the 90's Disney villains. Esmerelda, a beautiful but assailed second class citizen partners with Quasimodo - seeing beyond just his appearance - in stopping Frollo.A very progressive film on the part of Disney. Of all their animated films, this is one of the darkest ones with genuine characters and real- life human emotions. A lot of us kids growing up were too young to see the messages of this film, but later came to realize that The Hunchback of Notre Dame had more depth than given credit for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Hunchback' is charming, yet tonally uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1990s, Disney was putting out a lot of animated productions. Films like Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King. However, they released another film, that I don't think gets enough attention. I only watched the film because I had heard the villain's song, and fell in love with it. Here it is, the film I think more people need to see. Let us meet......The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The Hunchback of Notre Dame follows a deformed bell-ringer named Quasimodo, who ventures out of his bell tower home, against the advice of his 'master,' Judge Frollo, and meets a girl named Esmeralda, whom he falls in love with and tries to protect as Frollo confronts his desires for her, and tries to kill her.Going into this film, I knew it was not going to be the typical 'all is happy' Disney film. I knew it was much darker than any other Disney film I had seen. Hell, I knew that because of the song Frollo sings, Hellfire. And I'm happy to say that this film is definitely a good one, especially considering the fact that it's a Disney film.The music is probably the best thing about the film. I've mentioned it so many times, I may as well say it, Hellfire is my favorite song, and may be my favorite villain song ever. I love how it plays off of the song that is sung just before by Quasimodo ("Heaven's Light"), and the two songs show different perspectives of two men's love for a gypsy girl. Other songs like The Bells of Notre Dame, Out There, and God Help the Outcasts are all great too.The characters are all written very well, and are all rather entertaining. Tom Hulce does a great job singing and voice acting for Quasimodo, bringing a voice you wouldn't expect to a character as deformed as Quasi is. Demi Moore does great as Esmeralda (and her singing voice, done by Heidi Mollenhauer, is great too). Tony Jay gets special praise for his performance as Frollo. If he had been played by anybody else, I don't know if the film really would have worked as well as it did.The animation is beautiful as well. There are a lot of sweeping landscape shots of Paris and they all look wonderful. The inside of the Church is beautiful as well, there being several murals and stained glass windows shown, all of them looking about as good as one could expect. You can tell that the film was done lovingly, and shot as well as they could have with the budget they had.I have only two problems with the film, overall: 1. The comic relief characters of the Gargoyles. They were funny in some places, but in other places (particularly the ending), it doesn't really feel right. 2. The last five minutes or so of the film. The fact that the film ends so cleanly isn't really a great thing for me. I wanted something bad to happen. The film had gotten so dark by then, that I was expecting someone other than the obvious to die, it's a shame that they didn't.Overall, however, The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a great Disney film, and one that should be looked upon as a classic. It has great music, great characters, great animation, and great acting. Although the ending and the Gargoyles annoy me slightly, there is no denying that Hunchback should be counted among the greats like Aladdin and The Lion King.9/10. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's Best, But Not In Line of TLK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie back when I was a five year old in 1996 and I was never much of a big fan of it as a kid and looking back at the movie that I have on DVD, I find it good but not in line with films like the first four Disney Renaissance films. The story is dark and talks about the corruption of church and power and the characters are good and the realistic style of animation was fantastic. But it really didn't hit me as a memorable classic, even as an a adult I can't think of the words to the songs that were shown nor finding the characters to be that memorable, although they're not bad. Frollo is definitely a complex villain, he kills people without a care but he thinks he's a solider of god, although a priest in the book, he's also a judge and the late Tony Jay had done a fantastic job on the voice and singing, he should've deserved at Annie award. Quasimodo is a good Disney protagonist and was definitely in character like in the Victor Hugo novel. The relationship between Phoebus and Esmeralda wasn't interesting and memorable in my opinion with its one liners and the development of their relationship wasn't strong. Hunchback in my opinion not in the line of films like TLK, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, but definitely part of Disney's best. I don't have any plans on seeing this movie's 'sequel'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most enduring complaint about Hunchback is they Disenyfied a story too dark for children. While many stories by Disney are know to be inappropriate in their original form, Hunchback is the one film that's still too mature after adaptation. This isn't really a kid's film. There's not enough action, not enough comedy, not enough fun. The themes the movie presents will just fly over their heads. Hunchback hurts itself by including comedic relief characters, especially the gargoyles.However, I think that Hunchback can get away with that because it's the greatest movie ever made.I love this movie. Its perfect in so many ways, I can tolerate the occasional sight gag or odd music number. Its beautiful, its emotional, it transcends what you'd expect from a Disney film. It explores the themes of religion, discrimination, and love without resorting to the tropes found in other movies, both cartoon and "adult".The main cast has great characters, who show off the full range of emotions. The villain is especially good - Frollo is despicable...but self-righteous and conflicted. He rings much truer to real life than any other Disney villain. And it makes him so much more compelling...and frightening. But let's not forget about the shy, kind Quasimodo, the heroic Phoebus, and the feisty Esmeralda. They're all good, with perfect voice acting. And we see them in both calm and dramatic moments.And the music! God, how isn't this recognized as the best soundtrack of all time!? The songs range from whimsical, somber, uplifting, even epic. The chorus dominate the mood, and make Hunchback feel gigantic. The music isn't just their to sing-along with your kids. It helps tell the story, and delves into the bottom of the character's hearts. Its the exact stuff to add goosebumps to my skin. The animation is top quality, especially on the cathedral.I could write an in-depth analysis on Hunchback. And I hate such film school seriousness! Its the best movie I've seen, and will be almost impossible to top. I know comedic relief can be distracting, but its less than 10 minutes of mild slapstick vs 80 minutes of masterpiece. I recommend this highly to everyone that asks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When asked to name a Disney movie, most people answer with the same old films. Beauty and the beast or little mermaid etc. I can say honestly without fear of contradiction this film is as good as any of the so called "big guns". the animation is sublime. The characters are well developed and strong. The music is breathtaking, probably the strongest across the board Disney has ever produced. The comedy is a sublime cross between silly slapstick and witty word play, both styles are done to perfection. And what a villain !!!!!! Tony jay (of whom I am a massive fan) brings to life possibly the cruelest, coldest and most sinister characters Disney has ever created. And what a voice! For speaking or singing tony jay has no equal. I realise that this film has been attacked due to its darker themes and sub text. And although I wouldn't recommend this film to very young or very sensitive for these reasons I do ask, does it really matter? This film Carry's Disney's darker side with dignity, majesty and above all courage. The bravery that Disney show as they tackle so called taboo subjects cannot be understated. Brave... Dark... Brilliant. The forgotten Disney masterpiece that no true Disney fan can miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent! I first watched it when I was about 10 years old and didn't really understand the story. I only saw the dancing and music and typical Disney scenes! I am now 17 and recently discovered the DVD and watched it again! I was blown away! The storyline is so deep and touched issues that society usually ignores. From the starting music I got chills until the very end! I thought Claude Frollo was an excellent villain, because he isn't your normal 'Take over the world' villain. He struggles with issues such as lust and the balance between right and wrong, which we can see in our everyday lives . The cheeky relationship between Phoebus and Esmerelda was brilliant and Quasimodo was one of the best heroes in Disney history.I loved how they began the movie with the riddle 'Who is the monster and who is the man' and then ended it with 'What makes a monster and what makes a man' It just captured the essences of this film perfectly! I can honestly say I am obsessed with this movie and it didn't get nearly enough attention from the public! This is a must-watch movie for every Disney fan! I think younger viewers won't really understand the deeper meaning of this film but they can enjoy the pure Disney parts of it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey kids! Do you want to see a perverted old man lusting after a woman more than half his age, burn people in their homes, and enslave a deformed man? You do! Then, boy, does Disney have a film for you! To be serious, I saw this movie for the first time last year (like "The Little Mermaid"), and I was blown away by it! There are problems I have with it, yes, but in all, it's unbelievable!ANIMATION: The animation in this movie is really impressive! I don't think it's as grand as "The Lion King," but it comes pretty doggone close! While "Beauty and the Beast" looked like it could take place anywhere, this movie makes me feel like I'm in Paris! Not the romantic, fantasized Paris, but the real, regal, grand part of Paris! It's rich, it's historic, and it's awesome!SONGS/MUSIC: God bless you, Stephen Sondheim and Alan Menken! God bless you both! The music in this film will blow you away! I'll admit that while "A Guy Like You" is a cool song, it breaks the tone of the movie. It'd be better somewhere else. "Topsy Turvy" is good for the movie, though, in the spirit of the gypsies. "Out There" is nice, and I enjoy "God Help the Outcasts." But let's discuss the two greatest songs of the film: "Hellfire" is absolutely amazing! We've never had a song as intense, disturbing, or creepy as this song, and it's great for that! We also get visual representation of the struggle Frollo is experiencing, and it's incredible! But by far, my favorite song in this movie is "The Bells of Notre Dame!!!" Good grief, this is one of my favorite openings to a movie! The way they tell the story, the lyrics, the movie, the singer - PRAISE GOD, the singer! Did you hear that last note he hit??!! I didn't think he'd get all the way up there, but he did! I need to meet him and shake his hand!ROMANCE: There's not a lot I have to say about the romance in this film. It was nice that Quasimodo didn't get the main character, though. You'd expect that in a Disney movie, but the movie ends without him getting the woman...and he's OK with that. That's very rare, but nice. And I'm just going to pretend that crap-in-a-hat sequel didn't happen! "The bell's beautiful...on the inside." WHAT?!?CHARACTERS: Again, most of the characters are just OK; there's nothing too special about them. The gargoyles are annoying as crud, but they get one or two chuckles...if that. Frollo, though, is incredible! He's probably my favorite character in the film! What makes him stand out is that he's not so much evil as much as he is corrupt...Or maybe he's really evil too, but here's what I mean: Frollo commits all these horrible deeds because he thinks he should. He argues that it's what God wants him to do. He sees nothing but goodness in himself. It's actually quite tragic when you think about it, but that's what we love about him!STORY: I've never read the original Victor Hugo book, and I understand this story goes out of order, but it still follows the story closely, so I'm not upset by that. I think the way Disney tells this story is fine. It's really good, in fact. I also like that this story doesn't say Christians are all hypocrites. Any other movie would have done that; it would have been so easy to have done that because of Frollo's actions. But because of the Archdeacon (I should have mentioned him earlier, he's really cool!), we understand that Frollo is just a corrupted man and a hypocrite; not all Christians are like that. And with the "God Help the Outcasts" song, we see hopeless people seeking help from God, not letting Frollo's evilness blind them from seeing the light. I love that!CONCLUSION: I'd be lying if I said I think "Hunchback" is anything special, but it's good and enjoyable. I don't think children will be destroyed for life if they watch this, but parents should definitely watch it with them...as all Disney movies are intended. Give it a watch and see what you think. God bless you! BOOYIKA!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best and riskiest Disney films ever made. This would have to be one of my top 3 favorites for story and musical execution. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a dark film for children, of course growing up with this as a child I never truly understood it until I got older. The songs have so much meaning and a scary truth to them translating to actual human nature. Frollo is probably the darkest Disney villain and I am glad that the makers of this film took that extra risk to make him seem deeply evil and twisted. I wish they made more classic animated films today. Overall I would highly recommend this to anyone, it is wonderfully moving and a deep experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's mature pieces and still under-appreciated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the slight disappointment of Pocahontas, it was an incredibly brave move by Disney to make their next film an adaption of Victor Hugo's gloomy novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Of course they changed a lot of things, but it is fantastic just how seriously they take this story and how engaging it is as a result. The film again wasn't met with as much acclaim as the earlier 'Renaissance' films and that is hardly a shock given how edgy it is compared to many of those works. I can safely say that some of the best aspects in the film are easily amongst the finest things that Disney has ever put to the big screen. It is not without its issues, but for me personally this film is a triumph.The story focuses on Quasimodo, the deformed bell ringer of Notre Dame who was raised by Judge Frollo. He yearns for a life beyond the cathedral and befriends a gypsy at a festival named Esmeralda, but is forced to help her when she falls foul of Frollo who has made it his goal to rid Paris of the gypsies. The story mainly deals with Quasimodo feeling stifled by his looks but showing that his kindness can win people over, while it is told with a lot of heart and it flows very well. Quasimodo himself is just such a likable lead and he has a real charm that carries the film, he only wants the simple things in life and you can't help but feel for him. Tom Hulce has a very pleasant voice that fits the character perfectly too.I think Frollo is easily one of Disney's best villains and probably the most complex. He thinks he's on a mission from God to cleanse Paris and he's willing to go to scary lengths to complete this. He has a great sinister design, does some truly abhorrent things and we even see him confront his sexual desire which is just amazing for a Disney character. His twisted dialogue is frequently brilliant and Tony Jay's distinct voice just oozes malevolence. The supporting characters are decent. Esmeralda is a solid kind-hearted character and he bond with Quasimodo is quite touching. Phoebus is a little dull and doesn't get much development, but he is likable enough and Kevin Kline's suave voice adds something extra.The animation is simply magnificent. For the most part it is very smooth and the darker colour scheme works well with the films themes. What stands out most is just how massive and majestic it is, with Notre Dame towering over the city and Paris itself just looks enormous. This is especially noticeable in the climax which has some of the biggest and most striking animation you'll ever see. The music is another highlight with both the score and the songs being superb. The grand sounding choir littered throughout just makes everything seem even more imposing. The songs themselves are excellent with 'The Bells of Notre Dame' making for a memorable introduction, 'Out There' being wonderfully joyful and 'Hellfire' is simply spectacular. You also have to commend the film for dealing with dark themes like sin and lust, it was a very bold move and one that adds something to the film.Of course the film does have some faults and for me the Gargoyles are the main one. Mainly because the whole idea behind the film is not to judge people, yet that is something they frequently do. They get annoying very quickly and most of their jokes either aren't funny or don't fit the tone of the film whatsoever. In fact I think that the comedic moments are a general problem, because the film does get quite dark and serious I think many of those moments feel very out of place. I also would have liked to get more of a backstory on the gypsies and for characters like Phoebus to get a little more development, but I can't really hold that against the film.The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a personal favourite of mine and for me it is arguably the best film from the Renaissance period. It has some of Disney's bravest and most adult material, it goes to areas you never thought they would and I have nothing but admiration for it because of that. It takes risks and even when it doesn't work at times you can still admire it. It has one of their most likable leads, one of the best villains, some of the most amazing animation and music that is just faultless. Sure it has flaws in certain areas, but the things that are good here are just incredible. It's a film that is gripping from start to finish.</fullReview>

My first favorite was Lion King, and like two years later this movie came out. I really had a huge love for this movie, specially for Quasimodo, the songs, and all the other characters who were in it.It has been a many years since I first saw this movie, but I never forget that I was so frightened and so in love at the same time. It Is obviously one of the darkest Disney movies so far, mostly because of the sexual lust for the gypsy that the main villain Qlaude Frollo has. Even though this may be the darkest from Disney. They have also been giving us other Dark stuff in the childhood. Like in SnowWhite, Pinocchio, The Black Cauldron etc. Disney are not afraid to take some few chances. So I disagree when people say that this is (almost) like the only dark movie Disney has made. But what can we say about this film. Well, as one of my favourite movies ever, and has ever been since. It makes me kind of sad to see that a wonderful movie like this is so underrated as it is today and has been some years after it's release. I really can't understand why. I must admit, that even though it is my favorite movie ever, there is one thing that kind of could have been done differently. Like the gargoyles. I thought at first that these things was imaginary, at first it looks like they are. When Frollo comes little after the opening and visits Quasimodo and when Esmeralda comes with Phoebus wounded. all that they talked about earlier seems to have never happened. This could be a really good idea that they were Imaginary, that would kind of have made a little sense to. Since Quasimodo is all alone up in the belltower and has been the past 20 years. But at the big climax at the end, they are fighting back, with the gargoyles and everything. This is not a big deal I feel. If it was I wouldn't have made this one of my favorites anyway.What else can you say about the movie? The songs are just amazing, Alan Menken is a master in Disney songwritting, this is where he belongs and where his music really shines. I love all the songs. My two most favorite songs in this movie is "Out There", and "Hellfire/Heavens Light" (Hellfire could almost be discussed as one song since they are after each other and there is no dialog in the little seconds before Hellfire comes on). The Characters that is in this movie is very well written. And they do have a personality that you can admire about them. Specially for Quasimodo. He is the main character in this version. So you will feel much more of what he is going trough instead of looking as a monster in the book or other adaptations that has been made based out of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" book.You will notice that compared to the book, this adaptation is very different. It has the dark elements. But some changes has been made. Like making Quasimodo the main character instead of Esmeralda. And Frollo instead of a priest he is a judge. But still has the religious faith there.It is for all to know that, when you are making and adaptation based out of a book. You must know that it is very hard to do it justice. And do it all correct to the book. And a lot of changes has to be made for the movie to be complex and still be interesting. And you are making a movie on 90 minutes from a book that has hundreds and hundreds of pages without letting something important be gone from the story. So even though the changes are many, it still could become a good movie and a good adaptation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful animation and story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 15th century Paris, Quasimodo the hunchback of Notre Dame falls for gypsy girl Esmeralda who was the only one to show him kindness. Claude Frollo the Minister of Justice has kept Quasimodo hidden in the belltower. The cruel Frollo set his soldiers to destroy the world of the gypsy and it's up to Quasimodo and the handsome Phoebus to come to the rescue.This Disney animation looks great. The story is a beautiful poignant story of sacrifice and love. The only thing missing is a really good iconic song. That would have added at least a point. The characters are really compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most Disappointing Disney Animated Films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of my least favorite Disney Films. It support's a weak script, un- necessary characters, and has a poor over all message. This film didn't take the books material to best use. This could have been stretched out further, and half of the screen time is spent on the lesser characters. Quasimodo should have had more screen time. The voice work and villain are top notch and so is the animation but everything else is a total disaster. The villain gets very little screen time but when he does get screen time it's dark, and suspenseful. Tom Hulce and Tony Jay support excellent voice work as their characters.The voice work is deep, provoking, original, and emotionally depth. Overall this is a very disappointing Disney Animated Film.

		<shortDescription>A WONDERFUL movie! &#x10e6;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say that this is one of my FAVORITE MOVIES EVER! &lt;3 And I think it is a SUPER underrated Disney film.I've heard some people say that the songs are weak compared to the songs in more acclaimed Disney films like Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.I TOTALLY disagree.I think the opening song is VERY powerful and God Help the Outcasts was simply beautiful and worked wonderful with Esmeralda's voice.Heaven's Light was a really beautiful and bittersweet song(bittersweet because we know what happens later)And the Hell Fire sequence was freaking EPIC.And am I the only one that found the gargoyle's song catchy and not annoying?Anyway,I also thought the score was AMAZING.I mean just listen to how powerful it sounds.It's all FSDUHAGAJBAMGK(that means amazingly powerful.)From the beginning by just hearing the music you can already tell the movie is going to be epic! Let's move on with the characters!I love the characters in this movie!Quasimodo is plain out lovable.I don't see how you can dislike such a sweet character.He is also a strong character who truly cares about Esmeralda,even when she does break his heart he still helps her because he truly cared about her.Phoebes is funny and I love his attitude and the way he stood for what was right even though there were consequences for him.And Esmeralda is an awesome heroine!I also love how she stands up for what is right and rebels.She's so kind and sly too.I didn't think the Gargoyles were annoying,I actually kinda liked them.I can't decide if the movie would be better without their comic relief or not though.However,the comic relief didn't ruin the tone of the film so that's good.As for the villain,Frollo was awesome!I loved his personality and sinisterness(is that a word?)And he is different than all the other Disney villains.He wasn't just out for power and he wasn't evil simply because he liked being evil.He actually thought everything he did was for God so that's really unique in terms of Disney villainy....And Frollo was just plain out awesome.The animation in this movie is beautiful.(well this is Disney,it's not like it would have crappy animation)I really wish Disney would make more beautiful hand drawn animated movies.The computer animation for the backgrounds and what not blended in well without looking cheezy.I love the vibrant colors and wonderful detailed backgrounds,especially in the cathedral.I thought this was a wonderful adaption to a rather grim story.A lot of changes were made to make the film more suitable for children but I give Disney credit for not totally screwing up the story and still keeping some of the more mature elements instead of making it all kiddy kiddy.Yes,it's a Disney film and it's still meant for children so they took out the more brutal things and gave it a ''the good guys live happily ever after'' ending but I'm glad they at least didn't keep the ending TOTALLY perfectly happy(poor Quasi not getting Esmeralda)I recommend this film to all children,animation buffs,or anyone who likes a good family movie ^.^ 10 out of 10 stars!Thanks for reading,my kitties!&#x10e6;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie was great FOR the right audience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered as Disney's one of darkest films of all times, Hunchback of Notre Dame is still one of my most favorite masterpiece Disney has created (the other one being Beauty and the Beast). The songs, unlike what other reviewers said, were fantastic. I mean, compared to the likes of Lion King and Little Mermaid, the songs weren't for the children, but it's so moving and wonderful. Plus the orchestration and the score, Menken totally deserved the Oscar for that. It's so sad that this is considered one of Disney's most underrated film. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to see this on Broadway (there've been rumors), and I know that this will succeed on Broadway because the songs and the story for that matter is really Broadway's, if you know what I mean... All in all, great film nevertheless..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm so amazed that this movie doesn't have incredible reviews! Sure, in the 90's, Disney was not at it's best. But, as far as Disney movies from the 90's go, this is amazing!The music is what makes the movie so wonderful, and totally worth watching! "Hellfire" is so beautiful, yet haunting. This is (obviously) not true to the book. It's Disney! Of course it's much, much happier than the book ever was. The book is, without question, way better (though, I'm not sure that needed to even be said). Disney's Hunchback is still great.Quasimodo is charming and lovable, Esmeralda is sassy but sweet, and Frolo is delightfully evil. There is absolutely no loving the guy- 100% to-the-bone evil.There are certainly better Disney movies (Dumbo and Lady and the Tramp top my list), but this is quite underrated, and really rather good. Definitely worth a watch- as long as you don't expect it to be true to the book! Enjoy it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's biggest triumph in the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Pocahontas was found unsatisfying Disney decided to try a more dark approach. The catch this time was to make a film strictly for adults, and thus "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" born. Some people might say it's semi-sugar-coated but I disagree. True there are scenes that should be more dark like they are in the original novel, but remember this is a Disney film.Hunchback has it's strong points no doubt, an excellent villain. Frollo is based off Dom Claude Frollo, but here he's a judge this was done so Disney wouldn't be accused of attack a certain religion. Also the story is strong and consistent and had me on the edge of my seat at times. I don't know if I like Phoebus as a good guy though, he's supposed to be a womanizer in the novel. Esmaralda's sentence I suppose could have been more brutal, but again this is a Disney film. Plus the final battle was just as good as anything else from the novel. Frollo falling into the molten copper was epic Now on to the characters Quasimodo changed drastically for the film, in the novel he can't speak or see. I guess Disney decided not to make him silent like Dumbo, plus Tom Hulce did a good job voicing him. Another thing that made this film excellent was the voice cast.Tom Hulce as Quasimodo it's like we can feel the person inside just longing to come out of his shell. Tony Jay as Frollo was excellent too, not only is his character intended to be menacing but his voice fit Frollo. Demi Moore as Esmeralda was good too, the unusual sound of her voice for the leading lady, and Heidi Mollenhauer as her singing was good too. In fact they both matched each other and it worked so well.The rest of the cast was excellent as well, especially Kevin Kline. The only thing I didn't like was the gargoyles, I mean it's okay if they're in Quasi's mind but to appear outside was just ridiculous. The music as well was perfect it advanced the plot and Hellfire is the best song in Disney history Overall, Hunchback is an epic Disney film. It's dark and full of thematic material, and the best thing is the plot worked.Hunchback gets a 9 from me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disfigurement! Racism! Lust! Religion! Dark Comedy! Disney?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funnily enough, Disney did not use the words I've used in the title of this review as part of their advertising campaign, but the film certainly has all of these things, hence its power.There are three main problems critics/the public have with this film: the treatment of Victor Hugo's novel, on which the film is based; the comic aspects, in particular the gargoyles; and its debated suitability as a children's film.It was inevitable that Disney were going to change parts of Hugo's novel when they took it on. Indeed, all of the film adaptations have made sacrifices and alterations and Disney have kept some elements that other film adaptors discarded, such as not switching Claude Frollo (the villain) with Jehan Frollo, who in the book is a trouble-making student, and removing or downplaying the religious aspects. In the Disney film, Frollo is a judge instead of a priest- a clever alteration as it highlights the theme of judgement and it's an attack on corrupt rule. His religious fervour is very prominent- there is a song called Hellfire, in which Frollo agonises over lust and committing evil, with flames all in the background. Fire appears more than once in the film, acting as a powerful symbol of destruction.In this adaptation, Phoebus is a bit of a ladies man but then he is softened. In the novel, he's a heartless vain cad. Obviously the latter does not make for a good Disney hero. However Phoebus is one of the better Disney love interests and there are some wonderful romantic moments. Disney looks at love in a much maturer way than in its previous films and although some may see the ending as defeating the point of the film, it doesn't do that at all, making for a more interesting protagonist and a better, more credible film.Then we have the comic aspects. If you've read the novel, you'll know that it's pretty much an out-and-out misery fest about torture. It's very good but it's not a jolly novel. Therefore Disney created three gargoyle friends for Quasimodo, who advise him (sometimes wrongly) and provide most of the jokes. The song they sing, "A Guy Like You", has a lot of great lines, and acts as a confidence boost for Quasimodo. The gargoyles aren't simply there for comic relief- they help push the plot along. Quasimodo lives in the bell tower and so it's not credible that he would suddenly make all these changes of his own accord. Anyhow, it is hinted that the gargoyles are another product of Quasimodo's boundless imagination. There's also some nice black comedy, a lot of which is gallows humour, as shown in "The Court of Miracles", and some of which is innuendo. It's a witty and dramatic screenplay- very quotable.And finally, we have the debate on its suitability for children. Giving the film a U rating is deceptive- there are many dark aspects of the film that could upset certain children. PG indicates that the adult should check the film to see whether they feel their children can "handle" it; U indicates that one needn't bother to watch/read up about the film first before they show it to their children. I think children should be able to watch maturer films but I also think that parents of young children have the right to decide what films their children might be afraid of.This is a dark film, no two ways about it. Frollo is the most frightening Disney villain ever. He is recognisably human in appearance and yet his actions and intentions are monstrous. Clopin, the Greek chorus, poses a riddle to the audience at the beginning of the film: "Who is the monster and who is the man?" By the end, it is clear who is who, and the "who" changes to "what makes a man?".It's certainly the most sexual of the Disney films. Esmerelda dances seductively and Phoebus gazes appreciatively at her. Frollo lusts after her to the point of torture. There is nothing explicit but the undertones and intentions are obvious.There are fascinating contrasts and conflicts throughout the film- Esmerelda is not Christian but her spirit is whereas Frollo claims to be religious and yet he only sees hell and damnation. Quasimodo loves Esmerelda; Frollo lusts for her. The songs are powerful- Hellfire is a great song. Cleverly, a short song called "Heaven's Light" is sung first, and then it builds to "Hellfire". The first song is sung by Quasimodo and shows a romantic childlike approach to love. The possibility of love has transformed Quasimodo. "Hellfire" is sung by Frollo- with an ominous background of Latin chanting, Frollo demands that God either let him have Esmerelda or kill Esmerelda. Powerful stuff.This is a multi-layered, fascinating film. Very underrated- it stands up not only as a great Disney film, but as a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truthfully I never liked this movie when I was little. Re-watching it I still find I don't really care for it. I do however have an appreciation for it though. Disney really went on a limb here and did something different. I have a theory they didn't get the credit they truly deserved from it either, or at least not by most Disney fans I figure.My childhood memory of this movie isn't much. I remember the hunchback and I remember talking gargoyles. I guess I must have blocked out the rest cause I truly couldn't remember anything else about this movie before re-watching it. I think I see why I did though. lol! I really feel for the most part that this movie would be appreciated by an older audience. That's just how I feel about it now.I found from seeing it again though that there is a lot of good in this movie. The songs for the most part are good, even really creepy. Frollo's song will always send chills down my spine, as will the character. As for the other characters they were all nicely done. I'm glad I can appreciate this movie a lot more now that I'm older.I guess I'll call this a family movie, only cause it's under the Disney name though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT Disney FLIK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It's a great animated feature from Disney adopted from the novel by Victor Hugo of the same name. In the movie Quasimodo is a bellringer who lives in the church of Notre Dame and who is forbidden by his foster father Frollo because due to his half form but with the help of his gargoyle friends Hugo, Victor, and Laverne he disguises himself and goes to the Festivel of Fools and befriends Esmeralda and Captain Pheobus who help him and the other people to understand about people who are different and they also help defeat Frollo and his evil ways. I really loved the songs for the movie written by Alan Menken who I think is one of the greatest Disney song writers of our time! I loved the scene when Laverne the gargoyle called Hugo the other gargoyle the fat stupid one with the BIG Mouth! I just died laughing at that scene! Mary Wickes did a fantastic job voicing Laverne before dieing in October 1995. I'm sure she would of loved this movie because I know I did! I recommend it for any Disney fan because it's really good! 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would Hugo have made of it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The issue of how far away from source material movie adaptations should stray is always a prickly issue.I imagine myself as Victor Hugo, bodily transported into the 21st Century, given a crash course in technological development, and then sat down in front of Disney's Hunchback. What would I be thinking? Well, for sure, I would recognise my novel as the source material of what was in front of me. I would see that it had been grossly simplified in the course of adapting it for presentation to an audience substantially younger that the audience it was written for, and that would perhaps mystify me somewhat - I would need to understand the nature of the Disney organisation and, even then, I might wonder at their choice of material.This contrast/conflict would also explain why the film was so colourful, contained songs, and contained a Hunchback who was lovable rather then hideous. By this point I might feel that the movie was escaping my original intentions but, by the time I had finished watching it I might understand that it was still dark in much of its tone and that it still addressed some adult issues which remained from the original.Most of all, I hope I might understand that this easy access, mass media adaptation would be a highly effective way of introducing many people to a centuries old novel which they might otherwise never encounter and, in so doing, bring my original novel to future generations. And I think that would please me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A significant emotional message in good Disney picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bell ringer Quasimodo (Hulce) has dreamed of life outside of Notre Dame and one day he is crowned the King of Fools, which introduces him to the gypsy Esmeralda (Moore).We film lovers have been extremely privileged to have been able to view some wonderful films thanks to a certain Walt Disney. Whether we are learning about the circle of life in The Lion King or looking at our place in the world in The Jungle Book, there have been some entertaining and meaningful pictures to marvel at since the late 1930's and this 1996 picture is as equally interesting as some of our favourites.As a musical Hunchback has a lot to live up to as Disney has produced some of the most memorable scene stealing songs to ever grace the animated screen. The Bear necessities, Beauty and The Beast and A Whole new world are still being sung even today.This picture opens with a wonderful number as a jester figure re-enacts the tale of how Quasimodo ended up at the top of the Bell Tower alone, friendless and 'ugly'. This opening song entraps the viewer and we are soon on an enjoyable ride with the Bell Ringer as we discover his sad life story of solitude and helplessness.What I particularly love about Disney pictures is that no matter what there is always an emotional core and significant message. Lion King had the very grown up message of dealing with loss, Aladdin focused upon social status and Robin Hood looked at rags and riches. Hunchback of Notre Dame takes the concept of appearance and puts a devastatingly sharp spin on it. We viewers on first glance will take into account that Quasimodo isn't the most beautiful person in the world. He has a misshapen back, his eyes are lopsided and his toothy grin is very obvious. But this soon becomes irrelative to us as we see the emotional core of the character and his lust towards a friend filled life. He has much the same desires as we the viewers have. A safe and happy life with love and friendship, and this ideology alone makes the film very enjoyable.Still there is no shying away from what others think of him. The King of Fools ceremony is unforgivably cruel as they treat him almost like an animal and once more, Disney further emphasises an important issue, and one of the most delicate in his career.The religious concepts encoded are very strong, particularly the look on sanctuaries and the reflections on heaven and hell are well portrayed.Hunchback isn't a perfect picture though. There is not enough humour to rival the big guns in the genre, Esmeralda is a poor singer and the music score isn't as free flowing as it thinks. Also it is over too quickly when more scenes could have been developed.However this is a must watch simply for the fact it is an enjoyable picture with some very significant and important messages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bells Ring! Gargoyles Sing! And the Feast of Fools is in Full Swing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has GOT to be one of my absolute favorites out of the Disney masterpieces. When I first saw this movie in theaters, I was little and didn't fully understand all the underlying concepts. However when I watched it again in a History class I was stunned at the darkness and mystery of the film! Disney had some serious balls back then to be able to juggle lust, infanticide, murder, religion, and so much more into a G rated movie! Quite the achievement if I say so myself.The most striking thing about this movie is the stunning quality of the visuals. The beautiful backgrounds make you feel like you are in Paris and the exquisite views from the top of Notre Dame are just breathtaking! Like Esmeralda said "Even the King himself doesn't have a view like this" and that is quite true! No other movie has such wonderful artwork! I also love the characters. True, they weren't exactly as Victor Hugo made them but they served their purpose well. Quasimodo, the Hunchback stood out as a noble, brave, and even charming guy who touched my heart for I too know what it was like to be picked on. I also enjoyed Clopin, the Gypsy King. He was my favorite and though it embarrasses me to say so...I had something of a crush on the guy when I was little and I still happen to be fond of him. He is a ruthless, charming, devilish character and man can he SING! The songs in this movie are really what set it apart from the crowd. When the opening number "Bells of Notre Dame" starts with the choir and clanging church bells you are instantly immersed in the world of Hugo's novel. The fun songs like "Topsy Turvy" and "A Guy Like You" are cute and amusing. However the crown jewel of this film has to be "Hellfire". No other Disney song is as dark or foreboding. So many themes come through that song alone it can actually frighten you slightly and make you hate Frollo even more. Such a creeper that man is.All in all, this is a true gem in Disney's animation crown and should not be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"...Disney's Strongest, Most Stirring Tale of Prejudice and Acceptance..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HOND (as the movie is abbreviated) is a movie that came out when I was 6 years old, and I was a big fan of the movie from the start. As I got more into anime and Tim Burton, I always held a love of this movie. I have recently rediscovered the movie and now see it in a different light. It is Disney's strongest, most stirring tale; one that tells of prejudice and acceptance. It touches on many sensitive aspects, very rare in Disney films, such as the Christian religion, damnation and bigotry, as well keeping the trademark Disney themes of overcoming great adversaries and believing in oneself. The story came from that of Victor Hugo's 19th Century novel, which, oddly enough, was a cry to preserve the sanctity of the holy building in which it took place. Anyway, it is an adaption that tells the story of Quasimodo (Tom Hulce), who desires to be a part of society, but his master, Frollo (Tony Jay, in his most riveting performance) keeps him confined out of fear and scorn for the poor beast. But, when he is crowned "King" in the annual Festival of Fools, he captures the heart of outspoken and beautiful Esmeralda (Demi Moore), whom he helps escape Frollo's wrath.The movie has many big names, as well as some lesser known, who deliver a wonderful performance. Tony Jay*, known for his deep, compelling voice in video games and cartoons, probably delivered his finest performance in this film, that of a tortured and corrupted religious figure. Paul Kandel delivered the performance of the versatile Clopin, the narrator of the story, if you will. The three gargoyles, one of which is voiced by Jason Alexander, gives the movie a touch of loyal Disney sidekicks. However, this movie received a G-rating. I feel, due to it's dark undertones, that it should have been given a PG. Many of the themes will go over the heads of kids under 7, and it may seem frightening at times, as well as the VERY thinly veiled element of lust, so parents, be warned. Overall, the movie is a tapestry of beauty and a powerful message of Justice and Courage; taking a stand for what's right.*-Sadly, Jay died in 2006 due to complications following lung surgery, but his performance will never be forgotten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rings a bell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Though it sounds a bit too dark for children, this is a downright entertaining masterpiece. The idea of Disney doing an adaptation of Victor Hugo's THE HUCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is a bit of a stretch. Hugo's tale of an ugly duckling is dark, cynical and too violent for children. On the other hand, any attempt that could be done by Disney to soften the tale with whimsy or talking critters (this in case, gargoyles) would be taking it too far. But leave it to Disney to juggle the dark and light elements to create a wonderful achievement that remains one of Disney's most accomplished works.What it lacks in the light and joyousness of ALADDIN or THE LION KING is more than made up with dazzling elements that has something for everyone. The kids will love the funny gargoyles that come to our dear hero Quasimodo's (voiced by Tom Hulce) aid (adult SEINFELD however, will be happy to note that one of them is voiced by Jason Alexander). While adults will enjoy the deep, sometimes dark storyline and its surprisingly mature characters from the spunky gypsy Esmaralda (voiced by Demi Moore) to the cold-hearted, pseudo-religious judge Frollo (voiced with malice by Tony Jay). But both will definitely love the adorable Quasimodo, the delightful musical numbers populated by songs written by the one and only Alan Menken and the towering animation that's an accomplishment to behold. The animation done to the very lively city of Paris is still stunning even in this days of newer and more advance techniques in animation.But like all Disney efforts, HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is populated by reliable characters (without the exclusion of a funny critter) and the wonderfully told storyline. The surprise with HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is that it strongly follows Hugo's renowned work without being too dark and too menacing for little kids to watch. It's a perfect balance of the the dark elements and the traditional Disney elements; It's true family affair.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very touching, and never becomes old or boring. The story is of a Hunchback named Quasimodo, who was adopted by an evil Judge named Claude Frollo when he killed is mother. Keeping this secret from Quasimodo all of his life, Quasimodo became attached to Frollo and obeyed his commands(most of the time). He later meets a beautiful Gypsey named Esmerelda, who insults Frollo at a festival. Frollo becomes obsessed with finding this Gypsey, which he also has a sudden love for. In the end, Quasimodo saves Esmerelda from Frollo, who falls to his death from the bell tower. It has a happy ending, but this movie is also dark at times. It has many frightening, religious, and violent scenes which may not be right for young kids. This movie is best suited for Pre-Teens at best. Still, this movie is enjoyable for any age at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant Disney classic. Very underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Walt Disney died, there was a period where every animated feature produced under the Walt Disney company was fairly mediocre. In 1989 The Little Mermaid was released and the curse was broken. For about 10 years Disney remained on top with only brilliant animated movies, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame was one of them...probably the most underrated. As a kid's movie, this is probably one of the worst Disney movies. It's very dark, has some mature themes, and is pretty violent for a Disney cartoon. Kid's will still enjoy it, however, just maybe not as much as watching the goofy Genie from Aladdin. It's obvious the movie was Disney-fied with comic relief gargoyles, but the truth is this tale of prejudice is a mature story, so adults will probably enjoy it more than little children.Quasimodo was left on the steps of the cathedral when he was born because of his disfigurement. He was almost killed by Claude Frollo, the minister of justice, but the Archdeacon did not allow this, and Frollo begrudgingly kept Quasimodo as his own, forever locked in the church bell tower, his only friends being three stone gargoyles who he talks to. Frollo manipulates Quasimodo to believe that he loves him and wants the best. One day Quasimodo finally leaves the tower during the Festival of Fools, and is ridiculed. When down there he meets a gypsy named Esmeralda, who Frollo grows a bitter hatred towards. Frollo tries to get rid of the gypsies, and Quasimodo, Esmeralda, and a guard, Phoebus try to stop this.For a 6 year old to follow the entire plot of this movie seems like it would be nearly impossible, but maybe I'm underestimating 6 year old children. This is not a critique on the movie, because though it may be complicated, it turned out to be one of the most mature and beautiful Disney films. The animation is great. Computers are used for some shots, but it mostly looks very traditional, and it's great to see how far Disney animation has come from just 10 years before this movie. I love the music! Every song here is beautiful, and 12 years after it's release I still find myself listening to the soundtrack. I have never listened to a Disney movie's soundtrack like this one, except maybe Touchstone's the Nightmare Before Christmas. The voice acting is great, led by Tom Hulce, Kevin Kline, Demi Moore, Jason Alexander and voice over actor Tony Jay showing off how evil he can truly be with Frollo. The characters are relate-able, and real emotion id felt for Quasimodo who is shunned by the public for his looks, even though he's a nice person, and Esmeralda who's constantly being pursued by Frollo who wants her dead.Overall, this is one of the most brilliant animated movies ever made, and the most mature of the Disney animations. Too bad fan and critic reviews for this were much lower than many other classics from the 90s, but that still doesn't keep this from being considered a true classic.My rating: **** out of ****. 90 mins. G.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your typical Disney, but I love it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The average person wouldn't expect Disney to make such a dark flick based off such a dark book (which I have read and I will say while it's very good, I have enough room in my heart for both the book and the Disney version), but who knew it would come out to be such a breath-takingly beautiful movie with stunning animation, well-developed (and complicated) characters, and some of the coolest music Disney has made? I still can't stop saying this, but the animation is just stunning and a very good piece of eye candy reminiscent of Lion King and Prince of Egypt (even though it is released after HoND) that gives me the chills every time I see it. From the swooping views of Out There to the images of Paris on fire, it is just phenomenal and some of Disney's best. The characters aren't as simple as you think and do have some very un-Disney subject matter associated with them. While characters such as Quasi and Esmeralda are quite likable, they have very complex feeling, which they express beautifully in songs such as Out There and God Help the Outcasts. The villain, Frollo, is without a doubt one of Disney's best offerings, not to mention certainly the most twisted on the inside. A religious man of the law who thinks his killing of innocent people is right and lusts for Esmeralda, the very thing he despises of and wants to destroy, isn't your typical Disney, but is done incredibly to make one of Disney's most fascinating characters.Now, the music, which is by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, is something that must be heard to be believed! The songs take on some very un-Disney subject matter themselves, and feature it too. In the magnificent opening Bells of Notre Dame, a mother is killed, a baby is almost killed, and sin is touched upon. God Help the Outcasts, a beautiful prayer, is Esmeralda's asking from God to help her people, who are outcasts in society constantly getting persecuted. Hellfire, a real doozy and my fave from the movie, is all about Frollo's sexual obsession for Esmeralda. Those songs don't sound very Disney, do they, considering the heavy religious subject matter (such as sin, salvation, absolutism, etc.) that goes into each one. Throughout the movie, there's also Latin chanting taken from real chants of the Latin Mass, such as the Confiteor, the Angus Dei, and the Dies Irae. Besides adding an excellent dramatic touch and putting emphasis on the religious portions of the movie, it sounds mad cool! I would've given this a 10/10, but the reason it got a 9 is cause of those Gargoyles! They may be nice comic relief for the kids, but they're just plain irritating. I'm sorry, but when a city's on fire, the last thing we need is a painfully annoying song like A Guy Like You. Putting that aside, this movie, in general, is phenomenal and simply a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie and music.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie came out, I was young, and I loved it. I was even Esmeralda for Halloween. Recently, I watched it again (after about 10 years) because a friend of mine had not seen it. It was like watching it for the first time again.I had completely forgotten the story, and the little details that Disney always incorporates in its movies, such as references to other movies or comedic side characters. I fell in love with the characters, and the music! It gives me the chills every time I watch a music scene. If that isn't enough, I enjoyed all of the main conflicts; Quasimoto's whole life, Esmeralda's struggle as a Gypsy, and Frollo's internal conflict (and how he shifts blame to Esmeralda). Each scene always leaves me with a bunch of emotions, and I like when movies do that.If you are an adult who hasn't watched this in a while, I suggest you watch it again. If you haven't, well what are you waiting for? ^^If you like the music in this movie, you'll probably like the Prince of Egypt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Disney Movie- A Truly Mature Film for Children and Adults!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I wasn't quite six years old, I was taken to see this movie in the theaters. I vaguely remember being intrigued with the bell ringer Quasimodo, the fast-jabbing gargoyles, and the dancing gypsy Esmeralda.I watched it again when I was about ten then totally forgot about this magnificent film. I saw it again just recently and at nearly 17, I appreciate this film much more than I did so long ago.The film describes the journey of Quasimodo, the deformed bellringer of Notre Dame who struggles to find acceptance and join the outside world, but is ruled by the tight fist of the cruel Judge Claude Frollo. The film's beginning is enough to show this is no ordinary film. Before the Disney logo even fills the screen, the viewer can already hear the bells tolling, a prelude of suspense. The dark music begins and then we see Paris and hear Clopin's tale of the Gypsies and how Frollo chased after Quasimodo's mother and killed her on the steps of Notre Dame. The Archdeacon stops Frollo from killing the poor child and out of fear for his immortal soul, Frollo raises the child in Notre Dame to be the bell ringer. I still get chills down my spine from the conclusion of the opening sequence when we finally see the title. Twenty years pass and the hunchback desires to leave his lonely tower, for his only companions are the three friendly gargoyles. Frollo will not allow him to leave, but Quasimodo sneaks out to the festival and befriends Esmeralda, the beautiful Gypsy girl. Phoebus is also entranced by her, but Frollo's lust is revealed. When the Gypsy saves the hunchback from the people's abuse, he decides to help her once she becomes a fugitive for doing so. Frollo tears Paris apart to find the object of his lust and Quasimodo is forced to realize Esmeralda has chosen Phoebus and not he, for love. The three are forced to a chilling climax with the deranged judge in this emotionally gripping film.I have seen several bad reviews for this movie and quite frankly, I do not understand why. The plot is marvelous. Disney took Victor Hugo's work and made it an intense film for both children and adults. Of course, content had to be changed, but it was done so quite well. The ending was happy. But do not be fooled merely because this is a Dinsey film. There are plenty of aspects for the children: Jokes, silly songs in between and even the fun-loving gargoyles. However, there is much darkness as well. The music is flawless during the more emotional songs. The Latin chants add to the atmosphere of suspense and mystery. Disney managed to tackle very grave subjects: Lust, which Frollo felt for Esmeralda is mentioned in such a way that perhaps children of 6 or so like I was will not understand what he really wants from the Gypsy, but the older audience certainly will and it is quite chilling. The desire to be accepted is also among this heart-wrenching film: Quasimodo wants the world to accept him as does Esmeralda for the Gypsies are treated very badly. The battle scenes and especially the climax at the end are not truly that violent, but with the chanting and great music, as well as emotional pulls, it is quite suspenseful. Each character is unique: Quasimodo is a different kind of hero than in most Disney movies: We truly get to see his beauty on the inside when he selflessly helps Esmeralda and the others. Phoebus is not so evil as he is in the novel: Instead he is a heroic, selfless man who will not harm the innocent and truly loves Esmeralda. Esmerelda is the not so ordinary heroine as she fights for justice for her people and helps out others. Frollo is perhaps the scariest Disney villain of all and his evil has no limits. The music: Amazing. The Plot: Magnificent. The characters: Unique. Not to mention the amazing graphics. Notre Dame shines and will perhaps even get your jaw to drop.People get angry because this does not follow the book. But this movie has served its true purpose: It provides good lessons for children, as well as entertaining distraction and best of all for those of us who are older, it provides a chilling plot underneath it all and is true entertainment.If you are not too closed-minded and love suspense, I strongly recommend this film. If there are any bad things about this movie, it's only that it's too short being one hour and a half!The end is especially touching when Quasimodo is embraced and accepted warmly by the people of Paris. Clopin sings ecstatically of the moral of the story- Who is the monster and who is the man?- and we can see quite clearly that the monster is not Quasimodo, but Frollo. Despite his appearance, Quasimodo is the true man, a selfless hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than it Gets Credit For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I'm older now, but I honestly enjoy the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I always liked it, but in recent years it has really grown on me. I absolutely adore the chants incorporated into the soundtrack and think the beginning is the best of any Disney movie, and one of of the best for any type. I really love having French culture spotlighted again in a Disney film, and thought the animation of the church was especially gorgeous. The dark storyline, yeah, it's not for younger kids, but I don't think that was the intention. It still makes for a thoroughly entertaining film even though I've grown well beyond the age for cartoons (not that it ever stops me anyways).I do however have 2 major qualms with this film. Firstly, the incessant need to lighten up the film with the stupid gargoyles and their silly songs. The studio had committed (and rightly so!) so deeply to a dark story that the anachronistic antics and juvenile humor neither saved the movies for kiddies nor entertained the older audiences.Secondy, I have no idea what Esmerelda saw in Phoebus. They spent so much time crafting this story about inner beauty, only to have it fall flat as a pancake when the hot girl goes for the hot guy. I'm not saying that I wanted her to end up with Quasimodo, but seriously people- beauty coupling is not the only storyline out there. Phoebus was nice, sure, but his personality was lackluster and flat compared to Quasi, and in the end everyone knew why Esmerelda stuck with him. In many ways this is culmination of the Disney Renaissance: a beautifully rendered film that trusted the audience to handle something a little more mature. If only they had kept the tone completely consistent.Quote of the Film:-It is a tale, a tale of a man, and a monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best since Beauty And The Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has the same basic idea and moral as 1991's Beauty and The Beast. Adapted from the classic by Victor Hugo it tells the tale of Quasimodo (Voiced by Academy Award Nominee, Tom Hulce), The deformed bell ringer who has been locked away in the bell tower of Notre Dame by his cruel master Judge Claude Frollo (Tony Jay). Frollo tells Quasi that he is a monster not a man and that the world would never accept him as anything more. Urged on by his friends the Gargoyles, Victor (Charles Kimbrough), Hugo (Jason Alexander), and Laverne (Mary Wickes with additional dialog by Jane Withers). Quasi disobeys his evil guardian and ventures into the city on the day of The Festival Of Fools. The crowd rejects him and tortures him because of the way he looks. After being disgraced and mistreated Quasi meets Esmeralda, the beautiful kind gypsy girl voiced by Demi Moore, and the heroic and often humorous Captain Phoebus (Academy Award Winner Kevin Kline).Quasimodo finds himself battling his master (and his band of guards) to save the city and the people he loves and through all of this he finds out the truth about his past and is able to rise above evil and Judge Claude Frollo is destroyed in the fiery pit.This film is a masterpiece. Alan Menken's original score sets the mood for the film while Stephen Schwartz's lyrics always tell the story that needs to be told.It is at times darker and more violent than it's thirty-three predecessors. Still children of all ages will adore the songs and hilarious characters and parents will love the uplifting and thrilling story with a heart touching message that emerges from the film's dark undertone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie a few times, in a cinema and at home, and I must say I was impressed by the songs, at least. Having not read the book, I don't know how well it matches up to the original story, though.Even without knowing the fuller story, one can appreciate the era that it was set in- persecution of the gypsies, sanctuary in the church, etc.One thing I really liked about the film was the songs. The singers are great, and most of the words are clear and understandable. My favourite was the Court of Miracles song. The jester is a great character.Also, the visuals were very appealing. They had a very realistic look, even having the discinct 'clean' computer look that comes of 3D graphics most of the time. The bells ringing were really good- very well done.Overall, 3.75 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney generally makes movies for kids,but when they plunge into thedarkness and decide to explore the recesses of the human psyche,they do a great job-BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is proof of that. HUNCHBACK is directed by the same guys who directed BATB and it is indeed a study in shadow,a look at innocence and evil. Tony Jay does an absolutely great job as Frollo. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is the better film,butHOND is also extremely good,though several songs easily could've been excised("A Guy Like You" is the worst.) I have read Hugo's novel several times, and I'm not sure how I feel about their treatment of it. Also,in the Trivia section,it says that Belle can be seen during "Out There." That's not Belle. I once read an article-I don't remember who they were interviewing-but she said that that is Belle's great-great grandmother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A darker Disney, a remarkable splendor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe how many people did not like this film because they thought the theme was too "dark" or "adult". Yes, there are darker elements to the film and yes, there is adult thematic scenes in the movie involving Frollo's obsession with Esmerelda, but these elements are precisely why I enjoyed this film so much. Frollo, I believe has the most depth to all other Disney villains and is my favorite. His obsession with the gypsy girl was essential to the telling of the story and I believe Disney handled the mature theme very well. The musical score is a masterpiece in itself (why it did not get the Academy Award I do not know). The animation was superb, especially the great cathedral scenes. My favorite scene however, is the scene with Frollo in front of the fire. This scene is one of the most powerful, I believe, ever to be animated. This addition is one of the greatest (including the wonderful Beauty and the Beast of course)animated achievements in Disney's history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Disney film yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to start off with a quick summary of what I'm going to say: I have seen and I own just about every Disney film (I own all the full-length animated films) and this is the best so far. For the ease of reading I'll separate my praises into categories.Animation - I loved the Lion King, but the only truly impressively animated part of the movie was the opening number. Here the whole movie keeps the quality high. To akin it to another Disney flick, Beauty and the Beast had the famous computer animated section, but it was so obvious that it was computer animated. Here there are sections using computer animation (man I've overused that phrase) that are impossible to differentiate from drawn sections upon even the first three viewings. It is just that well made.Story - Despite the changes from Victor Hugo's version, this was very well written. If looked at totally independently from the original novel it can be better appreciated. Not because it is worse and it looks better when not compared to something better, but because if you are not expecting to see an animated version of the original it seems a lot better. And for the record, while the new ending was nice, it would have been neat to see Disney make a movie without a happy ending.Characters - Okay this was the weakest section, but still great. Phoebus was changed greatly, but it worked. Esmerelda is fun to watch, and was done very well by Demi Moore. Quasimodo is incredible, Tom Hulce did an amazing job at both acting and singing here. And of course Frollo is amazing, easily the best bad guy in any Disney movie. Tony Jay has a great "evil guy" voice. But my personal favorite character was Clopin, played by Paul Kandel (kan DELL). He is just a joy to watch, and has a sort of mesmerizing quality that I see where I can't stop watching him.Songs - The best part of the movie. Stephen Schwartz and Alan Menken did a fantastic job on the score, setting the mood perfectly. The title track is great, especially the last note for Clopin (a really high D, still gives me shivers to hear it). Every song is very well done, even the mismatched "A Guy Like You" works to just be goofy. Out there and Hellfire are beautiful songs, and I used "Topsy Turvy" as my audition piece for a musical. I'll write another review to say how I did, heh.and just for the record again, I'm 15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most powerful animated film of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most powerful animated film ever made. While I realize that this is a highly subjective comment, I feel that the movie justifies it. Within the first five minutes, as the story is being set up, there is more genuine emotional connection than most movies have in their entirety. At the heart of "Hunchback"'s success is an incredible marriage of the music and the visual element. As Frollo chases the young gypsy woman at the beginning, the visual and emotional content is already very powerful. However, when the viewer realizes that the choir is singing the "Dies Irae" text in the background, it gives the scene a more frightening edge of foreshadowing. With outstanding animation, wonderful vocal performances and a faithfulness to the adult nature of the story, this movie is a cut above the rest of Disney's excellent animated product. While "Beauty and the Beast" was a very good film, this is the cartoon that deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.</fullReview>

I find "little Quasimodo" quite adorable, I deeply respect Esmeralda and Phoebus, and Frollo is the only Disney character I really hate. I have also read the novel, but in fact I prefer this movie. The music is beautiful, especially Esmeralda's prayer, and in fact Frollo's "Hellfire" is quite fine, but it really isn't for the smallest children. I really would like to know what my real gypsy friends would think about the film - I almost shudder of fury while listening to Frollo's disgusting opinions! But the only thing I don't find good in the movie is that Esmeralda can't love Quasi. If Disney ever makes a continuing part to HUNCHBACK, Quasi must either find a girl of his own - or die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame is a technically, cinematographically and choreographically brilliant film. The music and songs are slick, the script is funny and moving by turn and the story, although a "disneyfied" version of the Hugo original, still works. The lack of usual Disney sugared schmalz is, in actual fact, refreshing.However, just whom was the film aimed at? The-on screen attempt to burn alive a family, the presumed actual burning and killing of the gypsies, the torture of a disabled person, attempted genocide, the internal wrestling of a cleric with his conscience, visions of hell, suppressed sexual desire...hardly the fare that most parents wish for their children. I found it fascinating but the jokey gargoyles were not enough to keep my 3 and a half year old spell-bound. (It's noteworthy that the trailer for this film on other Disney videos selects very carefully the scenes to show, creating a totally misleading impression of its suitability for kids).Hunchback was not a great hit and this was probably because it was just too "difficult", both for young minds to follow and for older audiences to swallow. The fact is, Disney produced an art movie with an unavoidable political message. I wonder if it meant to?David</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A deformed bell-ringer (Tom Hulce) must assert his independence from a vicious government minister in order to help his friend, a gypsy dancer (Demi Moore).The Second Golden Age of Disney was roughly 1989-1992 (give or take), and "Hunchback" was a little late to the party, coming in around the same time as "Pocahontas". Not sure what happened here. The heroines are not as memorable, the songs are not as good (the song about hellfire is a questionable choice). There also seems to be some sort of reclaiming going on, changing the characters from the original story enough that they are now heroes and there is a romance.Some might think this is one of the better 90s Disney films. But for me, it falls between the cracks and can probably stay there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know Disney made a lot of changes to the story and characters but I'm happy that they did because it makes it more exciting and action packed. And this film brings back a lot of memories for me. I remember seeing this film in the cinema when I was about 5 or 6. The names "Quasimodo" and "Esmeralda" still sound familiar to me. I remember a lot of scenes like the part where Frollo kills Quasimodo's mother, the part where Quasimodo is being tortured for the public's pleasure, and Frollo falling into the lake of fire. And the way I saw it was that Quasimodo was unhappy for most of the film except when he was around Esmeralda. Frollo is probably the darkest villain of all the Disney villains. I loved the music and songs in this film. I mean at first, I thought I didn't like singing in a film but it looks like I changed my mind. This film should have gotten an Oscar. And I hate how some critics and viewers only gave this movie mixed reviews because of the changes. I remember I used to have a stuffed toy of Quasimodo as the King of Fools and I had McDonald's toys of the three gargoyles. I couldn't believe it was about thirteen years since I saw this film when I watched it on YouTube. I thought I'd never see it again. It was very refreshing to see. And watching this makes me miss being younger and miss the nineties because that was the decade when all the best classic Disney films came out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie! But not for kids.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to watch this movie with my friend at her house, we both being Disney fans. I remembered back when I was very little when I saw the trailer for this movie and I was a little wierded out by it. After seeing this movie, at sixteen years old, it became one of my favorites. It's truly incredible and doesn't get enough praise.When the movie started, I was wowed by the animation. It was so detailed and beautiful! Then I was introduced to Quasimoto, the lone deformed bellringer in the tower of Notre Dame. Yes, he isn't the most handsome character ever, but he is intelligent and has a good heart. As the movie goes on, his character increases in depth and it is very impressive. He's mostly a quite, humble kind of guy, he's tortured by loneliness with only three hilarious gargoyles to keep him company, and he longs to be able to go out and see the world. He also has a dangerous side, too and is very powerful physically and mentally. I've never felt so sorry for a character in my life! He's treated horribly in several scenes by his master, Frollo and the townspeople. Another character I enjoyed was Esmerelda. She's the young gypsy woman that stands up for Quasimoto and becomes friends with him. She is very fun to watch. She's spunky, tough, and not afraid to get her hands dirty. As for Frollo, Quasimoto's "master", he has to be by far the creepiest Disney villain in history. I don't know the original story, but I really liked the plot of this movie. One thing I have to say about the plot, though, it really isn't for little kids. The movie includes the whole gypsy thing, which kids won't understand, as well as many situations that could frighten them. For example, when Quasimoto is in the town during the Fesival of Fools, he is tied down and people begin to throw fruit at him. This particular scene can be quite intense. There are various other situations of this kind. A couple character almost get hanged, but are rescued last minute, and one characters almost gets burned at the stake. This movie has possibly the most chilling, dark, suggestive scenes in Disney history. The villain, Frollo, sings his terrifying song, "Hellfire", which, if you listen closely, talks about his burning lust for Esmerelda. During the course of this song, the background is filled with fire and rows of menacing, red-hooded figures. Definitely not kid-friendly. I was pretty scared, and I'm sixteen. The great thing about this movie is that it takes a lot of risks. Most Disney movies sugar- coat stories to make it kiddie friendly. Not this one, though. It incorporates all the adult themes mentioned earlier, but it works out to be a great film, maybe for those over the age of ten. All in all, great dark story, great plot, great characters, chilling music, and spectacular animation. If you get the chance, rent this movie and watch it. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To summarise, the protagonist hunchback is coerced into hiding in the bell tower of Notre Dame. He toils all day for the people buzzing in the streets below and longs to live amongst them. With the help of his gargoyle friends, he finally plucks up the courage to plunge down to the joyous 'festival for fools'. Yet he is ridiculed when he is dragged on stage by the provocative gypsy Esmeralda.Realising her mistake she stands up and protects him from a jeering crowd. In return, she gains the sanctuary of the church in her coldest, darkest hours. There she sang simply the most beautiful lyrics, 'I ask for nothing, I can get by, but I know some people less fortunate than I...' Teaming up with a soldier, the trio drop their prejudices and compassionately fights a battle against injustice, vanity and shame.The best thing about the film is that it captures the outcasts of society and shows the audience that they too are good people and children of god.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another One Of Disney's Classics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is a wonderful Disney film. It is a classic along with "Beauty and the Beast","The Lion King", and many more. I first saw it in theaters when I was 9 years old. This movie has great animation and I love the songs on it. My favorites are: "A Guy Like You", "Out There", and "The Bells Of Notre Dame".My favorite part of this movie is when Quasimodo meets Esmeralda at the festival of fools. I also love those gargoyles, they're so funny! I also like Esmeralda's pet goat, he's cute.Everyone should see this movie and it deserves 10/10 stars!</fullReview>

No wonder extremist religious leaders did not like it - they all saw a BIG piece of themselves in Frollo. Tom Hulce played Quasimodo to perfection, and I was extremely impressed with both Demi Moore and Kevin Klein.As always, Disney's supporting characters added the perfect touch of humor and relevance, at just the right time.Hunchback remains one of my all-time favorite Disney movies, with Sleeping Beauty and Beauty and the Beast.Favorite line: "Life's not a spectator sport.

		<shortDescription>Strange.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember back when I went to see HUNCHBACK on its opening day. And as I had sat there through the entire opening all the way to where the title flashes up on the screen, I could feel my face staring in shock. My eyes were wide and my jaw was hanging open as I stared with a feeling like I had just been socked in the gut.It had been a mixture of awe, surprise and horror. I was overwhelmed. While one half of me admired the craft and care that had gone into the film, the other was going, "Eisner, what have you DONE??!" (I hear that this film was Eisner's pet project?)HUNCHBACK is a weird film. Easily the darkest animated feature Disney has ever produced, it somehow manages to be both awe-inspiring and repelling, entertaining and unwatchable, daring and calculated, appealing and unappealing all at the same time. Oh yeah, and just to add to the list of contradictions, it also manages to be PG while being officially rated "G".Do I like the film? Not really. Do I hate it? Not really.That's what's so strange about it, the way it inspires such feelings. I'll try to go over them one at a time:"Both awe-inspiring and repelling": There's no denying the artistry here. The visuals, direction, animation and storytelling are all well-done and also for the first time in The New Disney's history we see a fully-successful nararration character (the wonderful Clopin, my personal favourite). But at the same time, the film is so dark and "mature" that it appears that Disney has finally pushed its luck and the audience's traditional trust too far. After POCAHONTAS, which had already tarnished Disney's name, this film was simply too much for parents to take. For pete's sake, I've heard all about how even the animators themselves were nervous about this film (I'll get to the nervousness in a minute), and can one blame them? So by the phrase I mention, I mean that it is at once both a wonderfully-crafted work and at the same time so anti-Disney that Disney lovers everywhere will be repelled."Both entertaining and unwatchable": Sure, there are things to enjoy in this movie. Judge Frollo is an amazingly cold villain, Esmerelda glows with a humanity that outshines her overly-done "sexy" looks, and there are some great lines throughout ("Look at that DISGUSTING display!" "YES, SIR!"). And there's even a couple of songs I like here. But at the same time, the movie makes you oddly uncomfortable as you watch Disney take a daring dive off a cliff into previously unexplored territory, such as the S&amp;M suggestions made by Frollo and all his horrific (and extremely sickening) salivating over Esmerelda. While it can be argued that Disney deserves credit for trying to "up" the animation palette, it's like watching a live high-wire balancing act: it appears to be more of an act of daring than of good judgement. Which leads me to..."Both daring and calculated": Simply put, the movie wants to sweeten its subject matter for a family audience but at the same time it lacks the nerve to cut completely loose from its famous roots. As a result, the film gets incredibly muddled. (For example, there's a garagoyle-sung ode to love here that is completely uncalled for and upsets the movie's dark rhythm: it dances in with a hat and cane in a desperate attempt to soothe the audience by reminding them that they are watching a film from the same folks who brought them BEAUTY AND THE BEAST). And speaking of BEAST, something about this film's overall conception smells of a desperate attempt to go BEAST one step further in an attempt to earn another Best Picture nomination. It's like someone said, "Let's see, BEAST got nominated but didn't win, we need something that will have better chances, something that will make Oscar sit up and take notice. I know! How about this one?" While Disney's tackling this story is a bold move, their handling of it is not. And the artists' own self-consciousness and understandable nervousness shows through the seams here as you see them desperately trying to "cover their tracks" as they go along, simultaneously trying to give Disney fans what they want and to create a mature film for adults. But I don't blame them: this is one story which should have been left enough alone, in my opinion. And I'm certainly glad that *I* don't have this under my belt."Both appealing and unappealing": This probably speaks for itself. The film is appealing in the sense of its trying to present a new stab at Disney entertainment, but at the same time THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is hardly the sort of story that will get families packed into the theatre, Disney name or no. So it floats in a sort of unappealing otherworld, not dark enough to satisfy the original tale's fans but not fun enough to appeal to Disney admirers.And finally..."PG while being officially rated "G": This speaks for itself. I'll just quote my elderly mother, who blindly bought this on the day of its release for the foster children she was taking care of simply because of her lifelong blind trust in the Disney name: "This is NOT a 'G'-rated movie! How can they get AWAY with it??!" After watching it the one time, she literally threw it in the garbage.A strange film indeed. I'm not going to judge, though. I'll just say that I hope the Disney team (and Eisner in particular) all learn from the experience of this film and we'll just leave it at that.(NOTE: I just realized that I'm composing this review on Donald Duck's official birthday date. It seems to bring to light yet another bizarre contradiction: the old Donald Duck cartoons and this film. What a clash. Somehow, the irony of this realization seems to fit in with everything I was just commenting on very well.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's enough place in my heart for Hugo's original work and the Disney version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read that the Disney studios were working on an animated feature based on Victor Hugo's classic work 'Notre Dame de Paris' I decided to buy the novel and read it, for I was curious for the original story. I loved the novel (though I was angered because Hugo treated his protagonist so cruelly). Then I went to see the Disney version,and realising it was vastly different form the novel- in fact, they had taken some themes and key-elements of the original and made up their own story - I loved it too! The reason may be that I'm a buff for Disney animation as well as a lover of classic literature (especially Charles Dickens) and I also know that Disney flicks are often very liberal rendition of the original sources. What springs to mind for instance is Disney's Pinoccio -generally and rightly regarded as an animated masterpiece. But is does 'sugar coat' the story and tones down much of the cruelty, as well as simplifying the plot of the long-winded narration(for instance: in Collodi's original Pinoccio is hanged from a tree among other things)and the original character of the puppeteer Stromboli was quite a reasonable guy.So I could go on and on. Yet, never have I heard any comment like 'Carlo Collodi is turning around in his grave' though similar objection can be raised against D's'Pinoccio' as have been raised time and again against D's HOND. Did you enjoy D's Little Mermaid? Are you sure Hans Christian Andersen would have liked it? How many times did you watch D's Jungle Book? By all accounts it did take little more than the names from the Kipling original. If you can only value faithfull renditions of classical books just don't watch Disney animation (you'll probably hate it anyway). Now the Disney version taken on its own term, it is a intensely dramatic, heartfelt story with only one serious flaw: the comic'relief' of the gargoyles. They are very irritating, as several earlier reviewers have pointed out, and especially in the sequence with the song 'A guy like you', not merely because of the anachronism (note: the in-joke reference to Tom Hulce's role in 'Amadeus' doesn't even work in dubbed versions)but also for the insensitivity they show toward 'Quasi' HOND, unfortunately has been infected with the 'Aladdin virus' which thankfully has worked out by the time Tarzan hit the screen.High point of HOND:Quasimodo rescues Esmeralda from the stake and cries out 'sanctuary'. Even if Victor Hugo would not have liked the rest of the film, this scene would probably have satisfied him.Low Point The "A guy like you" sequence. See comment above.All in all, HOND in my opnion is a good Disney ,though not as perfect as Beauty and the Beast: 8.5Victor Hugo fans, take heart. I do understand your feelings. But note: in 'Serious Business' it is revealed that at the release of D's Hunchback Disney's own publisher Hyperion reprinted the orignal novel, which enjoyed brisk sales. Even if you despise the 'Disney version'it has actively promoted Hugo's work. A blessing in disguise, so tho say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gays relate to brilliant "Hunchback"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney has made a stunning film which anyone who has felt like an outcast can truly relate to. When Quasi sings "Out There" (nice gay connections) it leaves the viewer breathless as he swings from steeple to steeple. When Esmerelda sings "God help the Outcasts," it rings true to the hearts of anyone who has ever felt pushed out. The lyrics read "God help the outcasts, strangers from birth, show them the mercy they can't find on earth..." The animation is absolutely smashing. The special edition laserdisc is worth all of its 89.00 price and more. Another great scene, very adult and perhaps the greatest 5-6 minutes in Disney history: when Frollo lusts for Esmerelda in front of a glowing fire. The scene beautifully flows from a song by Quasi right into Frollo's wrenching guilt-ridden portrayal. It is genuinely spine-tingling. The overall effect of "Hunchback" is not diminished by the new Disney ending. In fact, as Quasi is invited "out there" by the hand of a little girl, the movie delivers a bittersweet moment of personal growth. Come out. COME OUT! The world no longer thinks you are a hideous monster. And so...Quasi does."The Hunchback of Notre Dame," Disney-style, is in my all-time Top Ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, but only to be expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an interview published in 1992 Kirk Wise was asked what he wanted to work on after "Beauty and the Beast". His reply was the obvious one. He said he liked B&amp;B but he wanted to work (with co-director Gary Trousdale) on something very different.Instead Wise and Trousdale were given "The Hunchback of Notre Dame". Does anyone notice the similarity in subject matter? That was the problem: the two men simply couldn't make a film sas sincere and heartfelt as their first, under the circumstances; and so they didn't. In attempting to be more quirky and amusing they simply fell between two stools, missing out on both comedy and tragedy. Ah, well. Their next film will be "Atlantis" - which shows that Disney CAN learn from its mistakes."Hunchback" has to be pulled to pieces, since it really doesn't come together to begin with. It's just good bits and bad bits. A few random pot-shots:Editing was too brisk - for many spectacular shots, we didn't get a good look at anything. The animation of Quasimodo was superb. Ditto Clopin. Esmeralda's "lascivious" dance fell surprisingly flat and was even jerkily animated - it certainly wasn't sexy. The song she sings later is, I hate to say, no more than modern-day Christian guitar music. (Once upon a time Christianity inspired songs like those in Handel's "Messiah". How the mighty have fallen ...) The opening song and the "A Guy Like You" song were nice, and cleverly staged. They didn't belong in the same film, though. The dark and violent slapstick in the final battle was an inspired return to an old genre. The weather changed a bit too often at the mere whim of the directors. Computer animation is not yet ready to handle crowd scenes in the way Wise and Trousdale attempted them. Completely harmless sections were cut from the Australian release in order to secure a "G" rating, which is an outrage. I could go on ...If you're wondering what my comments have to do with each other - well, I wonder the same about the different parts of the film. Actually, MOST of the scenes play well, and most of the film is enjoyable to watch, but to there is no cumulative effect. If I must pass a verdict on the film as a whole it must be, "misfire". So it's back to "Beauty and the Beast" - or forward to "Atlantis".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie for the whole family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of Quasimodo, the bell-ringer of Notre Dame in Paris, who lives hidden because of his deformity and an oppressive tutor, who is also the chief judge of the city. Based on the Victor Hugo's novel, this animated film has direction of Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, a script by Tab Murphy and a competent cast of voice actors led by Demi Moore, Tom Hulce and Tony Jay. The music was done by Alan Menken and was nominated for an Oscar in the correspondent category.We're facing an animated film, of the Disney Studios, probably one of the best of this genre in the nineties. The animations are excellent, in vivid colors that look good on the screen and shining properly, without exaggeration. The script is also good and makes an adaptation, light and well thought out, of the story in the original novel, thought to adult readers and, therefore, very different from the story that this movie brings us, looking to pass simple messages like acceptance of differences of others, courage and honesty in defense of ideals, sincere love "versus" profane love. Religion and faith are also addressed, with the cathedral serving as a symbol of faith and protection, but also hope. The two main characters (Frollo and Quasimodo) were also very well thought: Quasimodo is the living proof of the popular saying "to see a face isn't to see a heart", because his disturbing appearance hides a noble heart and great generosity; Frollo is the complete opposite: its a apparently righteous man occupying a public office that requires moral rectitude, but he has a truly sinister heart, bad character and is totally hypocrite. Undoubtedly one of the best villains that Disney has ever created.The work of the voice actors was very well done and does not deserve negative criticisms. The same can be said of the powerful and profound musical moments. The major exception is the song "A Guy Like You" because it doesn't fit the rest of the film, coming at a point of increasing dramatic tension and cutting it in half. In short, its a great film for the whole family, will please both children and adults and endure in the memory of viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's Dark Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***CONTAINS SPOILERS***The Hunchback of Notre Dame is one of Disney's darkest stories. There are traditional Disney elements to prevent it from being too dark, such as the comedy sidekicks and funny animals. It has a silly show number in the middle that is out of place. The traditional elements actually end up hurting the overall picture. The straight to video sequel goes even further with the traditional elements, making a very much weaker picture. They are a touch of comedy in a serious more adult picture.What sets this one apart from other Disney films is that the movie is more adult in its themes. The film deals with many heavy themes such as, religious fanaticism, sexual desire, racism, and social norms. The songs are mostly serious, not the normal sing-a-long type of Disney song. Hellfire is an amazing serious, dark Disney song. The film does not take place in a beautiful kingdom, but instead in a poverty stricken Paris. Our female lead is not a princess, but a commoner. Our hero is not handsome, and doesn't get the girl. Then there is our villain Frollo.Frollo, in my opinion is Disney's most sinister villain; he makes no jokes, nor is he silly. Frollo brings no comedy to the picture; he is not played as a fool or coward. Frollo is fearsome, and a character that seems very real. Voiced by the late great Tony Jay, Frollo embodies the idea of religious fanaticism. He is so blinded by his beliefs; he does not question any of his beliefs. Frollo is so determined to save his city he that he is willing to first destroy it, he will even attempt destroy Norte Dame. Frollo is beyond the foolish and silly Disney villains (Captian Hook/ King John/ even Cruella DeVille), he is in a class alone. He is a man of hatred and violence that should chill even the oldest viewer. The film is so well made it is sad it is not seen as up to the standards to its fellow Disney pictures of the time. The film is forgotten because it is ugly. Our hero is seen as grotesque, the city is dirty, and many of the scenes are darker in color. But really what makes this film ugly is it deals with the ugliness of humanity. We see the cruelty and violence of man. No other Disney picture deals with such adult themes and darkness. It is a great film that should be seen, don't turn away from the ugliness, but understand it. This is Disney's dark gem, but a gem all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Our main hero is Quasimodo, a supposedly hideous man who has been locked up in the castle by Frollo, whom we'll get to later. One of my problems with this movie is that Quasi is not nearly as hideous as he is portrayed. He's more of an ugly-cute. He's not attractive, especially compared to his costars, but 'the most hideous man in all of France' he is not. But my main problem is that this film professes a moral that it doesn't matter what you look like, yet what's Quasi's reward for being the hero. You and I both know that if he'd been more handsome, he would have gotten the girl (honestly a sexist concept in of itself, but that's for another day), the beautiful Esmeralda. But he doesn't. He merely gets to be accepted by the public and treated like a normal human being. What kind of a reward is that? Esmeralda ends up with the traditional blond, handsome prince, Phoebus, who is so forgettable I had to look up his name before I wrote this review. That's garbage. For all his hardships, Quasi basically gets the 'reward' of being the third wheel.The one bright spot among our cast of heroes is Esmeralda. Besides having a gorgeous name, she's entertaining, energetic, flirty, and cunning. I'm not really sure if she's that different from the other Disney Princesses (yes, I know she's not actually a princess, but Disney plays it fast and loose with the branding; if this movie had been more successful, you bet she would have been there), but she definitely feels different. She feels more experienced, more mature.Honestly, I wouldn't have minded if they took out the Hunchback and her prince and instead made it about her and Frollo, It really wouldn't have been an adaptation of the Hunchback of Notre Dame anymore, but it would have been a more interesting, better-told story than the one we ended up getting.Frollo himself is far and away the highlight of the movie. He's the kind of Disney villain that's scary when you're a kid and downright disturbing when you're an adult. Before I rewatched this one, I thought Scar was far and away the best Disney villain ever. Now I'm not so sure. If you asked me right now, I'd give the edge to Frollo. He may not have killed Mufasa, but he is wondrously, gloriously, terrifyingly insane.In fact, at the moment of writing, I'd even go so far as to call him arguably the best straight-up villain in film. That voice, that outfit, that authoritative, slimy charisma; it's impossible to look away when he's on screen. He steals every scene. He, plus the many, many wonderful shots in the film (including one in which the pattern on the main stained glass window of the Notre Dame is projected onto the ground on which Esmeralda is standing) are what elevate this film above its contemporaries and make it a truly great film and underrated in the massive Disney animated canon. I hope there comes a day when this film is fully able to come out from the shadow of The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast and really, truly stand on its own.For the first act or so, Frollo is just a captivating, impressive villain. Then comes Hellfire. Other than being the best song in the film and one of the best songs in the entire Disney renaissance, other than being partnered with a beautiful visual sequence that, like real destructive fire, is as painful as it is unignorable, it completely reveals Frollo's state of mind. This is his one moment of weakness, and it disgusts him. And what does a man like Frollo do when confronted with his weakness? He wants to destroy it and bring back the stony faade he regularly projects, for that is all a withered, black soul like himself has left.What is his weakness? He wants Esmeralda. And I don't mean he wants her to lock up in his castle or tie up on the train tracks. He wants her in a lustful, sexual, carnal sense. Of course, the film doesn't use those words, but it's as clear as the water on a bright sunny day. To see emotions like this expressed with the lush Disney bigness is as surreal as it is terrifying. Yet there's a certain current of reality to all this that immerses you in his crazy, twisted world.He refuses to accept this thoughts, and thus they go more twisted and perverted. He seeks to snuff them out and so wants to kill her or burn the city down trying. And that's exactly what he does. He burns half of Paris to the ground. We see him torch an individual home with his own hands. He tries to chop off Phoebus' head. And it's fairly clear that if he got Esmeralda alone to do whatever he wanted with her, he'd kill her, but not before raping her first.Yes, this is a G-rated kid's movie.And because of the nature of animation and Disney animation in particular to shape the environments around the emotions of the characters, you feel every bit of what I just described. It's well-done, evocative, and kind of unbelievable.While a mess of a film in some parts, the parts that are good are so good they more than make up for it. This is one of the great Disney Renaissance movies, and I hope Disney gets around to the live-action adaptation. It's truly unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will not lie, its one of few movies that made me cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the heading suggest, this was an epic emotional movie that just knows how to grab you and not let go. I was so impressed by this movie that words can not describe it, but i will try anyways. The animation is gorgeous and a lot of the subject matter profound. Many critics have complained about the talking gargoyles messing up the movie and taking it further away from Hugo's original novel,for me they fit right in with Hugo, who told in his novel that Quasimodo would sit for hours holding solitary converse with the statues. Of course, this was all in his mind, but hello, so are the gargoyles in the movie. No one else ever sees them talking or moving (with the exception of Djali), and they are animated to give Quasimodo some friends, just as he did on his own in the book. Of course, there are many other parts of the movie that are WAY different from the book, but not as many people complain about them, so I won't mention them. The main reason I love this movie is the villain, Frollo, played to perfection by Tony Jay. His sinister atmosphere and lust for Esmeralda are elements of the like we have never seen in any other Disney movie, prior to or after Hunchback. Frollo is decidedly the deepest, and most evil of all Disney villains, and is definitely one of my favorites.The music in this movie is also the best that Disney has ever produced. Though the songs are not as catchy as those found in other memorable Disney movies, they are nonetheless the most powerful. In this movie, we find large-scale choral music in Latin, huge orchestral works, religious themes, and Broadway/Classical style arrangements that put most of the other Disney movies to shame. It truly is magnificent.I definitely recommend this movie to all audiences, and I give it a solid 10/10. This is the Disney movie that deserved an Oscar nomination more than any other, and it is a shame that it has been so underplayed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trust your hunch! You know, it's true! The Hunchback of Notre Dame deserve more praise in the 1990s than it honestly got. Directed by Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale, and based on author, Victor Hugo's 1831 novel of the same name. The plot centers on Quasimodo (Voiced by Tom Hulce), the deformed hunchback bell-ringer of Notre Dame and his struggle to gain acceptance into society. Considered to be one of Disney's darkest animated films due to its narrative exploring mature themes such as infanticide, lust, damnation, genocide, and sin; this film was panned by some critics at the time, for being too scary, violent and adult for young children. To those critics, I have to say, there is nothing wrong with the mature themes. Its movies like these, that really help, grow children into respectful adults. Then, there are those critics who found the huge changes to the source material, somewhat jarring and uneven. A good example of this, is how the movie is now told, through the eyes of Quasimodo, instead of the original novel protagonist, Pierre Gringoire, the poet, whom in this case, isn't even in the film. For those critics, I have to say, Quasimodo has always been the main character, even in other adaptations like the 1923 &amp; 1939's versions. With that, I say the Disney version is my favorite. There's so much heart and passion to his character that you can't help, feel for him, in this ugly duckling type of a story. I know a lot of people hate the gargoyles supporting characters that come with Quasimodo, but I didn't find their presence to be unwatchable. If anything, they serve their purpose, as a way to allow Quasimodo to stress out, his feelings. It made for very entertaining moments. Still, the filmmakers could had cut down, a bit on the comic relief parts in their behalf. If they were any big changes, I didn't like, it was with Captain Phoebus (Voiced by Kevin Kline). I didn't like how he was turn from an antagonist in the original novel into a supporting hero in the film. Don't get me wrong, his character and voice actor was likable; however, I really wasn't digging the romantic sub-plot between the Captain and Esmeralda (Voiced by Demi Moore) as much as I should. After all, I felt like they rarely share any chemistry with each other. If anything, I thought, the movie should had allow Quasimodo to be the one that, Esmeralda fall in love, for. I know, it's a recycle clichs that mirrors other movies, but it shown to work. Honestly, if the filmmakers didn't want that, maybe the movie should had kept it, similar to the book, in which Gringoire end up with her. No matter what, Esmeralda in the film is like the book, somewhat, one dimensional eye candy. Despite that, Moore does a good job in her voice acting. One thing, I have to say, I glad the movie didn't go with, is the original tragic ending of the book. Wow, what a downer. The ending here, is so much better. I don't care if any of these changes, anger the original Hugo's fan-base, because I like how film try to lighten up the source material in order to ensure a G rating. It's not like dark mature themes are missing, from this adaptation, anyways. You still have villainous Claude Frollo (Voiced by Tony Jay). In my opinion, he is one of the best realistic villains, Disney ever put out. I found his scenes with Esmeralda to be, very creepy and well-done. The song, "Hell Fire' isn't just a well-done song, but a powerful monologue that show, how people use religion like a weapon against any who get their way. However, I have mixed feelings about his change from archdeacon to a judge. I know, Disney did this, to avoid any religious sensibilities, but it draws away, some of the main themes from the original story like how the corruption of church and it's uncheck power, need to be put into question. Despite that big change, some people in the Christian right still attack the character. To them, I say, I love the fact, that he's a complex religious man who is torn between "good and evil; chastity and lust". It made for an entertaining watch. It's just kind of a shame that people look at the movie and see it as a lesson against organized religion when it was kind of the opposite, really. It was trying to show the good parts of religion with those within the walls of Notre Dame. A good example is how the priest in the film is humble, gentle, and kind. This movie also had a strong message about the condemnation of abortion, euthanasia, racism, and a moral resistance to genocide. Also, one of the most important narrative in the film is the belief in a loving, forgiving God. With those examples, I really don't understand, why certain Christians hate this film. It's not like the gypsies culture is hating on this film, on how the film portraying them, as a group of nomadic people having to survive, through means like deception and thievery. It just shows the complications of morality. There is no true, good or bad way to live your life. Despite all the changes, the movie has made. It kept most of the grandeur style of the source material. Notre Dame is wonderfully represented here. It just added wonderful music to go with it. A good example is the opening of the film with the intense 'The Bells of the Notre Dame'. Wow, an epic mix of well-drawn animation and music! Overall: This ballsy cartoon is one of the last great Disney Renaissance, hand-drawn animation film; the company ever did. It certain deserve more credit than got, originally. This movie &amp; 2002's direct-to-video sequel is worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful movie in its own way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is astonishing. The animation is great and the protagonists are presented as flawed, yet good people unlike in Disney's earlier movies. I have one bad critique about this movie though. It bugs me that in the end Esmeralda is with Phoebus. I think that sends the wrong message. Esmeralda is a beautiful woman obviously and Phoebus is not bad himself. And that is exactly what you would expect from Disney. In the end beautiful girl always ends with a handsome man. I am not saying that she should have ended with Quasimodo, but I most definitely don't think that she should have ended with Phoebus. Throughout the whole movie we get the message which says that it isn't important what is on outside, but what is on inside and that is exactly what makes Quasimodo a beautiful man. I get the feeling that in the end this moral is denied because Esmeralda ends with Phoebus. Everybody would expect for her to end with a handsome man, but I think that it makes this movie hypocritical a bit. In the end Quasimodo is alone, without true love, although he is praised by the people. So, the ending is the only thing that could have been done better in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's dark masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kind of wish I had been born a decade earlier so that I could have been old enough to go "Disney's adapting WHAT!?" when this film was announced. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is a bleak, depressing, accusing and above all else dark book. And the Happiest Place on Earth wants to make an animated family movie out of that? Gods in heavens above, that most have turned a few heads.And you know what? They pulled it off. This movie reaches the darkness of the original novel. It goes over themes of lust, hatred born when that lust goes unfulfilled, discrimination, imprisonment, abusive child raising, religious zealotry, the vanity of man and the fact that absolute power corrupts absolutely. And yet you can show it to any little child out there. It's that masterfully crafted. Judge Claude Frollo is one of the best villains Disney has ever done, not because of any great power he possesses or because of his inhumanity, but because he is in fact oh so very human. He's the dark mirror, the other side of the coin. But I don't think little kids find him that scary. It's only when seen through the eyes of an adult when his true nature really sinks in.Furthermore, the rest of the characters are also very good, with Esmeralda, the gypsy princess, being perhaps my absolutely favourite Disney heroine. She's everything. Resourceful, independent, kick ass fighter, soulful, wise and smoking hot. The music is also beautiful and this film contains many of my all-time favourites. Hellfire, God Help the Outcasts, The Bells of Notre Dame, all amazing, powerful, soul-chilling songs.Alas, much like our eponymous bellringer, the movie is very much flawed. Half of the time it's everything I could wish for. It's dark, insightful, willing to explore themes Disney has never touched before. But the other half of the time is spent goofing around with the gargoyles, or shoving the message that people can beautiful on the inside down our throats, watering the message and the tone, almost ruining both of them. And the unfortunate fact is that Quasimodo is not that interesting of a character. I get that he has to be in the movie. He is in the title, and everything. But if I'm completely honest, I'd have much rather seen a film between Esmeralda and Frollo, with Quasimodo and Phoebus as the two main side characters perhaps. The story already revolves largely around the lust Frollo feels for Esmeralda, so why not reinforce the fact by making Esmeralda the main character.Nevertheless, even as it is, it's an amazing movie. One of the best Disney has ever made. It could be better and has some major, fundamental problems. But when it works, when what it's telling reaches and sends chills razing down your spine and makes the shadows in the corner grow larger, it's transformative. From the Studio of the Black Mouse, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Disney more for adults that takes risks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one did little for me when I was a kid. With morals like tolerance, loving people for who they are, multiculturalism, forgiveness, love, and friendship, it wasn't as glamorous as the Arabian design and neat little love story in Aladdin with the very funny Robin Williams as Genie. The visuals were very pretty though, the enormous and detailed stone faades and bright festival clothing of the gypsy people.Fast forward to an adult seeing this. What brought me back was that scene where the bad guy was gazing into the fire, dishevelled, struggling while the fire and smoke danced for him. And I'm not the only one.Judge Claude Frollo, a pious, cruel and ruthless man, has strongly sexual feelings for a female character in a Disney film, Esmeralda, and they play this out on screen. They also show him sniffing her hair. Not only that, they have him barricade a family into a house before setting it on fire to find her (not surprising, he implied he was intent on committing genocide and seemed quite at ease in the dungeons of the castle) and tries to have the Captain of the Guard killed and leave him to have a slow drowning death because he refused to do it himself. Then he captures her and puts it to her - either she be with him (presumably as a mistress - a man of his stature unmarried would be very unusual in those days, and she's a gypsy) or she dies. Esmeralda for her part does a dance that seemed to borrow modern elements from questionable places, and while Frollo's behaviour is never to be condoned, he would likely never have seen such a display.Of course, none of these things are particularly self-evident to children who watch this film and for me as a child it went over my head. But really, why this is important is it pushed boundaries Disney probably thought it never would. It is an adaptation of a far gory and less neat source. It creates a villain of which Disney has created few equals to in terms of his depravity. And a connection between two characters that has gone far beyond in adult nature what was done previously and since. Jasmine in Aladdin tried to sexually seduce Jafar to protect Aladdin. This isn't quite as bigger plot element though and doesn't have a musical number. It's what the internet has called "Fresme" (Frollo/Esmeralda), and Disney knows it's a thing. Search for "11- 08-2012 - Esmeralda and Frollo - Disneyland Paris" and see cast members in Euro Disney play it up, with Esmeralda's supposed love Phoebus no-where to be seen and Frollo chasing Esmeralda around and asking her to dance. Dig further and there's pictures of him clutching her, stroking her face, hugging her. Cast Member Esmeralda, by contrast, looks happy while all this is going on. And while nobody would ever expect the Parks Jasmine to dance in a red outfit for Jafar, it's not quite the same for Hunchback. A majority of the fan activity on the internet about this movie is directed at Fresme.This movie has become one of my favourites for the risks it took and the elements it created. It's not very charming unlike a Snow White or a Sleeping Beauty (sans the architecture which is fantastic), and the ending is unsatisfying (from my perspective) but it's like eating a whole tub of icecream in one sitting - wicked but so good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Staying fairly true to the spirit of the original book, the story revolves around a deformed human who lives in the cathedral of Notre Dame. He's looked after by the cold cruel-hearted man known as Judge Claude Frollo. They developed the villain so well that he's number two on my list of best Disney villains. Quasimodo is also perfectly handled being not so much a monster as a normal human being. It also has a pretty good performance from Kevin Kline as Phoebus and Demi Moore as my personal favorite Disney princess, the gypsy Esmeralda. Although this is one of the darkest films Disney has ever done, it doesn't go that far especially considering the wonderful animation and memorable songs like "Topsy Turvy" and "Hellfire". Highly recommended as a family movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story was great, the characters were great, the animation was great, heck even the gargoyle's were great, bringing the right amount of humour to an otherwise dark film. A slight nit-pick I have is that the gargoyles actually fought alongside Quasimodo at the end, but that's such a small flaw that I'll overlook it because it could be interpreted as God himself protecting Notre Dame or even the Cathedral herself acting in self-defense. Quasimodo was a good protagonist, Clopin was as mad as a hatter, Phoebus was a decent guy instead of the womanizing jerk he was in the original story and Esmeralda was beautiful and feisty but not na?ve or stupid, whereas in the original story she was blindly devoted to Phoebus who later betrayed her. But one person stood out among all the characters as the most fascinating man or monster in the film; Frollo.Played by the sadly deceased Tony Jay, who was not only a great voice actor but a magnificent singer, Frollo is probably the greatest villain Disney has ever created. It's rare to find such a complex, three-dimensional bad guy in a Disney movie and the thing about Frollo is that, for all his evil, I can relate to him. He's right when he says the world is cruel and wicked; just look at all the wars and terrorism and natural disasters that happen all over the planet. Hellfire is my favourite Disney song as well as my favourite part of the film. Tony Jay's performance was excellent throughout the film, but Hellfire was his greatest scene and he nailed the madness, fear, anger and confusion Frollo was going through during the song. I listen to Hellfire regularly because I understand how maddening it is to obsess over a woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996): Dir: Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise / Voices: Tom Hulce, Demi Moore, Kevin Kline, Tony Jay, Paul Kandel: Enchanting animation about a deformed individual who lives in isolation under the ruling of Judge Frolo. Quasimodo is forced to live in a bell tower due to his deformity. His mother was murdered and he was brought up on lies. Three gargoyles entertain him but he longs for a day among ordinary people. With encouragement he ventures down to the fair where he encounters gypsy dancer Esmerelda. One flaw in the film is its hypocrisy. In Beauty and the Beast Belle didn't marry the beast until he transformed into a handsome Prince. Knight Phoebus is likable and joins forces with Quasimodo to overthrow Judge Frollo, but it isn't difficult to predict who will win Esmerelda's hand, and that's where the hypocrisy seems to emerge. Directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise with stunning animation. Tom Hulce voices Quasimodo with Demi Moore as Esmerelda, Kevin Kline as Phoebus, Tony Jay as Judge Frollo whom is destine to be overthrown. Paul Kandel provides the voice of Clopin, a mischief minded gypsy who will stand up for his people. With colourful animated characters and adventurous plotting this should appeal to its target audience. Theme of prejudice and treatment of others is what makes the bell worth ringing. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review of Disney's the hunchback of Notre dame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My thoughts on Disney's version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame are like some. I liked it all except for one scene in the film; the humiliation scene with Quasimodo and the music that came along with it. I just thought that was a bit much even for a Disney film. other then that the film was actually really good. I mean look at what the animators did, the scenery, the characters, the backgrounds I mean it was all so breathtaking. the story was OK but again I thought it was a little to dark especially for a Disney movie look at the themes/subjects it tackled-genocide, sin, hell, prejudice, etc. that's a lot for kids to go in watch in theatres. not to say that Disney didn't do a great job at adapting Victor Hugo's 1831 novel into a animated masterpiece because they did, I just wished they stayed a little more close to the original material he wrote instead of taking it in a different direction; minus everyone dying of course. other then that I really have no problems with the film, I Still Have it on VHS. I am hoping that Disney will make a live- action remake of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney tackles religion. That's ... interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the disappointment brought about by Pocahontas, Disney needed to bounce back; and on the surface, a film based on a novel that addressed the corruption of church may not have been the best idea but what they did with it was still decent. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is one of my all time favorite animated films and is one of the most underrated films of the last thirty years.Disney has created a cascade of memorable characters and have still kept aspects of the novel in the film such as Frollo's lust for Esmeralda or Quasimodo saving Esmeralda and shouting "sanctuary" but have added that Disney touch that makes all their films wonderful. Quasimodo himself is likable, the singing by Tom Hulce is average but there is softness to him and a likability that makes him a very sympathetic lead character. Tom Hulce brought to life the greatest Disney villain ever, not only does he do all the horrible things that Disney villains do but he is actually complex; he's not just after money or power as many villains are he is a man who believes that he is fulfilling his religious duties, his death is also one of Disney's best as it symbolizes that Frollo has been condemned to hell (as he dies by burning). Esmeralda and Phoebus are also very likable characters and their romance is believable as it develops over various circumstances. However, I was not a fan of the gargoyles; they were the most obnoxious things ever put on film and did not fit the tone of the story, if they were in Quasimodo's mind it would have been tolerable but in the end they help him fight the guards so they are real and I feel were not necessary.An aspect of the film I also enjoyed was the music. The music was simply to die for, from the truly admirable songs that told the story and reflect on the emotions of the character at that one moment (which is what music of a musical should do) to a score that fit the film's darker tone, with the exception of the very obnoxious musical number sung by the gargoyles. The animation is wonderful and the use of computer animation makes everything else such as the bells seems so much grander.This film is also so unique from other Disney films in other in the sense that it actually touches on issues such as religion and faith and even lust (the main motivation of the film's antagonist). Also, the hero doesn't get the girl, that is one of the many risks that this film takes which shows the extent the writers went to keep some of the tragic aspects of the novel in the film.Ultimately I believe that The Hunchback of Notre Dame is on par with Disney's best and would recommend it as perfect family entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uncoventional Disney Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney didn't produce very memorable films in the mid nineties. The Lion King was arguably their last great film in a streak of big hits. The Hunchback of Notre Dame seems like a curious choice for a Disney film. Subject wise, the themes and story don't lend itself to a "Disney" film. Somehow they were able to explore issues of religious hypocrisy, lust, and mild (but contextual) profanity subtlety and retain a G rating. Nonetheless there are some great characters to see in the film and some plot points are really good. Quasimodo is the best character. His outer appearance contrasts his inner personality. Frollo is easily one of the more sinister villains as he's a self proclaimed man of God that persecutes the Romani people, denies Quasimodo of his freedom, and lusts over Esmeralda. Because of the dark nature of the film, this might not be suitable for younger children. Like all Disney films, there's a lot to enjoy, but this one isn't the most memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was absolutely captivated by 'Beauty and the Beast' but after that the Disney animated films seemed to lack something. I had a lot of admiration for 'Aladdin' but felt that it lacked that tweak that made BATB so captivating. 'The Lion King' very much a kids picture and I was offended by Disney's decision to give Pocahontas the body of a supermodel (the real Pocahontas was about 14).Needless to say I wasn't too keen on the idea that they were working on an adaptation of Victor Hugo's 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'. I read the book sometime ago and it is a book that begins with an abandoned child and ends in death. The movie keeps the first idea but changes the second in a way that doesn't undermine the story.'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' is an exhilarating experience. It never falls into the kiddie movie realm but tries to stay true to its origins. Care and patience was given to each of the visual details making Paris into a bustling city, a noisy place always with the Cathedral of Notre Dame (that's No-trah Dahm) looming in the background.The movie wisely does not soft soap it's opening. We learn the a deformed gypsy child was ripped from the arms of it's mother by Judge Claude Frollo. Thinking it was a creature from Hell he was about to throw it down a well but feeling the saints bearing down upon him he decided to hide the child in the bell tower.Some years pass and we find Quasimoto still holed up in the bell tower. In the street below one day the Festival of Fools is brewing and he slips out of the church for a visit. The freedom of animation allows him to slip and scale the cathedral walls like a monkey, hanging precariously from the dizzy heights and slipping easily to the ground.He is caught up in Festival and is selected King of Fools by the crowd who think he is masked. When he is found out he is a freak he tied up for public humiliation. Esmerelda, a gypsy girl takes pity on Quasimoto and rescues him. In return he gives her sanctuary inside the Cathedral.Quasimoto feels pity for the gypsies and gets involved in a struggle to save them from death at the hands of Frollo's troops. One of them is Phoebus who doesn't agree with Frollo and has fallen in love with Esmerelda. This leads to a series of events in which Quasimoto learns the true nature of his isolation and of his humanity. He is never a forbidding character as Lon Chaney was. We are invited to like his tender personality. Whatever some Disney films lack they rarely ever fall short at giving us a great menacing villain. Here he is Judge Claude Frollo a stern, cold authority figure more concerned with the letter of the law than with justice. His baritone voice is provided by Tony Jaye with a cold, pitiless detachment. This is one of the few Disney villains that is true to his character. He comes with no catchphrases and no joy of his hatred.We are taken in 'Hunchback' to some of the most breathtaking locations that I have ever seen in an animated film. The Festival of Fools is a kaleidoscope of color and whimsy. The Cathedral has a gloomy forbidding Gothic interior of dark shadows and glowering statues. There are breathtaking moments in this film especially in the opening as the camera crawls upwards into the rafters of the bell tower. This is proof of the freedom of animation. This would have cost a fortune in a live action movie but animation gives them the freedom to move effortlessly through the streets of Paris, up into the bell tower and down into the catacombs of the solemn Court of Miracles.The animation here is so fluid and beautiful. At one point Quasimoto swings by a rope out over the crowd in the street and I had goosebumps.'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' is a brilliant achievement, a work of patience and care and the freedom that the writers felt in not trying to sell the story to a kiddie audience. They have found a balance between trying to be faithful to Hugo's work while retaining the grandeur of great animation and making the movie suitable for a family audience. They have succeeded beautifully. 'Hunchback' is a towering achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Disney Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that this film would be considered Disney's second black sheep next to The Black Cauldron. Does that mean it was bad? I personally don't think so.Story: Judge Claude Frollo raises a hunchback named Quasimodo, and convinces him that he is a monster and will never fit in. However a gypsy named Esmeralda convinces him that he's not in any way a monster, and he falls in love with her, but she's in love with the captain of the guard, Phoebus. It is up to all three of them to stop Frollo from wiping out all gypsies. Obviously Disney won't kill off the main heroes, and sugar coat a few things in the book, or is "sugar coat" the right word? This film is one of the darkest Disney had ever done, next to the Black Cauldron, and the villain, Frollo makes it dark and edgy! In my opinion he is THE best part of the film. He does the worst things that even Disney wouldn't allow before: kill a woman, almost drowns her baby, keeps him prisoner in the tower, lies to him about the world, wants to wipe out every gypsy (though Quasimodo and Esmeralda are gypsies), lusts over the gypsy Esmeralda, offering her life for sex, sees her half naked in the fireplace, and all along claims he's doing God's will. Woa! Now that's a lot to take in for a Disney villain! Often Disney villains are just evil, whether it's just for revenge, or just for the sake of being evil. However this villain is not only evil, he tries in vain to convince himself that he's good and tries to save his soul for every mistake he makes. That was a brand new step for a villain! I also love Quasimodo. I always feel sorry for him when he's mistreated and when he doesn't get the girl of his dreams. I also feel sorry for him when he's being abused by Frollo and he doesn't know how awful his father figure is, or what he did to his real mother. He also seems like an innocent child who is unknowingly lost in a cruel, but occasionally friendly, environment - kinda like how I am. I still love that scene where he breaks free of his chains and saves Esmeralda from being burned at the stake. Speaking of which, Esmeralda is also a great character. I love how tender and supportive she is towards Quasimodo, and she also can survive on her own most of the time. Heck, she had to save both Quasimodo and Phoebus from disaster or death. I don't have much to say for the other characters.The songs/music: oh I just love them! The choir makes me emotionally attached to each moment in the film! It always makes me feel like my soul is awake and alert to the moment. I love each of the songs, do I even need to say which one is best? Hellfire is just flat out Awesome, dark, and edgy. The animation, music, and timing are just perfect and make my spine chill.Speaking of animation: it is massive! Every detail of Notre Dame just sticks out! I always feel like I'm in Notre Dame, the village, the Court of Miracles, in the dark night or in the glorious sunlight! Whoever worked on the designs ought to receive an Oscar or two. Everything was just three dimensional, compared to other Disney movies, which is still impressive!I also love that it deals with how life can be both cruel and kind at the same time, and uses the issues of church to unravel that message. Not that it could have been done anywhere else, but the original book showed how hypocritical the church officials were back then. In this film, while it does show hypocrisy, it also manages to show that not all of them were hypocrites (the bishop). I think it is better summed in the scene with the song, "God Help the Outcasts" where Esmeralda prays for hope and help for her people while everyone else prays for themselves only.The only flaw I say this film has aside from not following the book faithfully - though face it, when is Disney going to do that? - is that this film was rated G. Really? Sexual moments shown on screen like half naked women, old man sniffing a young girl's hair, using the word "damn", and other subconscious messages are worth a G rating? It's like rating Pan's Labyrinth G because it has a kid in it. I don't know how it got rated that, but then again I don't think Princess and the Frog should have been rated G either.Aside from that, it was a really great film. The story was three dimensional, the characters were three dimensional, and the animation was three dimensional. I love it a lot and I wish it wasn't so underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A somber one from Disney, but pretty exciting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a somber and somewhat dark full-length feature film from Disney, a tale about deformed bell-ringer Quasimodo, confined in the bell tower of Notre Dame by the cold and heartless Judge Claude Frollo, who finds independence to help his new friend, gypsy dancer Esmeralda, escape the hands of the vicious Frollo.Like The Lion King, it was filmed with what I think is a more mainstream Hollywood approach: serious and some egotistic characters, dramatic and a few disturbing scenes and some adult language like "hell" and "SOB." As a result, it is apparent that you could tell some slapstick comic relief was forced in to lighten up what is otherwise a serious movie.Though the Disney touch is absent, it is an intriguing and suspenseful movie - full of courage, heroism and adventure. Helped by a solid plot, nice music and songs and memorable characters, this film is overall entertaining for the entire audience.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wtf were they smoking when they gave this movie a G rating?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you can probably tell from the summary that this movie isn't really for kids. Yet, I find it to be one of the greatest Disney film of all time. Why? Well for starters Disney took A LOT of risk with this movie. Instead of making it bright, colorful, and family friendly, "Hunchback" is dark, gritty, and surprisingly has a lot of mature themes. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story. It's about a disfigured man named Quasimodo who lives on top of the bell towers of Notre Damme for all his life because according to his master, Claude Frollo, his "kind" is not welcomed in the streets of Paris and therefore he must spend the rest of his life isolated at the bells of Notre Dame. What made this movie so great however is because it defied the laws of Disney. In a sense, it did the same thing Nolan's "Dark Knight" trilogy did, by taking a familiar material and making it darker and thematic. But why do so many people hate "Hunchback"? It did the same thing "the Dark Knight" did, hell it even came out before the "Dark Knight". But why does everyone like the "Dark Knight" but not "Hunchback"? Why is it forgotten? Well, maybe it's because it's a Disney Movie. Maybe people were tired of the way superheroes and needed a change to the traditional campy feel of superhero movies and were happy with the changes that "The Dark Knight" offered. When people watch a Disney movie, they expect a colorful movie that's fit for the family. Not a dark film about a disfigured man that is shunned from society. You expect that from Tim Burton, not Disney. Yet again, being different isn't always bad. I'll admit, I didn't like Hunchback that much as a kid either, and it wasn't until a more recent viewing that I came to respect it. And On top of that, who could forget the most famous aspect of this movie; the villain. To describe Judge Claude Frollo would be impossible for he is far to complex and I wouldn't be able to do him justice. But one things for sure, he's perhaps one of the greatest villain that Disney created. What about the songs? For the most part, the songs were pretty good, great actually. Particularly the opening theme and the villain song. So overall, I say go check it out. It's definitely not for everybody, but if you're looking for something different or if you like a movie with a little dark twist, then you should definitely go see it. Just make sure you don't show your kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victor Hugo's Novel into an animated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1996 adaption of The Hunchback of Notre Dame was one of the best musicals (along with "The Lion King") of all time. Oh sure Its one of those Disney films adapted from a story that ends unhappily, where Disney animation makes the ending all happy for children, where the villain dies and everyone happy with a rainbow appearing (being sarcastic). but still great songs to sing along with and good actors. How I see the film is that some of the characters were quite better than the ones who there shown in the book. The film centers a 20 year old deform bell ringer, named Quasimodo (french for "low Sunday"), of Notre Dame, who grew up living a cold and isolated early life inside the bell tower, and dreams of seeing the outside world, but is told by his evil guardian Judge Claude Frollo (who killed Quasimodo's biological mother when Quasimodo was an infant, due to being a gypsy). During the film Frollo is against Gypsies, in someways make it loosely look like Anti-Semitism, (I'm also a guy whose against Anti-Semitism). If your a fan to Disney or Victor Hugo's books then your in luck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best (and most underrated) Disney cartoon ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must be a movie-going anomaly, because I consider The Disney Studio's animated version of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" the best animated feature ever made. Victor Hugo purists have complained about the movie's liberties (particularly with the comic relief of the three gargoyles, which I admit is a bit of a stretch for sidekicks). And the story, of course, is way too dark for anyone expecting a lighthearted Disney cartoon. But then, perhaps that's part of the point.The movie was directed by Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale. Those names are worth noting because they also directed Disney's "Beauty and the Beast," which was the first-ever animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. Obviously that gave the duo some clout to make pretty much what they wanted. They certainly chose one of the darker stories to animate, and it showed at the box office when it grossed only (only?) $96 million. But it is a story superbly told on all levels.The film's opening scene tells, in song, how the hunchback was stolen from a gypsy by Claude Frollo, an evil judge (changed from a priest in the original story) who has a huge hang-up about gypsies. Frollo sees that the child is physically deformed and intends to drop him down a well, until a priest shames him into keeping the child as his own. He condescendingly names the child "Quasimodo" (meaning half-formed) and keeps him locked in a bell tower where he learns to ring the bells for the city of Paris. And in that first ten minutes, you're thinking: These Disney guys are really serious.From there, the movie introduces Esmeralda (voiced by Demi Moore) and Frollo's troubled officer Phoebus (Kevin Kline), both of whom come to befriend Quasimodo. Yet the movie doesn't go for easy answers, and when the movie (controversially) ends happily, it feels quite earned. Because along the way, Quasimodo certainly needs a friend or two. Voiced by Amadeus's Tom Hulce, he does a song called "Out There" in which Quasimodo expresses his longing to simply get out in the real world one day, and it beautifully lays the groundwork for everything that follows.That song is part of an unjustly overlooked score by Disney vets Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, and it's only one element of the most underrated work you'll find in animation. There's an astounding scene where Frollo privately confesses his lust for Esmeralda, and as G-rated numbers go, it's a pretty hard G. But I found it refreshing that the Disney group was willing to take some chances here, unlike their much safer audience-pleasers, such as the politically correct "Pocahontas." For all of its happy ending, the movie doesn't cop out, either. Quasimodo doesn't get the girl, but he gets something much better--the acceptance he has always craved. Disney movies have offered a lot less palatable messages. And for those who think that a Disney cartoon shouldn't rattle anyone, I say: Remember what happened to Bambi's mom?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful art, powerful music and a plot based on a masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the film on theaters, when I was 4 years old. It's a bit dark for that age, but it was a Disney film, so my parents took me to the screening. I have to say, it left me breathless! Even though it was difficult for me to comprehend the whole story, still I was able to follow the basic plot! And what really enchanted me was the incredibly powerful music! The soundtrack is one of the darkest and most surrounding soundtracks I have ever heard! Disney generally has "high quality" soundtracks, but what makes this different is that it's not meant for children. It's not happy and cheerful, it has something bittersweet and dangerous. And matches with the pictures and story perfectly! The art is beautiful too, and the Notre Dame looks so real! I've read the book twice, but I still find the film enjoyable and full of feelings! It is one of the really great Disney movies (plot-music-art combination) and I think you should watch it as if you didn't know anything about the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think it's decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually just watched this film for the first time, and I am shocked I hadn't seen this film before, and I grew up watching Disney films. I am not going to say this film is bad, because it is not, but I will not say it's one of my favorites either. Anyway, let's talk about the good stuff. Quasimodo is a likable character, and I do like him, but he's actually not my favorite in the film. Esmeralda is a FANTASTIC character. She's very kind, cares for others, and, unlike everyone else, she accepts Quasimodo at first, despite him being ugly on the outside. Plus she becomes his only friend and helps him throughout the film. You may think I'm crazy for saying this, but I think she's the second kindest Disney female character ever. First is Belle. She's amazing, I really like her. One more thing I really like about this film is that when Quasimodo and Esmeralda become friends, you think they would get together at the end of the film. You would also think that since Quasimodo obviously develops feelings for her. WRONG. Instead, her and Phoebus, who starts working for Frollo, get together at the end. That's unpredictable, and I like that. I also like the dark tone of the film, and the music that plays in situations like it. Sure, it's overplayed, but it's really good. OK, now for the not so good. Frollo's a very evil character, and will do what it takes to capture Esmeralda. OK good, I have no problem with that, but then during the Hellfire song, he mentions that he wants her to marry him. When at ANY point in the film did Frollo show that? There's NO buildup! I would let this slide, but Frollo nearly kills her at the end, and gives her the option to either marry him or die. Another problem is the moral. Like I mentioned above, Esmeralda accepted Quasimodo, but pretty much everyone else thought he was an ugly freak. What, is every person in the city supposed to be beautiful? They act like they've never seen an ugly person before! They only accept him at the end because he helped save Paris. So the moral of the story is to laugh at an ugly person, but praise him if he saves the city from destruction. Dumb moral. God made us for a reason. In fact, this movie is partially religious, and mention god at times. Shouldn't they think that God made us for a reason? They're people too, you know. Sorry, I REALLY hate this moral. But I do like the story around it, though. Anyway, I think it's okay, but not one of my favorites. It may be worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's awesome, unique, and risky!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book (same name as the movie title) by Victor Hugo is very depressing. But the Disney movie has a good mix between comedy, sadness, darkness, romance, lust, music, and cuteness (from those gargoyles). I would rather watch the movie than read a 500 and something page book about depressing and sick moments. Was Hugo crazy and have anger management issues when writing this book? Probably What about Disney? They can transform Hugo's work into a Disney MasterpieceDisney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame has some of the best music EVER! The score is unbelievable. I feel like I was in Renaissance France when the songs and score was playing. It's so unique and creative. Props to Alan M! The songs are amazing. If you think the songs are forgettable and lame and too mature, you've probably been in a hole with Lil Wayne or Rihanna singing to you. One of my favorite movie songs is Out There with Quasimodo's part. It just sounds so beautiful and alive. I don't hate anything about the music. It's too flawless.Now onto the characters. The majority of the characters are well developed and understood by the audience. Some are flat white bread like Phoebus (he's not brain-dead like Prince Charming, but he's not heroic and passionate like Flynn Rider and Simba). Frollo, Quasimodo, and Esmeralda are some of the best character I've ever seen out of any movie (Disney and Non Disney). Frollo is filled with these evil characteristics and it makes the viewer think about what Frollo will do with his treatment of Quasimodo or his lust on Esmeralda. Quasimodo is the hunchback bell-ringer who is kind and longs to be part of society. He is one of my favorite male characters and most people can relate to his feeling about being isolated or being put down from anyone. I'm really happy that he got his happy ending! Esmeralda is this gypsy girl that loves to dance and sees people on the inside more than the outside (kind of like Belle). She can seriously kick some ass! Sorry Mulan, but she can knock out more of Frollo's guards than the Hun Army (but she SAVED China so I give her credit). Her personality is amazing and how she accepts Quasimodo is even better.Because it is more mature than The Little Mermaid or Peter Pan or Tangled, your kids or any kid should wait until he/she becomes older or if they understand about discrimination or power or lust. It's an awesome movie, but you might feel skeptical when you first watch this movie (this happened to me so this is who this movie is an 8/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hump on Disney's Shoulders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney was facing with the failure of Pocahontas from the year before, and this wasn't maybe the best choice to go with next. It didn't go over well at the box office to say the least. But in my opinion this has to be one of my favourites. It is by far the darkest Disney has gone, in my opinion at least, with their animated movies. All these adult themes such as lust and sin. But as usual lets start with the good things. The first thing I noticed is how great the animation looked. Just as with The Lion King it felt so grand and big, to a giant scale. It looks great all the time and the buildings, especially Notre Dame all look fantastic and Gothic mingle in with beautiful visuals such as the sun setting across the river. Quasimodo is a very likable character (although his singing voice could use work) and proves himself to the people of Paris in the end. Esmeralda is also pretty likable and designed very well, and Phoebus can be likable at times but it seems like they should have spent more time on his character for him to be really interesting. Frollo is most definitely one of Disney's greatest villains. He is not exactly a priest but he sets out to rid Paris of sin along with the gypsies. But he grows a liking for Esmeralda confusing his sense of justice as he learns how he must have her, which leads to the best song in the movie, "Hellfire" which is also one of my favourite Disney songs. It mixes all the "No no's" in Disney movies such as lust, the church, sense of judgement, and eternal damnation. Also the choir and orchestral parts in this movie always sound so epic and beautiful. But this also brings me to the bad stuff, mostly contained in two things. Except for what I mentioned about the soundtrack already the other songs are very bland and forgettable. The other is the comedy relief, the Gargoyles of Notre Dame, I just don't find them funny except for a few chuckles here and there and the movie could have done without them, and that's sad since Jason Alexander voiced one of them and he's normally quite hilarious. So in the end I found this movie even a better watch now then when I was young. Its one of the best and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unconventional Disney Winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's clear that The Hunchback Of Notre Dame is a Disney film. Many of the key components for a Disney film are here. However, there are some shockingly un-Disney like elements here. And while I wouldn't want all Disney films to be like The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, this is a very nice change of pace. Frollo, a powerful king and a religious man is in charge of taking care of an ugly hunchback named Quasimodo in order to be forgiven of his sins, specifically, an act of murder. Quasimodo is in charge of ringing the bells in the chapel. But Quasimodo wants to be free, yet Frollo doesn't allow it. When Quasimodo finally does manage to escape briefly, he gets into a bit of a mess, but it helped by a rebellious gypsy named Esmerelda. Frollo, however, is obsessed with doing away with the gypsies, but Quasimodo is determined to help the gypsies which throws his life into chaos. The Hunchback Of Notre Dame has all the Disney staples: Songs, humorous side characters, romance, Alan Menken score, and a happy ending. But Disney has tweaked the formula a bit, this time around. The Hunchback Of Notre Dame is significantly darker than most other Disney films. While Disney clearly tries hard not to over do it, there are a lot of intensely dark scenes. Depending on your point of view, this could be a bad or good thing. Personally, I think the level of darkness here really works, even if it may be a bit much for younger kids. One slightly disappointing thing about The Hunchback Of Notre Dame was it's humor. While there are many attempts at humor throughout the movie, I didn't laugh a whole lot. This isn't because the jokes are dumb, they're just, well, not that funny. They seem mostly more geared to the younger audience. Rarely have I seen a film with so many songs. I'd like to say there's about 10 songs in the film (though some are just reprises). So it's a shame that the songs aren't very good. In fact, many of them are more like poems as opposed to songs. Many don't have a chorus, and they exist primarily to movie the story along. The songs are in great number, but they just aren't very memorable. There are two decent songs in the film, though. One is the main theme; "The Bells of Notre Dame," and "Topsy Turvy" which wouldn't be nearly as special without the visuals. And speaking of the visuals, they are stupendous. I feel like I'm always gushing about how great the visuals are when I review Disney films, and even though I always expect great visuals, I'm always impressed every time. And this is no exception. The voices are a bit of a mixed bag. Tom Hulce has a less than stellar singing voice, but when he's not singing, he brings emotion and sympathy to Quasimodo. Demi Moore does well as Esmerelda, but there's nothing incredibly impressive here. By far the most impressive voice talent here, is that of Tony Jay as Frollo. Frollo delivers a lot of intense lines and musical numbers that Jay nails. Though I've never been all that impressed with Alan Menken's scores, he really nails this one. With heavy emphasis on bells and choir, Menken delivers a grand and spectacular score to The Hunchback Of Notre Dame. While lacking in humor and memorable songs, The Hunchback Of Notre Dame is a solid piece of work. Dark themes, a memorable villain, a winning score and jaw dropping visuals makes this a welcome addition to the Disney canon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We watched it again with our 9 year old daughter and it was just as good as I remember.I noted many comments that this is a "dark" movie - and it is. If you have little kids (2-5) then this might be too much for them. However, for those older there are many great elements to this movie. The music is also great. It's big and powerful and, yes, dark at times. The lighter songs are also good. This is one of the few movies that I have ever bought the soundtrack for. If you're looking for pop songs, then you might be disappointed, however. The best songs are orchestral and operatic.The animations also holds up, despite being 16 years old. It's not Pixar level stuff, but it's awesome 2D CGI. It's also a good reminder that no matter how "cutting edge" a movie's technology is, that tech will eventually be dated so the movie needs to stand on other merits, like story and acting. Fortunately, this movie has plenty to both areas. The voice talent is excellent and at no time does the story drag.This movie isn't as popular as some Disney movies, probably because you shouldn't let the smaller kids see it. But once they get a little older you should!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney at its Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is my favourite Disney movie of all time. Dark, beautiful, heartfelt, heartbreaking and triumphant, The Hunchback of Notre Dame takes Victor Hugo's classic novel and makes it fit the Disney Musical mold without sacrificing any of the thematic depth.When the powerful zealot, Judge Claude Frollo, accidentally kills a young gypsy woman, his only concern is sending her deformed baby "back to Hell where it belongs". The Archdeacon of Notre Dame convinces Frollo to not only spare the child, but to raise it as penance for killing its mother. Frollo agrees on the condition that the baby live in Notre Dame's bell tower. 20 years later, the baby -- now a young man named Quasimodo -- is the cathedral's designated bell-ringer. When he finally gets his chance to spend a day among the Parisians he has watched from the tower his whole life, he finds them to be less than accepting of his grotesque appearance. The only person who shows him any kindness is Esmeralda, a gypsy girl whose impertinence in the face of Frollo makes her a wanted woman. Desperate to meet the new girl of his dreams, Quasimodo helps Esmeralda escape Notre Dame where she is essentially held prisoner by the guards waiting outside to capture her. Meanwhile, Frollo's inner demons are stirring, and Quasimodo finds himself trapped between love and his devotion to his master as a maniacal manhunt for the beautiful gypsy threatens to burn Paris to the ground.I have been watching this film since I was two years old, but it took me years to fully grasp all the subtext and complicated themes that are woven through it. A warning to parents with young children -- this IS a very, *very* dark film, full of attempted murder, successful murder, sexual frustration, emotional abuse, off-screen torture, etc. That being said, the movie is also very beautiful, and I'm not just talking about the animation. The film is very emotionally driven; the plot, the characters, the animation, the voice acting, everything rides on a wave of pure emotion from start to finish, and you are taken along for the ride. Scenes like Esmeralda's singing of "God Help the Outcasts" bring a tear to my eye every time -- Frollo's descent into madness is genuinely frightening -- and Quasimodo's declaration of "SANCTUARY!" is enough to make any heart soar.The score itself is brilliant, and carries the film, in my opinion. If I just listened to the music, I would get the same emotional impact as if I watched the film. The instrumental pieces are dramatic and heart-pounding (the "opera chorus" in the background is actually singing in Latin!), and the songs are a thousand times better than anything else Disney has ever done. They range in tone from the operatic and dramatic "Bells of Notre Dame" to the gentle prayer that is "God Help the Outcasts"; from the fun yet sinister "Court of Miracles" to the kid-friendly brevity of "Topsy Turvy". The piece "Heaven's Light" is masterfully juxtaposed with "Hellfire", the former being Quasimodo's declaration of his love for Esmeralda, and the latter being Frollo's confession of his "sinful" lust for her.Well, there are only so many ways I can tell you that this movie is fantastic. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is truly Disney's greatest film, bringing together both the dark drama of Hugo's novel and the upbeat brilliance of the Disney Renaissance to create a wonderful piece of animation. If nothing else, it's a great introduction to Hugo's work (Notre Dame de Paris -- the original title -- is one of my favourite books of all time). In fact, there is one thing that I think this movie has been able to do that no other film adaptation of The Hunchback has; in the novel, Hugo states that when Quasimodo claims sanctuary for Esmeralda, he truly becomes beautiful... and in this movie, he truly does.10/10</fullReview>

The only thing I did not like after hearing it all the time during the film, is the racism/bigotry (that's another word for prejudice) against the gypsies, and I hate that - racism and prejudice.

		<fullReview>How can someone turn Victor Hugo's classic dark novel Notre Dame De Paris into a Disney movie for kids? Basically, it all in fact comes from the magic of Disney. They somehow, just made it work. Although the dark parts in the novel have obviously been trimmed down for the film, there's still some present.The bell ringer of Notre Dame, Quasimodo, is psychologically manipulated into staying put in the cathedral by his evil master Frollo, but longs to be part of the outside world and for people to see past his ugliness and deformation. Esmeralda is the first to do it, as she is also a victim of hate in the outside world, being suspected and later tried for witchcraft.It's a mesmerizing adaptation even though there are a few inaccuracies. The fact that it deals with social realism, which was what Hugo put in nearly all of his famous novels and poems, makes it a real treat for both kids and adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great and dark take on the Victor Hugo novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1831, Victor Hugo made a novel titled, "The Hunchback Of Notre Dame". The story is about a deformed bell-ringer that meet's and falls in love with a Gypsy woman. Much to his caretakers dismay.In 1996, Disney released an animated adaptation of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame".This was a great adaptation. The film had some great animation and it really fits well with the dark setting. The song's were good including, "Out There", "Hellfire", and "A Guy Like You". The voice acting was also good.The only problem I have with this movie is that they had to take out some of the character's and part's from the book.Overall, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", is a great animated film and even though it dosen't stay 100 percent true to the book, it's still a great animated film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 2nd favorite Disney Movie of all time (My favorite now is 'Beauty and the Beast')</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid, I used to watch this movie all the time with my family. Now you might call me crazy, but I actually didn't think this was a dark and intense animated film, maybe because I don't get scare that easily while watching movies. But what made me watch this movie over and over again were all the amazing songs and characters. My favorite song is Out There, because it is a song that I sometimes feel like singing when I want to spend one day at a new place in my life. And my favorite character is Quasimodo (the Hunchback of Notre Dame), because he really does resemble me on the inside when he is nice, innocent, and brave in the movie. If you seen the Siskel &amp; Ebert review of this movie, they said this was the best Disney movie since 'Beauty and the Beast', because they felt the same way I feel about this movie. And the songs called Bells of Notre Dame, Out There, and God Help the Gospels made it to the top 100 Disney songs of all time. If you like Disney and things related to the Hunchback of Notre Dame, this is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated. Such a pity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful. The greatest of the traditionally animated Disney films in my opinion. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is the boldest Disney has ever gotten. This film gets dark, and touches upon some very serious themes a children's film, Rated G at that. Prejudice, manipulation, lust, religion, damnation, corruption, ignorance, but also faith, determination, strength of heart and acceptance. ...Damn.The Hunchback of Notre Dame is of course an adaptation of the novel of the same name (in the US, in France known as Notre-Dame de Paris ["Our Lady of Paris"]). What's surprising about this film is how such an adult novel was re-imagined for a mass audience, particularly geared towards children. It does it's work flawlessly. For one, to agree with the late Gene Siskel, introducing Quasimodo to said audience and softening his features so he is clearly disfigured but not frightening must has been a tough task for the artists. The end result is admirable.Second, following the source material albeit censoring it for younger viewers yes, but also keeping it solid and enjoyable to adults as well. Children will sympathize with Quasimodo's abuse and will root for him to be accepted by society just as they have while watching.Thirdly and fourthly, making Notre Dame as believable as the stunning architecture is in actuality as well as not having songs in the film just for the sake of having them (e.g. The Princess and the Frog). Hellfire and God Help The Outcasts are both nothing less than spectacular. The details on the church are fantastic, and the songs touch upon the themes mentioned before, and only strengthen the conflict and drama, particularly the dark soliloquy by Claude Frollo (the main antagonist), Hellfire. This gives Frollo a great depth to his presentation, written well, and voiced by the late and wonderful Tony Jay.Finally, having a great cast that leave their marks on each of their individual roles, not to mention having an absolutely memorable and triumphant score that adds to the already heavy weight that even Atlas would struggle with.The Hunchback of Notre Dame has great characters, an intimidating and frightfully realistic villain and themes to add to it. The story is dark, but still throws something playful at you to keep it from feeling dismal, and keep its key demographic interested. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a representation of the struggle and controversy between religion and the hypocritical interpretation of good an evil in an execution enjoyable to adults and children alike even if they do not understand the entire spectacle. Others say Spirited Away, I say The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that continues to move me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this film when I was in grade school, and back then I thought it was a dark but stirring Disney film. I thought that I would be disenchanted with this movie after I read Victor Hugo's novel. However I find it better to treat the novel and this film as two rather different stories in order to better appreciate them.The thing that really moves this adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame is the music. I consider this to be among the most heartfelt and emotionally powerful Disney soundtracks ever written. Everything from Quasimodo's longing to be part of the world, to Esmeralda and Clopin's lives as gypsies, and especially Frollo's struggling with various temptations is rendered beautifully through song. The awesome animation and witty dialogue are also treats in this feature.Even after so many years, this Disney film still ranks as one of my all-time favorites. I wouldn't advise this film to be shown to very young children because of the darkness of the subject matter, but I think it's a must for anyone interested in the Disney canon. Or life for that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Darkest Disney Film in Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look back on the classic Walt Disney films from the Golden Age (1937-1942), you'll notice that these films were not afraid of being dark or even downright horrifying. No matter how many charges Disney got from parents, the company didn't listen to them. Flash forward to the 1990s, where political correctness was causing Disney executives to tone down the films. "Beauty and the Beast", "Aladdin" and "The Lion King", great films they are, but they are inferior to the level of quality set by Walt in his first five classics.Thankfully, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" tries to come closer to the classic Disney films and it actually goes into levels of darkness that seemed unthinkable at the time. In the film, you have a deformed main character who is treated horribly. The villain is a bigot who is also perverted and murderous. The dramatic scenes are as effective as ever.It's almost perfect, except for a couple flaws. Disney executives began to have their say after "The Lion King". In a way to pander to children who would usually be bored with the film, three comic gargoyles are thrown in for relief from the drama. It makes the film uneven at times. The gargoyles are sometimes funny ("Eh, go scare a nun!"), and sometimes they're flat out unfunny.The film boasts a great selection of songs. "Hellfire" is indeed one of Disney's darkest and most frightening moments. "Festival of Fools" is a colorful extravaganza of laughter and antics. "God Help the Outcasts" is an emotional moment. "The Bells of Notre Dame" is a spectacular introduction to the film. The only weak song is "A Guy Like You", obviously thrown in to please children when the story is reaching its dramatic heights.The film works on several levels, and it has the guts to be dark and frightening. Some parts are even downright violent by Disney standards. How it got a G rating is beyond me (there were edits done to the "Hellfire" scene because the MPAA suggested revisions), yet a lot juvenile animated films get a PG rating for crude humor. Well, the problem is, many might think the G-rating equaled "just for kids", thus legendary Disney animation gets the "kid's stuff" stereotype.In terms of character development, "Hunchback" is strong. The villain, Judge Claude Frollo, is hateful towards gypsies, but yet he lusts over Esmerelda. In the "Hellfire" scene, he realizes that he himself is going against his beliefs. Very powerful scene. Frollo's religious hypocrisy might even be stab at modern religious hypocrisy. Like Dumbo, Quasimodo is an outcast that you care about, and the animators altered his appearance to make him not so hideous. But he still has a deformed figure, but yet the animators succeed in making him appealing. There's a scene between Quasi and Esmerelda where they talk about being outcasts, and it's rather emotional. The animation is great. After "The Lion King", the Disney animators were no longer rushed to complete films (see "The Little Mermaid", "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin") to meet the release date. The animation is great, especially the character animation, along with the great use of computer animation. It ranks up there with "The Lion King", "Tarzan" and the Golden Age Disney films as one of the best-looking animated films.However, the film seems to be more of a remake of the 1939 film adaptation, rather than the Victor Hugo's novel. Several shots and scenes resemble the 1939 film adaptation (an excellent film by the way) and the film comes off as a bit unoriginal in terms of the production. Otherwise, Disney did a fine production. It divides split opinions among literary critics, animation fans and film fans. It may take several liberties with the book, but it's a fine film that has a fair share of flaws.A 9.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice Disney film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's animated film "the Hunchback of Notre Dame" is my first experience with Victor Hugo's story. I saw this film first time back in the 1996 while being eight years old and the film did impress me greatly. Seeing the opening song "Bells of Notre Dame" on a huge screen is one of the best movie experiences I've had. Since then I've seen the film few times again and although it's not as great as the directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise's previous project "Beauty and the Beast", it still remains as a very good Disney film.I can imagine the difficulty writers have gone through to transform Hugo's dark tragedy to a film that would keep the essence of the book but also be suitable for the children. In many parts they have obviously used the 1939 Charles Laughton film as an inspiration. In the end the film does include all the most famous scenes of Hugo's book like the Feast of Fools, Court of Miracles, the invasion to Notre Dame, Esmeralda's saving from the execution, the nearly fatal stabbing of Phoebus (though in different circumstances than in the book) and other things.Beside the story becoming more comfortable for children, characters themselves also have gone through changes. Quasimodo is not as bitter towards rest of the world as in the book, Frollo has become judge instead of priest (like in 1939 film) and apart of few scenes appears to be nearly pure evil character. Esmeralda is more mature here than in the book. I don't really understand why so since Disney has used young girls as their heroines before, I can only guess they didn't want an old guy like Frollo lust after a girl. The biggest problem I have with the story is making Phoebus the hero. I know this was done back in 1923 also, but in the book Phoebus was certainly no hero. Why not use Gringoire again like in other movies? Or better yet, why not make a film where Esmeralda would have accepted Quasimodo? Wouldn't the theme of loving people for who they are and not what they look like be perfect for Disney? Visually and technically the film is a feast for eyes. Animation is constantly moving and colorful, and very detailed works of Notre Dame is superb to watch. Also a great thing about this film is music and songs by Alan Menken. Along with the opening song "Bells of Notre Dame" another memorable ones are Esmeralda's beautiful "God Help the Outcast" and Frollo's "Hellfire", which is one of the darkest scenes in Disney history. From voice actors Tom Hulce as Quasimodo, late Tony Jay as Frollo and Paul Kandel as Clopin all provide great voices for their characters and they even sang their own songs.So Disney's take on "Hunchback of Notre Dame" may not be in the list of top 5 greatest Disney movies, but it is wonderful animation to watch and certainly a good way to introduce Victor Hugo's story to kids. Just prepare an explanation for them when they ask "why did Frollo sniff Esmeralda's hair?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though not a close adaptation of the book, for what it is, it's a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many years of not having seen this movie since I was a kid, I decided to watch this again.Now I have been called a purist, and to certain extent I guess I am. When I was first saw the movie, I had never read the book, had seen only one other filmed interpretation of the novel (that being an episode of Wishbone), and only had a vague idea of who Victor Hugo was. At the time, I really enjoyed the movie (I remember distinctly my dad, who's more of a purist than me and who absolutely love Victor Hugo's works, getting really mad at it). Several years have passed since then, in which I have read the book, a comic book version, and seen several other movies which it is based upon. So what my opinion now? Well, actually, I still like this version. Granted, this is not my favorite film version, of the book. However, this one still has its effects on me.First off, I have to say that the visuals to this film are stunning. The animation, colors, character designs, and, especially, the sets are beautifully done. It's probably one of the best things about the film. The songs are good but, for me, a bit of a mixed bag. Some are much more memorable than others. Personally, I think the best were "The Bells of Notredame". "God Help the Outcasts", and "Hellfire." Many of the other were a little on the less memorable side.Now for the story. Because Disney, of course, supplies family entertainment, and tries to make pretty much everything as family friendly as possible, the story and characters were changed a lot from the novel. Many of the ideas Hugo was trying to demonstrate in his novel are gone in this version. Though I think this is a shame, because a lot of the original novel's feel and deeper meaning is lost. However, this does not completely destroy the movie. Since this is more of a kid's movie (or tries to be), many of the themes would be lost on a younger audience. But, the good thing about the film is that it displays it's own messages; discrimination towards specific groups of people and justice. There is also underlying bits about lust, that if you're old enough to understand, you will catch onto, but, once again, for a younger audience, it will mostly go over a kid's head (I know it did for me). The tone over all is much lighter as well. Personally I prefer the dark feel of the novel, but for it's purposes, I see why it was changed. The nice thing though, is that the movie is not so light that it is sweet and sugary. In fact, this is probably Disney's darkest movie.I want to also touch quickly upon the characters. They were, of course, all changed in some way or other from their original incarnations. These changes weren't too bad. Though I think Frollo in the book was much more complex and interesting, he is definitely good here. In fact, I think he's one of the better Disney villain, and probably the best villain of the newer movies. One thing that did bug me, was the addition of the gargoyle characters. They were pretty much there for some sorta of humorous entertainment for kids. But for me, an older person watching this, they came off as annoying.Overall, even with the major changes, I'd have to say this, for what it is, is a fairly good adaptation of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and worth checking out. But, if you're looking for the really close adaptation of the book, it's not a close interpretation of the novel. I'd suggest this for a little bit older kids, since it's a little darker and younger children might not understand any of the themes presented here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's most enchanting and spectacular films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hunchback" is definitively one of Disney best and most underrated films. It's a truly enchanting and captivating film that have become my personally Disney favorites of the 90's, along with "The Lion King" and "Pocahontas". It's a shame that it didn't earned better at the Box office, although we can be relieved that at least it did 100 $ dollars.The most remarkable with "Hunchback" is the animation. Although Disney often had their film good-looking, they never had a film as stunning as "Hunchback". I remember during seeing this film on theaters in 1996 I was so impressed, I've never before seen an cartoon looking so real, like it could almost (just almost) be a live action film. Art director David Goetz did a amazingly good job by handling the light and darkness in the film. Truly impressive.Another good thing with "Hunchback" is the protagonist: For the first time Disney is telling a story about an human guy who doesn't look a like a handsome prince and, ironically, has problems who lies in his interior rather than his exterior.The characters are also a big strength; Quasimodo is a kind and nice guy that immediately reaches your affection, Esmeralda is feisty and strong and definitively one of Disney's most sexiest females. Phoebus is a likable and funny guy and Djali is an enjoyable animal sidekick. I know many people have problems with the gargoyles, but they didn't bother me, although I don't like them neither. But they do what they're supposed to do: entertaining the kids.Although I liked 1995's "Pocahontas", "Hunchback" had the things that "Pocahontas" missed: more action sequences, more intensity and a more interesting villain. Frollo is one of Disney's most complex and evil bad guys ever, brilliantly voiced by Tony Jay.The songs might not be Disney's most memorable tunes, but are still great on their own merits: "Bells of Notre Dame" is an breathtaking and chilling song, "Out There" is an powerful "I want" solo, while "God Help the Outcast" is a beautiful ballad and so is "Heavens Light" (and it's reprise). "Hellfire" is an dark and engaging song, while "Topsy Turvy" is catchy in it's own merits. I have nothing against "A Guy Like You", but I don't like it either. The only song that doesn't give me anything is "The Court of Miracles".As good as "Hunchback" is, it still suffers some problems. The tone and the context is more darker that you expect from Disney and the film becomes too intense at times (and I'm not talking about the issue between Frollo and Esmeralda). Most to blame is the MPAA for not giving the movie a higher rating. How your kid is gonna respond to the movie, is individually.The contrast between comedy and drama becomes too huge and that's why some of the humor becomes silly, especially in form of some guards, who could have been excellent villain sidekicks, but unfortunately it was decided to make them funny, which they're not! Still, "Hunchback" is one of Disney's greatest achievement and one of the best films from 1996. It was a moving story that touched me emotionally. Although Disney of course have changed some things from Victor Hugo's novel, the essence of the story is still presented on this film, like only Disney does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a few quick comments about the film from a passionate Disney fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has become one of my favourite Disney films. While not within the top three, it definitely is within the top five. The plot is a sweet story about accepting yourself for you are and accepting others for they are, regardless of physical appearances.The artwork is absolutely brilliant, as it was created before Disney incorporated the use of computers to do all the art for them. The shots of Notre Dame are gorgeous and accurate.The characters are all defined and you can easily tell them apart. The Gypsy Clopin, as the narrator is a brilliant character who often has a little hand puppet of himself to help him tell the story. Which adds a bit of comedy to his character, who is already an amusing one to begin with. The other Gypsies are all different characters in themselves, and none look the same as any others.The soldiers, on the other hand, are all very similar to each other, letting Captain Phoebus stand out among them.Frollo is the villain and he is portrayed very well as a villain who doesn't see himself as one.Quasimodo, the hero, is a sweet character who has hidden himself away from the world in the bell tower of Notre Dame cathedral. He, and his three gargoyle friends, Victor, Hugo and Laverne, watch the city of Paris from their sanctuary until one year at the Feast of Fools Festival, when the gargoyles convince Quasimodo to go join the festival. Then their world turned itself upside down and inside out.From there, you'll have to be the judge once you watch it for yourself. I highly recommend it to anyone willing to watch it. The music is amazing and the artwork stunning. It is a true example of Disney masterpieces. Trust me on this.</fullReview>

And really for a Disney movie its probably one of the most darkest ones. The villian is probably the most unique one in Disney history, touching on adult themes like lust. But really the best part of this movie is the music, they really went all out, i actually own the soundtrack and listening to it still moves me to this day. Recomend this movie above all other disney films. I never have seen the sequel because i dont want it to spoil my fond memories of the original but really im surprised that its probably the most overlooked of all the disney classics.

The movie is wonderful watching with great sound and brilliant animations, the biggest problem is though with this movie, is that it has simply got too many songs. The interest for the story dissapears behind all the songs being performed by different characters and this gets too much.Visually great but the movie is too long, and too depressive and serious in the length.

		<fullReview>This is an underated classic, and some critics agree. Roger Ebert gave it Four Stars, which is the highest they'd give. Off course it's a flawed masterpiece, considering those idiotic singing gargoyles.But the songs (except the one sung by the gargoyles) are brilliant (if you listen to the words), the score is brilliant, the animation WOW! And it has a spiritual side. True faith vs corrupted faith. Esmeralda, the gyspy, in her song "God Bless the Outcasts" attains a simple faith while Frollo (Frodo? hahaha) thinks himself perfect. The words of the afore mentioned song strikes upon one of the principle of Christianity; Christ was an outcast.Despite the spiritual side, it goes more for a humanistic message that is in itself an important one.But this is Disney at it's darkest so I don't think very young children should watch this. It might upset them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quasi meets the Mouse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the release of Disney's take on "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," Victor Hugo no doubt flipped in his crypt. While the story lends itself well to song and spectacle, both of which are abundant here, the novel is just too sad to pass through the Disney prism unreformed. Gone is all reference to Quasimodo's deafness. Gone is the poet/playwright; much of his role is commandeered by Phoebus. A vain, shallow jerk in the original, who thinks Esmerelda is a piece of a$$, Phoebus, in Diz, becomes the romantic hero, if something of a jock. (He also has an inclination to pun, as when he commands his horse, "Achilles! Heel!" -- or when, regarding Esmerelda's goat, he says, "I didn't know you had a kid.") And, of course, both Esmerelda and the reconstructed Phoebus survive in the Diz version; in the novel, Frollo murders Phoebus and successfully frames the girl, who is executed for it. (So a Diz movie has a happy ending. Don't try to tell me that's a spoiler.)The unspeakably sad conclusion of the novel is supplanted by cartoon Quasi's emergence into the sunlight, at Esmerelda's urging, to be hailed as the toast of Paris. The theme, fortunately, isn't so much the hackneyed lesson to "accept people no matter how they look," and more the question of what makes a monster and what makes a man (i.e., a retread of the core concern of the Diz "Beauty and the Beast"). Still, when Mel Brooks finally gave Frankenstein's monster a long-overdue happy ending, at least he had the sense to do it in the context of a satire. Then again, there ARE those gargoyles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>on the trouble with being Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the problem: In this country, animation is stigmatized as children's entertainment to begin with. Animated films that have aimed for an older audience (Titan A.E. and Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" come to mind) have categorically failed at the box office, or have been jammed into art houses. If a studio has its eye on money-making at all, they often insist that these films are toned down to appeal to kids (we saw this happen with Dreamworks' The Road to El Dorado).At the same time, Walt Disney established himself from the very beginning as a peddler of innocuous family entertainment, and so the Disney company is saddled with the expectations of everyone (who in general want to see them remake The Little Mermaid over and over).Then again, Disney had gotten a taste for Oscar nominations, and weren't going to give up. This has been blamed for the "adultness" of this movie. It has some of the most graphic sex and violence I've seen in an American animated movie (Fritz the Cat notwithstanding). People are crushed under catapults and boiled in oil. The villain sings an ode to lust and the heroine is shown dressing and pole-dancing. All of this *MIGHT* have been acceptable, had this movie been obviously intended for adults.HOWEVER--Disney has a habit of ensuring every film is as cute and marketable as possible. Merchandising--that's where the real money is. Here they have forced in a romance between two beautiful people because this way they can sell some fashion dolls. In addition, they've played up the goat for cuteness, but the most bizarre and completely unexplainable part of this movie are THREE CUTE, TALKING GARGOYLES! (Too be fair, they're actually grotesques.) They are completely out-of-place, and even if the rest of the movie was cute, they still wouldn't make sense. The song they sing ("A Guy Like You") is terrible, pointless and annoying.All of this would still be OK, if it weren't for the tiny annoyance that the movie has no plot or character development at all. I found myself sitting in the theater wondering "Is this build up? Was that the climax? Is the movie over yet?" The fashion doll romance is impossible to believe, and the two characters are forced to utter the disturbing bad pair of lines "The arrow almost pierced your heart." "I'm not so sure it didn't." Please.There's nothing inherently wrong with making an obvious Oscar bid by forcing "adult" themes into the movie, but these are no substitute for plot. And talking gargoyles are just weird.History has shown that every time any movie tries to be all things to all people, it fails at being anything. This film is just one of a million examples.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My best friend Carolyn ranted and raved about this film, and I always said I liked Sleeping Beauty and nothing could surpass it. Well, out of curiousity I listened to some music (randomly) on a music downloading service. I was hooked with the first notes of The Bells of Notre Dame, and determined that I would someday see this movie. Well with its rerelease I bought it, and was spellbound. I just can't believe the guts the Disney execs had to pull it off. When I first heard about it, I, like many of the reviewers, thought, "What are they thinking?" but it took seeing the film (rather, hearing the music first) to appreciate it. That said, here's a bit about why this film deserves some respect: SOME SPOILERSPoor Walt must have been rolling in his grave when he heard his execs even considering to undertake such a challenge. I think if he had been around he would have turned it down flat. He even said he wanted The Jungle Book to be far from what it was written to be. He wanted his works to be for children, pleasing to the eyes and ears, with a wholesome story. Well, I can't say he would be proud of it, however it would get his respect for a number of reasons:The animation is far superior than any other animated film I've ever seen, surpassing Sleeping Beauty and Pocahontas. The battle for Notre Dame at the end is a spectacular clash of colors. The drawings of Notre Dame herself are amazing, especially the inside during Esmerelda's endearing ballad "God Help The Outcasts." I wasn't crazy about the three gargoyles; which is why I stayed away from this one, but seeing the movie for a few times made me realize how important they are to the story's progression. Once you analyze them and their presence it seems almost excusable. I don't care for their song however it does set a bit of opposite-foreshadowing. The gargoyles think Esmerelda is in love with Quasi but in fact she is not.The most amazing animation comes during the song "Hellfire." This is Menken's most incredible song, and the best song I've ever heard for a film. It's innaproppriate for young children, yes. However as a sequence it deserves more respect than it's gotten.The main reason I enjoyed this film is because of the characters. They seem almost human, unlike so many of Disney's other characters who just seem like figments of our imagination. These characters, the story, leads you to wonder if this could have, or could ever, happen. Sure it's based on Hugo, but it is not as tragic as the book. Although I have not read it, I know what happens at the end, I still want to read it. What you should do if you have not seen this movie, or avoided seeing it or analyzing it for what it is, ask yourself this: If it had been PRECISELY what Hugo wrote, nothing more, nothing less, would it have been any good?God help this outcast in Disney films. I don't see too many people (besides soundtrack enthusiasts like myself) giving it respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Darker Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good movie, yet I agree with most people. It should have been PG. I'm thirteen, and I still like it, and I saw it when I was little. My dad got the book and read it to me, and then I read a little of it by myself. I also agree, it is a little dark, and little kids shouldn't really watch it. About Frollo's song, I don't think it was really that bad. My grandmother threw a fit because he kept saying the "H" word. Yet still, all movies have that word now. Anyway, I like this movie, yet the second one was horrible. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney meets Victor Hugo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is far from being an accurate adaptation of the novel. Well, who am I kidding here? Actually I'm certainly not an expert on this subject because I got to admit that I really haven't even read Victor Hugo's original book. Nevertheless I'm pretty certain that this one goes without saying: when it's up to Disney of course the film has only taken some approvable parts of the story here and there and changed dramatically things not acceptable for young viewers. Of course the movie itself is a successful, gorgeous and solid Disney picture in good (technically ground-breaking, impressive and magical animation) and in bad (very predictable, you always know when there's going to be another song). This is perhaps not the type of a film I normally spent my times with but I had to rent it for some reason and I can't say that it was a mistake. Kevin Kline was excellent as the voice of Phoebus. I guess want it or not, Disney's animated "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" will certainly be remembered as one of the most beloved versions of Victor Hugo's book classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Disney animated movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame is definitely on my top ten list of Disney animated movies. The artwork is beautiful, the songs memorable, and the script more mature than past Disney films.I have noticed that there was much talk about how the film is too heavy for younger children to understand. It really depends on their level of comprehension. I read that a woman, who took her kids to see this movie, was asked by her seven year old, "Why does Frollo want Esmeralda to die?" The mother simply responded, "Because he is in love with her, but she does not love him." The child quickly understood. Although the movie is much more adult than past Disney films, it is very good. It teaches children not to judge by appearances (though many adults can learn this lesson, too). Another gripe some people had was that Quasimodo did not end up with the beautiful leading lady. This is probably why Quasi gets a girlfriend in the sequel.Finally, there are the viewers who say that Disney destroyed the original novel. I am sorry, but if the movie was closer to the book, it would not be a Disney movie. Disney has made its living off of making stories less violent and more happy and carefree. If you don't believe me, read the original "Cinderella" among others.All in all, I find this movie a winner and give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome Disney flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow...a dark, and sometimes disturbing disney animated feature. Naw, its not really something to worry about keeping your kids away from, while darker than any other disney animated movie to date it also strays quite far from Victor Hugo's original novel (a masterpiece) to accomidate the familly image. However kids with short attention spans won't find lots of lame slapstick slipping on bannana peel type stuff here (other than those stupid gargoyes...ug)...just a deep, captiviating plot full of emotion and complex characters (for disney cartoon standards anyway)so dont be surprised if some of the younger kidos get...oh say a little bored. But what a better way to support emotion than with a beautifull score of music, I have been a Disney fan since i was young, and my major hobby is broadway and musicals in general. Hunchback has one of the best tracks to date...with nearly every song standing out (other than that stupid gargoyle song...its boring, overly cooky, and un intresting) especially "God help the outcasts" and "hellfire", which is heard throught the movie as musical remixes. Overall this is one of the better Disney movies you can watch, it will surely keep adults intrest...and disney should make a trend of this more adult thing with an actual deep plot...crazy characters slipping on banana peels may be entertaining at first...but can get old fast..Disneys fully animated movies are becoming quite epic and deep while keeping a family friendly tone, which is the way it should be, and if kids get bored with that, they should stick with looney tunes until they are old enough to appreciate it....Peace out:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plotwise, the best Disney movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have gotten into many an argument with people when I tell them Hunchback is my favorite Disney movie. Continually, I have had to explain my reasoning...plot! Don't get me wrong, the usual Disney flick is great. The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and others are great, but they don't have what it takes to make a great movie. Plot. The whole story of Hunchback is awesome and spell binding.Before anyone bashes me for saying how great the plot is, I know the striking difference between the movie and book. I don't have the problem many other people do, I like them both. The book uses each individuals imagination to create the story, the movie provides us with the imagination of the authors. At least that is my take on the whole situation.Furthermore, why are so many saying Hunchback is bad because it strays from the Disney norm? Black Cauldron is another of my favorite Disney movies for the same reason, it isn't another Little Mermaid, Lion King, and so on. The only other Disney movie that really comes close is Beauty and the Beast.Lastly, I have to point out the song Hellfire sung by the character Frollo. "It's not my fault/It's in Gods plan/He made the Devil so much stronger than the man!" What other Disney movie can make you think like that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie, even though I think it's rather unconventional for a Disney flick. In HUNCHBACK, animation has reached its apogee. Just looking at the Notre Dame Cathedral or the colorful Festival of Fools takes your breath away. The music and action sequences are also excellent. But what really makes HUNCHBACK work is its unabashed Gothic treatment of the narrative. For the first time in almost 60 years, we get to see a Disney movie that isn't worried about being politically incorrect. There's all kinds of morbid stuff in here: a disfigured baby, Gypsy killings, sexual tension, and overall a spirit of gloomy angst that doesn't spoil the movie's grandiloquent, joyous ending. While I do prefer Disney's traditional approach to movies, it is refreshing to see them attempt a really relevant screenplay for our times. Good job Disney!</fullReview>

Pitifully,he never notices HIS evilness until God punishes him.

It may be a chore getting through some of the long descriptive passages, but it is worth it. Disney's version is entertaining, but there is very little of Victor Hugo in this retelling.

		<fullReview>This is one of Disney's darkest animated features, and it's also really sad and violent, too! Too boring and grim for kids, and a little too insipid for adults. This movie has suggestive themes, killing, mild violence, rude humor, and a city called Paris gets burned down near the end of the movie. A little to heavy for a kids flick, eh? That's what so strange about this movie. It's supposed to be a kids flick when it's really more for of an adult movie. This movie should have been a rated PG while being offered a rated G. Frollo is supposed to be one of the best and meanest villains in any Disney movie. A better villain than Sykes from Oliver &amp; Company I should say. The songs are unoriginal. Helfire is the worst song in the whole movie, I thought that song was a little heavy for a kids flick. Quasimodo is the main character in this movie. His mother was killed by Frollo at the begging of the movie, and Quasimodo lived all by himself in the bell tower. Quasimodo has three talking gargoyles that come to life, and he's very good friends with them! Esmeralda is a beautiful gypsy girl, she a very likable character. It was disappointing that the hero doesn't get the girl at the end of this film. Esmeralda ended up marrying Phoebes instead of Quasimodo at the end of the film, how lame! Not the worst animated film, but it was kind of forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to disconnect this to the book, to enjoy it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The secret to enjoying this movie is to forget everything you every hear about the story. I love both the book and the movie, because I don't compare the two.My only real complaint about the movie is that it is extremely Disneyfied, to an extent that it is ridiculous. I love the darkness of the Frollo scenes, but it does not fit the rest of the film, which looks like something out of Spongebob. Either keep it all cartoony or keep it all dark.They ruined the movie with the conflicting feels. The book is surprisingly light hearted and very funny. But it can be dark. This works in the books favor because it contrasts the dark and light and adds more impact to parts of the story. What they did in the movie is just wrong.This is by no means a children's movie and the G rating is troubling. Although I'm sure the little kids did not care about nor understand the darker stuff. Hey, as long as it has a happy ending they can do what ever they want. Right? I do love the music, it is one of the best Alan Menken has done. It's fun to listen to the Latin chanting and figure out the Latin, which is very possible to do. The music is the best part of the movie and the gargoyles are the worst.It is definitely an acquired taste, as far as movies go. First you have to shut off part of your brain then you have to block out the cartoony parts and focus on the amazing animation and music. Then buy the DVD and CD so you can listen to the songs whenever you want and you can fast forward to see a certain scene when you feel like it. Thats what I do, and you are left with the experience of seeing a masterpiece of a movie. Just remember to restart that part of your brain you shut down, after your done watching. The movie and the book are two entirely separate things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what was being smoked by the guy who came up with the idea of the wise-cracking gargoyles, but it must have been some strong stuff to be able to cloud judgment that much. Just how many more stupid auxillary characters must we put up with before Disney.money decides to become Disney.art again? (Here's hoping with Atlantis, which if not art, it may at least attain a Raiders of the Lost Ark standing). At least with Hercules or Aladdin, the whole movie was kind of goofy and unreal, but to do that to Hunchback (and worse, Eddie Murphy's dragon in Mulan) is nearly intolerable. If it gets worse before it gets better, I almost expect the filmmakers to start emulating the insultingly stupid gross-out comedy of the Farrelly brothers and Tom Green (please, God, no! We already have Heavy Traffic).It would have been one thing if the gargoyles were actually imaginary friends of Quasimodo, as my old roommate and I had hoped when we first saw this movie. That would have made more sense and given Quasimodo's predicament more urgency--not to mention, the choice would have been totally his instead of being more-or-less dared into it by "friends" who apparently spent their winter days in New York, for all they understand about Quasimodo's situation. After all, would real friends try to convince someone to incur the wrath of his abusive father just for a little afternoon fun, or would they try to help him escape the situation?Thankfully, scenes with the gargoyles amounts to a relatively small portion of this otherwise terrific movie. The scenes between Esmerelda and Phoebus (Demi Moore and Kevin Kline) are full of witty, dry, almost Hitchcockian wordplay (imagine how much better the movie would have been simply if this type of humor had been used throughout, instead of that silly (and worse, unoriginal) slapstick). Tom Hulce, as the bell-ringer does the movie a tremendous service by being able to elicit emotions even with the gargoyles on screen. Many of the shots are beautifully imaginative--the jester looking down at a pool of water, the slow camera zooms at the "eyes of Notre Dame"--just about every visual gives the film an majestic look.Then of course, there's Judge Frollo, the villain. Up to and including the point where he says, "I had some trouble with the fireplace," he is the most complex and realistic villain of any Disney cartoon, period. He has emotions, he has mixed feelings about things. He feels guilt, he has to make decisions--even if they are bad ones. He is a human being. Imagine what the animators must have been thinking as they put pictures to that wonderful song of torment and lust--did they ever worry that it might not get a G rating? Or did they, in an artistic furor, say to hell with it, we want to make art for a change?Of course, the moment he says, "Find the gypsy girl," he changes into the blandly evil (read: generic) villain that we've all come to expect from Disney (for all of Scar's evil flamboyance, he doesn't ponder right or wrong--even Hitler wasn't merely a monster). And the ending just doesn't ring true--if God (if we assume that God is really plunging him into the firey pit) took a hands-on approach like that, there wouldn't have been a Holocaust, Crusade, Inquisition, or Pauly Shore movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has changed my life....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>....and I say this in the most sincere, honest, and heart-felt way possible. I love most Disney movies, almost as a rule, but no movie, NO movie, Disney or not, has what this movie has.I completely identify with the character of Quasimodo, who is one of the most well defined characters I have seen on the screen. I think if anyone has felt lonely, cast aside, and felt alienated in their lifetimes, one cannot help but identify with this hero. When he triumphed, I felt myself triumph in parallel. While any fictional story is not a complete basis for the way the world will work, the outcome in this story, in regards to Quasi's final situation, gave me faith and hope that I might feel the same. I truly have begun to look at the world and my own place in it with an optimistic disposition. I can safely say this film planted the seed to make that happen for me. It was my "wake up call," if you will.So, he he! If you'd like to get THAT out of a movie, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is a MUST!Further praise / originality .....I think the song "God Help The Outcasts" sung by the character of Esmerelda ( and obviously NOT by Demi Moore. LOL! ::sorry Demi...:: ) is something rare and to be kept with you. She sings a prayer, asking God to help her people, but to overlook her own self, as "I can get by." I think the message here is outstanding. It , to me, says that selflessness, that true caring and concern, is an attribute to hold close to you. It is certainly something I have always believed in, and I most likely enjoyed this song because it validated my opinion, ::grins::Another remarkable aspect of this movie, is its villain. Frollo is the most believable, love-to-hate, concrete villain I have seen. The fact that he is motivated by lust is certainly a daring, and very effective attribute for Disney, especially, to include. Without it, though, Frollo would have become hum-drum. If you see this movie you will hate he guy.:) He is the perfect antagonist for the type of character Quasi is. All Quasimodo wants is to be accepted by the people of his town, while Frollo represses that because of his own petty, sinful,desires. PERFECT metaphor of real life situations.I looked back at past Acadamy Award winners, and was disheartened that "Someday," the closing track by All-4-one, had not even been nominated. Although I feel it is simply constructed, I cannot listen to it without literally crying for joy. And for me, that is truly saying something.::A Side note dealing with musical score: If you want a GORGEOUSLY perfect score, check out Disney's newest movie TARZAN. Why is it not up for an Acadamy Award!? Somebody please explain this to me! It is also a shame that Mulan's score was beat out for the award last year by the boring, and similar-throughout score from Shakespeare in Love. SIL's score was pretty, yes, but had little substance...... ::Anyhoo.... Do you feel poorly about yourself? Do you feel repressed by today's society? Do you NOT feel suppressed, yet love a good story!? Then you MUST see THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. You are doing youself a terrible injustice if you do not.!-Tickle</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the reasons why Ithink that ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame ''is very sad, is because of the story that makes me feel bad. The fact that I was just a kid the first time I watched helps;So I really thought that some scenes like the one where Quasimodo is humiliated in public at the streets(because of the Foll's festival)very depressing and with a big impact in my mind. Until the present day,I really don't feel comfortable to watch this movie.(If the person are older than 12, I guess he/she will not have the same problems I had). But the story itself is a beautiful and exciting masterpiece.Paris, 18 century. The Gypsies are followed everywhere they go in Paris, and one of the people behind this massacre is judge Frollo, a dark and evil man determined to kill all gypsies he follows. One day, he kill a gypsy woman who was carrying a baby, and when he saw the baby was deformed, he almost killed the baby trowing him in a pit, when the Priest who saw everything that Frollo did made him take care of the child. Frollo hated to do that, but he was scared since he was a catholic man so he did. 20 years passed and the name Frollo gave to the the was Quasimodo, that means 'almost formed'.( a very cruel name) Keeping Quasimodo only inside the church of Notredame as the bell ringer and forbidding him to go out to the streets, Frollo was going to be the judge of the Fools Festival, one of the big commemorations in Paris that he was the judge. Quasimodo, tired of being locked in the church, decided to go to the festival without Frollo know, and there he meet Esmeralda, a beautiful and kind gypsy woman and her goat, Djali. Esmeralda will become one of his friends (as well Febo the captain of the french soldiers) and will help him in the fool's festival when he is crowned king of fools and people started to throw things on him. Frollo will fall for her, making him even more cruel than the normal and trying to destroy the gypsies home. Many things will happen then, and the end of this movie is one of the most touching ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie - NOT Hunchback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason, my young friend, that all of the people you have heard blasting Disney's version of Hunchback is quite simple. The should have named it the boy in the bell tower or something else. When one names a story after a Great Work, and even uses the author's name on it, one SHOULD follow the story line a tiny bit. The same is true of Pocahontas and Hercules. Everyone who has every read any of the Greco-Roman mythology knows that not only was Hera NOT Herc's mom, she hated his guts!!! And as for our pretty little song bird, well...Virginia may well be the most beautiful state in the union, but I can guarantee you that there are NO cliffs like they portrayed in the Tidewater area. And as for the girl herself? Pocahontas was an UGLY 14 year old girl. She did indeed lay her head on John Smith's to save his life but her later years bear as little resemblance to the sequel as the ending of Hunchback bears to Victor Hugo's novel. Disney does a great job of bringing fairy tales to the screen. They should stick to their genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of the whining here about this not being true to Dumas' book...gimme a break, it is a Movie, not a Novel. And as such, I felt that Disney did it justice. Good characterizations, some great animation, a vile villain, Demi as a strong and desirable heroine, whom I thought offered something unique to this particular 'toon. You can't blame Frollo for wanting her, though you can hat him for what he tries.I would say that this will grow on the public in the years to come, and deserves better than it has gotten. *** outta ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to mangle a great work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notre Dame de Paris is one of Victor Hugo's greatest works and to see it mangled in this way is horrifying. If they'd refrained from the slapstick and aimed at a adult audience it might have worked. The animation of the cathedral &amp; Paris was excellent but the plot &amp; characters are completely Disney.SpoilersIn the novel Phoebus is absolutely vile. He swears, drinks and sleeps with women. He is not the noble hero represented here.Frollo is not a judge. He's the Archdeacon. As a priest he took pity on the infant Quasi &amp; later got corrupted by power. Here he is not allowed any shades of grey.Gringoire a playwright also in love with Esmeralda is absent from this version.The tragic ending of the novel far surpasses the limp one Disney offers. What's the moral here? It's okay to be ugly but you'll never get the girl? The fact that they've brought out a sequel makes it worse.Djali is female in the novel.The gargoyles are a comfort to Quasimodo but they don't come alive.Most of the tragic scenes are missing or toned down.The novel is about the cathedral &amp; the people whose lives it affects. It is not about a lonely hunchback. Victor Hugo detested the English title.Read the novel. You'll enjoy it more. This version 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated Disney movies of all time but really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was on TV there the other day and I decided to watch it as I had a lot of it forgotten. The story is about a deformed man named Quasimodo(which means half formed)who is the bell ringer of Notre Dame. He falls in love with a gypsy girl named Esmeralda(Demi Moore) who is in love with Phoebus(Kevin Kline). Quasimodo of course cannot leave his tower because of the evil man Frollo(voiced by the late Tony Jay) who raised him as his own as Quasimodo's mother died when he was a baby.The music is brilliant (Alan Menken&amp; Stephen Schwartz who did the music for Pocahontas and Enchanted to name a few) I love the song Out There or The Belles of Notre Dame which is such a powerful song. The story is very good as it kinda reminds me of Beauty &amp; the Beast in a way. If you never heard of this movie then check it out for the music im giving it a 9/10 for the whole film a 9/10.Listen to the end credits for the song Someday by All 4 One its such a good song. I saw it again on DVD as I own it on DVD and it is one of the best Disney movies from the 1990s. Some people say its like Disney's 50th but hey it kinda reminded me more of The Phantom Of The Opera in a way.Overall I loved this movie and still enjoy watching it.</fullReview>

When he leaves the tower to go to the Festival of Fools he winds up in big trouble with Frollo and has a woman that tries to rescue him arrested. But she goes free and escapes the guard. In the tower the only people Quasamido has are 3 wisecraking gargoyles named Hugo, Victor, and Laverne. They find out he's in love with a guy named Esmarelda and the guys notice this and sing about it. Frollo schemes to attack at dawn with 1,000 men and has Esmarelda handcuffed. And Quasamido back into the bell tower and orders his guards to make sure he stays there. When Frollo nearly does something bad to Quasamido he is pushed aside and falls into a fire.

		<shortDescription>The Best disney movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the 'Hunchback' I was a 13 year old girl who loved Beauty and the Beast, but after seeing the movie it was my all time favorite. Now I'm 18 years old and its still my favorite. Since reading the book "Notre Dame De Paris"which I also highly recommend I see new things in the disney interpretation which is wonderful for all ages. But if Frollo's song "hellfire" had not been the way it had I wouldn't have seen the disney interpretation as a good view at all. Because without Frollo's lust and obsession with the gypsy esmerelda there is no way it could be acurate to the vision of Victor hugo, well besides the fact that frollo is sopost to be a Priest, but we all know that, many parents, and children wouldn't have been able to handle something that unaccepted, as a priest lusting after a woman. Frollo was a very real person, he had emotion, feeling, lust, obsession, all those feelings that he has seemingly been trying to push down through the years. I know I seem biased about Frollo, but he is Disney's greatest villain of all time, he isn't goofy or silly in any sense except with his joke about "whipping" his men into shape, and even that isn't silly because he truly has a sinister sense of humor. I believe alot of the true frollo character is lost in the cartoon though, the book is a really deep, emotional portrayal of a man fighting against his wants and his god. But as far as story.......this is a good one, rent it!</fullReview>

It's a bit too dark. There is alot of racism, death, and sexual tension. The Festival of Fools which was supposed to be a funny party type of thing, really was only a bunch of peasants getting drunk and acting stupid. But besides all that, I think most of the characters were acted out nicely (except for Phoebus (Kevin Kline),because he was the typical "i'm the great knight in shining armour" thing). The song Hellfire was a bit...disturbing...and i honestly think the best songs were performed by Paul Kandel as the gypsy Clopin. All in all though, i give this song a *** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great moviemaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I became "too old" for Disney movies, I got rid of most of the Disney fare in my video collection. I did, however, keep my five very favorites. This was one of them. I believe it really is one of the most powerful, thought-provoking Disney movies. The story was a departure from the normal fairy story with magical characters that make everything alright with a wave of the magic wand. The characters had to make their own happy ending, and all while dealing with issues that Disney had previously only scratched the surface on. Even though the music was not exactly made for radio (I still can't stand Bette Midler's version of "God Help the Outcasts"), it was very appropriate for the time frame. I still can't get enough of the songs "Out There" and "God Help the Outcasts" (the version sung in the movie). The choir's Gregorian chant really drove the mood home. The only real complaint I have about it is that they decided to include the three gargoyles. Something tells me they were only added to draw in kids who otherwise would not be interested (and should not have really been there anyway). Other than this one beef, I thought the movie was absolutely wonderful. And as for those who say the movie is not like the book at all, not many of the other film versions are much better in that respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MINOR SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*I enjoyed this film as it was a break from the usual Disney style. I liked the characters a lot. But I must warn that this film may disturb very small children. It disturbed me when I was 8. This is mainly because it is a very emotional film at times - at the festival of fools, the people were very harsh on Quasimodo, when he was jeered at. And it is dark at times. But it is a very good film, and it has a happy ending. The music is superb, and the animation breathtaking. So remember - if children under the age of 7 watch this, you should watch it with them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Disney Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hunchback of Notre Dame is perhaps Disney's most unappreciated film. I will admit it is not one of my favorite and certainly not up there with The Little Mermaid nor Beauty and the Beast, it is a joy to watch. I'll start one by one:1. The animation- this is the strongest key element in an animated film, if the animation is not up to the standards, the whole film is a disappointment. In this case, Hunchback features some of the most impressive animation I have seen so far. It superbly combines hand drawn with CGI animation and the result is a consistently eye-popping adventure- a treat for the eye.2. The songs- while not disney's best, they are serviceable while only one truly stands out - "Out There" is truly touching and also one of the most impressively animated scenes in the film-I just cannot imagine the scene is animated! Also, it seems like they invested more on the look (animation) of the songs than on lyrics and music. Alan Menken has lost his magic touch by 1995, but Pocahontas' Color of the Wind was outstanding.3. Character- Quasimoto's character design is absolutely striking. The way the animators designed his face, body shape, wow... The next best thing is Esmeralda, her outlook is also strikingly beautiful. She marks a department from the barbie-doll look of Ariel and Belle. The other characters, and I mean everyone of them, are perfectly animated!4. Plot- I guess this element sadly made Hunchback less successful than its predecessors. Though the story's quality hasn't been on a par with early movies in Pocahontas, kids could anyway understand that the English want to take over the Indians' land and Pocahontas and John Smith stop the war, blahh, blahh... But the story in Hunchback was too difficult to understand for youngsters. Pretty sad.Overall, Hunchback is an experience everyone should enjoy: A visually stunning animated film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's absolute best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many who would disagree with me on this, but I believe that "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is Disney's finest achievement for the studio, especially in its post-"Little Mermaid" renaissance. I think that it is the single best animated film of all time, surpassing my previous favorite, "Beauty And The Beast."In my circle of friends, family, and acquaintances, I could not find anyone who agreed with me on that. Many said that "Beast" was best, or even some of the classics like "Pinnochio" or "Peter Pan" were considered better by a few. But, I have to disagree with all of them, and here are two reasons why:1. From an animation standpoint, "Hunchback" is unparalleled. Sure, it has a look that is similar to "Beast," but it is only a similarity. I think of "Beast" as the dress rehearsal of "Hunchback."2. Victor Hugo's timeless story is something that involved me emotionally more than any other film ever had. Sure, Disney toned it down some and altered some plot points. They also included a few characters who are not in Hugo's original. But that is okay, for it must be remembered that they are in the business of making Disney films.We all have had experiences where we felt inadequate. I sure did. There was that beauty at school that I admired from afar, never really believing that she would ever want some homely guy like me. It was these feelings and memories that "Hunchback of Notre Dame" brought back that made me feel so sympathetic for Quasimodo. And even though I was familiar with Hugo's story, and I have seen this film several times, it still pains me as I realize that Quasimodo will not end up with Esmeralda.This movie appeals to everyone. A terrific family film; I loved it, as did my young children. It is a beautiful sight to see, and filled with great songs. My favorite sequence is the "Topsy Turvy Day." It is a blast.I really recommend this film.</fullReview>

How do you explain such raw hate toward a group of people except "Oh boy, the villain was evil, so he was filled with hate and ran the campaign for hatred". It's not that simple. And not only that, but the characters were so plain (except the villain). The plot was alright. The o good vs evil. If anything was good about it, it was definitely the villain: he was fun to watch, especially near the end when he went insane over the lust for Esmeralda. And I guess the animation was really good too. Definitely something that I could see today. If you're looking for a Disney film to watch, I suggest skipping this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is addressed to parents, not the kids. Kids, go on loving the movie if you do.This movie is one of the clearest examples of the deepest sort of cynicism, at every level, that infects our culture. Disney's current masters will have a special place in hell (so to speak) for allowing this sort of thing to be perpetrated on children.While adapting stories to the film medium and changing some details is fine by me, there can be no excuse for calling this film "The Hunchback of Notre Dame." It bears such a slight resemblance to the actual book (which is *not* a children's story by any means) that the degree of change needs some explanation.The explanation is that Disney's pathetic executive committees decided that Hugo's great story was not politically correct. (By the way, this was very clearly the work of a committee, the whole production screams "I was made by compromise among politically correct liberals who sold out to the Disney corporation!") Esmeralda, in the book an independent-willed but very feminine and essentially fragile character, is made into the standard Disney type of plucky heroine who can fight just as well as a man. Quasimodo, in the book a pathetic, deaf, brutal, mean, stupid, and monstrous-looking person, becomes merely a misfit, who can hear and think just fine. The band of gypsies, in the book a brutal, stupid, vicious, and insane band of thieves, in the film become a pure-hearted and oppressed Race who would never steal.Worst of all, Frollo, in the book the archdeacon of Notre Dame itself and an extremely complex person with a great deal of good in his character, is made into a bizarre judge and master of the guard, all-powerful, who works in a Hall of Justice that looks like an evil castle. In the book, he actually, out of kind-heartedness, rescued the four-year-old Quasimodo from a place where foundlings were left to die--he wasn't about to *kill* the child, as the Evil Frollo does in this pathetic excuse for a movie. In fact, in the book, it is suggested that the infant Esmeralda is stolen by gypsies from her French mother (a particularly pathetic whore), and an infant Quasimodo is left in her place.Now, why would the Disney committees make such changes? Because, of course, the original story is very far from politically correct. Now, I can see glossing over dens of gypsy thieves; there's no reason to have that in a children's movie. But the notion of making a flawed, but more or less respectable man of God into a particularly fiendish monster, as the movie does, reveals that the Disney committee's decision-making process is absolutely devoted to making art (yes, even art for children) subordinate to the indoctrination of their point of view. I'm not even religious myself. I just can't believe that there would be this level of cynical subversion of artistic integrity--so that they would turn the story so completely upside down in order to teach their own moral lessons.The film thus sins, for the sake of children and to appease corporate critics who would find anything remotely faithful to Hugo's story politically correct, against art, and also against both reality--yes, there really are people that ugly and brutal, yes, there really are dens of thieves like that. You do children no favors by pretending otherwise.Actually, that's my reaction to *a lot* about this movie, not just the character of Frollo. The basic problem with it is that it is essentially a piece of propaganda, and even worse, propaganda for children. Its essential aim is to portray Christianity as racist and oppressive. You might say that the priest in Notre Dame is a sympathetic character; but the words and sign of religion are more often and more seriously put into the mouth of Frollo. In the book, Frollo is no saint, and he *is* bigoted (like virtually everyone who lived in the times) and something of a charlatan. But Hugo certainly did not mean his book to make a mockery of religion; if anything, in the book he mocked the occult beliefs that Frollo secretly held. At any rate, the movie is clearly only so much propaganda, only so much art placed in the service of the prevailing dogma, for the sake of profit. The arrogance and greed that lies behind this production is breathtaking and frightening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I do not approve this a good Disney animated film, never in a thousand years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I see a Disney animated I look for 3 things, just 3 simple things, the original songs, the humor, and the theme. I think that this movie failed miserably at all of these.First, the songs. They're not original, as most of them tried to be something that has happen in other Disney's classics already. For example in Quasimodo's love song, I can hear the chemistry - the beat sort of - from Be Our Guest running. The songs aren't original.Second, the humor. The only gags are slapstick and not even the good kind. Their humor is cheap, just lots of guys getting hit in the balls. The best of all the humor is probably the 3 stone stooges, which is no where near its past, like Lumiere and co.Last, the theme. Disney movies are supposed to have a simple and just purely good theme. Let's say Beauty and the Beast's redemption from evil, or Pocahontas's love can overcome anything, this movie is no where match. The theme is what, religion and hellfire. I call that bullsh-t.In summary, this is no where near anything Disney has ever done and is terrible at being a Disney family everyone loved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not to crazy when I first started seeing trailers for this Disney animated movie back in 1996. Even after I saw the movie I was still unimpressed.What I really hated was the plot and a few of the characters. The plot is weak and condescending. This brings us to one of the characters--Frollo. He's a sneezy, you-know-what because of the way he treats Quasimodo and all of the citizens of (Paris?). It's ludicrous! There is a bunch of weak humor too. I don't remember ever laughing in this film.I'm sorry to say those comments mentioned just before overshadow the pluses of this film. Esmeralda is a nice, young, juvenile, gypsy (which Frollo hates) but she has an eye for seeing what is really in Quasimodo that his master Frollo (ugh!) does not want him to. The song "God Help the Outcasts" is heartwarming though.My rating? Three *** out of **********.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a Disneymovie set in Paris. The movie is about Quasimodo(Hunchback), who is forbidden by his master Frollo to leave the clock tower of Notre Dame. However, Quasimodo disobeys his master and leaves the clock tower, in order to take part in a festival. At the festival he meets Ezmeralda, a gypsy dancer, but he is discovered by Frollo. Frollo is an evil man, and he wants to get rid of all the gypsies in Paris. Hunchback has visuals to die for, and I was particularly impressed by the scenes at the festival, where you get to see hundreds of well-animated people, all doing different things. A good orchestral music is also present, but I think that there were too many songs, and many of them weren`t that good. The story was also sometimes more predictable than I liked. But I would also like to mention that the story is a rather mature and realistic one, when compared to other Disneymovies like Peter Pan. 7,5/10 </fullReview>

I don't see why anyone would like this movie. And it's not because the main character is fugly and gross, it's because of the end. I thought it sent a terrible message to kids. The guy totally falls in love with Esmeralda, goes out of his way (I mean above and beyond the call of duty) to rescue her and be the good guy to prove his love for her...and she ends up with the handsome one?! What kind of message is that? To me that is Disney saying "the hot girl belongs with the hot guy and the fugly hero can never have true love". I don't know if this movie is based off a book or a true story, so if that is the case then I could kind of forgive it...but if not, Disney made a huge mistake. There are some good songs, the villain is very easy to hate, and the handsome soldier guy does provide some comedy relief along with the gargoyles, but other than that movie pretty much sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly my cup of tea...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not much into Disney's cartoon features. At least not the newest ones. And their straight-to-video sequels are appalling. What's next, "Pinocchio Goes to War"? "The Lion King: Feeding Frenzy"? "Beauty and the Beast in Nashville"? The list goes on. (Thanks to MAD for those hilarious sequel titles.)My favorite Disney film(s) are "Toy Story," both the original and sequel. It captured what family films should be about: Cleanness, humor and a pretty darn good sense of watchability. "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is yet another cash-in film, nothing too great here. I advise you waste your invaluable time on something else. 2/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The strangest Disney film I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, after watching this movie, I had to wonder what the brainstorming sessions were like at Disney while coming up with the idea for this film. Were all the cute books taken or something? I mean, there's nothing about the original novel that exactly screams Disney.Both my eyebrows went up while watching this movie, and stayed up. I mean, I remember Frollo's song about Esmerelda and I couldn't believe they made hellfire and damnation into a *musical number*, for god's sake. And Esmerelda's number where she's singing to God was a little heavy for a kid's flick.On the other hand, this is one of the wittiest Disney films I've ever seen.All in all, the strangest film Disney has ever produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's just hope that the Disney people never decide to do to Shakespeare or Sophocles what they've done to Victor Hugo and Hans Christian Andersen (I'm alluding to The Little Mermaid), among others. Romeo and Juliet? Just a misunderstanding. They live happily ever after and so do Montagues and the Capulets. Hamlet? He marries Ophelia and then we get 'Hamlet II: Back to Elsinore.' Oedipus? It's all a mistake; he didn't really kill his father and marry his mother, he was really an orphan adopted by the Queen, everything's okay, and the Sphinx was really just unhappy because she was misunderstood; she moves into the palace with Oedipus and they become great friends, and then comes 'Oedipus II: Sphinx's Pride.'There's always seemed to be a cinematic schizophrenia at the Disney studios: Amid all the saccharine goo, there were moments that were darker, even shocking. In particular, I'm thinking of the death of Bambi's mother, and more recently the death of Mufasa, Simba's father, in The Lion King. But there seems to be this rule at Disney that even if a major character dies halfway through, the ending has to be all smiles. I mean, what is the point of doing a story with a sad ending like 'The Little Mermaid' or 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' if you trivialize the entire point of the story by changing it from dark to light and fluffy? Are they afraid of traumatizing the delicate little psyches of America's children? Have you checked out the video game shelf at your local computer store lately? Have you watched the six-o'clock news lately and checked out the 'if it bleeds, it leads' top story? In this age of drive-by shootings, when kids' parents, unlike in my ever more distant childhood, are afraid to leave their kids unguarded on their front lawns, much less roaming unchaperoned either in or outside of their own neighborhoods, does it make sense to sweeten (and thereby render meaningless) the ending of a fairy tale? Only if you're venal enough to be already planning to make more money with a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I do not think this story was a good source of material for a Disney movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not see why they thought this particular story would make a good Disney movie for the family. It is a story that ends tragically, has lots of sad stuff in it and for the most part is not a story that is going to have a lot of stuff for the kids unless you completely change the story and add to it stupid characters in the form of gargoyles. In fact making this story into a Disney movie was probably one of the biggest mistakes Disney made except for letting Rosie O'Donnell do the voice as a monkey in that Tarzan movie. The story has Quasi in his happy church with his fun friends the gargoyles. This was stupid it is like the dragon in Mulan, they are unnecessary little buddies to add the comedy. In the end most of this story is not family friendly and then they have to add the happy ending to make the story completely messed up. Why my friend had to get me to come to this one is beyond me, he always talked me into going to the Disney movies that chances are I would not like rather than some that might like, say "Hercules". He even tried to get me to see Tarzan, but no way I was going see that one what with Rosie O'Donnell doing the voice of that monkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good and bad things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the disastrous film of Pocahontas, Disney hat to do something with more work in order to re-obtain its greatness, and the result was "The Hundback of Notre-Dame". Based in the novel of Victor Hugo, the adaptation is quite good, knowing that the darkness of the film can't be so vast, as it is for kids (anyway, is one of the darkest classics of Disney). It is clear that there is a very hard-work inside the film. The quality of draws is much better than Pocahontas and the care in the representing of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame is surprisingly good. Also the movements of characters and in the amount of moving objects in screen (a lot, and all different) serve to show how hard has Disney worked for this film. In addition, the sound effects and the soundtrack of the action scenes, with all the opera voices is quite good, spectacular in some moments. Moreover, the characters are well done, and again, the best built is judge Frollo, where we can find hypocrisy and evilness in a sweetest harmony. If it is so good, what is bad? The amount of songs that there are in the film (more than half of the film is sung), the addition of the Gargolies (a present for kids, but absolutely awful), and the development of the plot, while in the book the plot is interesting and breathtaking, the lack of rhythm of most of the movie (mainly because of the songs, that spend a lot of time) cause the film to leave a bad feeling. It has very good things and it's clear that it has a lot of hard-work inside but some great mistakes in direction make the movie to achieve a poorer result as expected at first sight</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney animation continued its steady decline with this adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel."The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is mostly a mess, too dark and sophisticated for kids but still a little too cartoonish for adults, with the result being that no one will have a good time with it.Pixar has long since established that it can do brilliantly what Disney's late 1990s films failed at.This film received its obligatory Academy Award nomination for Best Comedy/Musical Score, despite the fact that the score isn't remarkable in the least.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's more forgettable efforts - a genuine Disney film that feels like it was aimed 80% at children.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hunchback of Notre Dame is another one of those Disney films that I do remember watching years and years ago on an old video cassette but remain unable to pinpoint any specific plot of some sort or that of particular scenes. Seeing it again more recently, I began to think shortly after finishing it that it wasn't my bad memory that disabled me from wholly remembering it but that the fact the film just isn't that memorable in the first place.I think Disney like to go for the grand, epic look to their films; particularly the more recent ones. Setting them in large, open, enchanting places (castle in Beauty and the Beast, continent of Africa in The Lion King) and having spectacular, over the top devices likes genies (Aladdin), talking furniture and the like. With The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the cathedral of Notre Dame acts as a spectacular and enchanting setting but everything else feels limited as the usual Disney 'magic' is very much missing. I understand this is a book adaptation but if you're going to adapt it in a fun, Disney sort of way then at least do it properly.Quasimodo (Hulce) seems to act as the character we're supposed to focus on the most; he's given all the tragic build up and the early focus ? he's even got three gargoyles that actually act as his subconscious as they're always telling him to do the opposite of what it is he would and should normally do. Although funny at times, it not only works on the level of humour but also as an interesting case study of loneliness; a deformed person hearing voices and telling him to rebel a little as he doesn't get the contact with other humans bar his master and carer: Judge Frollo (Jay).Quasimodo should also be more aggressive than he is. In this film, he's very kind and caring ? he crafts wooden models to a tee and manages to find comfort in helping people and birds. I feel anyone shut away in a bell tower overlooking the city and the people whom have apparently rejected them; all the while not having any human contact with anyone bar one person would be far more disturbed and psychologically dangerous than the way Quasimodo is put across in this film. If Disney formally decided against going down this route then you need to question why they even took the subject matter on.Despite all the focus Quasimodo actually gets; having a hero that is consistently bogged down in one location, not being out in adventures and finding and overcoming conflict is not going to work. It really feels like the film realised this half way through and used the character of Phoebus (Kline) to take over, acting as the hero. Phoebus is out and about, he's a tough, handsome and confident soldier who wears gold armour in comparison to the goofy, incompetent, dull coloured guards he's seen with. He also seems to be the only person in the whole of Paris who actually has to use his brain more than once; thus, the love story and its eventual twist become very predictable. This also relegates our 'would be' hero Quasimodo to an accomplice or an ally of some sort. Suddenly; he doesn't really seem to matter all that much apart from when they need him to either do something for them or help them escape.Most of the time; especially in the second third, the film relies on the single plot device of Frollo and his guards trying to find the rouge gypsy Esmeralda (Moore). This gets really quite tiresome after a while ? there are only so many different ways and things the filmmakers can use before it just gets repetitive but it does give Phoebus an excuse to transfer over from the dark to the light side. I find it funny that Frollo is prepared to burn Paris to the ground in order to find her yet no one else seems to notice his insane plan; not even a mayor or a king/queen perhaps? By the time the film sort of limps its way to its climax, a lot of the early seriousness such as the concepts of love and loneliness have completely evaporated and farce does seem to take over when the fight scenes arrive as good and evil do battle in a significant location; something Disney like to do rather often only it usually works well: the Pride Rock fight in The Lion King, Gaston's battle with the Beast and Aladdin's showdown with Jafar at the Arabian palace.I don't think The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a particularly bad film but it is a bad Disney film; its mediocre approach and dull conflict it has running throughout is very frustrating and although most of Quasimodo's scenes are touching in a way, it falls well short in the long run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney should have walked, but strikes out instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In looking for a place to start with the criticisms, this film is a target-rich environment.Disney began with a story far too mature for its target audience (assuming it was aiming at kids), followed it with some casting mistakes (Demi Moore, who is wooden throughout) and then topped it off with the most plodding, unmemorable soundtrack of any Disney movie post-"The Little Mermaid," which essentially marks a dividing line in Disney movie history.Handling religious imagery or themes in cartoons aimed at children is also a balancing act, and while THOND tries hard not to offend, it unfortunately does so simply by ignoring the connections, which is unrealistic.The audience I saw this movie with was about half children, half adults. Most of the children appeared either confused or disinterested, especially during the musical numbers. Some of the others were heard to ask their parents why Esmeralda and Quasimodo were not brought together at the end of the picture -- which, to an extent, solidified the message that the ugly boy can't get the pretty girl after all. In other words, all evidence that the source material was never meant to be delivered to children ages 6-11.In short, the film misses its marks -- all of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, Disney. Not this time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movie that, for all visible reasons, should've been a great movie. It's fairly exciting and dramatic, and some of the characters are interesting enough, especially Frollo, who is probably one of the better Disney villains ever created. But The Hunchback of Notre Dame has way too many flaws for it to be a good Disney movie. First of all, this is not Disney. Disney has always dealt with touchy subjects. But it has never gotten so dark and disturbing that young kids can't watch the movie. Second, this movie can't decide which way it wants to go. One minute, it's scaring kids with disturbing material. The next minute, it's sickening adults with its incredibly bad humor. And the gargoyles are the most annoying sidekicks ever created next to Panic and Pain from Hercules. Sorry Disney. Close but no cigar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best movie Disney's ever made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, as a BIG fan of Disney animation, I have to say I was disappointed in this picture. Having come off of my extreme disappointment with Pocahontas, I expected this movie to make up for the mistakes of the last one. I was wrong. Not only didn't The Hunchback correct the mistakes of its previous box office flop but it made some new mistakes that were even worse. For one, making some of the scenes in the movie too emotionally intense(the humiliation scene, the Hellfire scene, and the burning of the miller's house) Two, WAY too much religious icons(Lady Mary w/ baby Jesus, the statue of the saints and huge cross is Judge Frollo's chambers). While I understand the story centers around man who is isolated in a church, I feel the repeated references to God and Mary may isolate some viewers(like myself). Point blank, religion DOES NOT belong in Disney movies(or at least not that much of it!!! And last but certainly not least, my biggest complaint is the hero doesn't get the girl!!!! Disney is known for 3 things: its musical storytelling, it's beautiful animation, and it's hero/heroine relationship. While it delivered on the music and animation, it failed on this important component. I mean, poor Quasimodo is rejected and humiliated by the world outside of Notre Dame and after being rescued by Esmeralda(who makes him feel as if she understands his plight and shows signs of liking him), ultimately chooses pretty boy Phoebus because he saved one family from a burning house(which was set on fire by the villain he use to work for). What is up with that??? I mean, Quasi gets his own movie, a song telling how great he is(A Guy Like You), and right afterwards, has to endure the heartbreak of knowing the woman he loves is attracted to another man(a man who worked for his wicked master and probably only quit cause he wanted to be with Esmeralda). I mean, who helped Esmeralda escape? Not Phoebus. Who rescued Esmeralda from certain death at the hands of the malevolent Frollo? Not Phoebus. And who risked his own life to finally put an end to corrupt judge at the heartpounding climax atop the church? Not Phoebus. Maybe I'm making a big deal out of nothing but put it in the light of people with disabilities. How do you children with facial deformation felt about this picture? Disney has always had a beautiful lesson to teach kids of all ages. Well, what kinda lesson does this teach special needs kids or unpopular kids in general. You can do all the work but don't expect to get the credit because your not what society considers normal? That's certainly the impression I got and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Point blank, Disney in this film, fell into the stereotype of the perfect couple(which is a surprise consider their overwhelming success on Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin). While this certainly doesn't change my opinion of Disney animated films in general, I have to say I don't recommend this movie as a first choice(unless your in the mood for a dramatic Broadway-style film with a questionable ending).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frolo is supposed to be more interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the original book when I was 10.It's one of the best I've ever read.Those of you who liked this movie should try to read it too. Frolo in the book is not realy evil.He spent his life serving god as a priest,searching for knowledge and protecting his kid brother.But he was obsessed with a woman and tried everything to get rid of his obsesion.I looked to him as the hero of the original novel.He fights his own self and his society.In this movie he may becomes Disney's deepest vilain,since he has doubts,he is still too shalow.He treats everyone badly.Where is the original's compasion? Esmeralda has been raised by the gypsies but she is french.She has a strong moral code and is betrayed by her "Knight in shining armor" Phoebus.Here she is only a lame charachter.And not even a reference to her mother,an important charachter of the book,and her husband the poet. And she doesn't even get burned. Quasimodo was a gypsie abandonet by his tribe and his foster mother.The only person that was kind to him was Frolo who saved his life and raised him.Quasimodo hates everybody except Frolo,who he kills in the end of the book and soon regrets,and Esmeralda.He is deformed ever since his birth and is deaf thanks to his job.He can hardly speak. Many consider a deamon that the "magician",Frolo called.In this movie he is innocent,not violent and doesn't say the classical words "everything I loved is dead".Extremely dissapointing. There's also no reference to the king of France Louis XI who plays a small but important role in the book.No reference to Frolo's student brother and his felow students.The statues in the begining of the movie who represent the kings of France is the best detail in the movie but is never explained and most people thought they represented saints.Also small references to prejdism. and to the coruption of the church.Some say kids would't like that.Why not?The christian church has a history of blood and coruption.Anybody who read's history should know that from the begining.I was a five year old when I started reading for the first time and in a year I already unterstood that point.So it's not something stange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe Disney tried to do a movie like this.Attempted rape. Murders. Sexual overtones everywhere. A story far too complex and mature for kids filled with talking gargoyles and "funny" characters. It's too boring and scary for kids, and too dumb for adults. What's But worst of all - the fact that the whole story is acceptance, and the fact that beauty is found within - and yet Esmeralda falls in love with the beautiful stranger, completely ignoring the main character of the film - because he's deformed.So, I guess the lesson here is - you can be a hero and have a heart of gold, but unless you are handsome and cool, it really doesn't matter.Easily, the worst Disney animated movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My grandparents used to have a souvenir gargoyle mounted on their staircase, which was always frightening, even when you knew it'd be there. Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame is the opposite, an anodyne, ironed-out cartoon which takes the edges off all the characters and story.It's a perfectly competently made animation (although it's rather gaudy for 18th century Paris). For all the earnest attempt to capitalise on Victor Hugo's famous tale though it's a bit of a circus - plastic songs, a plethora of unlikely extra characters and the pox of grown-up irony scattered about to entertain the chaperones in the cinema.

I won't even bother to list the numerous crimes to the original book that were committed, but it just makes me want to scream.Some may say, lay off, it's a children's movie, they shouldn't have to deal with the issues presented, but then my response is please, please, please, don't do an animated Hunchback! What's the next brilliant idea? Disney's frigging Hamlet? Nathan Lane as Captain Ahab in Disney's Moby Dick, complete with singing whale and touching reconciliation scene between Ahab and the whale at the end? Maybe they could do Disney's Oedipus, where Oedipus unknowingly kisses his sister on the cheek, and in disgusted agony over his acts, goes out and eats a REALLY STRONG sour gumball.

		<shortDescription>Take with a grain of salt: and not because of the plot deviation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The deviation from the actual plot aside (the worst trashing of a classic story yet.) there are a number of reasons I did not like this film as well as why I would recommend that parents not let their kids watch it, at least not until they can better handle some of the more mature themes.This was a rather dark movie for children. The stark ugliness of the world that Quasimodo wants to be a part of is way to sharp a contrast to the bright sunny world of the bell tower. However Disney feels the world may be, it is rarely so black and white in its differences.There are a number of rather mature scenes that may be age inappropriate for the target audience: 1. When Quasimodo is trying to loose himself in the crowd he accidentally bursts in on Esmerelda dressing for her performance. Not the worst DIRECT scene but you do a get a brief glimpse of an uncovered breast 2. Ah, the once scene that takes the cake as having too lustful an overtone. Esmerelda is dancing, using way too sexy of moves in front of Frollo, and uses a spear to pole dance. I'm sorry, but that just not appropriate in a children's movie.3. And last but not least, the numerous scenes where Frollo expresses his lust for Esmerelda.This movie was everything I have come to expect from Disney in recent years. By all means if you find yourself bored pop it in and shut down the thinker for a while. Just make sure to fast forward through a few points if toddlers are present.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is so hard to imagine that the same studio who made the magnificent BEAUTY AND THE BEAST also made this terrible little film just a short time later. It seems obvious that the final "nails in the coffin" of traditional cartoons were being hammered in by this film as it featured lousy writing, uninteresting characters, a total disregard for Victor Hugo's novel and sub-par animation. I took my oldest daughter to see it and became enraged in the opening segment of the film, when they showed the bad guy about to chuck a baby down a well!! Who thought this was appropriate for this audience? Well, from then on, the story continued to be just too adult for the audience intended--even though they added some stupid talking gargoyles to interest the little ones (and also annoy adults who came to see the film). This was simply a great story that was too dumbed down for adults and too dark for the kids. I would have MUCH preferred they marketed the cartoon strictly for adults and eliminate some of the cuteness or else make it more bland and market it to kids. But, their compromise certainly made this an annoying and pretty forgettable film when compared to the Disney Classics of the 80s and 90s.Also, and I know that many of you will see me as a narrow-minded person for this (and I probably am and don't particularly mind this being said about me), I didn't like the idea of having actors who are known for their very adult movies doing the voice-overs. While Demi Moore certainly is famous, I thought it pretty tacky that the same actress who drops her clothes in STRIPTEASE and INDECENT PROPOSAL stars in a kids' movie. Of course, this is at least better than having Woody Allen doing the main voice in ANTS (would you allow him near YOUR kids?). But as a parent, I just hate to see these sort of people glorified for our children. What next--letting Paris Hilton or Saddam Hussein do the voice-overs in some future Disney production?!</fullReview>
