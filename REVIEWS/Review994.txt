		<shortDescription>An unforgettable accident that paved the low road for film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Detour just a bad dream? Or a masochistic reverie dredged up out of the sumps of self-loathing? Long before setting out on the road trip that took such a disastrous turn, Tom Neal was a picky eater at life's banquet. Pounding the ivories in a Manhattan nitery, he sulks that his talent goes unappreciated (when a drunk tips him a ten-spot, it's 'a piece of paper crawling with germs'). He sabotages his rapturous renditions of Chopin and Brahms waltzes with a left-handed boogie-woogie beat. When his girl, the club's shantoozie, tells him that he'll make it to Carnegie Hall 'someday,' he snaps back, 'Sure, as a janitor. Maybe I'll make my debut in the basement,' and 'Yeah, someday ? if I don't get arthritis first.' Neal's lousy with what we now call issues.When his fiancée heads to Los Angeles to try for the lush life, he lets her go, then, suddenly lonesome, decides to hitch out to the coast. In Arizona, he thumbs a ride from a pill-popping driver (Edmund McDonald) with scratches on his wrist from tussling with a 'wild animal' ? a woman he had picked up in Louisiana. When Neal takes over the wheel during a rainstorm, McDonald up and dies ? and conks his head on a rock as he slumps out the passenger door. Looks bad. Since he casts himself as eternal victim, Neal, though blameless, guiltily drags the body into the desert and assumes its identity (along with car and wallet). Later, at a gas station, he offers a lift to another thumb-jockey (Ann Savage), even though she looks like she 'just got thrown off the crummiest freight train in the world.' (Does the phrase 'self-destructive' strike a familiar note?) In fact, she's none other than the beast who sank her claws into the deceased ? and plans to make an even bigger feast out of Neal....The stubble on Neal's unshaved chin can't disguise his pouty, pretty-boy looks, and he proves just right as this callow, ill-starred loser (a better actor would have added superfluous dimensions). If he and his self-absorbed predicament start to wear a little thin, it ceases to matter when Savage arrives halfway through to give a performance that beggars all description. Owing either to Ulmer's or her own genius (or to exigent production values), her hard face stays stripped of glamor ? when she does slap on the war paint, the effect is primitive, alarming, with eyebrows that looked slashed on with a stiletto under an unkempt riot of hair. She starts off slowly, until, supposedly dozing in the shotgun seat, her eyes fly open to size up and devour Neal. It's the most terrifying instant in Detour. From then on in, she's all shrew all the time, drunk or sober, intimidating or seductively manipulative. Thus Savage's Vera entered film history as the hardest-boiled of its femmes fatales. And Neal never knew what hit him.Insolently original ? a classic in a class by itself ? Detour is by no stretch of the imagination a conventional masterpiece (if masterpieces can be counted as conventional). It shows evidence of starting out to be something ? a longer, more fully developed movie ? quite different from what it ended up . Groundwork gets laid for developments that never come to pass. What seems to be intended as the plot's centerpiece ? a scheme to pass Neal off as McDonald, the lost scion of a wealthy family ? comes to nothing. As does Savage's ominous cough, a clue to her subsequent indifference ('I'm on my way anyhow') to that 'perfume Arizona hands out free to murderers.' Somewhere along the way, Detour ran out of time, or money, or film stock, and was cobbled together out of footage already in the can, with the aid of peculiar voice-overs (in the last-ditch manner of The Magnificent Ambersons or My Son John). Against all odds, it still worked, and remains one of the best known and most unforgettable titles in the film noir canon, a stunningly effective piece of work that manages to encapsulate, in 67 minutes, all the inchoate angst that informs the cycle. It may have been an accident, but it's the kind of accident you can't peel your eyes off of. When the noir cycle began to coalesce in the early 1940s, it looked like it was going to take the high road of starry, big-budget prestige productions (The Maltese Falcon, I Wake Up Screaming, The Glass Key, Laura, Double Indemnity, Mildred Pierce). Edgar G. Ulmer's Detour took the low road. A Poverty-Row production empty of box-office names, it was shot on a few cheap sets in a matter of days. But it sweated off a raw power that other alert film-makers working on the fringes of the industry were quick to emulate; the next few years would see Fall Guy, The Guilty, Suspense, Violence, I Wouldn't Be In Your Shoes, Decoy (the pick, along with Detour, of this particular litter) ? all done with wannabes or has-beens in cast and crew, visually often ugly (the murky lighting more a matter of necessity than moody esthetic choice). It was often inspired movie-making on the most frayed of shoestring budgets. And yet, with a few exceptions, this second-feature slot was the niche into which film noir would settle until it ran its course in the late 1950s. Which raises a question: Without Detour paving the way for quick-and-dirty, sensational fodder to fill up double bills ? B-movies that the suits in the front offices didn't much care about and so paid little attention to ? would the noir cycle have been but a brief flash in the pan? Would it have stayed the passion only of a handful of French cineastes? Would it have amounted to a cycle at all? The debt owed to Detour may be greater than acknowledged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the marvels in film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the all-time great examples of film noir. It can practically be used to define the genre: shadowy black and white cinematography; a star-crossed protagonist ("...fate sticks out a leg to trip you."); a femme fatale (the unforgettable Ann Savage as Vera); cynical voice-over narration; ambiguous morality. All these elements are brought together magnificently by director Edgar G. Ulmer, who incredibly made this movie in several days on a shoestring budget. His direction is so masterful that the low budget sets only add to the film. This is a great masterpiece and one of the marvels in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No budget masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Roberts (Tom Neal) is a depressed NYC piano player whose girlfriend leaves him to try her luck in CA. He follows her by hitchhiking his way. He's picked up by a man who (inexplicably) dies while Al is driving. Naturally Al does everything wrong...like dumping the body and then picking up Vera (Ann Savage) a totally amoral woman. Then things barrel horribly out of control.You can quibble about plot points (a certain death is highly implausible) but this IS a masterpiece of the genre. It's one of the grimmest film noirs of its time. It was made by a poverty row studio (PRC) on no budget. Actually the lack of budget helps the story--everything appears dark and grim fitting the tone of the story. Also they had an excellent director (Edgar G. Ulmer) and a great script by Martin Goldsmith. Also Neal was very good as Roberts and Savage is exceptional as Vera (there's a scene where she explodes at Roberts in a car which is truly scary). It's also all wrapped up in a tight economical 69 minutes. This has deservedly been a cult movie for many years.Good luck finding a clear print with good sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I got my first VCR in 1985, the two movies I immediately rented were "Baby Doll" and "Detour." I have revisited the former many times but it's been 20 years since I saw "Detour." I like it even better.It moves in a seamless manner. The narrator is drawn as we watch into further and further degradation.The movie has a beautiful look. I'm sure it's a cliché to note this but it resembles a Hopper painting. It also bears the trademarks of Edgar Ulmer's movies: Literate dialogue and classical movie, no matter how low the budget.Tom Neal is a mournful, appealing protagonist. He's weak, not really bad. Ann Savage, of course, is terrifying as Vera, the hitchhiker from everyone's worst nightmare.Al's descent from blonde soubrette Sue to consumptive, murderous Vera is terrifying. Yet, though it passes by us quickly, it is fully believable."Detour" is a true work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can quibble about details, but it's hard to deny that this is a classic in its genre. Al Roberts (Tom Neal) makes a series of bad choices that bring him low. They're the choices of a not particularly bright young man under increasing pressure. Vera (Ann Savage) is the quintessential Bad Girl. Their repartee, indeed much of the dialogue throughout, is a big part of the attraction of this film. The plot, presented in flashback, barrels on relentlessly to its conclusion. The characterizations, dialogue, plot, photography--all contribute to make this taut, gritty film a must for film noir enthusiasts. My only real disappointment is with the rather abrupt end. On the whole, though, great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bottom rung studio rings loud kudos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Me, PRC, the sub-Republic/Monogram indie studio that was considered the most cardboard of studios managed on this occasion to actually create a deliciously nasty noir. DETOUR, as many commentators here like to spoil for you by telling you THE WHOLE STORY is an excellent low budget film of one man's descent into accidental crime. So powerful are the screen images and the seedy tawdry drama that one almost forgets they are watching one of the cheapest (and profitable) films ever made. Monogram Pictures made several highly appreciated low end noirs (like the truly shocking DECOY of 1946) and must have been very envious of the now enduring $66,000 PRC masterpiece DETOUR. In fact I would not be surprised to find that Monogram were inspired enough to make DECOY as a result. Tom Neal sadly actually went to jail in real life in a genuine DETOUR like way and vicious Ann Savage lived up to her name in a few more noir shockers for various crummy B/W outfits who specialized until the mid 50s in similar films. NARROW MARGIN and KISS ME DEADLY are equals. DETOUR is one of the most rewarding grim descents into 40s desperation film making and the doomed loser played by Tom Neal certainly is the most tragic of them all. This is a great film. It is all it is meant to be and viewers who sit riveted to the unfolding emotional horror are genuinely rewarded. Originally TIFFANY STUDIOS in the 20s the lot became for hire after 1932 then was the home for GRAND NATIONAL from 1935 -39 and morphed into PRC in 1940. With a huge shed of snazzy 20s furniture and sets from the previous 15 years it allowed PRC's budget conscious front office to upgrade their art direction by virtue of all these classy fittings costumes bought and left there by the sophisticated view of those previous managements. I have seen a number of independent B grade30s pix made there with the same sets and outfittings inbetween management reincarnation. PRC in the late 40s were bought up by EAGLE-LION a US/Brit franchise headed by J Arthur Rank and rolled in 1950 into UNITED ARTISTS. As one journalist aptly wrote "No other poverty row outfit were able to cash in their chips so handsomely". Good on 'em! See DETOUR and gasp!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Haunting Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One recurrent thought passes through my mind as I watch "Detour." It is that I do not believe a single moment of its story-telling. It isn't because of the incredible coincidences or the bitter irony but because of the simple goodness of the main character. Characters in film noir are not role models or good people placed into bad circumstances. They are bad people who believe that they're good.The characters in "Double Indemnity," "Body Heat," or "The Talented Mr. Ripley" do not think of themselves as bad people. They believe they are forced into their crimes by the world, which is the essential difference between crime movies and noir. As pointed out by Roger Ebert: "the bad guys in crime movies know they're bad and want to be, while a noir hero thinks he's a good guy who has been ambushed by life.""Detour" is told through the central character, Al Roberts, who recalls his story as one made through impossible coincidences and horrible luck. But there is something not right about his story. The audience can pick out the incongruities and flaws as soon as they're told. Was Charles Haskell's death really the result of bad luck or simply a murderer trying to convince himself that it was? We wonder if it is possible that a person as innocent as Al says he is can be forced into such immoral activities. However, the explanation is quite clear. Al is retelling the story not as a true confession but as a man reviewing his defense to the police.Watching the movie, I was reminded of Tanazaki's "The Key," a novel in which the main character deliberately lies to the audience as a way of reaching the story's conclusion. We do not see a real conclusion to "Detour," but we sense that the police will find the same flaws in Al's story as we do. And that is not a fatal form of story-telling but a way of looking into the mind of a true noir character and seeing the darker depths of his soul. That is why film noir is so haunting and why this movie is so definitive in its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the film that made me love old movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Detour for the first time on TV when I was 7 or 8 years old in the mid 60's. It used to play quite often, and I never missed it. I used to have dreams about it when I was a kid, and make believe that I was on the run, and impersonating a millionaire's son.I lost track of the film until recently. I was flipping channels and came across it on TCM. I knew immediately it was my long lost film. I enjoyed it as much the other night at the age of 43, as I did at the age of 7. It is a true classic, and simply ageless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hitchhiker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a tribute to Edgar Ulmer that "Detour", made for about thirty thousand dollars, still keeps an interest with new fans who discover it. According to some comments, "Detour" has not been seen in this country in quite a while, but we recall the first time we saw it when it was presented at New York's Film Forum as part of a Film Noir festival in the late eighties. The copy shown recently on TCM has a poor quality, while the print we saw at Film Forum was in better condition.What makes "Detour" a must see, is the clever way its narrative unfolds on the screen. Al and Sue are seen first in the small bistro he plays the piano and she sings, in Manhattan. Sue sings a happy rendition of "I Can't Believe You're in Love with Me", and Al shows he can improvise on a theme by Chopin as he jazzes it up. When Sue decides to pack it and move to L.A., Tom promises he'll follow. The tragic mistake he makes is to intent crossing the country hitchhiking. Even in the forties, it's a miracle he made it alive!In Arizona Al meets the kind Charles Haskell, who happens to be going all the way to L.A. and offers him a ride. The two men develop an easy friendship until the point when Haskell dies of an apparent heart attack. Al disposes of the body and keeps going, assuming now, Haskell's persona. At the nearest gas station he sees a pretty woman, Vera, who appears is hitchhiking, and offers her a ride. This will prove to be his biggest mistake.Vera turned out to be Al's worst nightmare. She knows Al is not Haskell since she, herself, knows the man. Al ends up a virtual prisoner hiding in the apartment they have rented in Hollywood. He can't escape. When Vera realizes there's a lot of money to be made by having Al pretend to impersonate the dead Haskell, he refuses. She threatens to call the police and he is left on the other room pulling the telephone cord...The film works because all the elements are in place in this satisfying 67 minutes work and because of the great performances Mr. Ulmer got out of Tom Neal and Ann Savage. Edmund MacDonald and Claudia Drake played Haskell and Sue."Detour" was shot in two sets and it shows. It's a small film that doesn't pretend what it's not, and that's basically why audiences seem to like it as it's discovered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ann Savage - Nothing Else Needs To Be Said</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two words - Ann Savage - make this film worth viewing....and owning, if you are a film noir collector.She is not a major player here. There is one lead actor (Tom Neal) and a few supporting ones in this ultra-low budget, amateurish-production values film. However, her character "Vera" has a place in film noir history as probably the nastiest woman to ever make an appearance in this genre.Savage is so brutal that her insults, put-downs and nasty demeanor just make you laugh out loud. If this was made today, I could the imagine the profanity spewing out of her. She shows you don't need that to get your points across.The movie, as a whole, is not as good as many critics would have you believe. Until Savage enters, it's so-so at best. Since it's only 68 minutes, one can endure some mediocre material which features a real loser-of-a-man until the femme fatale arrives. Neal's character is one of the ultimate downers on film and his life is just one big soap opera, at least if you listen to him moan about it. Without Ann, one viewing of this film would have been enough because Neal is just too much of a whining wimp to endure more than once.....but sweet little Vera saves the day, er film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boogie Woogie Chopin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.You can watch this the way the establishment wants you to: as a seminal noir, cheaply but effectively done, with most of the enjoyment from appreciating its role in film history. Sort of like visiting Nixon's childhood home, one gets a certain indirect value from the knowledge of the experience rather than the experience itself.I believe that ruins the whole thing. Noir - real noir - is destroyed by such histories. Either you have to take it as it is, or discard it. Noir films by definition have no history, they are themselves a subversion of history.Noir is an intrusion of the narrator into our personal space. It exists less as an artifact than as the experience of a conversation. In noir, the actor looks at us and tells us a story. The link between the teller and us is a matter of pure chance, and that chance about relationships always underlies the story. What we see is the story as invented - or partially invented - by the teller. In this case, the narrator is an unimaginative dope, so it makes perfect sense that the sets and acting all be frankly artificial. And that the dialog all be pulled out of pulp fiction. And that the lighting be that vulgar, emotional stuff the Germans liked before it became art.This a story (the narrator's) about a story (Al's) in which he is tricked - almost - into telling a story (about him being Haskell) so that the woman who wants to be called Vera doesn't tell a story (to the police).You can read elsewhere about the various components of this (including the remarkable flash forward in the midst of the flashbacks), but you probably will find no mention of the Chopin. Chopin factors in all sorts of film, from `Five Easy Pieces' to `Autumn Sonata' to the recent `The Pianist.' he is to solo piano as noir is to film, indeed inspired a literary tradition that noir reflects.So pay attention to the boogie woogie rendition of Chopin at the point in the story where fate is perturbed. It wasn't the germy ten dollar bill. This is actually a wonderful musical essay. I wish I knew who created it. Could it be Rubenstein from the film `Carnegie Hall' of the following year? The hands say yes.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That's life, whichever way you turn, fate sticks out a foot and trips you."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ann Savage gets my vote for the person I would least like to meet under any circumstances, much less as a hitchhiker at a desert gas station. Her character Vera in Edgar Ulmer's noir mind bender "Detour" sets a new standard for women of her disposition, those with a capital 'B'. The film builds intensity as it's protagonist Al Roberts (Tom Neal) finds himself in a nightmare world, if not of his own creation, then at least one in which he shares major complicity. His character's voice over narration reveals a tortured mind, feverishly painting himself into a corner from which there is no escape, until events spiral out of control and strand him in an emotional twilight zone.It would have been interesting to see how any number of scenarios might have played out given some of the film's set-ups, such as the dying millionaire or the mysterious coughing fits suffered by Vera. Instead, her manic manipulation of the spineless Roberts suggests only one sure outcome, that at some point this powder keg must detonate. One might have expected a more direct confrontation, though Vera's demise is ultimately suited to her own unique propensity for evil. Sorry, wrong number."Detour" is a strangely disorienting movie, with a reputation that transcends it's modest origins. Even it's ending, which seems like the end of the road for Roberts, leaves enough left open to the imagination to suggest that perhaps he can work things out with just the right roll of the dice. But what about Haskell, what about his dying father, what about Vera's corpse at the rooming house, what about Sue? The movie leaves more loose ends than any other I've ever seen, and doesn't even seem to care. In that respect, it's a lot like Al Roberts at the end of his rope, with the viewer left to decide whether or not to kick out the chair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hapless hitchhiker's noir nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American Dream becomes a nightmare for a musician hitchhiking cross-country to see his girl in Edgar Ulmer's quintessential film noir, a bleak exercise in minimalism (shot in 6 days using 4 1/2 sets and costing $30,000) that's now considered a masterpiece of low budget film-making. From a shadowy, expressionistic New York to a starkly sunlit Southwest, Al Roberts' odyssey conversely goes from a kind of optimism to a near-nihilistic fatalism along the way. Tom Neal's self-pitying Al tells his tale of woe in flashback but every "twist of fate" he paranoically fears is, in reality, free will. Drifter/grifter Vera, another hitchhiker (and one of life's disposables), can be as sadistic as Al is masochistic and when they meet it spells the end of the line for both of them. The aptly named Ann Savage shrieks and sneers her way into the Femme Fatale Hall Of Fame as the vulture-like harpy Vera. Al Roberts was full of self-fulfilling prophecy and this movie foreshadowed baby-faced Tom Neal's real-life downward spiral from movie star to wife killer. Director Ulmer's low rent artistry has a compelling pull; it's like "discovering a Rembrandt drawing wrapped around a wad of bubblegum". Using fog, shadows and a few props, he was able to create mis-en-scene out of nothing. Ulmer actually preferred working on "Poverty Row" to the big studios as it offered him complete control. In Ulmer's grim vision, the American Dream is unattainable no matter who tries (legally or not) for the brass ring: Al Roberts is bitter over an aborted career as a concert pianist even before the film opens and his following of Horace Greely's "Go West young man" led to him being swallowed up by darkness. His girlfriend, Sue, is still optimistic about her future and decides to try Hollywood but once there ends up slinging hash. The self-made bookie, Haskell, had suffered setbacks in Miami but plans to turn some jack into a small fortune once he reaches L.A. He never does. In life he had run away from home many years before and didn't know he was the heir to a $15 million fortune. Vera is masochistic Al's aggressive alter-ego. They're both sullen and stare straight ahead once they're picked up on the road but Vera, unlike Al, hasn't given up or given in and has a few shady ideas to make it big once in California. She dies trying. DETOUR is not unlike the Depression-set THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY? in that, like lemmings, folks come to sunny California to pursue the American Dream only to find it's "the end of the line" and there's no where else to go. Unlike Al Roberts, Vera generates some empathy. She's not unlike Gloria in THEY SHOOT HORSES -tough breaks have hardened her and she's used to fending for herself. Dying of consumption, how many times was she beate or raped as a homeless drifter without family or friends? The route she takes to "make it" are outside the law but, then again, why would she have any faith in societal rules? Often considered one of the meanest femme fatales in all of "noirdom", she's never killed anyone (not even responsible for anyone's death) and isn't so tough after all. Vera nearly (but not quite) whimpers "You hurt me" when Al manhandles her and she pathetically makes it clear that Al can become sexual if he likes. At least she tries ...which is something Al can't (or won't) do. Roberts' overheated, desperate voice-over narration is often at odds with the flashbacks themselves and raises more questions than it answers. It doesn't explain things so much as call into doubt any rational understanding of his tale. Call it "Al's alibi" -excuses he believes -and desperately wants the viewer to believe as well ("fate, or some other mysterious force, can put the finger on you or me for no good reason at all"). Al won't take the blame for anything. His paranoia is such that it's a foregone conclusion everyone would think he'd killed Haskell; therefore it's logical to just switch identities with the dead man and continue on. We're listening to elaborate reasoning as we watch a simple theft take place. Once Roberts has all the trappings of the American Dream (new clothes, a car and a wad of cash), his trip takes the most downbeat turn of all: he gives Vera a lift. Common sense would dictate keeping a low profile -especially since Haskell had to toss a dame out of his car because she wouldn't "be nice". It would be even odds that the girl Roberts is giving a lift to is the same one. She was. I'm up in the air about the ending's final image: Did the police actually pick up Al -or is that a reverie/hallucination of forgone conclusion he's having while sitting in the diner? It's a self-fulfilling prophecy either way -and a good show all the way around.The barren Arizona landscape in Ulmer's film is reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO. Like Ulmer, Hitchcock made his B &amp; W low-budget film on purpose as part of his artistic vision. Like Al Roberts, Marion Crane is heading West to start anew while on the run after committing a rather shady act. Both are questioned by policemen along the way. Both do day-and-night driving with their eyes reflected in the rear-view mirror while they mull over past events. Both want to ditch their cars once in California and end up in a used car lot. Both encounter unexpected death in cheap motel rooms (although in Al's case it's a cheap apartment for rent).It wouldn't have been the same, of course, but John Garfield was interested in filming the novel and Warner Bros. almost made DETOUR as an A picture with Garfield as Al, Ida Lupino as Vera, and Ann Sheridan as Sue if PRC had been willing to let the property go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not "the best B-movie ever made"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not "the greatest B movie ever made" - as one critic claims, but it has its moments. It is arguably unique for its time, but as film noirs go, it is pretty ordinary, following many noir conventions. Some of the rules of film noir:1) People are rotten, and women are the rottenest people. 2) Society lives by rule #1, so people always believe the worst about each other 3) At the bottom of every man's trouble is a very bad woman 4) People are weak and stupid, and men are the weakest and stupidest 5) Evil schemes never succeed. 6) Things are the worst when they look the best.Spoilers follow:Life has always been tough for Al Roberts, but he never realizes just how tough life can be until it's too late. His troubles begin when his girlfriend dumps him and heads for Hollywood to become a star. His first mistake is deciding to follow her. In his circumstances, the only way he can get to Hollywood is by hitch-hiking. He is picked up by a gambler who offers to take him all the way to California, and in appreciation he agrees to share the driving. Things are looking good (see rule #6), so we know this is where it starts to get interesting. And stupid. The gambler dies of natural causes (fortunately, he wasn't driving) and instead of calling the police, Al decides to rob him, bury him, and take his car, on the grounds that the police would never believe him if he told the truth. See rule #2 above.Although frightened that someone will find out his secret, and turn him into the police, Al nevertheless decides to pass the kindness of the driver who stopped for him onto someone else. So, he stops and picks up a hitch-hiker, a woman no less. See rule #1 and rule #4. This movie has one great moment that redeems all the craziness of its dysfunctional universe, and that is when Al - and the audience - realize that his passenger *knows* .. knows what happened to the gambler who gave him a ride. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it. I'll just say it's one of the best plot twists ever .. From this point forward, Al is under this woman's control. He dances to her tune, and she has all sorts of plans for him, most of which would not pass close legal scrutiny. See rules #3 and #4. There is another priceless moment in this movie that'll you'll miss if you blink. Al and Vera, the woman hitch-hiker, are in LA, and have rented an apartment. They make a liquor run for their supper, and after finishing the bottle, Vera announces "I'm going to bed" and puts her hand on Al's shoulder in an unmistakable "care-to-join-me?" gesture. Al's a wuss, but even he has enough spine to pass this invitation. See rules #1 and #3, though Al's response here belies rule #4. So, is Detour a good movie, or not? Yes, it's a good movie, but it is not a great one. What makes the movie special are the elements that cannot be described, only appreciated while watching the movie. For a non-existent budget and a six-day shooting schedule, Detour is a masterpiece. I can't imagine a better movie being made under similar trying circumstances. From All Movie Guide: "Directer Ulmer .. succeeds in creating a memorable, dark, nightmare world, uncaring, cynical and brutal. "I thought every part of the theatrical elements of this story were masterfully done. I love the amoral, fatalistic, decadent ambiance of film noir, and this movie certainly has that. But, the whole movie turns on a plot point that will not hold: Al thinks that no one would believe him if he told the truth about the man who gave him a ride. In a film noir universe, that may be true; in the real world, it is not, so I cannot buy into the movie experience at the most pivotal point of the story. For that reason, I can only rate Detour a 6 out of 10. Still, it is a remarkable movie given the circumstances under which it was produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best of the genre. At noir festivals I have organized, this is the film that people talk about. Many of the old-tymers feel cheated that they never had seen the movie before. Those that have wondered why it was not available until recently.Cutting to the quick, this movie was made from idea to answer print in a little over two weeks with next to nothing in the way of a budget. The actors are not glamorous or even remotely likeable. Neal's character, Al Roberts, is not the smartest guy, he makes all the wrong decisions and never makes an attempt to try--period. He alone is responsible for his troubles. Savage's Vera is not the prettiest femme fatale, but she is the sexiest, most devious, and fatal in a hatchet-face sort of way.But it is Goldsmith's masterful script and Ulmer's brilliant direction that make Detour a cinematic masterpiece.Like a punch in slow motion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Detour" (1945), directed by Egar G. Ulmer, could just as well be called "Fate" due to the film's preoccupation with it and the way it throws up every conceivable misfortune at Al (Tom Neal), a man hitch-hiking from New York to Los Angeles to see his girlfriend in L.A.; while taking a ride with Charles Haskell Jr (Edmund MacDonald), Haskell, obviously with some type of ailment, fulls asleep during a rainstorm. When Al tries to wake him, he falls out of the car, dead. Panicking, Al takes Haskell's money, car and ID. The voice-over, spoken by him, says he didn't kill him, but is this a case of unreliable subjectivity? While driving, Al picks up super-slut and femme fatale Vera (Ann Savage), who knew the real Haskell and blackmails Al into giving her all his money and using him as her will dictates.Made by cult director Edgar G. Ulmer during his time in the Z-trenches, this potent film noir was either made in six or twenty-four days and cost from $20,000 to $100,000, all depending which source you go by. Either way, it's a Poverty Row quickie, probably the best film to come out of the Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), with leads you've never heard of before and never will again (Tom Neal was convicted of manslaughter, and served four years in jail). But out of straw, Ulmer weaves gold, and with the aid of some suitably dark and murky photography, courtesy of Benjamin H. Kline, he concocts a brooding, fatalistic tale of a man utterly beaten by bad luck, whose every move is counteracted by fate. The very well written narration spells it all at the end as Al bleakly walks off into to the night. The direction is faultless, and the sheer cheapness and seediness make this an overpowering film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ann Sure Wasn't Called "Savage" For Nothing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detour, a 1945 low-budget Thriller and near-perfect example of Film Noir excellence, was severely marred by the scene-chewing antics of Ann Savage, who literally bulldozed her way through her part like a rabid bitch in heat.Detour lost significant points all on account of this wretched Savage wench. It was a good thing that her character wasn't present for the first half of this film, otherwise Detour would've been a total write-off in my books.But once Savage's presence was firmly established in Detour's last half hour, the story deteriorated at an alarming rate and became so unbearable to watch at times that I almost turned it off in pure disgust.Prior to Savage's savage entrance, Detour was an exceptionally intriguing Suspense/Drama about a honky-tonk pianist from NYC, named Al Roberts, whose life takes an unexpected and unpleasant U-Turn when he suddenly decides to hitch-hike out to Los Angeles in pursuit of his girlfriend (not Savage, thankfully).Murder, blackmail, and sheer desperation all await young Al Roberts as he travels along the road, heading in the direction of the land of milk and honey.Regardless of its low budget, Detour (filmed in black &amp; white) obviously had excellent high-production values. And actor Tom Neal, as Al Roberts, was superb. I'd say that his performance was close to being on par with anything that I've ever seen from the likes of Robert Mitchum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this film on what I thought would be a poor quality DVD copy but it turned out to be both an excellent print and a fantastic film. For me "Detour" ranks alongside "Gun Crazy" as one of the best examples of pulp noir. The pulp noir films were turned out by Ulmer and other directors of this School from the 30s to the 60s. I look forward to seeing the new documentary Edgar G. Ulmer: The Man Off-Screen, which opened in August and provides more detail on his life and films. Interestingly pulp noir advocates Corman and Wenders are featured in this. Surely "Detour" confirms Ulmer's much underrated place in both the noir and pulp schools.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film does what most can't seem to afford to, and cuts to the chase, which is ironic because you would be hard-pressed to find a lower-budget film. The plot, while thoroughly contrived on the surface, takes on a rich depth by virtue of its narrator, who is in many ways untrustworthy. For example, every scene with Sue in it has something wrong with it. That pervasive song, the London fog and impossible cross streets in New York, and the general vagueness and lifelessness of the situations and people surrounding his memories all contribute to the question: Does she even exist? His highly improbably stories about Haskell and Vera leave the viewer wondering whom to trust, particularly considering Vera's remarks about his appearance, which contradict everything we see in the man. Tom Neal pulls off the part beautifully, playing a character who is convincing and easy with whom to sympathize while still narrating an all but impossible story. Ann Savage as Vera is (in my book) one of the most chilling characters in film history, with her piercing glare and cruel retorts. If nothing else, the car scene in which she wakes during one of Al's voiceovers makes this film worth seeing. Overall, the acting is superb.The dialogue is downright funny in many places in addition to being clever throughout. The score, while more or less dominated by the song "I Can't Believe That You're in Love with Me," is effective because this song is so fitting to describe the relationship (fantasy?) between Sue and Al. The rest of the music is not particularly memorable but fits the film well. Watch for the use of utterly nonsensical slang that I can only attribute to satire of the genre.To summarize, this film takes what it has and goes far with it. The 68 minute running time is perfect, without dragging the thing out as many films (even good ones) do today. The fact that this film is almost sixty years old and still funny and engaging makes it a fairly timeless masterpiece in my opinion. 8/10 in its own right, bumped up to 9/10 by the incredible small budget, short shooting time (6 DAYS!), and otherwise undistinguished actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong Turn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Detour," directed by Edgar G. Ulmer, is one of the few rare motion pictures of any era that stays with you long after the credits fade away. Like "D.O.A." (1949), "Detour" is a B-movie filled with an uncountable number of imperfections and flaws, yet its haunting narrative and excellent lead character helps engrave it in our memory.Like "Fargo" and "A Simple Plan," "Detour" is about a seemingly innocent and brief idea that soon unravels and turns into a dreaded nightmare. It all tarts with Al Roberts (Tom Neal), a lonely, self-pitying hitchhiker who recalls his story to us in a beaten and dingy diner. A man in the diner starts to play a song on the jukebox: "I Can't Believe You Fell in Love with Me." "Turn that off!" Al yells. He doesn't like the song, and we have a feeling we're about to find out why.He starts his story at a time when he was a happy piano player with a girlfriend named Sue. After tiring of the poor life, Sue decides to travel to Hollywood in order to find a new job. Left stranded by himself, Al soon musters the courage to make the long trek to California by himself. Once there, he'll reunite with Sue and they'll start a new life.Along the way, Roberts is picked up by a traveler named Haskell (Edmund MacDonald), a nice fellow who is so trustworthy that he even lets Roberts drive the vehicle part of the way to California. He also reveals a nasty scar on his hand to Roberts, and says that some "dame" bit him a while back along the road.After Haskell dies of natural causes in the car, Roberts is left facing the opportunity of alerting the police of the death or burying the body far from sight. Realizing that the police wouldn't believe him if he told them his story, he decides to take Haskell's ID, clothes, and money. ("It seemed like an awful shame to leave all that money there.")Convinced that he's done the right thing, Haskell crosses the border into California and soon finds himself picking up a fellow hitchhiker named Vera (Ann Savage). But, as Haskell so adequately puts it, why couldn't she have been a different girl? Why did it have to be the girl that Haskell gave a ride to the day before? "Where'd you bury his body?" she barks.She doesn't believe his innocent story after he tells her. But she is a ruthless young lady, "No older than twenty-four," and doesn't care about his innocence--she just wants to make some money out of the ordeal. Her idea is so ridiculously outrageous that Roberts soon schemes a way to escape her grasp.The film is a brutal one, both literally and figuratively. Filmed in six simple days with an ultra-low budget and some fairly unknown actors, "Detour" is proof that sometimes films don't need to be well made to be entertaining and effective. Here is a movie so technically poor that our narration begins with lighting in the background being shut off and a flashlight beam being shone down upon Neal's face. But, as silly and amateur as this may sound, I thought it was one of the most haunting narrative techniques of all time--a haunting technique that colorized filming would never be able to accentuate upon.I enjoyed the acting in "Detour" very much, especially after hearing how "ham-handed" it was. Tom Neal--who comes across as a sort of moody, earlier version of a frustrated Kurt Russell--is a real scene-stealer. His portrayal of a man slipping down a steep slope, unable to return to the flat surface, is extraordinarily good--and I imagine quite controversial for the time. The implications of what his character does at times during the film are often the sort of stuff that would disturb today's audiences.Neal, as our film noir's hero, is probably one of the oldest anti-heroes of all time. In today's age there are doubts over whether or not his story is essentially true or fabricated--did he really kill Haskell with his own hands and make up the rest to satisfy his own sense of self-satisfaction? We'll never know the true answer. Part of what makes this film so engagingly playful is the way it twists everything about so that we never really know for sure what's happening, or what's about to happen, even on multiple viewings.Its director, Edgar G. Ulmer (who I am not related to as far as I know), had previously united Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff for the first time in "The Black Cat," filmed eleven years prior. "The Black Cat," also filmed on a fairly low budget, is a major cult horror film to this day--and was a fairly popular film at the time; the equivalent of Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees' infamous showdown in last year's "Freddy vs. Jason." So it's strange to think that Ulmer, a German refugee from Hitler, would lower himself to the depths of die-hard B-movie-making."Detour" is far from a perfect motion picture. It's often quite corny, and seriously flawed in terms of filmmaking. Sometimes you can tell where two scenes were spliced together to form a whole. In fact, the entire movie was essentially filmed in a car with a rear projection of California landscape and a hotel room.Here is indeed ample proof that aspiring directors need not always worry about all the technical quirks. It helps to make a good movie a great one, but more important is a good story and fine characters, and if anything, "Detour" more than makes up for its literal flaws with strong storytelling.5/5- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bottom Of the Barrel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detour is a cult item from 1945 about a piano player who hitch-hikes to California to meet up with his old flame and runs into a few snags along the way. Nothing goes right for him, and even when things are or seem to be looking up, something bad happens. Detour is about as noir as film noir gets. Directed by Edgar Ulmer on a miniscule budget, it's a very cheap film, and looks it, yet this works in its favor, giving it a nightmare quality (ever have a nightmare in Technicolor and Panavision?).Martin Goldsmith story is pure pulp stuff, though some of the dialogue, especially between the leading character and a guy who gives him a ride, is sharp and credible. The acting is variable, with Tom Neal looking so forlorn at the start of his journey that one wouldn't be surprised if he'd been picked up on suspicion. Of what? Anything. He just looks suspicious. As the woman from hell he meets up with, Ann Savage is terrifying from her first glance. She was either a great unsung actress or a crazy woman who just happened to get fortuitously cast and was merely playing herself. Her scenes with the passively hunky Neal are bizarre and convincing. They play not so much off as against each other, as people in real life often do.This is essentially a depressing movie about people living on the fringes of society; on highways, diners and used car lots. The pessimism is of the kind that was fashionable in the forties, though most noirs have fancier or at least more appealing settings. I think that part of Detour's appeal, aside from its being very well-made, is that it's about people they don't tend to make movies about. Hitchcock did the same with Psycho, though its characters are a bit more genteel and middle class. Detour is more bottom of the barrel, a cheap, sleazy movie about cheap, sleazy people. I respect the talent that went into it, but this is not a likeable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling non-masterpiece filled with low-budget drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detour (1945)This is a movie with a huge reputation and if you aren't into films big time, or into film noir in particular, or if you don't have a taste for the funky and low-budget, you'll be only partly interested here. Even the great climax is so ridiculous it's laughable, but yet it's supposed to be a bit over the top and perhaps metaphoric rather than real.And yet the movie is on some level depending on its gritty realism to be unique and to such you in. That is, you or I could easily be a hitchhiker who gets so involved in a mixup and criminal mishap our whole lives get ruined. Or so it happens to the leading guy, Al Roberts, played by pretty good unknown actor Tom Neal (an ex-boxer). He's so utterly despondent as he relates the movie in interior dialog flashbacks it's bordering on camp. But not completely. You get his woe and want to know the details.One reason the movie survives its simple mechanics and uneven acting is director Edgar Ulmer, famous (maybe even more famous) for his other great excessively moody classic, "The Black Cat," a decade before. Ulmer has a visually expressive style that trades realism for effect, and it's great to watch. It so happens the "Detour" has some of the critical elements of film noir--before film noir had fully developed into a genre. That is, the loner against the world, the femme fatale (and what a doozy in Ann Savage), and moody cinematography. There are some good noirish lines, too, in the uneven script.So cast off hope for a great movie but get set for a (possibly) great time watching. It's fast, too, just an hour long, and the twists keep coming. The copies that are circulating (including Netflix streaming) are public domain and pretty rough. If you want the best experience you might try to see it on TCM, which has a decent copy. The Alpha DVD is supposed to be the best DVD version, but it's no Criterion (which hasn't released it). But then, maybe the low quality is part of the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens to a loser when he's at the wrong place at the wrong time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an interesting and very entertaining addition to the film noir category.It's most interesting, first, because it is a B movie that worked, and worked well; second, it must be one of the least expensive ? I nearly wrote 'cheapest' ? films made in the 1940s; third, it gave the movie audience the poisonous and perilous Vera (Ann Savage), whom many would argue was the deadliest femme fatale in cinema history (I wouldn't go that far, but, man, she was baaaaaad!); and finally, it gives the audience perhaps the morally weakest male protagonist, in my opinion, to be seen in film ? the night club king (ha! ha!) of the ivories, Al Roberts (Tom Neal).Here's the bare bones: Al, a disgruntled pianist in New York, sets out to hitch-hike to see his girl, Sue (Claudia Drake) in LA. Along the way, he's picked up by Charles Haskell (Edmund MacDonald), a well-to-do con man who has a heart attack and dies; Al, being uncertain and scared about facing the law, worsens his situation by dumping Haskell's body, assumes his identity and continues on to LA. Now, as Al progresses with his journey, he comes across Vera, who's also hitchhiking to...anywhere. Al picks her up, but unhappily for Al, she recognizes him as fraud and puts the squeeze on him. The narrative then settles down to the two together, both of them on their own private roads to hell...Just how they wind up, I'll leave you to find out (although you'll find plenty of spoilers from other contributors here at IMDb).This is a great narrative, even though it contains too many coincidences, for my liking, to keep the action going and to bring the story to denouement ? which, when you see it, is not exactly what you would expect. But, it fits within the context of the times and the need for Hollywood to show, once again, that evil does not succeed. Other films that complement that moral stance include The Maltese Falcon (1941), The Postman always rings twice (1946), The Killers (1946), The Devil Thumbs a Ride (1947), Out of the past (1947), They won't believe me (1947) and many others.Where Detour fails to come up to the same standard as those above has very much to do with the tight budget, B-grade cast ? notwithstanding Ann Savage and Tom Neal ? and very obvious lower quality of production.Where it succeeds, and comes very close to the others however, has everything to do with the direction and cinematography. Add to that also, an incisive dialog and voice over by Al, as we watch his descent into chaos. And did I say a tight budget? Well, waste not, want not, was the obvious watchword for this film: there's not a wasted frame, nor wasted line in the entire 67 minutes (mind you, there wouldn't want to be, for such a short movie).If you love film noir, you should see Detour, one of Hollywood's better earlier efforts for this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of the elements of a good noir film,but the plot depends on the protagonist being an idiot...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Detour" has a memorable plot that is memorable for all the wrong reasons...but is worth seeing as a period piece.Just to put this in perspective, I saw "Detour" and "Spider-baby" at a friend's house back-to-back one Saturday afternoon. And while "Spider-baby" is some kind of pop-art exploitation psycho grind-house milestone, this is the film that annoyed me so much that I wanted to grouse about it on IMDb. (This may tell readers more about me than I'd like to admit).I've seen movies by Ulmer that I've thought were enjoyable and well done, so I had hopes for "Detour". And there are some nice touches here and there. The creative team behind this movie made the absolute most of their budget in terms of scenery, music, cinematography, sound design, art direction etc.But my gripe with "Detour" is that the "hero" is such an idiot that it's hard to identify with him. I found myself yelling at Tom Neal's shabby little guy seemingly every 30 seconds: "Idiot! Why are you hitchhiking across the county to rejoin your girlfriend? Just work a couple more weeks, and then just ride a bus to Hollywood, instead of taking weeks and months to hitchhike there!" "Moron! Even back then, the police could do autopsies to discover the actual cause of death of your driver friend. 10 seconds in an morgue would absolve you of any wrong-doing....WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS????" "Dope! You can dump Vera anywhere along the highway on the way to California...just throw her out of the car and drive off without her, and assuming she ever actually makes it to California,who is ever going to believe her story when she has no proof other than hearsay? Just deny everything and you are golden!" Of course, it's entirely possible that Ulmer and the screenplay writer WANTED me to feel this way. Certainly Tom Neal plays the character as a weak willed schlub who deserves the audience's contempt and ridicule.(I am reasonably sure these were acting choices, not simple limitations).Wow...it's been three weeks since I've seen "Detour" and I'm still arguing with the screenplay in the back of my head. Maybe you'd like to do the same?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course I'm referring to the late Ann Savage as "Vera" (it's not clear in the movie that that's the character's real name), that fatale-est of femmes in "Detour." Narrated mostly in flashback by the (anti-) hero, a feckless lounge-piano player who decides to hitchhike across the country to Los Angeles to join his lounge-singer girlfriend, it illustrates in big neon lettering that in "film noir," "Murphy's law" rules: that which can go wrong, will...especially for people not particularly bright to begin with. Al, the musician, seems to have lucked out after thumbing a ride with a seemingly well-to-do gent who even buys him a meal; the affable driver reveals some scratches on his hand, courtesy of an earlier female passenger. (What ever happened to "foreshadowing" in the movies? I used to enjoy that.) Once Al takes the wheel so his new friend can sleep, though, the powers that be start to clamp down: it starts to rain; Al stops the car to put the convertible roof up; his benefactor promptly falls out of the car stone dead. Al makes some very quick and very wrong decisions, setting the stage for the eventual appearance of Vera. Never mind "The Hitcher": THIS is why you should never pick anyone up on the road. She stands there sizing him up like the later Jerry at the beginning of "The Zoo Story," then strides toward his car like a lioness on the hunt, gets in and stares stonily forward, allowing Al a few moments of pleasant anticipation before she snaps "What did you do with the body?" Of course she's the one who scratched up the dead fellow and of course knows Al is not he. Immediately taking over his life by threatening to rat him out to the cops, she directs him to a cheap motel room and emasculates him in every figurative way. Al is such a passive sap that it's hard to work up much sympathy for his ordeal (hard to believe that actor killed somebody several decades later). I won't reveal the outcome of their coerced partnership, but presumably you can guess that as Morgan Freeman memorably put it in "Seven," "This ain't gonna have a happy ending." The other reason to trade an hour and change of your life for watching "Detour" is to enjoy the Expressionist touches of immigrant director Edgar G. Ulmer, best known for "The Black Cat" (1935) which managed to cram necrophilia, devil worship and live flesh removal into a package that wouldn't even get rated "R" today--remember "the power of suggestion" in movies? I used to enjoy that. At one point Al imagines his girlfriend singing with the shadows of three musicians appearing on the wall behind her, then the whole image is reduced to the size of the rear view mirror of the car he's driving---and it doesn't seem "arty," just adds to the overall Lynchian dream-likeness. By the way, here's a "spoiler" but a good one--it DOESN'T all turn out to be a dream at the end! Or if that was the original ending, fortunately it got edited out... By the way, I hadn't known that trying to enter California in 1945 was like trying to get into East Berlin during the Cold War; didn't take long for us Yanks to get used to living in a police state, sorry to say...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A road seen though the windshield of a moving car. The car stops in front of a roadhouse and a man, Al Roberts (Tom Neal) leaves the car thanking the driver. Sitting by the counter sipping his coffee the jukebox plays a song and makes him remember.......... He was hitchhiking from New York to L.A. and not making much progress. A car stops and the driver says he's heading straight to L.A. The hitchhiker thinks he's lucky but he didn't know what fate had in store for him. During the night the driver will die mysteriously - Al Roberts was in a jam! He hides the body, gets into the car and drives on. Later on he'll know a girl and will be further enmeshed in a web of nightmare. He's out of his depth. He has to go on and take whatever comes along. This voyage is Dante's hell, life as a dream, whatever you want to think about. Detour is not metaphysical, it tells a straight story, but this story has surreal undertones and a beautiful b&amp;w grainy photography. The acting is robust and natural. The world portrayed by "Detour" lies on the other side of the fence. It's a pity that the DVD (probably taken from a VHS tape) is in bad condition - this film is a small gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the bare-bones of film-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like other films made with almost no budget, the flaws of the film by way of B (or below) movie actors and a shooting schedule that would make Ed Wood cringe, are overcome by the power of the simplicity in the story and the quick pace to which its told. This is one of those direct interpreted films in the mood that is film-noir (as it is hard to classify it into a genre)- much like with Stanley Kubrick's the Killing or Wilder's Double Indemnity, Edward Ulmer's Detour takes what is essentially a pulp novel and translates it directly to the screen, without cutting the fat, keeping what is necessary to tell the story. Luckily, the story is fascinating, as are the performances to a degree.Al (Tom Neal) is very good as an average Joe (if one could coin the term in such a world as in Detour) who is in love with a dame of sorts, Sue, who is out in Hollywood. Al is determined to see her again, and hitches to there. Enter in the troubles of hitchhiking, first in the form of a well-off businessman Charles Haskell Jr, and in the aftermath of a plot thickening point I won't reveal, a hitchhiker Al picks up, Vera, in the best performance of the film by Ann Savage. She knows something's up, and so she and Al become attached to one another by way of money. But in this form of the femme Fatale and average Joe story, things turn as one might expect, though not without a second of suspense lost.The dialog is also another factor to the film's success and lasting power- it's identifiable by modern audiences by its cynicism, but also by its realistic attitude within that framework. Many can identify with Al as much as with Vera- desperate people who go to tricky circumstances to make their way in life. There is also the idea of fate in the film, as well as in the numerous film-noirs that were to follow, that makes a strong point in the film. "Fate, or some mysterious force, can put the finger on you or me for no good reason at all," Al thinks in perfect narration. It's this notion of all these characters meeting a destined fate, that there is this dark, looming sense of dread over trying to have free will, that also makes it mark on the philosophical side of Detour. What are people willing to do to not get caught and get away with things, but at the same time what will it cost for their own decisions? Of course, these are all deep things that wouldn't concern the masses at the time, or today or since, who have found this to be a classic. At the core it's just an entertaining, quickie of a murder story that gives love, action, excitement, and character, while also bending the rules of things with light and texture with the cinematography. It's a must-see for fans of film-noir, even if it's on a shameful print like the one I saw it on (this is in dire need of some special edition or criterion treatment).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O Fortuna! (Boom!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS.I'll pretty much collapse any description of the story because anybody who has sat through this, or is willing to sit through it, or is an Edgar G. (for "George") Ulmer freak, already knows it. Tom Neal and his blond girl friend work in a New York nightclub. He plays the piano. She sings. He's not content but she's even less content and, despite their vague plans for marriage, she tells him she's taking off to seek her future as an entertainer in Hollywood. Some time later, Tom learns she's become a hash slinger in La La Land and decides to hitch out there and see if he can help. He's picked up by a snazzily dressed guy in an expensive Chrysler who dies of a heart attack while Tom is at the wheel one rainy night. Very sensibly, he switches identities with the dead guy and continues driving alone, until he picks up Ann Savage who immediately guesses what happened, except she believes there was a deliberate murder. They reach LA together and, after an argument, Tom accidentally strangles her with a phone cord. He's doomed.The script is full of implausibilities on which we won't dwell. Let's give these people a break. A nine-day shooting schedule and a budget of, what was it?, $300,000 -- for EVERYTHING, including tips? But we should give credit to the writers where it's due. The main theme is from Chopin's Fantasy Impromptu in some key I forget, maybe C minor, but it's been made into a popular song, "I'm always chasing rainbows." Neal also makes ten bucks by playing about the ugliest version of a Brahm's lullaby ever committed to celluloid. But there is a reference, too, to "Franco-Prussian sabers." Why Franco-Prussian? No matter, but it adds a bit of less rudimentary, less earth-bound detail to the script than we might have expected. There are other classic lines too. "Money. What is it. Just a piece of paper crawling with germs." And this exchange between Tom and his girl at the nightclub after he rips through some Chopin. Blond: "That was beautiful. You'll be in Carnegie Hall some day." Tom: "Yeah, as a janitor. I'll make my debut in the basement." (And this is while they're still HAPPY.) And this exchange: Ann Savage coughs. Tom: "That's a mean cough." Ann: "I'll be alright." Tom: "That's what Camille said." I don't know if he meant to take us back past Garbo to Alexander Dumas fils, but he does.The acting. Tom Neal is a kind of less talented Kurt Russel who wound up in some serious trouble of his own. As his character says, "Sometimes fate points a finger at you for no reason at all," etc. Ann Savage: A great vicious little woman who only smiles when her instinct tell her it will be to her benefit, like when she's drunkenly trying to seduce Tom in a hotel room, her scowl momentarily turning into what she probably believes is an inviting smile, kind of like a praying mantis. She has a clipped, bitchy voice and sneers constantly. If she didn't exist it would not have been necessary to invent her.Do see this. It's a classic noir. Absolutely primitive by force of circumstances. When Tom starts to reminisce in the diner, the lights dim except for a baby spot that comes up and highlights his bleary eyes. Don't watch it too often, though, or you're liable to slit your own wrists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edgar G. Ulmer directs one of the very best low budget flicks you can find. This crime drama is excellent Film-Noir. A disgruntled piano man(Tom Neal) doesn't have the dough to hook up with his songstress girlfriend(Claudia Drake)in California; so he decides to hitch-hike the highway and gets involved with a sultry femme fatale(Ann Savage)who introduces him to crime and murder. Gloomy and pathetic. A very good lesson in manipulation. And remember, when that big boulder of trouble starts rolling its damn near impossible to stop it. The finale is just, but not for the best. This DETOUR is worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tattered, Squalid Hour of Barely Survived Negative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A minimally preserved, 68-minute strip of scratched, seamy celluloid, this movie from Hollywood's destitute rank, shot in six days, to the top with technical errors and blundering sequencing, starring a man who can merely show displeasure and a woman who can merely scorn, should've washed from view soon after it was released. And yet it lives on, evocative, sinister, an incarnation of the shamefaced core of film noir, probably because its story pulls no punches in its refreshingly pagan pessimism, searing a sour chasm in your mind that doesn't immediately heal, as it'll trouble, maybe just slightly, the more insecure recesses of your thoughts. "Fate, for some mysterious force, can put the finger on you or me, for no good reason at all." It tells the story of Al, a petulant loser played by Tom Neal with troubled eyes and a tired mouth, a nightclub pianist who's in love, or says he is, with a singer. Their song, ominously, is I Can't Believe You Fell in Love With Me. He wants to get married, she goes West, he carries on with the piano, but then: "When this drunk gave me a ten spot, I couldn't get very excited. What was it? A piece of paper crawling with germs." The movie was shot on a shoestring with B-minus actors, but it was directed by a cult director who sought creative autonomy from the studios, Edgar G. Ulmer, who was an assistant to the great Murnau, and granted one of the associations between German Expressionism, with its overstated lighting, camera angles and melodrama, and the American film noir, which contributed slang and shame.The distinction between a crime film and a noir, I think, is that the bad guys in crime movies know they're bad and don't mind it, while a noir hero believes he's a good guy who's been trapped by life. Neal protests to us: "Whichever way you turn, fate sticks out a foot to trip you." Most noir heroes are overcome by the chinks in their armor. Few have had more chinks than Neal. He narrates the movie by candidly addressing the audience, generally in a maudlin drone. He's pleading his case, protesting that life hasn't given him an even leg up.Most critics, and admirers too, of Detour have taken Al's story in a straightforward manner: He's star-crossed in love, he loses the good girl, is pillaged by the bad girl, he's a blameless onlooker who looks guilty even to himself. Naturally, I read it that way upon first viewing myself. But a more stimulating hypothesis highlights that the narration is not what occurred, but what Al wants us to believe occurred. It's a false yet gratifying telling of the story, because the singer scarcely matches Al's descriptive account of her, that he's less in love than in need of her paycheck, and that his hiding of Haskell's death is a validation for an easy theft, scared and alone on the pitch black night-time roads between his home and his dreams. Al's account exemplifies that upsetting events can be revised into flights of the imagination that are easier to live with.Perhaps that's why Detour cozies itself up so well, why audiences react so fervently. The story's leaps and discrepancies are nightmare logic. Al's not telling a story, but dashing through the untreated fragments, amassing a defense, like the sequence where Al checks into a motel, goes to sleep, and dreams of the very same events that just happened: It's a flashback alongside with the events it flashes back to, as if his subconscious is doing a speedy modification. You could justify the overbearing amount of voice-over narration with the validation that the whole film's essentially a flashback. The focus is on the action, information and character relations. It's lean on setting details. And it's all frontstory.Neal makes Al limp, submissive, sappy. That's perfect for the material. Ann Savage's work is special: There's not a single transitory shaving of compassion or mercy in her performance as Vera, as she snaps out her pulp dialogue. These are two pure types: the submissive man, the femme fatale. To be in the moment, an actor needs to be connected to their own feelings. Sometimes, alas, the only feeling an actor honestly has is anxiety, but that's perfect for this film. And the idiosyncrasies of the two leads come off fittingly.The movie's low budget is clear. During one early scene, Ulmer artfully employs thick fog to function as New York streets. He shoots as many scenes as possible in the front seats of cars, with poorly maintained process shots. Flashing back, Ulmer just zooms in on Neal's face, cuts the lights in the background, and shines a light in his eyes. It results in a shrewdly economic way of furnishing an insatiably expressionistic noir, truer to form than many of the breed, but occasionally you can see him really reaching to get by, such as when Al calls long-distance to the singer. Ulmer fleshes out his running time by inserting stock footage of telephone wires and switchboard operators, yet can't manage any footage of the singer speaking into the phone.Do these confines and indiscretions mar the film? No. They distinguish it. Like good punk rock, Ulmer's radical film gains its natural, edgy verve from its actual roughness. Detour is a case of material finding the suitable format by, inadvertently or not, going outside the norm. Two scavengers from the mire of pulp reel through the literal shadows of low-budget noir and are caught panting in Ulmer's web. Detour's one of the most audacious, utterly wicked works ever to come out of studio-era Hollywood, and its succinct, negative vision of the arbitrary futility of the world is still all the rage today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Noir in B</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrific B picture which is immersed more deeply than usual in the jet-black mood of the noir genre of post-War despair, and it is a particularly early example of this gloomy mood. The hero says at one point in a voice-over: 'Fate sticks out a foot and trips you.' That is the theme of the film, the inimical and inescapable damage done to an unsuspecting man by the vagaries of Fate. The hero, Al Roberts, is a guy down on his luck anyway, and riddled with feelings of inadequacy and failure. Psychologically, he is already a no-hoper. We see him early on, and throughout the film as well, playing Chopin brilliantly in his off moments, though his profession is as a pianist in a cheap New York club on the Upper West Side called the Crack o' Dawn Club, which as its name indicates, is always open into the wee hours and attracts some seedy customers. The singer whom the hero accompanies is called Sue, and they are due to get married next week. But in the early morning as they walk home from the club, she tells him she has decided against it, that she wants to go to Los Angeles and try her luck there. She says: 'I'm young, and we can get together again in a few years. Maybe you'll even come out and join me one day.' A great parting line! So he turns in the fog and walks away saying a gloomy goodbye. Some weeks later he phones her from a pay phone booth, puts in his quarters, and learns that she has a job as a hash-slinger in a diner and isn't getting anywhere. So he says he is coming out to join her. But he has no money for the fare, so he has to hitchhike all the way across America, accepting dozens of short rides over a course of weeks. Finally, he has reached Arizona and thumbs a lift with a well-heeled bookie named Charles Haskell, who is driving a nifty convertible model and says hop in, that he is going all the way to L.A. Things look promising and he even buys our hero a free meal. Our hero, the character Al Roberts, is played brilliantly by Tom Neal (1914-1972). DETOUR was Neal's most famous film, in a string of largely forgotten B films and TV films which he made. His career was cut short because of his being blackballed by the industry after he had a violent fight with Franchot Tone. Neal had a law degree from Harvard and a boxing career behind him, but he was subject to violent temper outbursts and got into trouble over women. All of these elements of his character come together in DETOUR to create one of the most memorable noir hero performances ever. He was in many ways the perfect noir hero, superior to many better known actors in pulling off a completely convincing performance in such a story. He has a depressed and hang-dog look mixed with the puzzled good nature of a lost little boy, and he alternates between na?ve simplicity and world-weary despair, by way of cynicism and tough-guy responses. The director, Edgar G. Ulmer, makes good use of Neal's face, with meditative voice-overs, and he and his cameraman do extraordinarily simple things with light such as a single spot on part of Neal's face, as the surrounding lights dim, to give us the nod that he has now entered an interior dialogue which is about to lead into a flashback. The film has numerous instances of the simplest possible forms of expressionistic lighting and shadows, which are surprisingly effective and cost nothing. (Directors of today take note!) It may be that this film was Ulmer's high point, as it was Neal's, and neither of them realized it at the time, as they were just making a movie and going with the flow. The most amazing and hair-raising performance in the film, however, is by Ann Savage as the mysterious and terrifying character Vera. This performance is justly one of the most famous femme fatale portrayals in the entire film noir genre. And she and Neal are perfect counterfoils for one another. Savage is just about the scariest gal you could ever hope you would never meet. Her whole persona erupts in the most horrible manner. She is picked up as a hitchhiker by Tom Neal after he has adopted the identity and taken the car of Haskell, who has died suddenly on the journey of what appears to have been a sudden heart attack. Neal dragged his body off the road and covered it in brush, took the man's clothes and wallet and car and drove on, fearful that the police would think he killed the man (which is silly, since an autopsy would have revealed the truth, but Neal as a natural underdog irrationally panicked and assumed the worst). At first, Vera sits as motionless as a statue looking straight ahead, looking almost as if she is dead, as the camera views her in stark and unflattering profile. Then we cut to a shot from the front and we notice, to our horror, that her eyes have now opened and are glaring sideways at Neal as if she is a demon. And then she comes out with: 'Where did you dump his body?' It turns out that Vera had previously been given a lift in the same car by Haskell, before Tom Neal got his lift, and indeed she was the vixen who had deeply scratched Haskell's hand, which Neal had noticed earlier. So suddenly, Neal is deep into the worst nightmare he can imagine: Vera assumes he has murdered Haskell for his car and money. She turns into the wildest, most terrifying of harpies, and effectively takes Neal hostage on a journey into further criminal madness. Rarely have we been more scared of any woman on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Detour is as good as B movies get!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detour released in 1945 Directed by Edgar G. Ulmer and shot in 6 days for a very small budget, is a masterpiece and is very entertaining. Tom Neal stars as Al Roberts who is a piano player at a night club in New York City. His girlfriend Sue played by Claudia Drake is a singer at the nightclub; she wants to go to Hollywood, California. This disappoints Roberts because he is worried that he won't see her for a long time. So, Al hitchhikes from New York to California. When he is halfway there in Arizona he is pickd-up by a man named Charles Haskell. Haskell has a scar on him; Al asks Charles where the scar his from, Charles says that a woman who he picked up did it to him. Charles dies suddenly so Al takes his identification and buries him. Al picks up the same woman that scartched Charles; her name is Vera she is played by Anne Savage. Al introduces himself as Charles Haskell. Vera says that she knows that he is not Charles Haskell, because she rode with him. Vera agressively makes Al do everything she tells him to do, or she will call the police. I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't seen this movie. Detour starts out with Al being dropped of at a diner in Reno, Neveda. Al is upset; he narrates the whole story to us in flashback. Detour was released in 1945, and it looks good and old-fashioned, because of the song that is sung "I can't believe that your in love with me" which is a song from the early 1940's maybe even the 1930's, which of course wasn't old when this movie was made. The clothes, styles, and expressions are very old-fashioned. 2 things about this film are very modern though: 1. the cintementagrophy 2. The fact that Vera is very dominant and tough and she is a woman, and Al is very passive and weak and he is a man; that is something you didn't see at all in movies untill the 1970's. In most movies from the 1960's and before the female character acts scared and weak, while the male character is strong and tough. Detour for those reasons is extremely offbeat, considering when it was made, (Trust me I've seen tons of movies from that era) rating 4 stars out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS?I haven't seen the film in a while, but I recall liking it a whole lot. Tom Neal plays a drifter who is hitchhiking across the country (on Rte. 66, probably). One man who helps him dies while sleeping in the car. Tom doesn't want the blame to fall on his head, so he dumps the body by the side of the road and continues on in the man's car. I can't remember how, but he meets a girl, and they ride into California together. She is, I think, related to the man, and blackmails Tom, threatening to go to the police. They pawn the car and get an apartment (I think), where she accidentally strangles herself. Tom, to avoid deeper trouble, takes off and stops at the diner from the beginning of the film. I won't tell the ending, just watch this masterpiece of an early film.8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest B-Movie of all Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DETOUR is without a doubt the best B-movie/film-noir of all time. The story begins in the Big Apple. Al Roberts is a nightclub pianist, and his girlfriend Sue Harvey is running off to Hollywood to "make it big in pictures." After hanging around the Big Apple for a while, he calls Sue in Hollywood and tells her that he is on her way to see her, albeit if he has to hitch-hike! On the road, he thumbs down a car, and this is the beginning of his "detour." The driver is Charles J. Haskell, Jr., who is pretty wealthy.He tells Al about a girl he picked up recently, and who gave him plenty of trouble. Al learns of Haskell's past. However, things are good now. Al is grateful, and all is going well-until that night... On the road, Al has taken over the wheel. It begins raining, so he tries to wake Haskell to put up the hood. However, Al has more problems than just the rain-Haskell is dead! Here, the story really gets tense. From here, Al nervously takes the car, hides the body, and sets off. He picks up a girl, and-you guessed it-it turns out to be Vera, Haskell's "friend." From here, Al is manipulated in to a series of crimes bad decisions, which finally lead him to his ultimate "detour." DETOUR is one of those films that, once you see it, you never ever forget! Every aspect of it is wonderfully and brilliantly executed.Its director, Edgar G. Ulmer, was a master of suggestive lighting and shadowy cinematography(by Benjamin H. Kline). Although the film cost a mere $21,000, the techniques used suggest an A-picture budget 's talented film crew. Unknowns Tom Neal and Ann Savage star. The soundtrack has the great song "I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me"-music and lyrics by Jimmy McHugh and Clarence Gaskill-which was later the theme tune in THE CAINE MUTINY. (And they say the B-movies weren't influential, huh?!) Anyhow, take a look at this film. It's A LOT better than you'd think. It's not just a cheesy 50's drive-in noir. It's a real "sleeper." And a classic. It's the Best B-Movie of all Time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Actors and a Projection Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poverty row classic so claustrophobic, the longest shot is the 20 feet from Neal's car to Savage standing by the highway. I gather it was made in six days. Frankly, it looks like five. So what's so good about it. Start with sad-eyed Tom Neal as Al Roberts, a professional whiner. Listen to him blame just about everyone and everything else for his own dumb decisions. The guy belongs in some kind of movie hall of self-deluded fame. Then there's the great 40's ambiance-- the dingy all-night diner, the lonesome trucker, the deserted 2-lane, and blowzy old Esther Howard as the blowzy old Esther Howard waitress. But most of all, there's Ann Savage as Vera, with a voice like fingernails across a blackboard and a personality to match. Romancing her would be like wrestling a crocodile-- even Neal figures that one out. Had she been mother Eve, we would all be extinct. Vera too qualifies for some hall of fame, but I'm not sure which. Still, the whole package would probably fall apart without that maestro of the movie quickie, Edgar G. Ulmer. In short, he's got real style. Note the great silhouette of horn players on the nightclub wall or the inverted shot of Vera reflected in the mirror. As someone wisely noted, his is a camera that never falters, no matter what the material. No, this is not exactly Oscar bait. But it will still be shown long after those award-winning clunkers have gone to the big celluloid attic in the sky. Great 40's noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You know, there oughta be a law against dames with claws!" Al Roberts (Tom Neal) couldn't agree more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That's life," says two-bit loser Al Roberts. "Whichever way you turn, Fate sticks out a foot to trip you." Roberts, played by Tom Neal, is the whining, complaining protagonist in Detour, one of the worst, and best, pulp noirs you'll ever enjoy. And if Roberts doesn't have a good moment in any of the film's 67 minutes, you will if you get a kick out of pulp fiction so ripe it'll remind you of how old Charles Haskell's corpse is. Roberts, a piano player in a New York nightclub, was hitch hiking to L.A. to reunite with the woman he loves, his girlfriend Sue. When Haskell stops and gives him a ride, then dies of a heart attack, Roberts makes the first of many bad decisions. Haskell had several hundred in his wallet and three big, raw scratches on one hand. Wouldn't you know it, after ditching the body, taking the cash, the car and Haskell's identity, Roberts winds up stopping to pick up a hitchhiker...who turns out to be the dame who gave Haskell those scratches. "Man, she looked like she'd just been thrown off the crummiest freight train in the world," Roberts says. We can see for ourselves. Vera (Ann Savage) is tough as nails. She's a tramp. She's poison. She knows Roberts isn't Haskell. She sets a hook in Roberts' mouth and pulls him around from one scheme to the next to get money. When Roberts finally resists...well, see the movie. How can a film be so bad yet be so satisfying? It was shot by Edgar Ulmer in only six days on a tiny budget and looks it. Ulmer probably paid more for all that rear screen projection than he did for the actors. Neal and Savage are barely even B-level quality. The movie is hardly more than an hour long. And yet... First, the movie moves quickly. There is absolutely no wasted time, even when Ulmer is padding out a few shots. Second, Tom Neal is perfectly cast. He has a petulant, greasy face and a plump, weak mouth. Neal was not a sympathetic or likable actor. In what career he had, which wasn't much, he usually was at his best whining or playing bullies. Here, he's just weak. His career was effectively over when he beat Franchot Tone nearly to a pulp over a bimbo actress named Barbara Payton. A few years later he married and then was accused of murdering his wife with a gunshot to the head. He spent several years in prison on a manslaughter conviction and died of a heart attack a few months after he was released. Not much to admire here. Ann Savage is so over the top as the tough Vera that we sometimes do a double take over how she handles her dialogue. Still, the two of them, perhaps inadvertently, do full justice to the concept of Detour as full-bodied pulp fiction. Third, the script is great. Pulp, when it works, is sleazy, dirty entertainment. That's Detour. Neal and Savage make this fatalistic pulp cartoon vivid, not by how skilled they are, but by how well they meet the conventions of pulp action. Fourth, let's hear it for Edgar Ulmer. Some of Ulmer's films -- Strange Illusion, The Strange Woman, for example -- are fun to watch but none of them, in my view, are worth spending too much time thinking about. Like Val Lewton, Ulmer was a man of limited talent who could sometimes squeeze more interest out of so little to work with that one has to admire his persistence. He certainly sets up Vera's fate with style, even though Roberts' fate seems perfunctory to me. No one, I hope, would call Detour a great film. In my opinion, it's not even a great noir. But it succeeds as great pulp fiction. When that highway comes on the screen, when we see the credits and when we start to hear Al Robert's voice-over, we know we're in for a cheap, sleazy ride...and an entertaining one, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Winner About a Loser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great, terse, dark, little film!! There is no need to reiterate the story line here.....it's simple and cuts to the bone. Ulmer does a lot with no money......... the cheesy sets and cost cutting measures he had to take only make this movie more intriguing. It's a lesson that most of Hollywood didn't learn and those films where "more is better" don't hold a candle to this poverty row gem. Tom Neal, a loser in real life, brings such a sense of desperation to his role that you wonder if he is just playing himself. Ann Savage.....my God, who was this woman? She should have become the biggest 2nd lead actress in history. She scares you to death with her interpretation of Vera, the man killer from hell. You expect her to leap on Tom Neal and rip out his throat with her teeth.....in a word...terrific!! Critics tend to go on and on about what symbolism there is in the film, or what Ulmer meant by this scene or that scene.....frankly, I think that Ulmer, with no money, a short production time, and a somewhat weak script, made the best little film noir he could. He didn't have much time to think about deep, psychological meaning. Approach this film for what it is....a major low budget masterpiece that will cause you to ask the question,"What ever happened to Ann Savage?" Well, we know what happened to her....she's alive and well in California with a following of die-hard fans who cherish her greatest performance and wonder why she never got the breaks that would have made her a top flight star. See the film and you will wonder too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not gonna regard this as one of the best film noirs ever made, but it's quite impressive. It was made on a shoestring budget, and the cheapness shows on screen, but it doesn't show on the script. It's well-written and well-acted. Like many old noirs, there's some great dialogue. I like when Tom Neal describes his impression of Ann Savage when she first enters his car, during the voice-over narration: "She has a natural beauty. So natural it's almost homely." Well, Savage was no beauty. She was no Ava Gardner or Lana Turner. She was very well-cast and perfectly fiendish. As long as you don't expect a "masterpiece" you'll be impressed by "Detour." I'm pretty sure you won't find it at your local video store. My film noir professor mentioned the movie in class, and I was lucky enough to find a copy of it for $2.88 at a discount store. Well, if you can find a copy, it's well-worth the viewing. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Featuring one of the best femme fatales in cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A traveller, crossing the States to meet his girl, becomes the unwitting and cruel victim of fate as he finds himself embroiled in a series of unlikely incidents. The opening scene reveals Al's paranoia as a melody formerly associated with happier times incessantly reminds him of his nightmare journey and the events which have marked his conscience. For a supposed B-movie, this film's dialogue is hard-bitten and memorable such as Haskell's conversation about how he got his scars and the scenes between Al and the alcoholic, money-grabbing and sexually charged Vera. Ann Savage is one of the great femme fatales. The close-up where she suddenly turns to stare at Al after he first picks her up is genuinely unnerving as is her brutal, direct manner of speech when she confronts him with his secrets. Here is a woman who dictates the terms to a passive man and who is, in Haskell's terms, ?the most dangerous animal'. The scene where she and Al play cards is excellent. As each tries to outwit the other (gambling analogy), it becomes clear that Al is hopelessly out of his league; Vera is a woman for whom death or capture hold no fear and who holds all the aces.One Film Guide (Virgin) describes the film as a surreal journey about Al's fear of women, domesticity and failure &amp; success. This appears less ridiculous when you consider how he becomes the victim of Vera's materialistic ambitions to the point where their relationship almost resembles a black comedy on marriage as Al, controlled by fate and a woman's desires for betterment, reacts with deep anger and resentment.The film is perfectly spare, with no so-called stars, so that the noir elements are heighetened without the action being sidetracked by a big-name performance. Lack of budget allows Ulmer to be innovative; I particularly liked Al's flashback at night as he peers into the car's mirror to see Sue singing with the silhouettes of the musicians in the background.An interesting film ? and one which heralded the independent movement in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Detour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If a hapless protagonist being thrown around by uncontrollable fate is one of the key elements of film noir, Edgar G. Ulmer's low-budget noir classic Detour certainly belongs among the arcehetypal examples of the genre. The story is told in retrospect by a down-on-his-luck bar pianist Al Roberts (Tom Neal), who was once happily engaged to a pub singer named Sue (Claudia Drake) and saddened by her move to Hollywood in order to become an actress. While hitchhiking towards Los Angeles to see her, Roberts gets a ride from a tough and scarred man named Haskell (Edmund MacDonald) and everything seems fine until Haskell mysteriously dies in the car, prompting the panicking Roberts to assume a false identity. After picking up a spirited hitchhiker Vera (Ann Savage) who knows more about him than he would prefer, Roberts starts sinking further into the pit of paranoia and chronic bad luck.The technical aspects are well handled by director Ulmer. The use of violin music and classically dark cinematography suit the mood well and especially Roberts' performances at the piano early in the film are very enjoyable pieces of music per se, but also illustrate his thrown-away talent effectively. The shots of people on a foggy street or a rainy roadside are beautifully created as well. The acting is decent, considering the movie's poverty row background: Ann Savage fits her role as Vera perfectly and steals the show from the quiet protagonist softly played by Tom Neal, who occasionally doesn't come across as convincing as the other, bolder actors. This is not a major complaint though, as most of the time Neal finds the right style that suits his character.The film interestingly examines the theme of a man's identity getting blurred under growing stress and oppression. After Vera takes complete control over Roberts, he cannot do anything to get back to making his own decisions again, not only due to the unlucky situation and all odds being against him, but also because of his passive nature that has been affecting his choices for a long time, as exemplified by his pessimistic attitude towards his dream of becoming a concert pianist. The message about the unpredictability of life is powerful, even if slightly abrupt due to the short runtime of only 68 minutes, but on the other hand the briefness ensures that there are no idle moments in the story. To sum up, Detour is an enjoyable small-scale noir with a skilfully created sad atmosphere; definitely worth seeing for fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brooding Noir Tale Of Coincidences, Fear &amp; Sudden Deaths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie, the events that occur during a road trip from New York to LA, illustrate how a series of random circumstances can propel an individual's life into chaos and isolation. This taps into insecurities and fears that are felt by many people and as such, provides great material for this brooding noir.Al Roberts (Tom Neal), a piano player in a New York club, is suddenly told by his fiancée Sue (Claudia Drake) that she's going to Hollywood to try to make the big time. Some time later, he decides to hitch-hike across country to join her. In Arizona, he gets picked up by a driver called Charles Haskell Jnr (Edmund MacDonald). Haskell has three deep red scratches on the back of one of his hands and tells Al that they were made by a woman he'd previously picked up. Later, when Haskell gets tired, Al drives until it starts to rain and he gets out to put the roof up. His attempts to wake Haskell fail and when he opens the front door, Haskell falls out of the vehicle and hits his head on a rock. When he realises that Haskell is dead, Al is convinced that no-one is likely to believe what had happened and would think that he'd murdered Haskell for his money. He dumps the body in a gully, takes Haskell's clothes and driver's licence etc and drives away.After a night's sleep at a motel, he stops at a filling station, sees a woman hitchhiker and gives her a lift. He introduces himself as Charles Haskell Jnr, but his passenger, Vera (Ann Savage) turns out to be the woman who had previously travelled with Haskell. She threatens to expose the fact that Al is using a false identity unless he first agrees to cut her in on money he could raise by selling the car and secondly goes to Haskell's home and impersonates him with the intention of cleaning up on Mr Haskell Snr's fortune. Neither of these plans materialises and Vera dies in an extraordinary accident. The circumstances of Vera's death are such that, once again, he feels nobody would find them credible and would immediately come to the conclusion that he'd murdered her.Al subsequently learns that the police are looking for Haskell in connection with Vera's murder. As Al and Vera had booked into an hotel as Mr &amp; Mrs Haskell and had also used the same names when trying to sell the car, he knew that, if he wanted to cover his tracks for a second time he would not be able to continue using Haskell's identity. It was, however, also unsafe for him to attempt to go back to New York as he'd previously swapped identities with Haskell and was now officially recorded as having died.Al is passive, self pitying and defeatist and seems to accept everything that happens in a completely fatalistic way. Vera is aggressive, snarling and snaps out her venomous dialogue with absolutely no sign of humanity or in fact, any redeeming qualities.The final scene of the movie was included purely to conform with the requirements of the Hollywood Production Code and served no purpose in the context of this allegorical tale. Considering this and the very low budget involved, it's a major achievement that such a gritty, atmospheric and memorable drama was produced in these circumstances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Genius.Shot in something like 6 days, it's a little-known first-class film noir. It's dark, brooding, pessimistic, dangerous, and it draws you in only to smack you in the face when you least expect it.The short running time only adds to the feeling of nausea as you watch the lead character spiral out of control. Al Roberts is hitchhiking to see his girlfriend on the other side of the country, needless to say, when something goes wrong, the consequences of his actions deepen the mire he finds himself in with every turn. It moves so fast and the characters are so vivid it's criminal that this film hasn't got the recognition it deserves. The rain, Roberts growing beard, Ann Savage, the bars, the shadows, the close-ups, it's a pure classic. Yes, they don't make 'em like they used to.Compulsive viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the ten greatest American films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had barely ever heard of this film before I saw it at a local art house. I had not intended to see the film, but it was playing and I saw it anyhow. For 67 minutes, I was captured in this suspenseful, well-told story that is all the more amazing because it was made on a shoe-string budget in six days. Edgar G. Ulmer, who directed the film, is one of the true geniuses in film. With absolutely minimal resources, he masterfully directed what I consider to be one of the ten finest films ever made. Ulmer grips the audience with his attention to detail. The story is told tersely and to the point. On top of all this, the screenplay is exceptionally well-written and contains many of the classic lines of film noir. After leaving the screening of this film, I was compelled to buy it on video as fast as possible. It made a great impression on me. I believe it should be shown to all film students as an example of how to make a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Detour (1945) Is A Well Done Movie, Also Grim and Depressing...Who Needs That?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detour (1945) starring Tom Neal and Ann Savage is an excellent movie and deserves all the honors and "best film of it's type" listings it always gets everywhere. It's honored and should be honored.But Detour (1945) starring Tom Neal and Ann Savage is a detailed portrait of a very unhappy man leading an unhappy and amazingly unlucky life.It is grim and depressing. The movie is well acted, written, directed, and photographed. And all these result in the "grim and depressing" theme and result of the movie digging deep into the viewer and invading his dreams, conversation, and even ideas.Ugh! In a way, it is sort of like an artist doing a good job at depicting human body waste in such accurate, stomach turning detail, the viewer becomes nauseated and vomits, winces, and otherwise is revolted.Yes, the artist did a good job at accuracy and the result was a dramatic effect on viewers.No, the result of viewing such art (and this applies to the experience of screening Detour [1945]) is not uplift or edification.One can't even defend it as a cautionary tale, because the story told is so extremely unlikely and outlandish one can say with certainty such bad luck and bad results would never, ever happen in real life. They could, but most likely, they won't.So, what's the point of praising and screening Detour (1945)? What is it's place in cinema history and on lists of honored movies (it appears on almost all such major lists)? Detour (1945) starring Tom Neal and Ann Savage is more than just a film for masochists who enjoy being made unhappy by watching a skillfully made movie bound to summon negative mental emotions.It takes it's place among honored literary (if grim) art by writers such as Edgar Allan Poe, Ambrose Bierce, and Franz Kafka, and beside the work of honored studio artists such as Goya, David, and Picasso. Even Shakespeare's tragedies (King Lear and Hamlet) might be mentioned on this list of grim, unlikely, but dramatic and honored works of art.Not for everybody, and not for consuming at all times in all places, but important, in a limited way.I don't plan to screen it again soon.----------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

		<shortDescription>THE greatest low budget crime thriller ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love b-grade thrillers and horror movies that trancend their limitations and manage to create something truly unforgettable. Roger Corman, Sam Fuller and Mario Bava are directors who immediately spring to mind as having managed to do this on several occasions. A bit closer to home is Herk Harvey's haunting 1960s horror classic 'Carnival Of Souls', a fantastic example of what can be achieved on close to no budget at all. Edward G. Ulmer's 'Detour' is a bit like the 'Carnival Of Souls' of Film Noir. Ulmer directed the oddball Karloff/Lugosi showcase 'The Black Cat' in the 1930s for Universal, but spent most of his subsequent career making low budget b-graders. By the time 'Detour' came around I don't know how much money he had to work with, but it looks VERY cheap, and the movie was supposedly shot in three days. Despite that it's one of the greatest thrillers I've ever seen in my life. Tom Neal plays Al Roberts, a nightclub pianist who decides to hitch across the US to be reunited with his lover. One of the people who gives him a ride along the way dies, and Roberts thinks things look really bad for him, so he hides the body and "borrows" the guys car. Big mistake. Even bigger mistake is picking up a girl, Vera (the aptly named Ann Savage!). Things just go from bad to worse after that. The production values are next to nothing in this film, but it gives it a genuinely nightmarish feel, and Neal (who later was charged with murdering his own wife) and especially Savage give great performances that really hook you in. Savage's character is one of the most unforgettable femme fatales of all time, and 'Detour' is a crime classic that still packs a hell of a punch. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Depiction of Despair and Feeling of Dead Endedness(Some Spoilers Involved)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detour(1945) in terms of production values is unimpressive, which for some films can be disastrous, but here it becomes a virtue. What is lacking in tehnical professionalism is compensated with strong artistic effort. Its the less than perfect production values that makes characters, motives, and situations feel credible and semi-realistic. Many low budget films made for the next fifty plus years owe a debt to Detour(1945) as a paver of modern independent cinema. One example where a film can be excellent without having a big budget, or large amount of resourses.Told in a first person narration though flashbacks, to give viewer a way to identify at times with main protagonist. Al Robert's point of view when describing his side of the story has a disorienting effect of what is or is not true about his tale. First Person narration put me on guard because I began to think that his version of events that occurs during the film has been distorted to make himself look more helpless and innocent. The First person narration is very Poe like in seeing through the mind of a possible insane man. Similar appoarch to the First Person narrations of THE BLACK CAT, THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER, THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM, &amp; TELL TALE HEART.There are two types of categories that fit into the basic modes of Film Noir. First, there is the detective story, which involves complex plots, and scenes of Police procedue. Second, the innocent man corrupted story, which told through flashbacks,has first person narration, and deals with human nature and misfortune. Detour(1945) belongs to the latter category of basic Film Noir modes. Minimalist classic that's among best in Film Noir during 1941-1945 period that's heavily inspired by German Expressionism.Edgar G. Ulmer is an example of a filmmaker in the 1940s succeeding as film director without much to work with. The genius of Detour lies in the skillful direction of Ulmer who is able to create a powerful sense of human despair and broodish mood. His direction for Detour(1945) can certainly be linked to style of Fritz Lang for whom Edgar Ulmer worked for during the 1920s. He had been a set designer(uncredited) before becoming a film director for Lang films such as Die Nibelungen(1924), Metropolis(1927), Spies(1928), and M(1931), as well as working under FW Murnau as an assistent director. Experience as set designer is reflective in style of sets for Detour(1945).A theme, which is a noir favorite that plays big here is the theme of the doomed protagonist. Also, the focus turns to human desperation when things don't go right for Al Roberts. Al Roberts, the protagonist is a man who cannot escape his fate despite doing everything he can possibly do to avoid it. Tom Neal with his performance makes the Al Roberts character into a tragic figure, to which anything that can possibly go wrong actually does. One film that Detour(1945) is comparable to in many ways is Fritz Lang's Scarlet Street(1946) which is also about a doomed protagonist and his decline.There are some elements in Detour(1945) that is in the style of Neo-Realism. First, the low budget feel is something Detour(1945) and many Neo-Realist films were dealt with. Second, human behavior and lack of fancy sets are a common thread among Detour, and Italian Neo-Realist films. Its interesting to note that while Edgar G. Ulmer was filming Detour here, an Italian filmmaker by the name of Roberto Rossellini introduced the first landmark Neo-Realist film to audiences called Rome, Open City(1945). Also, the editing in Detour and Neo-Realist films are not smooth and done in a manner akin to a newsreel.There are a couple of ideas in Detour, which reminds me of Ossessione(1942). One, the sense of dread and doom felt by main protagonists. Two, importance on psychology, and human despair over typical Hollywood style ideas. I can see how a film like Ossessione could have had a major impact in the style of Detour(1945). Preemits the films of Mario Bava whose films were for the most part void of any large budgets, or limitless resources, yet were filled with an unique artistic quality that might not be seen in a big budget Hollywood styled film.Vera is one fiesty, tough film noir femme fatale, and one of the most memorable in history of Hollywood Noirs. Anne Savage gives a ferocious and captivating performance as the intimidtating, and aggressively imposing Vera. Without good girl qualities, which makes her into one scary Film Noir femme fatale. The scene where she practically orchestrates her own death is one chilling moment. No One since has given such a tour de force performance and perhaps no one never will.Like most film noirs that dealt with identical subject matters, Detour(1945) is a downbeat and sad motion picture that looks the darkness below the lights of the city. Probably played a role in the concept and filming ideas of Mario Bava's Rabid Dogs(1974). Tom Neal is very good for his role and even looks the part of Al Roberts. Not a perfect film yet that is the main charm of Detour(1945) because it gives film it contributes to grim and moody style. The scenes in the nightclub when Al Roberts is playing the piano reminds me of Black Angel(1946), and Shoot the Piano Player(1960).There are a few scenes in film that were my favorites. One, the conversation between Charles Haskell JR and Al Roberts on the character of Vera. Two, the moment when Al Roberts becomes desperate after the accidential death of Haskell JR. Three, the moment when Al Roberts decides to stand up to Vera and accidentially kills her in the process via telephone cord. Sadly, this was to be Tom Neal's big moment in the sun as his life ended a few years later in tragic circumstances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A memorably committed rendition of the lonely man - he drifts into the movie, hitch-hiking through an ominous, almost abstractly minimal landscape, and an hour later more or less drifts out, musing in voice over about the finger of fate. The voice over is eloquent enough, but the images tell us all we need to know. Neal etches a keenly moving portrait of isolation: his initially hard-bitten quality wears comprehensively away, until his scenes with the evil Vera are so over- matched that they conjure up a weird black (castrating) domestic comedy. Savage (whose first turn of her head toward the camera after he picks her up is one of the most unnerving close-ups in memory) pushes her performance to the feverish hilt. Tightly and claustrophobically shot, in a world drained of all colour or digression or respite, it's a fascinating film at every step. The girlfriend he pursues to Hollywood is so abstractly presented she seems like a dream; when he calls her in one scene it's as if he was talking to himself, and in the end she just fades away from view, as if any thought of respectability or stability was a sad delusion; as if the inevitable reality is just hollow, rootless disaffection. Vera may be the medium of his destruction, but his identity is never sufficiently secure to facilitate direct recrimination (only fate could do that): he's the little man caught up in money and female desire and dreams of betterment, and it beats him down. A profoundly pessimistic (and somewhat visionary) prediction of the post-War landscape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most hateful characters in a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not as fond of DETOUR as some of the other reviewers on here, purely because I found it an entirely depressing viewing experience. It's one of the darkest film noirs out there, leaden with a dreadful atmosphere throughout, full of foreboding, darkness, and misery. And I guess those are the reasons why it's so well remembered.The film is directed by THE BLACK CAT director Edgar G. Ulmer in much the same way he would direct one of his horror pictures. Tom Neal makes for a rather unlikeable hero, trying desperate to hitch-hike from one end of the country to the other and coming unstuck when he falls in with a seemingly friendly driver. He takes a chance and thinks he's made it when in fact he's just about to meet Ann Savage's Vera.Savage is the stand-out feature of this film and I hated every element of her angry, vengeful, selfish character. She's the worst femme fatale I've ever seen, a noxious character utterly devoid of redeeming features, to the degree that I found the movie hard to watch whenever she was around (which is most of the time). I admit that I thought the climax was excellent given what's come previously, although the only thing I came away from this feeling was relief, relief that it was over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the epitome of film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have a friend or family member who asks you, "What on earth is film noir?" Show them this movie. It has all of the hallmarks of a great noir flick: deceit, blackmail, twisted love, very unfortunate circumstances, unforeseen tragedy; and it is shot in low-budget black-and-white with minimal yet atmospheric sets. However, it all works most wonderfully, or uber-suspensefully. Detour, unlike many other fine noir films, has breathtaking pace; it doesn't stall or get mired in overly clever - or hopelessly cryptic - dialogue. That's not to say that the dialogue is on the cheap or not sharp; why, it certainly is. The weave of action and dialogue is just perfect: It's not a run of garish violence or verbose mega-star monologues. In fact, I think I'll watch it again tonight. Oh, BTW, I stumbled upon Detour on a Friday night in the mid-80s. It was featured on that old Night Flight series. I've been hooked on film noir ever since. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this film is not nearly as good as I've heard and read it was - at least not for me. I've seen better minor B film noirs, I've also seen worse. This one isn't too bad and is worth watching if you enjoy the dark crime films.*Spoiler*: Maybe I missed something but what I noticed is: Al Roberts was not arrested in the end of the film. They only showed him walking (or hitchhiking) and the police showed up, spoke to him and he got in the back of the police car UN-handcuffed. That means the police could have simply given him a ride in the same direction or he could have been brought in for questioning (he may or may not have been charged). The ending is left open to interpretation it seems to me. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful noir with a paranoid and jaded protagonist .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Film-Noir fans, Detour is a powerful noir. It wears its noirness on its sleeve. And does not try to come across as a polished big budget film or anything. Nor does it overstay its welcome - it is only 66 minutes long. The plot is quite interesting - the two encounters of a pianist hitchhiker when he is on the road to meet his girlfriend in Hollywood. The first encounter is with a talkative and sympathetic bookie who buys the broke piano player some food. The second one with a vicious blackmailing femme fatale that tears his life apart.The jaded psyche of the hitch-hiker is underscored in the film's second scene at a café when he turns away someone who tries to start small talk and reacts angrily when music is played on the jukebox. We are treated to his inner monologue which is utterly pessimistic and misanthropic throughout the film. He is a paranoid character who is unable to deal with the outside world. His only act of kindness (give a woman a lift) lands him in deep trouble. He does utter some cool one liners once in a while, though.Tom Neal is all right as the loser protagonist who is hard to like. Ann Savage as the vicious blackmailer steals the show in the film's second half.(7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Detour (1945): Dir: Edgar G. Ulmer / Cast: Tom Neal, Ann Savage, Edmund MacDonald, Claudia Drake, Don Brodie: Intriguing noir suspense about levels of complications. Tom Neal plays a nightclub pianist whose girlfriend heads to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. Neal hitchhikes after her and is picked up by a business gentleman who talks of his dying father and scars on his arm left by a woman. When he dies of a heart attack Neal buries the body and assumes the identity believing that police would accuse him of murder if he contacted them. Frankly, the coroner's report should prove otherwise. The biggest contrivance regards the hitchhiking woman who turns out to be the victim's blackmailing ex. Do we believe Neal's narrative? Even the silliness of the conclusion is striking from its viewpoint. Directed by Edgar G. Ulmer who plays with the film's sarcasm and thriller elements. Neal is fine as a victim of circumstance that concludes with two bodies. Ann Savage is vicious as the hitchhiker whom Neal learns much about and cannot counter. Edmund MacDonald is seen briefly as the victim but the role is pivotal. Claudia Drake rounds out the cast as Neal's girlfriend who seeks a career away from the madness. There are smaller roles that appear here and there but nothing beyond prop level placing. Low budget example of the compiles of sin and guilt. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Blow This Trap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A shoestring 67 minute production that effectively distilled 100 proof Noir.While the credits roll we see the desolate landscape of the desert from a vehicle barreling down a two lane highway, What's unusual about this barren landscape is that we are driving away from it. The scenery is passing us and receding into the distance, we are leaving what we know behind and we don't know what lies ahead. We are on a Detour and speeding towards oblivion, a Detour that's a metaphor for Destiny. The Destiny of one Al the Piano Player, late of the Break o' Dawn Club, Upper West Side Manhattan. Al had a steady gig tickling the ivories of the coffin with a bunch of hep cats in a combo, nightly at the Break O' Dawn Club, a smoke choked West side hole in the wall lounge. What made it bearable was Sue the cute peroxide canary, a real looker, and love of his life, as Al put it, he was a healthy American male and she was a healthy American babe and they had a healthy romantic relationship. One night as the club is closing Al, smoking like a Con-Ed stack, is pounding out a classical tune solo while waiting for Sue to change. When she arrives she tells him that" he'll make it to Carnegie Hall someday," he snaps back cynically, "Sure, as a janitor. Maybe I'll make my debut in the basement, Yeah, someday if I don't get arthritis first." He closes the fallboard and with a cigarette sticking to his lower lip declares "Let's blow this trap." As they walk uptown through the Hudson River fog (a clever low budget sequence that show just the tops of passing street signs sticking up through the dry ice fog) Sue gives Al the brush, she tells him that she wants a shot at the Big Time, Hollywood, Tinseltown. For Al, life without Sue makes him feel blue and dejected, playing for the café society patrons nets him an occasional ten spot tip. After a few months he decides to blow, he calls Sue from the club's phone booth and finds out that she's a waitress slinging hash in a beanery. Al tells her that he'll be right out, but he doesn't tell that he has no bread and will have to hitch. In Arizona he gets picked up by a pill popping bookie driving a 41' Lincoln convertible, name of Charlie Haskell, and he's traveling from New Orleans to LA. It's Al's lucky day, or is it? As they speed across the desert Charlie asks Al to get him the box of pills in the glove box, he does this a few more times apparently Charlie has some ailment. In the evening after buying Al a meal at a truckstop, Al notices some fresh scars above Charlie's wrist as he drives down the highway. Charlie notices Al looking, and tells him that a crazy broad he picked up gave them to him. A few hours later Charlie asks Al to drive. As Al tools along, in a nice noir stylistic sequence we see Al's eyes through the rearview mirror which segues into what is Al's last happy memory. We see Sue singing "their song" against a backdrop of shadow musicians. It's late night, Al is beginning to fall asleep at the wheel, we see his head nodding. A few sprinkles soon turns into a downpour. Al pulls over, they have to put up the top, he tries to wake Charlie who is unresponsive. Al gets out, and goes around to the passenger side, he opens the door and Charlie's dead body slumps out of the seat and caves his head in on a boulder. Al just bought a one way ticket to Noirsville. Al panics in genuine fear and desperation, he reasons that dressed they way he is and with no scratch in his pockets the cops will tag him for Charlie's murder, they'll never believe his story of what actually happened. Al decides to drag Charlie into the bottom of a gully, grab his wallet, assume his identity and toss his own suitcase and wallet down in with Charlie. He'll take the 700 clams and drive the car to LA then sell it. Al pulls off at the next motel and gets a room, the next morning he's showered, shaved, and dressed in Charlie's clothes. Back on the road to LA, Al stops to add water to the radiator. He sees a woman, Vera, (Ann Savage) standing at the side of the road hitching and yells out to her, even though "she looks like she just got thrown off the crummiest freight train in the world". Deciding to give her a lift, that ticket to Noirsville just got upgraded to express. Vera looks like she was ridden hard and put away wet, greasy dirty blond hair, rumpled and stained sweater and skirt, a lot of rough miles on her chassis. She's quite at first almost stone like but turns verbally ferocious practically spitting and hissing her razor sharp dialog, your worst nightmare a 24 year old Medusa who will turn your heart to stone. Savage is, quite possibly, the most terrifyingly vicious Femme Fatale of Classic Noir. Vera's arrival brings the film to a whole new level Vera also brings one of the greatest Noir twists to the plot of Detour, if you thought it couldn't get any worse for Al, your in for a shock. Detour, a "Poverty-Row" production was shot on a few cheap sets in 6 days. But it was a flare at the end of a dark tunnel showing a way to other cash strapped film-makers to make something out of nothing.

		<shortDescription>"Detour" Is Classic Low-Budget Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1940s &amp; '50s, going to the movies required a commitment of an entire evening. You'd be treated to a newsreel, a cartoon, a short, previews, and then a double-feature, which included a "B" movie (typically just over an hour long) followed by the main feature (one featuring A-list actors and the top screenwriters and directors of the day). How different from today's multiplex dogma of showing just one feature as many times as possible throughout the course of a day."B" movies were often horror films, Three Stooges shorts, westerns (in the early years), or serials (such as Andy Hardy or Charlie Chan), the main features would be the expensive musicals, dramas, and other big-budget productions. "B" movies were even made by separate studios. MGM and Paramount would never stoop to producing "B" movies. Whereas "B" movies were produced by the long-defunct Monogram Pictures, Republic Pictures, and others. While the "B" movies were usually shot on shoestring budgets, and often featured actors unknown to most Americans, some of them have become classics. One such "B" movie classic is Edgar Ulmer's 1945 flick, "Detour." Starring Tom Neal as a drifter hitchhiking his way across the country, "Detour" takes his character, Al (no last name required), through a series of missteps which serve to tighten the proverbial noose of classic film noir around his neck until the (basically) decent man is faced with spending perhaps the rest of his life behind bars. First, Al is picked up by a pill-popping bookie who accidentally dies when Al is driving. Fearing the police will assume Al killed the bookie, he steals the car and the man's identity. We can call this Mistake #1. Mistake #2 occurs when he picks up a female hitchhiker named Vera, a woman with no apparent moral standards, who blackmails Al by threatening to turn him in for murder. As Vera, Ann Savage gives one of the greatest femme fatale performances ever. She's hard-blooded, ruthless, and (dare I say) savage. Suffice to say, Vera is not the kind of girl you'd bring home to mama. And I loved the fact that, contrary to almost every other picture of the day, the woman was the smartest character in the film. Years after I first saw "Detour," Ann Savage's achievement is still fresh in my mind.While the production and camera-work leave a lot to be desired, "Detour" is one of the greatest examples of film noir ever. It features all the staples of the genre ? dark shadowy sets, murky black &amp; white lighting, a no-nonsense voice-over narration, and generally good characters pulled by outside forces into a web of deceit. Film noir protagonists often operated just outside the law, on the fringes of society. These weren't men who typically had a lot of friends. And when the protagonist was a cop, he was typically a plainclothes investigator who was at odds with the boys at headquarters. Think Glenn Ford in "The Big Heat." These weren't the "white hat" heroes you'd find in the "A" movie, or main feature."Detour" masterfully draws upon these tenets of the film noir style to present, through a highly personal story featuring very few characters, a world devoid of hope and promise. Now before you ask, "Why on earth would I want to see this?," I must tell you that "Detour" is a lot of fun to watch. I suppose we know early on that things will not end well for Al, the lead character. But getting from the opening scene to the somewhat inevitable conclusion is a 68-minute thrill ride unlike almost any ever put on celluloid.Edgar G. Ulmer was a relatively unknown director. "Detour" is his claim to fame. And it's so good it makes me wonder what Ulmer could have done with a big studio budget. We'll never know, of course, but the Library of Congress was smart enough to tag "Detour" for preservation in the National Film Registry ? meaning we'll always have access to this Buried Treasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the pianist Al Roberts gets tired of being miserable and missing his girlfriend who traveled across the country to seek her fortune in Hollywood, he decides to leave New York behind. He has no money to pay for the trip from one coast to the other, so he decides to hitchhike, something that proves to be his downfall. A man who picked him up dies during the journey and Al panics when he pessimistically expects to be accused of the death. He steals not only the man's car, but also his identity and stows away the corpse in a ditch. He then decides to pick up a hitchhiker named Vera, but he will soon regret it because she seems to know his dark secret and will not hesitate to take advantage of it.The story feels more than a little strained on more than one occasion. It's hard not to fall in love the hopelessness that constitutes Detour. A low-budget thriller directed by Edgar G. Ulmer. Sure, it's an extremely simple B-movie, but it is packed full of interesting quotes, friendly cynicism, pitch black darkness and at least as much rain. It is insanely entertaining to see Vera and Al throw sharp barbs at each other while the tones are so miserable that they find it hard to laugh at them.With a playing time of over 70 minutes says Detour goodbye long before it has time to start to feel tiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1/2 Great Movie, 1/2 Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to rate this film a 6. I really do. So much is good about this film. The storyline is interesting, the plot is taut and moves briskly, the scenario is believable, and the acting is great. It was easy to empathize with the main character and his girlfriend, even though this movie was made 70 years ago. In short, I really wanted to like this movie.However, the action breaks down around the 3/4 mark. Once the lead character is saved from outing himself by selling the car, the excitement steadily winds down without any sort of climax or denouement. Our protagonist begins to act irrationally, blaming himself for the death of his captor and skipping town without contacting the woman he loves.I understand that film noir is intended to be dark, gritty, cynical, and potentially tragic. It wasn't the unhappy ending that got to me; it was the lack of a payoff after the buildup, the lack of climax after an entire movie of wondering how the lead character would get out of the situation. His captor merely dies suddenly, then, in the next frame, he's in Nevada. Not exactly Oscar-worthy material.In short, the first 3/4 of the movie is great and gets 8/10. The second half is totally anti-climactic and gets 3/10. I average that out to a 6/10.</fullReview>

There are lots of holes in the plot, but it draws you in and you want to know what's going to happen.The blackmailing dame is a particularly odd ball character who shifts on a dime from a hard talking mama to a girlie girl who wants an affair and then back again! And why the guy does't just go for the 20 year old Makes no sense.Another thing..they want to get $2k from a used car. And are offered $1,850 That's close to $25K in today's money. Seems steep.As the movie goes on, Robert becomes more and more pathetic and his actions make no sense, but so what? Go for the ride.

		<fullReview>Although this film has a good storyline, I found myself losing interest quite a bit. The cinematography was beautiful throughout the entire film. My absolute favorite part was the shot where the woman was singing and the shadows of the three horn players were in the background. The low-key/high contrast lighting in the film was really great. That's one trait of Noir films that I really love and this film did it nicely. Whether the shot was during the day or night, whether it was on a person or just an object, it was really crisp. I also really liked how most of the sound throughout the film consisted of internal sound/dialogue. That made it a little more interesting to follow.I actually found myself sympathizing with the naive lead character, but at the same time, I also really loved Ann Savage's portrayal of the Vera. She was probably one of my favorite parts of the film.Although this film had good elements, the story didn't keep me interested and I found myself losing focus on it multiple times. However, I thought the ending was really, really excellent. It tied the film together really well and the lead's innermost thoughts were really neat to hear.</fullReview>

The film has all of the components of a film noir. It was interesting to watch this man, who started off just a lovesick man chasing after the one who got a way. A totally cliché but innocent plot. He makes a poor decision - probably because of his desperation to find Sue - that seems to come back to haunt him. It's almost as if Vera was his earthly punishment for his sin of ditching Haskell's body and attempting to steal his identity. He seems like a genuinely kind-hearted person, but then you realize the magnitude of the evil he's done in the wake of Haskell's death. Vera is much more on-the-surface evil, and her evil is the kind that comes from her general disposition. Al's evil was driven by his unconditional love for Sue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From poverty row's back-alley backlots to the public domain's online archives, this shoddy yet sublime article endures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made on a shoestring budget of $100000 on 3 sets with some location shooting in under a month, Edgar G Ulmer's 'Detour' is poverty row filmmaking at it's finest. Often heralded for it's gloomy atmospherics, the film has come to be known as one of the best noirs of the postwar era. Unlike many others of the genre, it has no guns or goons and a straightforward narrative.Baby-faced piano-player Al (Tom Neal with some five O'clock shadow to compensate) regales us of how he hitch-hiked across America in pursuit of his girlfriend Sue (a relatively angelic Claudia Drake) only to be detoured, over a cup of coffee in a dingy diner. It's a tale of double manslaughter, extortion, mistaken identity, and the uncontrollability of one's destiny (or as he'd prefer, fate). Ironically, Neal himself would be convicted of manslaughter sixteen years later under far less dubious circumstances. Just as America was discovering it's superpower status at the end of World War Two, Ulmer offers a vision of the American Nightmare with the odd couple dynamic of Al &amp; Vera (Ann Savage, whom our protagonist meets in the latter half of the picture) posing as husband and wife slumming it in a motel room. The American woman is also depicted as equally powerful if not more so than her male counterparts (not that that would last with the social reversion of the coming decade).'Detour' is full of loose ends and unfulfilled plots, but that's what sets it apart from other film noir. It's criminals aren't professionals, they're as inept as any of us, and maybe that's why it resonates so much.</fullReview>

It was fast moving at times as well. The movie dragged along at some parts, but for the most part it could keep an audience engaged throughout. The acting was really good in this movie, which also could keep an audience engaged during the entire movie. Overall, this wasn't the best movie out there, but it was certainly better than a lot of movies out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Low-budget Devining of Noir Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The pace starts slowly, almost dully some might say - what with extended narrated establishing of premises and recital of boogy-woogie Brahams, and Chopin in the original - then gradually picks up, quickening in both action and suspense, and moving, but not in chronological order, toward the end. Thus with highly realistic pacing it creates in 67 minutes a strong sense of the passage of time.There is change of venue: from that of a music club on New York's Upper West Side, to a car in nighttime transit belonging to the first unfortunate victim, then to a tiny motel room after his demise. It doesn't really get going till about the middle, when the second protagonist, apparently well known among aficionados as Noir's shrewdest femme fatale, hops in - and we're driving around in the car again, this time in daylight.The dialogue between the two benighted stars gets inspired at several points. On moving into their somewhat cramped &amp; stuffy furnished apartment rented on fraudulent pretenses, the one asks the other concerning the mechanized sleeping arrangements (Perhaps a Stymetz Bed?) provided in the living room: "Do you know how to use this thing?" to which the reply is: "I invented it".This viewer finds the ending highly refreshing and original, though it was probably necessitated by restrictive censorship code of the time. Its dreary final resolution, while keeping the actual fate of the main character a mystery, cinches it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was OK, i can't say it was anything awesome, but i didn't hate it either. it about a man on his way to California, and through an odd series of mishaps ends up killing two people by accident. the story was decent, but i thought the execution could have been far better, especially the acting. i did think it was cool how basically the whole movie is a flashback with him telling the whole story and what he was thinking the entire time. i didn't think there was really anything notable about the movie beside the plot, everything else seemed just about like every other movie from it's time. this is another film i think could be remade very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A grimy, road-weary guy walks down a misty road late at night. He turns into a cheap diner and, in a foul mood, snaps at another guy for playing the wrong song on the jukebox. So what's eating him? Cue lengthy flash-back scene as he recounts his desperate tale of thwarted love and ambition, strange deaths, a femme-fatale (sort of) and generally just the worst luck imaginable. Yes, we're in the land of noir again and this short and bitter-sweet movie, despite its uneven construction and unlikely events nevertheless makes for a convincing genre-piece.Tom Neal stars as our Mr "If it wasn't for bad luck I'd have no luck at all" clip-joint pianist who loses his singer-girlfriend to the bright lights of Hollywood who then decides to follow her there but with no money, has to hitch-hike his way there all the way from New York. On the road he happens upon a generous guy about his own age who agrees to take him the last part of his long journey when fate takes a hand and the world's worst series of unfortunate events start to happen to him.As is usual with noir, a huge amount of disbelief has to be swallowed as unlucky and highly coincidental events engulf him, but this low-budget does what all good noirs must, create its own world of no-hope desperation leading up to the usual unhappy ending. For much of the film, we're left to watch Hoag scratch and fight with the mysterious young woman whom he casually picks up on the same road to L.A. And sparks certainly fly between them. These scenes are the dark heart of the movie and the suitably named Ann Savage really chows down as the heartless, driven, even deranged girl he tangles with.Yes, you could pick holes a mile wide in the exposition and the film could have been wrapped up in twenty minutes if he'd only gone to the police in the first place, but of course that was never an option. It all ends badly for everyone as it inevitably must. Strongly acted and atmospherically directed this is a good little-noir, certainly worth detouring your attention for its brief but telling 67 minutes running-time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Trip Down a Deranged Path</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My lasting impression of Detour was the complex presence of lead character Al Roberts. Much has been said about Al's mental state and with good reason. Sat silently and stone faced travelling aimlessly, his presence gave the opening scenes a mysterious quality which only enhanced once the camera quickly moved in on Al's face. The lights darkens to the extent where his bold eyes are the focus points, drawing us into his mind where a tale of greed and ambition unravels.We quickly learn of Al's complexity from his back story via his internal monologues. When his long time girlfriend and performance partner Sue decides to crack Hollywood, Al follows suit. Throughout his hitchhiking travels he continues his internal monologue talking about the dangers of money, how it destroys and causes greed. In retrospect this is a foreboding for what follows. Although Al denounces greed it seems that he ends up succumbing to this vice. The plot spirals into dangerous territory after the death of a stranger Al meets hitchhiking. Was it truly an accident or was it murder? What ever the cause of death it must have taken place during the fantasy sequence of Sue singing "I can't believe you're in love with me". Considering the noir nature of Detour it is not surprising if Al killed for the woman he loved.Therefore we begin to analysis the actions of Al. Since Detour is from Al's perspective, we only see what Al sees. It becomes a distorting experience to the point where we feel the same disposition. Things go from bad to worse when Al, now using a false identity meets Vera. Knowing Al's true identity instead of giving up to the police Vera decides to use Al for money. This is where Detour reaches its peak in its noir nature, the contrasting chemistry between Al and Vera as they sarcastically abuse each other at their own pleasure. Vera is the typical femme fa tale, a woman willing to do anything for her own gain acting in a determined, callous manner. Using her scheming ways to the extent where she wants Al to continue faking his identity in order to collect an inheritance.Soon there is a tense standoff between the pair when Vera out of spite attempts to call the police on Al. The close ups between Vera and Al with along with the tense silence builds up to a fatal end. Another questionable death takes place after Al breaks in Vera's room to find her dead, the chord wrapped around her neck after collapsing on her bed in a drunken state. From the shared POV shot the cinematography creates a blurred effect which again raises questions to Al's sanity.By Detour's end the question of Al's sanity is solved as he is apprehended by the police, most likely to appease the Hay's code which unfortunately takes away Detour's ambiguity. Yet the ending sums up a tragic story in typical noir fashion. All Al wanted to do was to be with his girlfriend but somehow descended into a state where seduced by greed and desire drove him to murder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good low budget noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his girlfriend moves to Hollywood in order to pursue an acting career, nightclub pianist Al Roberts (Tom Neal) decides to join her and embarks on a long journey to California. While hitchhiking, he is picked up a by a mysterious man who offers to take him all the way to his destination, but he is then forced to take a little detour.The beginning of the film is a little slow, but the pacing is very good once the story starts to unfold. I was pleasantly surprised that a film with such a small budget can be so well put together, especially since it was shot in only four weeks. "Detour" is in essence a B movie, but it has all the ingredients of a classic in the same time. I was expecting the plot to be a little more elaborate, but I found the story to be engaging enough. Lead actor Tom Neal does a decent job here and so is Ann Savage who delivers the best performance in the movie. I thought that her acting was quite unusual for its time, but this aspect alone makes her role even more interesting.Of course, the film has its flaws (some lines in the film are really good, but I felt that the script could have been better and there were moments when the characters seemed a little unrealistic), but in the end this is a good entry in the film noir genre.My rating: 7,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uncomfortable diversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sex, murder, a guy and a girl; that's all there is to director Edgar G. Ulmer's "Detour". But when it comes to noir, you don't need anything else. Those are the basic ingredients right there.Today "Detour" is mostly known for being shot on a shoe-string budget, Ulmer knocking the film out in six days, using only three sets, a few props and some stock footage. This sparse aesthetic works well, though, meshing perfectly with the hazy, half-recollections of our central character, who narrates the film. Unreliable narrators are a staple of noirs, but here we have a narrator who may not even be aware that he's lying to himself. Is he being completely honest, is he delusional, or is he fudging the truth to paint himself in a favourable light? You decide.7.5/10 ? "Detour" doesn't reach the heights of cinema's best noirs, but it's so fast, cheap and moody that you have to admire it for what it is. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grade B, but one of the most memorable of film noirs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)"What kind of dames thumb rides? Sunday school teachers?"I guess this would be the most appropriate tagline for this black and white grade B noir from 1945. Al Roberts (Tom Neal) is the one asking the rhetorical question, although it could have been Charles Haskell Jr. (Edmund MacDonald) who has some nasty scratches on his hand to prove he can speak from experience. The lady in question is Vera (Ann Savage) who can turn on you like a cornered rat and strike at you like a rattlesnake, which is what she does to Roberts after he's picked her up hitchhiking. In a scene as startling as any I've seen in quite a while, Vera wakes from a nap and suddenly, without warning, but in retrospect with plenty of foreshadowing, viciously tears into Roberts who finds himself caught in a deadly vice of his own making.Roberts plays it passively, a born loser who knows he's losing again. A pianist who once dreamed of Carnegie Hall, he just knuckles under to Vera who comes off as a dom?--well, I won't use the word, but she appears to be the kind of dame who likes black leather while welding certain items of inducement, shall we say. But Roberts can't get a yen for her since he's still in love his sweetheart, a night club singer named Sue Harvey (Claudia Drake). Too bad, if he had, he might have gotten the upper hand in his relationship with Vera because she certainly wants him. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, it is said, and 'tis true, I can tell you, but Vera had the fury from first glance.Some of the dialogue is pretty lame, dime novel realistic you might say, the kind of talk that is written on the fly without imagination. E.g., "As I drove off, it was still raining and the drops streaked down the windshield like tears," which might not have been half bad except that the windshield wipers were flapping and there were no tracks of anybody's tears? Or, how about this: "Life's like a ball game. You gotta take a swing at whatever comes along before you find it's the ninth inning." Strange to say though, sprinkled among the prosaic and the banal are such gems as the one at the top of this review and this: "So when this drunk handed me a ten spot after a request, I couldn't get very excited. What was it I asked myself? A piece of paper crawling with germs. Couldn't buy anything I wanted." Sociologically speaking, this is a bit of a retrofit from the Depression era which featured gritty tales about guys down on their luck hitchhiking and looking for that one big shot at something, anything, love, money, half a break. And Roberts, even though a pianist of some talent, is like a James M. Cain protagonist, an ordinary Joe who gets involved with a dame (or two) and somehow makes the wrong moves and ends up in the deepest of deep quagmires. And like many another antihero, we can sympathize with him although we know and can see it's mostly his own damn fault. Fate has dealt him a bad hand that he should have tossed in, but he plays it out with the kind of fatalism that would befit a minor Greek tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Much with Little</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talented, somewhat experimental, director Edward G. Ulmer's early noir "Detour" is widely regarded as a genre classic. Ulmer had little to work with - a strong but depressing plot, some well-developed characters, an excellent femme fatale (Ann Savage), and a script which, at times, seems to have ambitions that exceed its scope and budget. Yet, he made a film which would strongly influence and help to define a major developing genre in mainstream film for decades.Detour's status in the noir canon has more to do with its innovations than the film's quality or entertainment value. Think structure and plotting: The story takes a few catastrophic twists along the way, people die, the film is shadowy (but not nearly as stylized as later noir), there is an unforgettable femme fatale (Savage), voice-over narrative and a lot of driving.Don Neal passably plays a talented pianist engaged to a lovely, vivacious jazz singer (Claudia Drake). Al Roberts, however, is not just a piano player. He is a classic mope, whining his way through life and searching for new excuses and new pathways to failure. Although Neal's acting does little to improve the sympathetic development of this character, his charming relationship with Sue (Drake) and his musical talent spare him from complete audience detachment. The story foreshadows Al's fate pretty nicely, but the series of events that lead up to it are still somewhat shocking. I won't discuss the plot twists - which are the film's key elements, except to say that they are why Detour is worth watching - especially Ann Savage's exceptionally tough and yet powerfully sympathetic performance.Road movies are a a strong but uneasy subgenre in Noir. Detour innovates in both of these areas, and does so powerfully. Ulmer's directorial talents save this film - the story line could have been an absolute train-wreck in less talented hands. The film is, essentially, over-the-top, depressing, and just a bit fantastic. Voice-over is used to hurry the plot along, and unfortunately, this happens in several key places. While voice over would become a hallmark of noir as the genre developed,its use was certainly not perfected here, and the problems seem to result from budgetary and scope constraints, not artistic decisions. Aside from Savage and good support from Edmund McDonald, the cast is weak. There are also considerable set limitations. Luckily, Ulmer would continue to innovate and skirt the mainstream throughout most of his career - maintaining a kind of independence that today's financially backed "indy" directors would have some difficulty understanding. Generally, his films are worth seeing - and not just for film buffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic cheapie that defies expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detour is one of those cinematic aberrations that occur every now and then: a good film that has no right to be as good as it is. Filmed on a budget that makes a shoestring look fat, in under a week, and confined largely to just two sets, you'd think everything would be against it. But the film is adapted by Martin Goldsmith (Anthony Quinn's brother-in-law) from his own pulp novel, and it's the writing that goes a long way towards defining this film. The cast of sour, jaundiced character spit lines that are as corrosive as acid. 'I'd hate to see a fellow as young as you wind up sniffin' that perfume Arizona hands out free to murderers,' Ann Savage's hardnosed femme fatale Vera (voted one of filmdom's top 10 villains by Time) snarls to Tom Neal's luckless Al Roberts who finds himself sucked into a spiralling sequence of events that can only spell trouble for him.The foreshadowing of doom lays heavy over the whole proceedings, making it something of a treasure for fans of darkest noir. Tom Neal, who had a reputation for hard-living (he once severely beat actor Franchot Tone for paying too much attention to his wife) was himself involved in a real-life crime 20 years after making this flick when he was imprisoned for the involuntary manslaughter of his wife after she was shot in the back of the head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Detour" is a standout noir, made in 1945 for pennies, and starring Tom Neal, whose art was later imitated in his life when he was charged with murder. Neal is effective as a man who seems on the surface to be a victim of bad luck and poor judgment. Real bad luck and real poor judgment. Trying to get from New York to LA by hitchhiking so that he can be with his girlfriend, Al, a talented pianist, is picked up by a guy named Haskell, who, at some point during the ride, dies of we don't know what - probably heart failure. The guy kept taking pills of some sort - my guess is it's digitalis because if it were speed, he wouldn't have fallen asleep. At any rate, his death leaves Al with a dead body and a car. Feeling no one will believe his story, he hides the body, changes clothes with the victim, takes Haskell's driver's license and money, and leaves. First mistake. Surely an autopsy would have confirmed the man died of heart failure, number one; and number two, Al in his narration makes reference to the body falling out of the car when he opened the door, indicating that there would then be a bump on the head and he'd then be accused of hitting him. Uh, Al, I doubt it - the ground was wet and the guy was DEAD. But instead of driving to the nearest police station and explaining what happened, Al takes off. Later on, he picks up a hitchhiker named Vera. It turns out that she knows he isn't Haskell and uses her knowledge to get him to do what she wants to get more money. If it was downhill in the beginning, now the situation becomes a sheer drop.There is speculation by viewers that Al is a big fat liar and that his narration, which makes him look like a victim of chance, is skewed, that the facts don't fit his story and that his girlfriend Sue didn't exist. That is a very interesting way to look at this film, and that conjecture may be true. On the other hand, Al may just be a loser and the victim of bizarre circumstances.The whole film, and I saw a very grainy print of it, has a bizarre atmosphere. In the New York section, as Sue and Al walk through the streets, there's a fog machine going nuts, giving rise to the conjecture that Sue and Al's romance with her are just in his imagination. The character of Vera is frightening and pathological; one minute she wants to be treated like a woman by being complimented, and she comes on to Al, and the next, she's threatening him and acting like a shrew. More inconsistencies. The hard-looking Ann Savage is savage indeed in the role, which is by necessity a quite exaggerated portrayal. Handsome Tom Neal does a good job as Al, and his role includes a substantial narration throughout. Is this narration what really happened, or is it what he is planning to tell the police if caught? We don't know. The ending was tacked on at the last minute and frankly doesn't feel right. I like the idea of the ambiguity of the original ending, which matches the ambiguity of the story. The viewer does see this ending, but then it is followed up by another minute of film apparently demanded by the censors.With Neal's subsequent real-life violent actions and his ultimately being accused of murdering his wife, this film takes on some really macabre aspects. "Detour" will always remain perhaps the most unusual noir ever produced: made for no money, the strange circumstances of the story, a character who may or may not be lying to the audience, and a leading man who perhaps took his role too seriously. A striking film.</fullReview>

It was made for $30K and looks it, with poor cinematography, occasionally bad sound quality, and sloppy editing. However, it is an interesting example of 1940s film noir, with Savage a riot playing the femme fatale from hell who tries to use Neal to get easy money. Neal, who apparently was a brute off screen, is appropriately wimpy here. As has been noted by others, there are numerous goofs in the film. Given the budget constraints, Ulmer makes the most of it, although it is not surprising that he never graduated to A pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For every wannabee actor, writer director or producer; this film should be an inspiration. They probably spend more to make a college work shop film than DETOUR. When it was made in 1945, it never made a money or brought any fame to anyone. So why is this film on the National Registry? Is it the fantasy of everyone who watches thinks they could write, direct, act or produce a better film? Most of us can not, or will not produce such a work in as little time, with as little money to spend on production. That is one of the things that makes this film special. Perhaps it is like one of those books your English teacher told you not to read because it lacked critical aclaim. But you read it and you could not put it down until you finished reading. It was also probably a short book, and this is a very short (61 min) movie.Perhaps some of the fascination about this movie centers on the "star". Has any actor lead a more interesting real life? Some might consider Neal's fight over a woman typical Hollywood antics. But he did break Tone's nose and gave him a concussion. The fact that Neal was a Harvard Law school grad, a boxer with a wining record and a real time convict for killing his wife was more than most stars could claim in their resume.Tom Neal in real life would probably make a better plot than DETOUR.Odly enough, DETOUR does predict some aspects of his real life that followed the fight with Tone. The theme of the movie sounds like Neal's defense when he was charged with premeditated murder. He was eventually convicted of involuntary manslaughter. In the movie, Neal is involved with two deaths that are not murder, but the appearance of which drives the main theme with grainy banal dialogue and illogical scenes. Some of the classical music score adds to the contrast to the grittiness of the film itself. The plot has Neal's singer girl friend leaving him for stardom while he was content to play piano in a third class bar for tips. Neal's poverty and desire to be with his girl friend is the reason he hitch-hikes and eventually meets the two people whose untimely deaths appear as murder. Maybe this movie is the reason hitch-hiking began to lose its popularity. The only really classy prop used in this film was a 1941 Lincon Convertible with a V-12 engine and Continental spare tire trim.Apparently it was owned by the producer or director and worth a few bucks in 1945 dollars when cars had not been made for the duration of WWII (1942-1945).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DETOUR is a tightly woven low-budget thriller with low-key B&amp;W photography that matches the starkness of the budget--and sets that can't disguise the film was made on a shoestring. But it pits together two fascinating characters--TOM NEAL, a man down on his luck when he hitches a ride with a wealthy but worthless man, and ANN SAVAGE, who turns out to be the man's former playmate--and just as worthless.Savage tends to deliver all her lines in sharp, staccato fashion as though she's imitating the poor man's SUSAN HAYWARD--and while the overacting is rather extreme on her part, she does manage to keep the tension on a high level as she mercilessly taunts Neal with knowledge of what he's done when the man who gave him the ride dies at the wheel and Neal foolishly takes his identity.TOM NEAL shows that he had the right stuff to play more of these roles if only his career hadn't hit the skids after a couple of tabloid scandals, one of which landed him in jail. He's an interesting actor to watch as he goes through dark despair when his plight becomes like a tight noose around his neck.Well worth watching but don't get your expectations up. It's the kind of film noir fans of that genre should appreciate. Others beware. It does look like the "poverty row" movie it is, filmed in a brisk time-saving six days for $60,000.</fullReview>

It's a really nice bit of acting that outshines the pretty shoddy material it's set in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breezy journey ending in a poignant sense of darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film noir, Detour had a really smooth storyline that was easy to follow and rolled by pleasantly. We follow the story of Al Roberts, a guy with such a naive "gee golly" personality, that he'd fit right into the sitcom "Leave it to Beaver, as he travels across the country to cure his love sickness for his girlfriend. The story then becomes wonderfully twisted in a film noir way, but elements of the movie do seem to retain a more open feel. They're driving on a highway, after all, but cramped interior sets, the classic noir narration told with a sense of pessimism not yet present in the character with the flashback scenes, add to the noir flavor.There's also the femme fatale, Vera, who has a weariness to her that most film noir heroes end up with at the end of the movie. Vera only skirts the edges of sexuality and instead, is much more outwardly viscous.In conjunction with the noir tradition and as expected from the narration, the movie ends unhappily. However, the ironies that mark Roberts' tragic fate hit me with such an echoing sense of darkness and despair, I had to marvel at it. That's the film's crowning glory, I think.However, if the film's climax and closing scene are beautifully poignant, the entire story before the climax seems too much to breeze through too lightly, so that the film in its entirety isn't as memorable as other great film noirs like Double Indemnity, Murder my Sweet, or Big Sleep. Maybe it's cause the film wasn't even 70 minutes long and there wasn't enough depth to the characters to make the revealing of their tragic fates as effective as it could have been, which is a shame because these characters were interesting enough that I wanted to have gotten to know them better before they met their ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Good review from bmacv ("An unforgettable accident that paved the low road for film noir", bmacv from Western New York, 14 July 2004). Also, JohnWelles ("From Straw Comes Gold", JohnWelles from United Kingdom, 13 April 2011) has an interesting commentary.***Detour (1945, Edgar G. Ulmer&#x200b;) is a low-budget, Film Noir&#x200b; cult film that entertains today. Three drifters are experiencing a luckless world without pity. While the production qualities are uneven, the 67 minutes spent taking in "Detour" feels very worthwhile.Al Roberts (Tom Neal--more on him later) is an embittered, impoverished pianist who accompanies his chanteuse girlfriend Sue (Claudia Drake) for the listening pleasure of drunks at an all-night Manhattan nightclub. The pair are excellent musicians: She sings beautifully while he improvises Chopin skillfully. Unfortunately, they both know they are far from the station that they each deserve. Hearing ambition's lonely call, she moves to Hollywood. In time he decides to follow her by way of hitchhiking. Traveling by the kindness of strangers is going well until he catches a ride near Phoenix from a Miami-based bookmaker named Charles Haskell Jr. (Edmund MacDonald). Haskell is a link between Roberts, a lost family fortune and a terrifying ex-girlfriend, Vera (Ann Savage). When Haskell dies, apparently because of a heart attack, the innocent Roberts fears the State will unfairly convict and execute him for murder. So he dumps the corpse and assumes Haskell's identity while driving to meet Sue in Los Angeles. Who today would do otherwise?Reality sets in after Al Roberts picks up Vera, who is also hitchhiking to LA. Vera, the deceased's former flame, surprises Roberts by immediately seeing through the deception that he is Haskell. They form a bipolar partnership, as the generally spineless and misanthropic Roberts is increasingly controlled by the treacherous and beguiling Vera. In Los Angeles, she convinces him to sell the car and pose with her as the married Haskells. When alone in their hotel room, she manipulates him while also trying to seduce him. The two are building up to a violent conclusion; but when it arrives it is not nature's preferred way. Nor does the finale resemble any other story's conclusion in recorded history.The songstress Sue and the sociopathic Vera are both irresistible in their own, dissimilar ways. Dour, moody and pessimistic, Al Roberts is worthwhile because of the plethora of memorably fatalistic lines he delivers in his voice-over. While the two female actresses both hit their roles out of the park, there is some question about Tom Neal's work in the lead role. Perhaps it is too out of character for him to portray someone allowing a dame to emasculate him so much. (After Detour's release, Neal's real-life brutality was revealed publicly. His first wife, to actress and singer Vicky Lane, ended in divorce with her citing "mental and physical cruelty." In 1951, the former boxer Neal severely beat up actor Franchot Tone, in a fight that started out of jealousy. In 1961, Neal is a gardener living in Palm Springs with his wife Gale Bennett, a receptionist. During a violent argument, she is shot and killed. Neal claimed he shot her during a struggle and he was subsequently convicted of manslaughter.)According to legend, "Detour", a leading example of a "Poverty Row" production, was filmed in just six days for $30,000. It has a huge following. The Black and White photography is suitably grim for film noir. "Detour" is possibly the most popular low-budget film ever made; I don't know anyone who doesn't enjoy it. It is a perfect hour to spend for those of us who understand life to be one slap to the face after another.This is great "B" movie with some obvious flaws. However, please exercise caution if you plan to thumb a ride to the revival theater showing this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Detour stars Tom Neil as Al Roberts, a hitch-hiker trying to make his way from New York to LA to be with a girl that had left him behind for Hollywood. Just hours away from his destination he gets picked up by Charles Haskell, who's willing to drive Roberts to his destination but suddenly dies in his sleep on the way. Detour is a hugely impressive film when you consider the meager $30,000 budget it was allowed by PRC. (a studio I've never even heard of) I didn't realize this when I started the film. I thought something was a bit off, but I didn't manage to figure out it was a budget flick until I had reached the ending. The film manages to carve a well-rounded narrative out of four actors, three sets, and the director's car. That's definitely worth admiring. Tom Neil gives a good performance, but he's completely overshadowed by Ann Savage as the film's femme fatale Vera. Vera is a character that feels like she was written to come off as real rather than cinematic. She's a good looking girl with a short temper and an angry demeanor. She didn't have the obnoxious lighting other femme fatales used that made them look glow in the dark and the writers didn't bother trying to shoehorn any completely out of place romance into the film, she was just a tough chick looking to make some quick cash off Roberts, a frightened, easy target. Ann Savage seemed like she was delivering her lines exactly how Vera would say them. She was harsh and irritable, and when she got the upper hand on Roberts she was smug and arrogant. Her performance was persuasive; she was dynamite, baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing road movie of Noir American cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The life of "Al Roberts" (Tom Neal), a pianist from New York, becomes a nightmare when hitchhiking decides to find his girlfriend who lives in Los Angeles. One rainy night, the man who wears it in your car dies ...This is a wonderful noir film in the series b in which it is shown, that with very little money and few resources can do a great job, provided there is a great filmmaker behind the camera with a clear vision of what is doing, and a very talented Austrian-born director Edgar G. Ulmer. He was assistant director of expressionist masters as Murnau, and it shows clearly in this film where the staging used perfectly chiaroscuro technique learned in Germany in the heyday of Expressionism.The film is one of the great signs of fate and destiny as typical American noir film, covered a total pessimism all times in which a man miserable and bland becomes involved in a journey hitchhiking where the twist of fate are cruel and hopelessly satisfactory end.Most of the sequences are in the evening with a great sense reinforcing mental darkness of a person who can not escape his fate, and even to have rolled down the obvious lack of money virtually alone without showing drawings of road scenarios, and almost always within a vehicle or heavy fog, it also gives the film a touch of sheer decadence supported by a pessimistic "voice in off" protagonist convinces himself of the fatality of his anguished life. The poor performances of the actors are marked in this way, and does not detract from the credibility of a story that seeks those imperfections in an obvious way to give it a painful and disgrace.It also has one of the "Femme Fatales" strangest and gender unglamorous being so unfriendly and rudimentary and not have the usual beauty or charisma of ladies always dragging men to a tragic fate. It is one of the trips from coast to coast in the United States more curious and emblematic never been filmed, and is surely one of the great black films made with very few resources in the history of Hollywood.</fullReview>

Nothing at all really seemed to happen, it would loose my attention a few times. Nothing was really likable about any of the characters, they were very bland/plain. It had a few interesting effects with the camera and editing, showing how Al Roberts was thinking, but that's all. Everything seemed to happen in a way that wasn't shocking, nothing was even thrilling. Maybe the scene towards the end was exciting for 3 minutes, but then it wasn't anymore.

		<fullReview>Film noir seems to be all about style and shadows for a lot of viewers - this is fine but in my opinion sells it short. Let's look closer.The film is bookended by scenes of our hapless schmuck in some anonymous twilight limbo - a bar for transients in Reno, so not even Vegas - ruminating about a dream he had of cruel fate. A familiar song in the jukebox triggers memory of the events that brought him where he is, this is the premise.Inside the remembered story, he was traveling all the way to Los Angeles to join his singer girlfriend in pursuit of the Hollywood dream. She wants to be in movies, he's a pianist of some talent and aspirations - he has to work in a honky tonk back east, but after closing time he plays Chopin in the quiet and his fingers dance. Of course money rules this world, material life in the big city, and not having any, he's constantly dissatisfied with himself and his talent. We get the sense that, when all is said and done, he'd rather make quick money in movies than play Chopin in the quiet.So how to exemplify that his heart is in the wrong place and really being led astray by the promise of a dream?Further down the road the dream turns into nightmare. By a twist of fate, he becomes the person with the sports car and bundles of money in his pockets, and so suddenly finding himself as the person he aspired to be. Incidentally standing to inherit a fortune of millions too as we later find out. The catch is that he finds himself at the mercy of this woman who steers him deeper into the implications of that dream.Seemingly none of this is of his doing or something he could help, from his end it's really just the way the mercurial gods of the road dealt the cards. But fate is an illusion; he can get out at any moment and confess truth, but this means he's sent to prison.This would be a prison where he's a nobody with no money, but is still himself and can pick up a phone and talk to his girlfriend. In the end he doesn't even have this, having dreamed to the end; he cannot even identify himself as himself, and is the sullen broken being that we first meet in that limbo of anonymous souls in transit.As usual with noir, the point of the film is strictly moral, a dream that steers the mind back into order and reminds that we control fate. But getting to see this far into the clouded mind, a mind clouded by narratives disguised as fate beyond control, is really valuable in-sight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody likes an unreliable narrator in any form of story telling, and Ulmer's 1945 Noir masterpiece gives us one of the most questionable purveyors of facts the genre has seen.Tom Neal plays Al Roberts, the man who we're supposed to entrust for the truthful retelling of recent events in his life, but about halfway through the film one can't help but be at least somewhat suspicious of Roberts' recounting of his tale of the cruel indifference of fate.Its like this: when a child does something wrong and they know they're going to get into some deep trouble for it they'll go to great lengths in order to make up a story so as to make them, the guilty , seem like an innocent person, while those around them were the ones conspiring against their well being. Roberts is arguably the same way: the story is told from his perspective, and if one adheres to the idea that he is, in fact, mentally unstable then everything that we've seen has been a lie in order to cover up for the murders for which he is guilty. A detour, not from Al's trip of getting from A to B, but from sanity.The edition of the movie that I saw was part of a Film Noir combo pack so the quality was poor (complete with alterations from black &amp; white to some sort of blue tint, and plenty of hissing audio.) but even the detracting qualities of the DVD could not hinder the brilliance of Detour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleazy nightmare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Playing out as some kind of nightmare, Detour demands repeat viewings since its running time is so short it leaves you hankering for more come the end. We follow the protagonist Al Roberts on the road, and watch (with accompanied narration) a sequence of events that see him in the middle of nowhere at a diner fearing for his future.Devilishly dark in tone, the film relies on a fine underplayed performance from Tom Neal as Roberts, and a gloriously annoying turn from Ann Savage as Vera. The film was made for next to nothing in only one week, and the whole film screams out as a low budget movie shot with a sleazy tint, but it fits perfectly for the genre, and although it took me two viewings to fully get onside with it, the film is an essential viewing for those interested in film noir. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest b-movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Detour" is the greatest b-movie of all time. Its hard to put your finger on just what makes it so brilliant. Sure, there are plenty of technical errors. Even the least observant will realize several goofs on the first viewing. However, Roger Ebert, a critic whom I'm not a particular fan of, nailed it right on the head when he said that these errors don't detract from the film, but they are the film.The film is one of the most thematically fascinating works ever made and its meaning and truth are open to debate. It makes one wonder if "Detour" was meant to be an existentialist premier on film noir or just another cheaply made b-movie to make a quick buck. Is its genius accidental? Possibly so. It includes all the standard noir elements, from the femme fatale to the hero without any luck to hardboiled dialog. However, the film takes all these and plays them to the highest extreme and creates a misanthropic masterpiece. Vera is a femme fatale, but the single nastiest woman ever in a film. There isn't one redeeming quality to her, but the protagonist Al Roberts clings to her like a leech. Roberts is the biggest loser ever in a film, both down on his luck at the beginning and constantly using fate as an excuse for his extremely poor judgment. The hard boiled dialog may seem contrived on paper, but it fits the downbeat atmosphere perfectly. "Detour" may not be the greatest film noir ever made, but no others epitomize the genre as this one does.As I said above, was this meant to be a masterpiece or just another crime flick to make a buck? We may never know as the film wasn't acclaimed as a masterpiece until years after it was released. That doesn't matter anyways. "Detour" is raw, improvised, and by any technical standards not exactly a virtuoso film. But it resonates like none other and the noir philosophy makes you question your existence. The flaws in "Detour" only add to the dreamlike atmosphere. Once seen, the film will haunt you for the rest of your life. (SPOILER) By the way, ignore the ending where Al is picked up by the cops. It was ordered by the MPAA to fit their moral standards of how a murderer needs to be brought to justice. In actuality, Al is doomed to wander the highways for the rest of his meaningless existence.

It's a movie of hope and hopelessness. It has that Macbeth sense of "what's done is done and cannot be undone." The poor slob is just trying to get to California and before he can do this he makes a fatal error. Common sense would dictate many more responsible actions, but once he pushes that body into the ditch, it's all over. The character of Vera is one of the most selfish, self centered, evil personages in all of filmdom. She has control and knows how to use it. Every action creates another layer of misdirection and, before long, we are suffering along with this man. I never wanted more to reach out and pluck a man from his circumstances. The starkness of the camera work. The sweaty browse. The piercing eyes of Vera. They all add up to a painful conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Blackest Films Noir I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Detour" has to be one of the most fatalistic films noir ever made.Laughably short (at 67 minutes), this nightmare film chronicles one man's bad day carried out to epic proportions. Tom Neal plays Al Roberts, hitchhiking across the country to join his girlfriend in L.A., who's set out to make a name for herself in Hollywood. He's picked up by a shady character named Charles Haskell, who inexplicably dies one night while Al is driving the car. Certain that no one will believe this bizarre story and will suspect him of killing Haskell, Al assumes his identity with plans to ditch the car in L.A. But he picks up Vera (Ann Savage), whom Haskell had given a ride earlier. Vera knows Al is up to something, and blackmails Al into joining her own money-grubbing schemes. These two hole up in an L.A. hotel, and what ensues is a domestic drama from hell.Ann Savage is nearly unwatchable as the repulsive Vera. She spits out each line like a snake spitting venom, and her harsh, angular features complement her abrasive personality. Tom Neal is effective as the dopey iconic film noir anti-hero, bullied by the femme fatale into doing whatever she wants, blaming the heavy hand of fate for his ill fortune. Is it a coincidence that a movie released in 1945, the year in which service men would be returning home to an uncertain home life, with both husbands and wives suspicious of each other's extra-curricular activities while they were parted, would paint such a demonic picture of domestic life? And how interesting (and hopeless) that everyone who comes across Al's path dies -- even Vera, whose manner of death I won't divulge so as not to spoil it -- was suffering from some unnamed illness, the implication being that she was not long for the world anyway. So essentially the entire trajectory of Al's downward spiral is pointless from the start. A far cry from the morale-building films that had glutted the marketplace for the last few years."Detour" seems to take place in a slightly alternate universe. Everything feels just a little off, with the feverish quality that comes from being too close to the inner workings of one man's obsessive thoughts. The America pictured here is barren and deserted; it's a world of empty roads, lonely filling stations and flea-bag diners in the middle of nowhere. The film was so cheaply made that the film stock and sound quality actually change throughout the picture. But these rough edges only enhance the movie's lurid appeal.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hitchhiking drifter with a string of bad luck (Tom Neal) gets more than he bargained for when he gets tangled up in a man's death and runs into a loud-mouthed babe with a real attitude with whom he fatefully shares a car drive (Ann Savage). She threatens to inform the police if he doesn't fall into line and follow her demands.Since a friend and I had just seen Edgar Ulmer's THE BLACK CAT (1934) together at a revival theatre, he decided to bring this noir film to my home for one of our Movie Nights, which came highly recommended by him. Frankly, I didn't get what all the fuss was about. I found Neal to have some amusing lines, and his volcanic co-star Ms. Savage was infrequently entertaining with her bitchy and maniacal ravings, even though hers is a pretty bad performance. I also didn't spot very many cinematic flashes of brilliance that I was hoping to enjoy in what essentially emerged to be a very poverty row-level production. After seeing and being underwhelmed by Ulmer's BLUEBEARD, MAN FROM PLANET X, DAUGHTER OF DR. JEKYLL, THE AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN and now DETOUR, my opinion that he just got lucky with the superior THE BLACK CAT is even more confirmed. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Detour" in a period that i was searching deeply film-noir films and especially b-movies of that kind.In order to appreciate this film you have to consider some things about its production.Only 6 days of shooting and 68 minutes runtime for a budget that could obviously create a category of c-movies.But Edgar.G.Ulmer's directing, Tom Neal's lonely figure walking through the streets and especially Ann Savage's marvellous acting makes this film astonishing.Of course you can see some plot goofs (Ann Savage's suicide with telephone cable) but the hole result is that a b-movie becomes classic.The hungarian's technique (much different from usual american's directing)takes place with:Light changing during a scene when Tom Neal remembers the unfortunate things that happened to him,tre-gro plans of a radio or a cup of coffee and a symbolic final scene with a last monologue of Neal about fortune.This movie can't be sized up with "the big sleep" or even "the maltese falkon" (which also was a low budget production) but shows a pessimistic way of thinking with the most powerfull and exciting way in a real detour of hero's common life</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was enticed to watch this film on the strength of Roger Ebert's review, who rates this as one of the greatest films ever. This is probably about the best cheaply made motion picture I've ever seen. It's about a nightclub piano player who wants to visit his estranged girlfriend in L.A. where she's a wannabe Hollywood star, but he doesn't have any money to go out there and has to hitch all the way. That's where his problems begin, more than that I will not tell you. This is something of a small 1940's masterpiece, well-scripted and easy to watch at 69 minutes. Some of the sassy 40s dialogue is absolutely hilarious. My only complaint is that the soundtrack is very bad and you really have to perk up your ears to hear it fully. If you made the exact same story with Bogie and Bacall, it would be considered a legit noir classic. As it is, it's a very good film just the same. ***1/2*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like Dumbo, this film has a rather odd length of exactly one hour (and five minutes), but it you can't imagine it and it doesn't need to be any longer, especially not to be put in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically New York nightclub piano player Al Roberts (Tom Neal) is in a highway restaurant, and a song starts to play, and he begins to have a flashback of his dark past. Where he was the piano player, his girlfriend Sue Harvey (Claudia Drake) is the singer, and she is moving to Los Angeles to try and get into the film industry. She goes on ahead, and Al decides to start travelling to meet her, and without money he can only hitchhike all the way, and he is picked up by Charles Haskell Jr. (Edmund MacDonald) who is heading the same way. After stopping in a café to eat, Al takes over driving to let Charles rest, it starts to rain and he needs to put the roof up, and that is when he discovers Charles is dead. He is very paranoid about calling the police and the truth about Haskell's death, so he decides to dump the body in the near desert and assume Haskell's identity, taking his car and wallet. After stopping for gas and assuming that he is going to be okay, he picks up a hitchhiking girl named Vera (Ann Savage) who he is very unlucky to discover knew Haskell. She is blackmailing him to sell the car for a good price, and she wants the money or else she will grass about All to the police. As they keep travelling to Hollywood, LA, she isn't completely concerned about why he has assumed Haskell's identity, she just cares about the money, but she may be developing a slight thing for him. So they get to Hollywood and find the nearest car dealership, but then Vera finds something that could mean more money, a newspaper reports that Haskell's father is very sick and planning to hand over an inheritance. Vera has turned Femme Fetale, wants Al to pose as Haskell to the millionaire father to get the money, and then she will let him off, but he thinks it is a ridiculous idea. It comes to the point where they have a long argument and Vera threatens to phone the police, she even take the phone to the next room, wrapping the cord around her neck, and trying to pull it back Al unintentionally strangles Vera. In the end, after having two deaths, Al is seriously depressed and knows he can't go and see Sue anymore, and coincidently while walking along a road, he is picked up be a police car. Also starring Tim Ryan as Nevada Diner Proprietor, Esther Howard as Diner Waitress Holly and Pat Gleason as Joe - Trucker at Diner. Filled with the common film noir traits, being in black and white, the leading character narrating with fluent flair, a greedy and dark female, death and a good simple story, it is a marvellous cult thriller. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very low-budget movie with a small cast and simple sets and camera-work. However, despite the simplicity of the film, it succeeds very well and is better than the average Film Noir picture. This is because the script, though having a few holes, is very creative and original. Plus, the writers really did a good job of catching the snappy Noir-style dialog. I have seen a lot of non-Noir films called "Film Noir", but this movie's grittiness, lack of sentimentality and characters make it a perfect example of the genre. About the only problems with the film were the ridiculous way Tom Neal reacted when the owner of the car hit his head and the incident with the telephone just didn't seem plausible at all. But, considering how well everything else was handled and how the film kept me on the edge of my seat, I still strongly recommend this film and think young film makers MUST see this film to understand it doesn't take a big budget to make a great film--something Hollywood should remember a little more often.</fullReview>

Is it worth giving up what he's good at just to thumb his way across the country to keep his would be "actress" girlfriend off the casting couch? The dude is simply hopeless. What he has in common with Ann Savage's character is they both have a screw loose. Are they natural born criminals or just a couple of lowlifes desperate for kicks? Do I sound like I hate the movie? No way, I love it! If anything, the characters make you feel better about your own problems for about an hour. It's so funny, too, especially after a couple of drinks. Watch this one with a group, at a party. You'll laugh your speed bumps off! Detour is an over the top, unintentionally funny cult noir classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The *best* film noir picture...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, this film-noir classic blows all those classy, polished looking "noirs" out of the water. No, you won't find Humphrey Bogart or Lauren Bacall here...no John Huston direction...No, this is truly gritty independent film noir. The real deal. The real brilliance here is in the lighting and in the writing. This script is so tight and concise but brilliant. The cinematography (by Benjamin Kline, who shot alot of the Three Stooges shorts) is truly some of the best ever seen in film noir. This is no cheap suspense movie. This is one of the truly greatest films ever made. Edgar G. Ulmer pulled this story off perfectly. And it is *so* believable given the production values and the performers. Check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this film by chance while visiting my parents' recently, who always keep the channel tuned to AMC or TCM. I don't like to watch a film if it has already started, and since this film looked really interesting, I decided to buy the DVD and watch it from the start. I'm glad that I did, as this film has quite a number of surprises (don't read the back of the DVD as they tell you what happens in the film - DUMB).As I read some of the reviews here, I can understand why some didn't care for it. You really have to like the leads in this film -- Tom Neal and Ann Savage. I've never heard of either one (I'm in my forties and try to keep up with the old timers of yesterday), but now I am a fan of both. Tom Neal is quite the stud with his brooding good looks, and Ann Savage is both a babe and the craziest chick ever to be put on film. I loved it!!(Spoilers)I thought the way the Haskell character bit the big weenie was really lame. He looked dead to begin with sitting in that car, so when he hit his head on the rock, my brain couldn't make the connection. When Vera got strangled by the phone cord, I also thought that was a bit lame also. Could anyone really get strangled to death by someone pullng on a phone cord from the next room? Well, when it happens I'll believe it.(end of spoilers)On the whole I really enjoyed the film, and have already been recommending it to others. I'm going to be on the lookout for more films starring both these fine actors (I think Ann Savage is probably just playing herself, but we'll see). Great little film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the perfect noir, except for the money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know how, when you're watching a James Bond movie, yousometimes think, "This is not the perfect James Bond movie. Idon't think the perfect James Bond movie exists. I know exactlywhat's in the perfect James Bond movie, and this movie has a lotof it, but it just ain't it"? If I were snooty, I would call that imaginarymovie the platonic form of the James Bond movie: the version of itwe have in our heads that is distilled to its essence.The same thing applies for film noir. I love each individual noir thatI've seen, but none of them quite matches the imaginary, perfectfilm noir that exists, fully-formed, in my head.Detour does not match my perfect mental image of what a film noiris and does. It comes pretty close, though. I might go so far as tosay that the only thing holding it back is its budget, which, judgingfrom appearances, was much less than the $786 Al Roberts(Neal) finds in the pockets of the man who gives him a lift.The movie opens after the story is over, with Al in a bar along thehighway, looking miserable, snapping at people for no apparentreason. And then...the flashback. So, story told in flashback,narrated by the protagonist...check that off on my list of platonicarchetypes.It seems that Al was a piano player at a club in New York, in lovewith Sue (Drake), the lounge singer. They wanted to get married,but needed money first, so she decided to try her luck inHollywood, against his wishes. Eventually, he decides to go outand join her and marry her no matter what. So he hitches fromNew York to Los Angeles. Along the way, he's picked up byCharles Haskell (MacDonald), who is wealthy, boorish, and,eventually dead, of natural causes (or so Al tells us...he's _very_adamant about it). Fearing the police will think he did it, andneeding money anyway, he steals Haskell's car, money, andidentity. Later on, he picks up a new hitchhiker, Vera (Savage),who wakes up after a brief nap and suddenly shouts at him,"You're not Charles Haskell. What did you do with him?" Turnsout she got a lift from Haskell before Al did. She is now in controlfor most of the rest of the movie, trying to milk the situation for asmuch money as she can, with the threat of a phone call to thepolice to make Al go along with it.The plot, admittedly, is kind of dumb, if you take it as you're given it. Would anyone really think that the police would mistake a heartattack for a murder by bludgeoning? Would anyone with a stolencar and an assumed identity, thinking he's on the run from thepolice, pick up a hitchhiker? I, however, tend to think that the storyAl tells us is the story he's telling himself-a kind of defensemechanism, covering up for what he's done, even if only tohimself. At one point he goes out of his way to tell us that, try asyou might, you can't cut a memory out of your brain. I think he'slying to us and himself, I think he's cut out two very specificmemories, and kept everything that surrounded them, and I thinkit's killing him.The movie was made on a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, verylow budget. It was made in three days with almost no crew. Bothof those things...well, they show. But the other element that showsis the large amount of serious talent that went into it. I mean, eventhough the look of the movie is largely dictated by the lack ofmoney, you can definitely tell that, had there been money, itwould've looked great. When Sue and Al are walking around NewYork City early in the movie, it's obvious that all the fog is there tohide the fact that there is, in fact, no city around them, but it lookswonderful, anyway...an expressionist nightmare. The scenes indarkness are filmed beautifully. And the composition of just aboutevery shot is like a painting, just as it should be in film noir. Interestingly, this movie's director, Edgar G. Ulmer, is one of thefew 100% direct links between German expressionism and filmnoir: before coming to America, Ulmer worked in Germany as F.W.Murnau's cinematographer, and he worked with Fritz Lang, too.Besides the look of the film, which, in a film noir is, arguably, themost important part, the line-to-line writing (leaving behind thequestion of whether the plot itself is good) is brilliant, full of thesnappy dialogue and depressive monologue that film noir isknown for. Of a ten dollar bill given as a tip at the nightclub, Alasks us, "What was it? A piece of paper, crawling with germs." OfVera: "She looked like she'd been thrown off the crummiest freighttrain in the world." Vera, to Al: "If you act wise, well, mister, you'llpop into jail so fast you'll get the bends." And one more: whenexplaining his relationship with Sue at the beginning of the movie,he Al tells us, "I was an ordinary healthy man, she was an ordinaryhealthy woman. Put that together and what you get is an ordinaryhealthy romance." (Our first hint that Al might not be telling us thewhole truth...)As for the acting, it's...well, it's very one-note, I have to say,especially on the part of Savage, who does not deliver a single linewithout being a biting, sadistic hell-beast. As for Neal, he's theput-upon, cynical noir anti-hero from start to finish. But hey, they'reboth really good at it, and each is playing straight to that platonicform I was talking about before.Which brings me back to my point. Detour is, in many ways, theperfect, platonic film noir...or would be, if only Ulmer had had someserious money to work with.</fullReview>

In a gas station, he gives a lift to Vera (Ann Savage), a woman that knew Charles and blackmails Al with tragic consequences."Detour" is a good film-noir, but with a flawed screenplay. The fate and bad luck of Al Roberts is not credible in the present days. His journey to meet his girlfriend turns into a nightmare supported by coincidences that makes the story impossible to be believed.

		<shortDescription>Nothing Short of Brilliant!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edgar G. Ulmer's classic 1945 film noir "Detour" gives new meaning to the derisive phrase "Don't do me any favors." Anybody who does somebody a favor ends up paying for it. Fate proves worse than blind justice in this minimalist masterpiece. No matter what our unfortunate protagonist does in this trim 71-minute, black &amp; white melodrama, he gets kicked in the teeth. Typically, film noir movies focus on men who find themselves on the wrong side of the 8-ball. Usually, a dastardly dame is on the other side and she lures them to their demise. The hero here is a destitute piano player who doesn't pack a firearm. Basically, he is an honest guy whose streak of bad luck earns him an inevitable seat in the gas chamber. Although we never witness his ultimate fate, the implication is rather obvious by the end of this taut tale. Like the standard film noir, "Detour" occurs primarily in flashback as our protagonist reflects on his disreputable past. The poverty row studio Producers Releasing Corporation made this melodrama, but the low budget doesn't constitute a liability. Instead, the austerity of everything enhances this cynical, unsavory, doom-laden subject matter. The performances all qualify as solid stuff, though none of the thespians left a cinematic legacy. Tom Neal is convincing but sympathetic as the conscientious protagonist who finds himself trapped in a web of circumstances. In real life, Neal was a scrapper. Later, he did time in prison for shooting his wife. Nevertheless, he is thoroughly credible as the ill-fated hero plagued by bad luck. Neal made some notable films, including "The Flying Tigers" with John Wayne and "The Bowery at Midnight" with Bela Lugosi. Neal's leading lady Ann Savage didn't murder anybody in real life, but she languished for most of her career in low-budget movies, most prominently "Renegade Girl" (1946). Aside from these two, the remaining nine actors and actresses made little impression. Meantime, acclaimed cult director Edgar G. Ulmer skillfully fashioned a memorable yarn on a threadbare budget, but he shared credit with Anthony Quinn's brother-in-law Martin Goldsmith. Nominated later for an Oscar for his contribution to "The Narrow Margin," Goldsmith penned this gripping narrative. Moreover, he contributed some sharp, snappy dialogue that Neal and Savage uttered with glorious irony more often than not. Their scenes in a Los Angeles apartment are unforgettable for their vitriolic repartee.Al Roberts (Tom Neal) plays piano in a seedy nightclub, while his attractive girlfriend, Sue Harvey (Claudia Drake of "Reunion in France"), warbles songs. Sue sings the song "I Can't Believe You Fell in Love with Me," and this song later haunts the forlorn protagonist. Sue wants to wed Al, but she prefers to make her fortune first before she ties the matrimonial knot. Sue surprises Al when she reveals her plans to head to Hollywood to seek fame and fortune. Ironically, when she arrives in Tinsel Town, Sue winds up slinging hash. Al perseveres around New York City, until he can no longer live without his songbird. He takes the ankle express to Hollywood, thumbing rides when he isn't wearing out shoe leather. Along the way, a motorist in a convertible, Charles Haskell Jr (Edmund MacDonald of "Destry Rides Again"), picks up Al in Arizona and agrees to drive him to their mutual destination Los Angeles. During the journey, Charles talks about his dueling scar. Al notices three scratches on Haskell's hand, and Haskell talks about an obstinate woman that he picked up and then turned loose. Al slips behind the steering wheel, while Haskell takes a nap. They are caught in a downpour with the roof down. When he tries to get Haskell out of the car, the man falls out and dies. Al suspects that nobody will believe that Haskell died in such a convenient manner. Instead of surrendering himself to the authorities, Al drags Haskell's corpse out into the desert, and he appropriates dead man's identity. The cash-strapped musician is pleased when he discovers a wad of dough. This good fortune doesn't last long because he picks up a hitchhiker, and she turns out to be Vera (Ann Savage) the same girl who scratched up Haskell. Vera threatens to turn Al over to the authorities, but she never makes good on her threat. Once they arrive in Los Angeles, they set out to sell their car. Neither Tom nor Vera utter kind words for the other. Eventually, she seizes the telephone and locks herself away in her room and threatens to call her cops. Al grabs the telephone cord and pulls on it. Little does he realize what he has done until he breaks into the bedroom and finds the cord wrapped tightly around Vera's neck. Talk about rotten luck. Al flees from the apartment complex, but the Highway Patrol nabs him. Things do not appear to be auspicious for Al."Detour" ranks as top-notch film noir. You cannot help but feel sorry for the woebegone protagonist. At the same time, Al Roberts emerges as a petulant loser, and it's easy to see why Sue would leave him behind. If you consider yourself a film noir completist, you have to have seen this gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lean, Mean Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Detour, it becomes apparent immediately that the movie was made on the cheap. The film relies on extensive rear projection work and shies away from using exteriors. All of this contributes to a certain cramped feel. This modest production is extremely effective nonetheless due to a few factors.First of all, we get a great raw-nerved, vulnerable performance from Tom Neal as our protagonist. This is complemented nicely by a vicious turn from Ann Savage as a hitchhiking femme fatale. Meanwhile, the script contributes several gems of dialogue that allow the two to really stand out. The limitations of the production actually work in the movie's favor. The cramped, constricted environment in which the characters operate becomes a pressure cooker, heightening the sense of dread as emotions boil over. On the negative side, the movie does fall victim to some clunky editing. This, along with a few other minor issues keeps me from rating this more highly.Bottom line: Worth your time for the performances of the two leads, especially if you're a film noir fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the Most Touted and Famous B-Movies Ever Made. Pure Film-Noir that is Almost Always Listed Alongside Blue-Blooded Big Studio Noirs Like Double Indemnity (1944), The Big Sleep (1946), and Out of the Past (1947). Quite an Accomplishment.Directed by Cult Fave Edgar G. Ulmer, this is a Prime Example of Primitive Art. The Fatalistic Story is One for the Ages. The Script Falls Somewhere Between Shakespeare and Chandler. Almost Every Line is Heavy Duty Pop-Psychology but is So Breathtaking in its Use of Stinging Pulp Platitudes Delivered with Slang and Over Riped Dialog-Speak from the Gutters Recited by Desperate, Cynical Folks that Have Done Some Reading. It is Virtuoso Street Poetry.Add to That, the Expressionist Cinematography Reeking of an Alternate Universe with Surreal Impressions Using Lighting and Other Cinematic Devices Like Fog and You Have the Stuff of Nightmares.Tom Neal, a Handsome and Limited Actor is Fine with His Droopy Dog-Faced Demeanor and Passable Narrative Skills. Ann Savage, On the Other Hand, Steals the Movie from Neal with an Iconic Femme-Fatale Serving Up Acid-Tongue Retorts and a Look of Evil in Her Eyes. Required Viewing for Students and Fans of Film-Noir, B-Movies, and Anyone with a Modicum of Interest in Post-War Fatalism and Desperation. One of the Greats of its Kind.Note...Beware Public Domain Prints of varying quality. It seem as though the original negative that survives is none too great and even the Print shown on TCM, that is a stickler and only uses the best available, is not pristine but a lot better than some of the quick-buck releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive for the Budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I mentioned to my brother that I had watched this film he informed me that it basically had no budget. This made a great deal of sense to me since I did not see much production value in it - this was noticeable even with it being an older film. To me Detour seems like a very rushed attempt at trying to make a noir film that works - not necessarily a great noir film, but one that fits the tenants of the genre. We start with Al Roberts as the wanderer who chooses not to be sociable; there is something troubling him, and he conveys this through, what seems to me to be, over-acting. We get a shift in chronology (a tenant of film noir which I love) and flash back to when he was a pianist and happy with a girlfriend, and this is where his journey begins. He needs to travel west to be with his beloved, but he needs to hitchhike in order to do so. Roberts meets a man named Haskell and the titular detour to where Roberts needs to go occurs on this journey. He inconveniently ends up in a situation where Haskell dies from what seems to be an accidental hit on his head as he falls out of the car. Then, because plot, Roberts happens to unknowingly stumble across Haskell's wife at a gas station, and he allows her to ride with him. As a complicated love triangle is almost formed, Haskell's wife blackmails Roberts into helping her squeeze money out of Haskell's car and inheritance by threatening to bring her husband's murder to the police. Once again, because plot, Roberts accidentally (yes it was an accident with a phone line) strangles Vera and kills her. He becomes the typical unreliable noir narrator at this point since this could have likely gone another way. All of this was rushed in just over the span of an hour. It is a noir film that has a cohesive plot, but evoked little interest from me. The ending voice-over about his acceptance of getting picked up one day over the image of him actually getting picked up by authorities was intriguing, but not the sort of ending which would rank this film among the likes of Sunset Boulevard or Double Indemnity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another film noir that I really don't want to see again. It's kind of like "Mildred Pierce", but it has a different setup. The worst thing that I found is that the Hollywood Production Code censored parts of the movie. They had to do a scene where Al gets captured after Vera dies from a telephone wire. However, there are many good parts that this film has, like the hitchhiking and the details of the narrative of the film. Even though it is dark, it does maintain a cult following when it was remade in 1992. I don't think I would want to watch that either. What is best about it is when the actors did their characters like they were supposed to. It reminds me of some of the other films that had good acting and writing. I find it a good movie, but it's not enough to earn my approval for a later time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tiny perfect film-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film-Noir is more about style, a mood, the rules are fuzzy but you know it when you see it and this film is it. It does have one of my favourite film-noir devices: the doomed protagonist who lives in the gutter with everyone else, is trying to do the right thing or is a supposed victim of circumstance, tries to raise above the gutter, do right thing but never makes it. In retrospect I fell for the nice guy, the victim of circumstance shtick that the main character Al Roberts tries to sell, its possible he is deluded,insane yet for a film from this era I would have expected that if he was insane it to be more obvious, the plot and acting are ham handed in many respects, I would not have expected subtlety with insanity . The feeling that Al is deluded undoubtedly comes from the need to move the plot along as fast as possible, I am sure the failed marriage proposal was due to Al loving her and she not so much but why waste time on why she doesn't love him, besides its role was to provide the plot device for Als trip. Does Sue really want Al to come to LA or is she patronizing him ? who cares ? we don't get an answer from Sue he is coming one way or another the plot demands it. Was Al really trapped in a no win situation when Haskell dies ? He could have driven Haskell to the cops or the hospital, the cause of death would have come out even with the bump on Haskells head, is Haskell actually dead ? is this the way it actually went down or is it Als deluded version? if not deluded then he is incapable of doing the right thing. The movie races along until its inevitable conclusion, things are not going to end well for Al and we know it, we are wondering could things get worse (yes, it gets much worse)we certainly cant look away.</fullReview>

The film is done in flashback style so we hear the main character tell us what is going on...to me this is rather a cheat...it is much easier to write a screenplay this way. The narration drones on, the main character whines a lot, and all becomes annoying. But, fortunately, it's only about an hour or so long.Overall, the film is somewhat interesting (minus the narration), however, after watching the whole film, I found the resolution to be completely unsatisfying...very much like the resolutions that art film directors like to impose upon audiences today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a plot. Detour is classic noir, dark foreboding, a male character plagued by a femme fatale, death, pure misfortune, and loose morals. Detour pretty quickly convinced me never to pick up a hitchhiker ever again. This film was depressingly dark, I have never seen a single character so plagued with misfortune. Part of it may be the acting, and the way Neal plays Al, always a downer right to the end. The ending of this film was great. In many ways it was well deserved for Vera, but it makes you wonder if Al did it on purpose. The only other thing I would say is the movie is oddly short, running only a little over an hour.

		<fullReview>"Detour" (1945) is a film noir directed by Edgar G Ulmer. "Detour" was filmed and released by a 'poverty row' studio ? Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) ? one of the small studios in Hollywood known for the development of 'B-movie' classics. Shot in less than two weeks, "Detour" stars Tom Neal as Al, as a piano player in a New Yorknightclub. Al is dating Sue (Claudia Drake), a singer who decides to move to Hollywood. Al tries to convince Sue to stay in New York, and pledges his love for her, but Sue is not dissuaded and leaves. Al becomes despondent and decides to hitchhike across the US to join Sue in Hollywood. The traveling is slow and uneventful until Al gets a ride in Arizona, where he meets Charles Haskell (Edmund MacDonald). Charles tells Al he is wealthy but during the drive, Charles dies, and Al becomes obsessed with the concern that the police will think he did it. Al dumps the body, takes the car, and picks up a new hitchhiker ? Vera (Ann Savage). Vera cons Al and coaxes him to assume Charles identify for a big payoff. Al's life changes forever with this femme fatale!While limited to just 68 minute run time, Detour is captivating movie. Vera and Al are incredibly acerbic, sarcastic characters. The dialog is often trite and vexing, the sets are minimal, and even the editing and props are low budget (one scene has US car with steering on the right-hand side). But with all these faults, the "Detour" is hard film to forget.</fullReview>

Unfortunately meeting up with the old guys problem, the women who left the scratches, and having her blackmail him. There are so many great twist in this movie that really capture the viewers attention.

		<fullReview>Detour in another one of those movies that I didn't expect much from, but it really surprised me. Usually with b-movies from the 1940s, they're really not that good. The sound is usually bad, the picture is kind of faded, and the story usually sucks; but Detour is a very well done movie, and shouldn't be overlooked. The movie has a great story (and I won't spoil it), and the actors do a great job, but the movie does have flaws. For one, it's very short. I actually wished it were longer because I was enjoying it so much (that's not really a flaw). Also, it is very low budget, so the sound and picture is far from perfect. Another thing is the narration. In the movie, the main character is narrating in his head. I actually find that very odd. I mean, in Double Indemnity, the main character narrates while confessing what he did, and in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the man is telling his story to the police. In this movie, he's kind of just talking to himself, but he talks as if he is talking to someone. Now what about the movies strengths? For one, the main character is very likable. It's cool seeing what he's like in the start of the movie, and how the events that happen change him through the course of the movie. Second, I like the personality given to the female lead. Usually the leading ladies in this genre are smooth, sexy, and mysterious; in this movie, she's just an awful person. She isn't very beautiful, she's very bitter, and you just want her to get what's coming to her. It's funny, with a few changes to the script, this movie could've been a romantic comedy road trip movie. I also very much enjoy the story, how one little mistake can spiral out of control and turn into such a mess. Detour is a very good movie. It may be short, it may be low budget, and it may be flawed, but for a 1940s b movie, it's very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's haunting qualities will stay with you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently shot in six days with a budget of $20,000 (other sources claim it was up to $100,000 however), Detour was a quickie noir from director Edgar G. Ulmer made for one of Hollywood's 'poverty row' production companies. It came and went, and seemed destined for B-movie obscurity. Yet the work of director Ulmer and star Ann Savage (here playing femme fatale Vera) were re-evaluated during the 1980's and up to the modern day, and Detour has become one of the key film noirs, and I remember studying it at University amongst others. Although this isn't the greatest film noir by a long shot, it certainly one of the purest, and one that captures the tragic desperation and twisted morals of the genre's themes most convincingly.Miserable piano player Al (Tom Neal) works for a shady nightclub with his club-singer girlfriend Sue (Claudia Drake). She packs up a leaves for the glamour of Hollywood, and soon after Al decides to join her, but has to hitch his way cross the country. He is picked up by bookie Charles Haskell Jr. (Edmund MacDonald) and the two seem to hit it off. As the rain comes down, Al pulls over to put the top up while Haskell sleeps, but when Al opens the passenger door, Haskell falls out and hits his head, killing him. Terrified the police will suspect murder, Al buries the body and flees, assuming Haskell's clothes, car, money, and identity. He picks up a hitcher named Vera (Savage) who has an acid tongue and a bad attitude, who turns out to be Haskell's previous passenger, and she smells foul play.Nothing about this film is particularly engaging visually - it has standard camera-work and lighting - and Tom Neal is a rather plain leading man, but it's the tension, and the sheer bleakness of the proceedings that engages. The roads of America are long and winding enough to corrupt your soul, it seems, but when Al thinks he may just have gotten away with it, along comes Vera to squeeze the situation for all the dough she can. Savage's performance is full of sneering, angry swagger, and although it's a slightly one-trick performance, she is certainly memorable, both sexy and dangerous enough to chew up and spit out the majority of other femme fatales. This should be a forgettable film, and one that would usually be gathering dust in an archive somewhere, but its haunting qualities will stay with you. Certainly one of the greatest B-movies ever made, and a must-see for film noir purists.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Going My Way?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is not a quote from this movie, but a reference to a classic "Twilight Zone" where the hitchhiker is just as deadly as Ann Savage's Vera. Like Barbara Stanwyck in "Double Indemnity" and Jane Greer in "Out of the Past", Savage represents what makes film noir femme fatales so riveting to watch. They are evil personified, using sex to get what they want, and what they want usually results in murder. Tom Neal is a down on his luck piano player whose girlfriend (Claudia Drake) moves from New York to Los Angeles. Desperately lonely (but broke) without her, he decides to hitchhike cross country and manages to make it to Arizona without incident. But it is there that his luck changes, and he'll wish he had scraped the money together for a greyhound. An accidental death results in him encountering the evil Savage who proceeds to hold him hostage then plan a scheme so vile that there is only one way out, and for this, there is no detour.For a character who exists only on screen for less than half an hour (of the movie's 69 minute running time), Savage is unforgettable. The moment she bolts upright from a nap in the car Neal is driving and begins to accuse him of unsavory acts, you know you're not dealing with a cookie filled with chocolate chips. This cookie is nuts. She is an amoral 20-something with attitude, a quality (or lack of) that many films neglected to give their characters. In short, she's real, but this is realism a poor sap like Neal can go without. Neal's crime is simply being in all the wrong places at the wrong time, and because of that, he is psychologically drawn and quartered.A masterpiece of film noir, "Detour" is the most famous film to come out of poverty row studio PRC. It is a nail-bitter you won't be able to resist, I think closely matched with the later "Gun Crazy" for its whacked-out realities. While there certainly are better made film noir(s), this one strikes a cord, and many of its elements have been either utilized or ripped off for similar films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although a moderately priced production, this is a strong, well-crafted movie which features powerful acting, especially by Tom Neal and Ann Savage. There are several great scenes between the two of them around which the entire story revolves. As soon as Ms. Savage enters the movie, the action is nonstop; she takes over. One doesn't know what she will do next. This is a classic film-noir. The story is well-defined and strong and contains a lot of snappy dialogue. Moreover, the story quickly engages the audience's interest as the main protagonist explains his plight. There is definite chemistry between Ms. Savage and Mr. Neal as their characters struggle to establish an understanding and connect with each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go Along For The Car Ride. Cinematic Film Noir At It's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i was pleasantly surprised by Edgar G. Ulmer's 'Detour', i thought i'd seen enough classics and films like this to be jaded enough, but this film caught me off guard and broke down my immunities. it really felt gripping and the plot developments truly unexpected and fiendishly clever.it's basically about a hitchhiker who get's the car trip of his life. the viewer also is subjected to a trippy trip as well. dark, intense, but often screamingly hilarious, 'Detour' still manages to typify cinema unconventionality. interesting too because of the fact that it doesn't offer anything too original or necessarily break any established rules in filmmaking and cinema narrative.'Detour' is anything but original. even the acting is strangely kind of hammy and overly melodramatic, and many of the wisecracks and vernaculars used seem to wax clichés that were pretty typical for that time period. but this oddly works to it's advantage because the film comes off as in your face and wildly over the top.i'm not familiar with Ann Savage or Tom Neal, but they are both sort of unforgettable here. especially Savage. it is Savage in particular that gives her performance a sort of melodramatic caricature that is so over done, at times you don't know what to think, but ultimately i was left kind of breathless by it.E.G.Ulmer's 'Detour' is a weird film. it's plot turns and developments are nothing short of hysterically funny. it's also a very disturbing movie with a rather harsh and unforgiving conclusion and philosophy. i mean really. what a thing to say. and what a scary statement on life. no thanks.that really is the only real problem with 'Detour'. it's harsh, unforgiving nature and message of doom. i suggest in the long road in life, that most viewers do not take this car trip too seriously. you don't wanna scare yourself and in truth, life often can hold more promise than this. however, eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow they may come and take you away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shot for chump change by the Poverty Row PRC company, Detour with its incredible performances has become a deserved cult item. It blew me away the first time I ever saw it and still does.Tom Neal spent the rest of his life cursing the day he decided not to wait until he had the price of a train ticket from East Coast to West Coast. Or even more important that he didn't do the right thing and just report the death of Edmund McDonald to the authorities, the guy who gave him a lift on a dark rainy night. We're more forensics conscious these days due to shows like CSI and Law And Order. Forensics would have shown McDonald just simply died of a heart attack, stroke, whatever. Important though that it wasn't a homicide.In his flashback narration for the audience Neal goes through all his justification for assuming McDonald's identity, taking his cash, belongings and clothes and car and leaving the dead guy on the side of road under some brush. But as luck would have it, he runs into one drop dead gorgeous woman also looking for a lift. The hormones take over and ruin him because Ann Savage happened to know McDonald and knows Neal ain't him.After that Savage inflicts herself into Neal's life and the film is one acid portrayal of these two people who are now joined at the hip and hating every minute of it. If Detour had been done at a major studio we might have been talking Oscars for Neal and Savage. As it was this minor PRC film didn't guarantee big star careers for either of them.Detour, don't make a wrong choice and detour away from seeing this minor classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cult Noir Small Masterpiece Finally Getting Deserved Recognition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detour is in hindsight quintessential in the history of film noir?But, everything is stacked against it so why is it so elementally singular within the genre? The film studio, PRC, was a real poverty row case never having the luxury of any respectable budgeting. The director, Edgar G. Ulmer, was a kind of "outsider" who was blacklisted by the real Hollywood and had to make a sort of Machiavellian arrangement with PRC so he could work at all. Somehow these obstacles were overcome with the 1945 production "Detour". Starting with a bare production by necessity "Detour" uses stark simplicity in story telling working wonders in its favor. It begins as a "raw-nerve" hard scrabbled protagonist, sitting in a non-decrypt all-night diner, tells his "hard sack" story in a narrated past tense. Al Neal, the protagonist, is on the cusp of either violence or a breakdown as a song on the juke box triggers everything he's running away from. Darkness ensues and doesn't let up. One of the keys here is certainly director Edgar G. Ulmer's casting of Tom Neal as main character Al Roberts. Neal, a real-life enigma who despite a promising Broadway debut, and even a Harvard law degree, was a kind of non-starter in Hollywood: pigeonholed as a generic unlikeable "tough guy" with no prospects of breaking the mold he surely had real life angst upon which to draw. This is considered by many as his one, singularly "breakout" performance. His availability for a pittance was likely, as much as Ulmer's intuition, a kind of serendipity for all involved. The PRK studio couldn't afford the luxury of choice so we have Neal. However, Neal is more than excellent as a truly talented, yet darkly tainted piano player who the viewer can easily believe would as likely shoot himself in the foot as to persevere. The casting is absolutely perfect as Neal seems absolutely natural as a dark soul who is destined for misery. As already stated the story, largely dictated by the lack of a budget, is simple: Lost soul follows love interest only to become a victim of his own devices. Al Roberts, a very talented but eternally broke and pessimistic, piano player decides to hitchhike to L.A. so he can reunite and marry his paramour who is trying to make it in Hollywood. In route he gets a lift from a stranger whose chance meeting begins to unfold a series of events in which Roberts is transformed from law-abiding and broke to a flush with the possibility of a death sentence. He manages all of this on his own, but things get worse when he returns the favor for a fellow hitcher, a mysterious young woman. The female hitch hiker, almost unbelievably is aware of what he has already done and uses it to manipulate him for her own sinister purposes. Ann Savage steals the show with what may be the best portrayal of a femme fatale in celluloid history. Her characterization of "Vera" is, as Neal's performance, like watching real people instead of actors, truly excellent. "Detour" is only just over a hour in run-time. It is stark and simple telling a horrific story and succeeds admirably. A must for all fans of film noir with its only fault being an ending that feels a bit rushed. The fact that Neal's ultimate fate isn't quite revealed makes the ending work however. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They don't make 'em like this anymore. With a B-Movie budget, average acting, and a running time of only one hour and seven minutes, Detour is one of the best Film Noir's I have seen.The plot is every hitchhiker's nightmare. When you hitch a ride with a stranger and he dies in the car. What's to prevent the cops form suspecting you of murder? Tom Neal plays the hitchhiker, he's just trying to get to his girl. But when disaster strikes, what does he do? Assume the dead man's identity of course. No, he's no Mr. Ripley, but he knows that his story won't stick with the cops. It gets even worse when he picks up a girl, played by Ann Savage, that actually knew the dead man he was impersonating.This is Film Noir in it's simplest state, and it's beautiful to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely taut and stylish Film-Noir that has shamefully been left to rot in cinematic limbo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That's life. Whichever way you turn, Fate sticks out a foot to trip you." - It certainly seems that way for Al Roberts in this grim and taut film noir which tells the tale of a dissatisfied New York bar-room piano player destined for bigger things whose vague plans of marrying his girlfriend are ruined when she decides that she wants to move to Hollywood to pursue her dream of becoming an actress. Al later decides to head to Hollywood to be with her when he can't bear to play piano in that bar room any longer without her soothing presence. He sets out to hitchhike the entire way, with very little luck. By the time he reaches Arizona, he is filthy and penniless, and this is where he gets picked up by Charles Haskell Jr, a pill-popping shady character who engages in conversation with Al and tells him that he will take him all the way to LA. Al notices scratches on his hand and wrist, which Haskell reveals were from dealing with "the most dangerous animal of all: a woman". Inexplicably, Haskell dies in his sleep while Al takes over the wheel. When Al opens the door, Haskell falls out and bashes his head off a rock. Now it looks extremely bad, so instead of reporting it to the police, Al takes Haskell's identity, his clothes and his car, and sets about completing his journey and then abandoning the car. But then he picks up a woman at a gas station, who knew Haskell from a previous journey, and she blackmails Al into keeping up the impersonation or else she will go to the police. Needless to say, things get worse...While the actions of the protagonist are extremely questionable in the logic behind what he does (If your trying to keep a low profile why would you even CONSIDER picking a hitch hiker up??), "Detour" is still a tremendous film with some fine acting, racy and blunt dialogue and a fast-paced story that twists at every turn. Once said to have been filmed in just six days (Evidence has since come out that has questioned these claims) and filmed on an extremely low-budget, "Detour" just goes to prove that a brilliant and tense film can be made on such a low-budget. Directed by German director Edgar G. Ulmer, who had before this enjoyed success in Hollywood with "The Black Cat", for the infamous Poverty Row studio. Due to the very low-budget, the film had to rely on the director's efficiency and skill to make what ended up being a masterpiece in film noir. All the elements of the infamous and controversial film noir are here; the femme fatal played by Ann Savage in a performance which German filmmaker Wim Wenders called '30 years ahead of it's time', the grim and paranoid atmosphere and the overwhelming sense of despair as Al's situation on the road seems to be getting worse and worse at every turn. Tom Neal, whose career would be ruined after he ended up in prison for murdering his wife, gives a superb performance here as Al; a fast-talking and blunt man who just finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. He's backed by an matching performance from Ann Savage, whose performance was indeed ahead of it's time.The narration is mesmerizing and really draws you in, here's an example of it here: "As I drove off, it was still raining and the drops streaked down the windshield like tears." Neal delivers the narration with such passion and belief that it really touches us and contributes to the haunting atmosphere. "Detour" has never been given a DVD release, due to the copyright expiring on the film leaving it to rot in the public domain, a form of limbo where the films reside with no foreseeable DVD release. "Detour" is available on line though, and shouldn't be hard to find. It's a superb film with a runtime just over an hour long I highly recommend everyone checks it out. Often hailed as the best Film-Noir, it goes without saying that it deserves a proper DVD release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie obviously was a very cheap movie to make. It was made by a small studio that made mostly small-budget B-movies and it's starring a bunch of unknown actors. The low budget can definitely be seem back in the movie. Visually and technically it's all quite cheap looking. The entire movie got shot in six days and mostly at just two locations. In other words, this movie has everything in it to NOT be a great movie. Yet the movie is still a very maintaining film-noir, that features all of the right ingredients and on top of it has a great, simple yet effective, story.The movie begins simple but of course the plot starts to thicken fast when the main character gets into more and more trouble, following a small 'innocent' incident. he starts to make wrong decisions. It's a typical film-noir that has basically all of the right required ingredients in it. One of those ingredients, that the movie is really lucky with, is its femme fatale, played by Ann Savage.The movie really takes off the moment Ann Savage steps onto the screen. She really is great in her role, which can't always be said about any of the other actors within the movie. Not like that is really the actor's fault though, since like mentioned before this movie got shot in only six days time, so circumstances must have been far from ideal for them.The movie is quite short with its 67 minutes of running time but it still manages to tell a entire story, with character build up, twists and basically everything else you could expect from a genre movie made during the '40's. It's also a movie that gets basically better by the minute.An unexpected and unlikely good movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Minor Masterpiece of Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An altogether different, but even more potent (indeed uniquely vicious) evildoer was introduced into movies by Ann Savage in the 1945 classic, Detour. It is Tom Neal's bad luck to fall into her clutches halfway through a gripping but up-to-that-moment not unusual, "B" budget melo. But once Savage comes on, the whole mood of the film changes from the moderately suspenseful to the inescapably dramatic. True this riveting change is affected by a somewhat far-fetched but not improbable coincidence, but such is the power of Savage's presence and delivery (plus the driving pace of Edgar G. Ulmer's direction, plus the searing dialogue provided by writer Martin Goldsmith) that any lessening of tension is quickly assuaged by the sudden boost to the noirish intensity of the hero's dilemma. Erdody's ingenious music variations also add to the film's mesh of entrapment. The doomed hero suspensefully struggles to free himself from a fate that is only partly of his own making, but all his efforts and even his good deeds only succeed in binding him tighter and tighter to an inescapable horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of Film Noir, this rates as one of my favorites. The writing is full of that corny but wonderfully appropriate dialog that all noir greats feature. The picture is dim and soft and sometimes too dark to see anything, but I'd have been proud to have gone down in film history with "Detour" as my one and only directing credit. "The Third Man" is classified as a Film Noir and it's fantastic, but it was a high budget production with big time stars and an A-List director in Carol Reed. Edgar G. Ulmer isn't as well known, but who cares? He took what little was given him and made the most of it. "The Third Man" is a great noir but I truly favor low budget noir's like "Detour" The bigger the budget, the smoother and slicker the production. Yes there's lots of rear projection and lots of scenes filmed in a hotel room, but so what? And what if they did have the budget to actually drive around for real? For me, the fact that the whole film looks like a TV kine scope before kine scopes even existed adds to the atmosphere. And I also love the casting. Ann Savage is perfect as the shrew who's attractive, but who also has that worn, aged, definitely younger than she looks look that her character needs to be believable in the part. Tom Neal is no great actor, but he's perfectly cast in his part as a guy who's aways in the wrong place at the wrong time. And please do read his biography. This turns out to be one heck of a case of 'pre' type casting. If you love film noir, are reading this and have never seen it, for god's sake see it! If your reading this because you just want to share your love of the movie with other fans, thanks for joining the club. Not my favorite Film Noir, but definitely one of the best ever made. I love it so much, I just had to take the time to write this review. Please drop me a line to share your thoughts if you wish. There's nothing better than fans of any given film discussing their love of it. It's the next best thing to inviting everyone over for a screening!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now considered by many film historians as a classic and one of the real, first film noir films, Detour does indeed have much going for it. It has a gritty sense of style and realism to it that is greatly enhanced by its low budget. I believe the entire film cost something like 30,000 to make. The direction is first-rate by one of the sometime forgotten masters of direction, certainly a giant of the B picture world, Edgar G. Ulmer. Ulmer paces the film well and creates taut suspense. The film runs only 67 minutes which is all the more a credit to the director and screenwriter Martin Goldsmith. The principal acting leads are more than credible and very memorable. Tom Neal plays a man hitchhiking his way to the woman he loves from New York to California only to be picked up by a man that dies while Neal is driving. From there on - more than halfway through the film - things fall apart quickly for Neal when he picks up a female hitchhiker that had been alluded to earlier. Neal opens his saga in a coffee joint at the beginning of the film and narrates throughout much like any other film noir classic(Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, etc...). Ann Savage plays one of the screen's truly most annoying, hideous women as Vera the hitchhiker. Ulmer brings a quick resolution to the film but the climatic moment at film's end is not to be missed. While gritty, the film does look pretty cheap at some scenes, there are not very many actors(good or bad - you be the judge?), and the ending - though inventive is abrupt. Detour, nonetheless, is a milestone in film for its contributions to film noir and as a reminder of how good Ulmer really was, but it, even more importantly, shows us today in our world of big budget films what a group of talented people can do with so very little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic low budget film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detour may be a modest and low budget film noir; but it's also one of the best! Budget restraints have meant that director Edgar G. Ulmer's most famous noir picture tells most of it's story in just a few locations, and the tale is very small in scope - but this is made up for by a great plot line and interesting characters. The film uses the plotting method of having a voice-over accompanying most scenes. This can be a sign of a bad scriptwriter, but here it works out brilliantly. Along with the dark atmosphere and unlucky lead character, the voice-over combines to make sure that Detour benefits from the classic gritty film noir atmosphere. The title, 'Detour', is very apt as that's what this film is. Detour is a story of luck that centres on a man named Al Roberts. While trying to hitch a lift to Hollywood to see his girl, his luck goes from bad to good to worse, as the man who is giving him a lift ends up dying on the way. Concerned that the police wouldn't believe that death was natural, our hero decides to steal his companion's identity. His luck then takes yet another downturn when he picks up the decidedly nasty Vera.This film is great because the plot is so open ended and never grinds down to predictability. The story is almost completely based on luck, and paranoia is built into this plot by way of the fact that not many of the events that befall the lead character are his fault. This also allows the audience to be drawn in to the film, as it's fascinating to see what kind of luck will befall the unlucky lead man next. Edgar G. Ulmer is best known in my eyes for the horror classic "The Black Cat", and this film isn't a world away from the Lugosi/Karloff classic, despite being a different genre. Both films are dark and mysterious and the director clearly has an eye for the macabre. Considering that the acting talent is B-class; it's actually rather good. Tom Neal is blank-faced in the lead role, but he's actually quite believable as he always comes across as being rather neutral. Ann Savage stands out the most, in the real starring role of the film. As Vera, Savage continually shocks and disgusts the viewer with her hard outlook on the main character, while always hinting at something more inside. On the whole, Detour is a classic noir despite it's budget restrictions, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Low-Budget Noir; Fine Directing Job By Edgar G. Ulmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good low-budget film-noir, and much of the credit goes to director Edgar G. Ulmer for getting so much out of the limited resources. The story is interesting and the cast solid, but Ulmer's story-telling makes the combination work better than it could have on its own.Tom Neal plays a somewhat aimless pianist who, while hitch-hiking across the country, runs into some unexpected problems, including a strong-willed, malevolent female hitch-hiker played with spirit by Ann Savage. The two main characters are never very complex, but they don't need to be, since the story contains plenty of tension and suspense. Neal and Savage both deliver just what the roles call for, and the supporting cast members are also solid.The story is told with some skill and resourcefulness, pulling you in at the beginning with some unanswered questions, and then building things up at a steady pace. The scenario contains a couple of highly unlikely developments, but Ulmer handles these well, foreshadowing them just enough so that they seem almost to be expected, rather than forced. That's just one example of the way that "Detour" is able to get the most out of its material.The result is an enjoyable little crime thriller that has retained a rather impressive audience over the years, for such a low-budget production. It's an unusual example of a movie that delivers well without any frills at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine the luck of seeing Detour on a double bill with (my introduction to) Citizen Kane. That was my good fortune in 1977 and I saw them both for a buck! Movie night on campus .. .. them were the days. There are movies that stay with you and movies that don't. Then, there are movies that change your life. I always thought there was more to it than an under-bill for "the best movie of all time" and as I learned to appreciate film noir, it becomes like any art. I don't know what it is but I know what I like. I understand that in 1992 the Library of Congress recognized Detour as the definitive noir movie of the 40s and in the same year a shot for shot remake of the classic was made starring Tom Neal Jr. I admit I haven't seen the remake and not sure I have any interest in doing so. My life can only take so much change. p.s. I've always wanted a car like Haskell's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was not a dark and stormy night. My wife and I had searched NETFLIX for anything worthwhile(streaming).We came across "Detour", listed as a film noir classic...oy! And yet, truly, unintentionally hilarious. This is less a review than a list of absurdities and blunders; a film tailor-made for Mystery Science Theater.Our hero, a poor man's Alan Ladd,is an embittered, unsuccessful cafe pianist--more of a key duster than a musician, whose girlfriend decides to take off for Hollywood, though it's obvious that she is 15 years past her starlet stage.Neal takes off hitchhiking to Hollywood, with no money and a ratty suitcase. In a montage of pickups we realize that the film has been flipped, as he keeps climbing in the driver's side. At one point, he seems to be going back east, but there was no money for a re-shoot.My doctor has warned me not to attempt to reprise the plot, but I must single out two highlights.His "ride" mysteriously dies, and Neal assumes his identity. Wanting to know more personal details in order to pull off the identity theft, he searches the dead man's luggage, finding a letter that had been mailed to the dead man's father! How did he do that?!!A tough dame has blackmailed him into a state of absurd captivity. When they stop at a motel, she locks him "in" the room they share, with a key that seals them both magically into the room, ditto the window--they're on the ground floor.The dialogue is a strange mixture of tough snarls and classical literary references. If you need an emotional pick-me-up, and a Dadaist cinema experience, grab this film! You'll laugh! You'll cry! You'll hate yourself for throwing away an hour+ of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definitive B-movie, and that ain't necessarily good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't as blown away by this classic film noir as the hype from friends and other cineastes had me geared up to be. It is definitively a B-movie: the skill level all around, from the acting to the camera work, is strictly bush league. The voice-over narration seems directed only at the visually impaired, since mostly everything it tells us is played out on the screen. Even the script, though it livens up in its second act, in the end is fairly boilerplate. And yet, that second act! I can't deny that it's really compelling. Tom Neal and Ann Savage play a couple of drifters at lethal cross-purposes. As actors, Neal struggles to attain believability and Ann Savage overacts so fiercely she leaves believability in the dust. She couldn't be bothered with it. I'll offer no spoilers, because what appeal the film does have is dependent on knowing nothing about what happens, but given the choice, I'd watch Double Indemnity for a fifth time instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Confused or laughing yet? I was as I attempted to watch the first "official" Hollywood film noir thriller, Detour. Filmed in 1945, this film took some heavy risks that the normal Hollywood production at this time was not willing to take. Detour dabbled in heavy themes, dark context, and highly developed characters, yet seemingly lacked in production and acting. While watching Detour, it became obvious that these missing elements turned this film sour.The production of this film consisted of three scenes: a hotel room, the restaurant, and finally (the majority) scenes of a car with a screen behind it. It was obvious that there was no budget. Due to these budget restraints, the overall elements of this film were completely clouded in spotty backgrounds and amateurish acting. This was a case in which more money would have helped create a stronger film. Normally, this is not my feeling, but for some odd reason, Detour brought this thought come out in me.Finally, perhaps it was the era that this film was made, or maybe it was something else, but I felt as if both the director and the editor could have been heavily intoxicated while filming Detour. The scenes are so jumbled together and are so horribly spliced that you can tell when the actors have made a mistake or when the director had to cut and start again. Perhaps this would not have been the case if the director had a better grasp of what he wanted to do and how to do it. The plot, due to the direction, seemed implausible at best. I had trouble coming to terms with the fact that an educated man would run from the law (and steal from a man) when he did nothing to cause his death. Any man of the law would listen to his story, look at the evidence, and see that Al is innocent.When Al runs from the law near the beginning of the film, it made me consider a point that was never developed in Detour. Was Al crazy? When he hides the body, thinking that he killed Haskell, we begin to see a side of Al that was not obvious in the first fifteen minutes of this film. Something, from before this film began, changed Al. What was this changing event? The world may never know, but it would have been helpful seeing at least a few scenes of Al's past to help develop his character a bit more. This was the same with Vera. I didn't know enough about her to really get a grip on her character. I needed more between her and Haskell before her meeting with Al.While Hollywood has expanded and obviously grown this genre over the years, it was interesting to see its beginnings. Unfortunately, due to poor production and overacting, this was not the best film to begin the genre. Detour is a "starter" film. It reminds me of buying a house, it isn't the house of your dreams (or in this case film), but it does allow you to begin building towards your next dream.Grade: * out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The assumptions of the noir,its premises and viewpoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A world of very schematic and for the most part phony psychologies, wholly confined to the most primitive and rudimentary forms of urban life, reached, somehow, a kind of primitive classicism that was merely a schematic-ism. Its qualities of style and atmosphere, though much praised by some, can not hide the conspicuous absence of any distinguished content ?.Are there any truths about life, heart,man,reality concealed in these schematic stories?It all reduces to a fatalistic and insolent pose, whose axioms amount to some utter banalities of a bleak cheap fatalism. The characters are UN-Relatable to (a difference with Hitchcock's characters ?).A few of these show (too) vague indications of another shore. (Welles' extravaganzas merit a separate discussion.)But was there ever anything else?A valid insight?Some mature poetry?Were such flicks ever used as vehicles of another, and deeper, significant, articulated understanding of the life and of the people?Their whole schematic primitive world, of viscid and violent under-creatures, is but a bluff, a phony thing, a poor world of abusive simplifications ?. They did not serve to explore anything?or, at least, like in Hitchcock's films, to magnify, to amplify ?.What about the mere excitement and trepidation of some of them? This is the positive side. Herein lies their merit and interest. They also had a relative value?as antidotes to a tendency towards idylls idealizations in melodramas. An inferior, monotonous, embittered humanity, nurtured by poverty, disappointment, lies, violence, evil, dirt, lust, etc.. A schematic naturalism improvised with very humble intellectual and artistic means; an angry, cynical, grim, brutal, inferior, plebeian, overly schematic, offbeat, cold, sardonic but semi?serious or quasi?serious view of humans and society. A crass ignorance of all the big subjects and themes and of any humanness.Style?Style is raised by that which it serves. By lack of content, this class or historical genre of flicks remained underdeveloped. Their strong moments, when they are, like in those several scenes towards the end of DETOUR, appeal again exclusively to the most primitive and simple receptacles of our soul. That it is why the emotion felt, whether in itself intense, is nonetheless mediocre and phony. When they generate an experience, whether they do, and maybe this does not happen so seldom, that experience is,again, poor and narrow, primitive, fake, of low quality. I suspect that is rather the cheap philosophy, and not the considerations of style, art and approach, that impress much most of this current's followers and buffs. It is fatalism over adventure and style. (Not to mention mystery,etc..) No police drama merits; no style; no content; no _relatable characters; in exchange, tones of fatalism and some true and respectable formal deftness, a very schematic syntax, a standardized format ,an ugly, bleak, simplistic view of human nature and society. Some axioms?lonely innocent men are doomed; women are cunning bitches; poverty makes one crazy; loneliness is usually replaced by even worse companies; many people that are close to somebody uninterruptedly cheat him; life on the run, in sordid motels, can be taken at even lower levels. As a genre, and some of its best exponents, these are the axioms and parameters of the noir. In all these, the noir lacks insight and a real take on the life and people. Eminently urban genre, it is a priori confined to these limits and deficits. On the other hand, it made the lowest budgets, a virtue; it brought dignity and even some creativity on the poverty row. It transformed the small budgets into an occasion of ability. Its fatalism was intended to impress the feeble minds and adolescent sensibilities, that are won over by fatalism and clichés.Ugly and cheap philosophy, that reached its pinnacle in that hideous monstrosity called SIN CITY,where this monotony and paucity of content was taken to its last limits.A weird, sordid, wild,nihilist but diluted and schematic Zolism Sui _generis, nourished obviously by the pulp?trend lanced by a few '30s writers, the noir leaves but a taste of ashes ?.Bizarre silhouettes wander in a godless, soulless, empty world. This is the premise of the noir trend; popular nihilism, of the worst kind. It is not about mystery, suspense, enigmas, but about this nihilistic depiction of an Expressionistic, schematic, _de-_spiritualized ,emptied, fallen, chaotic and arbitrary ,distorted, ill and abusive, absurd, envenomed, ugly world (though:in Europe, in literature and in another era, some 20 yrs. earlier, Expressionism was originally taken to search for a _spiritualization of the world ?). This is the premise, the prerequisite; the whole noir universe depends upon it. It is a direct expression of a sleazy, cynical, ostentatious nihilism and atheism.The charge against the noir is double:--one refers to the viewpoint;--the other points towards the phony, laughable ,low ,simplistic form of the nihilism professed. The offense is double:--the noir offers but nihilism;--and it offers a phony, sleazy, low?brow one. It is not only nihilism per _se; but a melodramatic, simplistic, empty, clichéd form of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PCR Pictures Inc presents...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detour is the first poverty row film chosen for conservation by the Library of Congress. The cast is largely unknown and the studio PRC Pictures specialised in extremely low budget movies. Detour, their biggest success was shot in 6 days by cult director Edgar Ulmer.The star of the picture, Tom Neal was a Harvard Law Graduate in real life. He was known for his difficult temperament which limited the roles he was offered by the major studios. In 1951 he beat up Franchot Tone over a girl giving him a broken nose and cheekbone. In 1965 he was hauled up for the murder of his wife and eventually found guilty of "involuntary manslaughter". Charming leadman huhn? The femme fatale, played by Ann Savage is supposed to be 24 in the movie. She looks much older but really was 24 when Detour was made. She made a total of 5 films with Neal - who regularly used to hit on her.The lighting in the film is superb and it is quite taut at only 67 minutes. All the successful noir films from that period were being made by the big studios and involved talents like Billy Wilder, John Huston, Jacques Tourneur etc. This film contributed greatly to the genre with its success because it was a good entry to the genre with a Grade B budget. This encouraged a whole spate of other low-budget noirs although none of them were as good. Edmund MacDonald gives a fairly good performance. The only disappointing thing was the ending. The censor board wanted the criminal to be brought to justice instead of getting away with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few movies are more dark and more bleak than Detour. Tom Neal plays a hitchhiker who thumbs a ride with a businessman who complains about this last passenger, a wild woman who scratched him. After the driver mysteriously dies, Neal panics, throws the body into the desert and drives off. But in the world of film noir, you can never escape from your actions. In this case, he picks up a hitchhiker, a nasty-tempered red head (Ann Savage), who instantly recognizes the car. Filmed on a minuscule budget by the great B-movie director Edgar G. Ulmer, Detour is a bleak and claustrophobic thriller that plays out as a cynical, minimalist drama with touches of existentialist angst.Edward Elmer's finest performance as an actor. I wish there were more like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story could be apocryphal, but in school I heard that the reason this film is only 67 minutes is that they ran out of money before they even finished principal photography. So it was edited until they could come up with a workable movie. This certainly explains the short running time, but I believe explains why this is such a great film. It is very concise. It is highly pessimistic/fatalistic. I don't know enough to know if the film ends the way it was envisioned. Maybe the original script had a "happy" ending. Okay, probably not, but "Detour"'s lack of closure is part of what makes it great and probably wouldn't be if they had a little more money. I'm glad they didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ann Savage overacting is awful. She rants all over the place. At times it even looks as if she would crawl over the walls and hang, upside down from the ceiling, held by her claws embedded in the plaster, and foaming at the mouth. Quite hard on the actress nerves, I imagine, and if, as other better informed readers commented, this film was done in six days (even less than the creation of the world!!) then she must have ended in one of those clinics where one nerves were cured by sleeping during forty days non stop. Tom Neal performance, by contrast, is a model of subdued acting. The lighting effects on his face are quite far-fetched (cafeteria scene), but I suppose it was part of the 1940's filming experience. The interaction of the man and the woman shows clearly that in this movie she was the man and he was the woman (if we conform to the stereotypical woman/man couple).She couldn't have been more bossy. He was a perfect lamb, and she knew it, from the very beginning (women always do). The end is totally incomprehensible from a logical point of view. But again, somebody better informed than myself, said that it was inserted by the censorship, because this character couldn't go free at the end (bad example). It's fascinating, reading Tom Neal's biography, that his real life was so close to what Ann Savage character tells him to be (from her point of view). Quite a character this Tom Neal, and far from a lamb, as the guy in the picture!! The movie clearly shows that it was completed in six days. Nothing to write home about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This low-budget noir seemed to me like an exercise from a film-writing class: put all the noir clichés you can think of into one hour of celluloid.So we have a brooding narrator, a nightclub, a broken relationship, alcohol, a guy in the wrong place at the wrong time, a couple of deaths, and a doozy of a femme fatale.We even have these tired visuals: a man makes a long-distance call (so we watch operators at the switchboard and pictures of telephone wires), and a man makes a cross-country trip (so we see superimposed images of him hitch-hiking over a moving US map). And when he's sitting at the truck stop brooding, the lighting changes in the most amateurish way possible to indicate he's "reflecting."It's all tired and contrived, with several spots where the main character could have bailed out of the traps he found himself in. And what a downer of an ending!Besides all this, the print they used on TCM looks like it was shot from a fourth-generation VHS copy.The high point is a great bit of piano improvisation done by an uncredited hand-syncher.Not a complete waste of an hour, but you'd be better off taking a DETOUR to a better film in this genre.</fullReview>

I streamed it from the internet. I don't know if it is better on the big screen than a TV, but the choppy sound and video from the internet playing in a six-inch window is far from ideal. Still it is a decent movie, but I hate old-time movie music. It doesn't seem to fit very well (which isn't to say that modern music does). Anyway, maybe I'll watch it for real sometime.

		<fullReview>When a film that was made for a stick of gum - $30,000 TOTAL - and shot in six days is this watchable the instinct is to admire rather than criticise but in this case one sloppy plot point negates everything else. The film is told in flashback from the pov of Tom Neal who works with his girl friend in New York. Where he is thinking wedding bells she is thinking LA may give her a better future so she quits her job and leaves town. Neal pines for her and within weeks he has decided to join her in LA and what is more he decides to HITCH HIKE. Nothing wrong with that, lots of people do it and if Neal were a clerk in a shoe store or pumping gas there would be no problem. BUT, he is in fact in the ONE profession that would enable him to travel to the coast and get paid to boot for he is a Musician, a talented pianist and would have absolutely no trouble working his way to the coast. As this glitch comes right at the beginning it tends to spoil the rest of the movie so that you are then watching out for other improbabilities - like how did Ann Savage get AHEAD of the guy who had thrown her out of his car and WHY, after stealing a dead man's wallet and car, would Neal actually ASK Ann Savage if she needed a ride when surely he would have just wanted to get to LA safely and dump the car. The last problem is the climax; what kind of door has such a gap that it enables a telephone cord to be pulled through it and WHY, once she felt the cord slipping round her neck, did Ann Savage not just simply pull it away. Apart from that this is a half-decent movie.</fullReview>

The nicest thing I can call it is campy.Ann Savage plays a vindictive nightmare/drag-queen, like a machine that converts even the most neutral input into shrieking hate. This isn't enjoyable or realistic, it's just over the top. She wouldn't have lived 2 months on her own. Someone would have taken her out. Serial killer Aileen Wournos seems like a real sweetie compared to her. Here's my favorite quote from the DVD box: "...the meanest broad in all noir played to perfection by Ann Savage in the most powerful and riveting performance ever recorded on celluloid." um, yeah...It's really too bad that viewers are cheated out of the best scene. Tom and the audience should have gotten some on-screen pleasure (a lot!) out of strangling her.But Gee whiz, Tom's just a swell misunderstood guy who happens to be around when people die.
