		<shortDescription>Against all odds, John Carney does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the movie Once. When I arrived at South By Southwest, and saw that John Carney had directed another movie, I have to say I was a bit skeptical that he could capture the magic of that movie again without the amazing music and raw performances of Glen Hansard.My fears were unfounded.SING STREET is a heartfelt, funny and artful coming-of-age movie set in 1985 Dublin. I'm close to an ideal audience member for this film, because I grew up in the 80s myself, a child of the MTV Generation. I count John Hughes' films and the Cameron-Crowe scripted Fast Times At Ridgemont High among the most influential films of my childhood. They are the reason I became a screenwriter, and why I continue to write movies for a teen audience.Sing Street truly hearkens back to those great teen movies of the 80s. The best stories about teenagers are rooted in pain and isolation, and this is no different - Connor "Cosmo" Lawler comes from an upper middle class family that has fallen on hard times. His parents have constant fights. His older brother Brendan is a college dropout and his sister, the 'smart one,' pretty much keeps to herself. In order for the family to save money, Connor is transferred to the local Catholic boys school, where he's quickly made an outcast and an example by the authoritarian headmaster.You could say that this is a movie about forming a band. And this genre of story - of artistic awakening - seems to be replayed quite often in British and Irish films like The Commitments, Billy Elliott, The Full Monty, and others. But those movies each had a unique wrinkle, and Sing Street does too. It's the beautifully told story of the way that the inspiration and inception of the best art is rarely an individual act of genius, but rather, the result of a series of interconnected acts of human desire and emotion.It's the parents who sentence you to a horrible school; the girl who you long for that won't give you the time of day; the other guys who join your band because they're outcasts too... the brother who loves you too much, and is too angry at his own cowardice, to let you settle for less than your best.There's also a lot of great humor in Sing Street about the fact that you have to try on the styles of your heroes before you find your own confidence. 40-something audiences will definitely get another level of enjoyment out of all the allusions to great 80s bands. The art direction and costumes are done wonderfully in that respect. But I think this movie will work wonderful for today's teenagers as well.The movie is by turns funny, heart-wrenching, soaring and surprising. And the musical numbers, while not necessarily Oscar winning, like Once, is great. I'm thrilled that a new generation of teenagers will get to experience the release of a movie that's on par with the films I love so much as a kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite movie of 2016 so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie to beat this summer isn't a superhero movie.Its a movie about a teenager forming a band to try and impress a girl. What a wonderful and beautiful movie this. I was smiling and hugging myself throughout. So light and warm hearted and funny and yet deep and powerful. The Music is amazing even the original songs are fantastic. It is directed by the great John Carney who directed one of my favorite movies about music, Once. This is one of the best coming of age stories I've ever seen. It stands with Say Anything, Stand By ME, Perks of Being a wallflower, The fault in our stars. Please just go watch this movie. Please. I Loved it. ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carney is now 3 and O</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a fan of Carney's band the Frames, and was delighted to see his first low budget film , "Once" His second wonderful film had a much bigger budget and well know cast, but still a small film. I just loved, "Begin Again" with Mark Ruffalo, Adam Levine, and Kiera Knightly.He goes back to his roots with Sing Street and it is simply a joyful experience. It started off a bit slow for me. But as the band that is the focal point of the film hones their skills and improves so does this wonderful story. I just can't say enough about how great the two leads were in this film Ferdia Walsh-Peelo plays the male lead Conor, and Lucy Boynton as Raphina were just wonderful. It is a great film to watch if you are having trouble getting your smile on. As an American I had a little trouble at times with the thick Irish accents. When I watch the CD I may have to stick the subtitles on.I wish the film had a bit of a bigger budget in the sense that it looks like it was made on a tiny budget and musicals are much better when the sound is powerful. But that is just quibbling. Go see this in the theaters, if for nothing else to make sure Carney gets money to keep making films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibility. Your own path. Risk being ridiculed. "Happy sad".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a few days before the end of May, 2016, and the year in film might already be over as far as I'm concerned. It did not seem that way to me after the first time I saw this film - the "Mary Sue"-ism of the band's progress in quality, the strange appearance of a 1987 song in a 1985-set film (Starship's track at the party towards the end - from the movie 'Mannequin'), me asking myself which characters were responsible for editing the music video for 'Riddle of the Model' so decently / well?, and a couple more quibbles. These minor details became less important by the second viewing, and completely unimportant by the third and fourth viewings. They were replaced by: the girl that inspires your work, the work that allows you to ignore your current circumstances, the "adults", however few they may be, that actually notice what you're doing and encourage you / help you / are happily there for you, the friends you make as a result of putting yourself "out there", the joy of coming up with new material, "who are you, Steely Dan?", the fantastic storyline with Barry - the 'bully' who is incorporated into the group as the roadie with M's "Pop Musik" playing in the background, Brendan and Raphina meeting towards the end of the film, Eamon's mother (hahah), Flash and the Pan's "Waiting for a Train", The Cure on a film soundtrack, "Depech-E Mode", cookies between kisses, and Raphina... and Brendan. When even Adam Levine works perfectly for the film's ending, you know things are clicking.On a side note: my profile has my location as San Juan, Puerto Rico, but I did not see this film there... since it has not been shown there, and I unfortunately would not be surprised if it ended up not showing there at all before home video (hope I'm wrong).On a second side note: while in early high school, we tried to make a music video to compete in MTV's make-a-video contest for Madonna's track 'True Blue'... and failed impressively. Hence my immediately noticing the editing in 'RotM' :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irresistibly Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing quite like the creative process. We've all had that feeling; unfolding with all its frenzied excitement, malleable thoughts and brainstorms and inventive problem-solving. Yet creativity isn't just limited to what music you make, what stories you write, what paintings you paint. Flexing the limits of your creativity is almost like a window into your identity. Do you look for the easy fix, do you power through despite mental blocks, do you try the unexpected or bend towards an originality or an universality. So it goes with Sing Street, a movie that expands the notion of creativity itself, making an unabashedly and irresistibly charming film.Conor Lalor (Walsh-Peelo) and his family live in a charmed dwelling overlooking the urban sprawl of South side Dublin. Due to financial strain, Conor is informed that he's being taken out of his private Jesuit high school and being transferred to a public school nearby. At first, things go miserably. He's hassled by bullies, called names openly in class and harangued by the school's principal Father Baxter (Wycherley). His only solace is watching new wave music videos with his older brother Brendan (Reynor). Things change however with the appearance of the mysterious and strikingly beautiful Raphina (Boynton) who stands on the stoop outside the school. He approaches her and asks her to be in a music video; she agrees. Next step: start a band.Conor quickly makes friends with a gaggle of outcasts from the school in order to haphazardly start, build and maintain a fledgling little group. Among them is the multi-talented Eamon (McKenna) who can not only play multiple instruments but can put Conor's lyrics to song. It is the moments between these two young artists that best exemplifies the movie's central theme. We share with them the 4am feeling of unbounded imaginative bliss as they riff off each other, clean up their chords and rhythms and ask each other the meaning behind the songs they write. Because of Eamon's father's vocation as a covers band leader, the band not only has a place to practice but instruments to play which benefits the rest of the players as they develop their sound.Conor uses his band not only for the purpose of wooing the girl but also as a means to escape his increasingly turbulent home life. The marriage between his mother (Doyle Kennedy) and father (Gillen) circles the drain as his dropout brother smokes hash and oozes cynicism and unrealized potential. In one moment of investigation, Brendan points to the mother who sits on the stoop, smoking a cigarette, hoping to catch the last rays of sunshine of the day. With big talk of some day going to Paris, the mother settles on these moments to sulk in bitter reflection. "I cleared a path for you." Brendan says in a moment of defeat. Seems his carefully curated collection of vinyl and his grimacing observations serve as a counterpoint to encourage Conor's brazen dreams.Yet it's the girl who pushes Conor to the point of unique creative verisimilitude. And as the would-be model that captures the heart of our young hero, Lucy Boynton is an absolute vision. She coyly hints at gigs and glamour in London yet she lives at an all girls boarding house and dates a guy who listens to Genesis. Yet despite outward moments of confident sashaying, behind the makeup and denim there beats the heart of a true romantic and a true creative conduit. "When it comes to art, you never go halfway." she says just after she throws herself into the Irish Sea for the sake of a good video. This moment is immediately followed by Conor responding in kind.And yes this movie is about a new wave band in the 1980's, so yes there is a lot of hair, makeup, posh scarf wearing and mod style bravado. While today we like to take potshots at the synth-pop aesthetic, there's still something utterly charming about the way it is presented here. Is it nostalgia; probably. Yet there's an unawareness to it, allowing the audience to discover (or re-discover) the trappings of 80's popular music in real time. The excitement Brendan and Conor feel in watching Duran Duran's Rio music video is infectious, and the original songs by the band are easily the best thing about Sing Street.Conor eventually finds a since of identity within the catchy rhythms of his songs, the jejune charms of Raphina and the kindliness of Brendan's brotherly love. The moments of kitchen sink realism serves not only as a cautionary tale to Conor but to us as well. When we refuse ourselves the rewards of creativity we risk becoming embittered, angry and resentful. In the words of Kurt Vonnegut, "Go into the arts. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow." To put it another way, go create something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>London Calling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The vast majority of 1980's music usually inspires nothing but groans and an immediate change of the radio channel from me. Yet writer/director John Carney masterfully captured and held my attention with this crowd-pleasing story that leans heavily on the tunes from that era.Mr. Carney was also responsible for two previous music-centric movies, Once (2007) and Begin Again (2013). He is an exceptional story teller who puts music at the center, but avoids the label of "musical" by making it about people, rather than notes.It's 1985 in economically depressed Dublin, and a strong opening sequence introduces us to Connor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) as his ever-arguing parents (Aidan Gillen, Maria Doyle Kennedy) inform him of the economic necessity of pulling him out of prep school and enrolling him into a much tougher environment ? one that comes with bullies and hard-nosed teachers/clergy.Soon enough Connor is hanging with the misfits and inviting an enchanting "older" girl to star in his band's video. She agrees, and wide-eyed Connor quickly sets out to form a band that didn't previously exist.There are two interesting and fully realized relationships that make this movie click: Connor and the enchanting Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and Connor and his older brother Brendon (Jack Reynor). Brendan is Connor's life mentor and music guru. They are quick to jump on the new world of music videos, and it's a real hoot to watch Connor emulate the style and fashion of Duran, Duran, The Cure, etc.It's fascinating to note that Connor, while a pretty talented lyricist and singer, doesn't really seem to be in love with the music except as a means to an end ? a way to get the girl. That said, the real message here is that while teenagers often feel like they can't fix the outside world (parents, teachers, bullies), they can fix themselves by finding a passion in life (the movie uses the term vocation).It's hard not to notice the influence of such filmmakers as John Hughes and Cameron Crowe, and Carney certainly brings his touch of romanticism. Plus, one must appreciate any movie that delivers an original song as catchy as "Drive it like you Stole it", while also taking a shot at Phil Collins. It's a funny and sweet movie that should really catch on through positive word of mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie you've always wanted if you were a teen in the '80s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm happy to grade this movie a full blast 10. I was a teenager in 1985 in the last private Catholic Boarding School left in Mexico City. I relate to the strict uniform policy, the angry and imperfect young Catholic brothers still guessing their vocations, the old professors teaching materials for yester years, the canteen food, hiding Walkman radios and sunglasses, talking about bands across the ocean, the girls who wanted to be older and the fashion. This is a happy sad movie, that will keep you tapping and asking why aren't all movies like this. The script is very very smart, the casting couldn't be wiser. Lucy Boynton does an amazing job. The art direction is so precise you can imagine the smell of the flats. The awesome cars. What a great movie!!Don't miss this!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, the joy and pain of first love! Young Conor (aka Cosmo, played in his impressive debut by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) has the smelly end of a shitty stick to deal with while growing up in 1980's Dublin. He has warring parents with the need ? for financial reasons - to move Conor from his posh school to 'Singe Street' Catholic school: a decidedly rougher and tougher place, ruled over with a rod of iron by Brother Baxter (Don Wycherley). This is a place of chaos and mayhem, ruled over by bullies of the likes of Barry (a superbly intimidating Ian Kenny).The 15 year old Conor tries punching above his weight with the lovely 16 year old Raphina (Lucy Boynton) ? a struggling wannabe model with "mysterious eyes" who hangs around outside the Woman's Refuge opposite the school. To get her number, he claims to head up a band and to need her help with the band's video. One small problem: there is no band and Conor has limited musical ability! He gathers around him a motley crew of friends, and with the help of his stoner brother (Jack Raynor) and his extensive vinyl collection, goes about creating a band to gain fame and fortune (or at least the girl).This is a film that works on so many levels. As a piece of nostalgia for us older folks, the sights and sounds of the 80's are brought vividly back to life, with a rocking soundtrack of the likes of Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet to enjoy. And as a coming of age movie, the long lingering looks, embarrassment and discomfort of first-dating is both touching and painful to watch, with the best Rich-Tea fuelled snog ever put on screen! Few films in fact have come this close to depicting this glorious ineptitude since John Gordon Sinclair and Dee Hepburn struggled to get together in Bill Forsyth's "Gregory's Girl" (making me feel ancient, this was actually set in 1981!).It should be noted that at one point the film also models the casual racism prevalent at the time, with perhaps only the addition of a rebuking "You can't say things like that" striking a less realistic note. This is a film where nearly everyone is damaged in one way or another ? drugs; hopeless ambition; child abuse; paedophilia, alcoholism; bullying; (the list goes on). However, the hugely intelligent script by writer and director John Carney drips the issues out in such tiny insinuations and snippets of conversation that it feels lifelike: not as if the film-maker is beating you over the head with it. This is just a poor Dublin life in the 80's: get on with it.All of this might make you think this is a hugely depressing, kitchen-sink type of drama that will leave you, at the end of the evening, in dire need of a box-set of "Father Ted" to cheer you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the same way as the music in Alan Parker's 1991 Dublin-set classic "The Commitments" - and indeed 2013's excellent Belfast-based "Good Vibrations" - lifted the spirits, so the drive and energy of the soundtrack makes the film a hugely uplifting experience. Besides the classic 80's stuff there are some really great original songs (co-written by the multi- talented John Carney, with Gary Clark): I was still humming "Drive It Like You Stole It" in the car park. The young cast throw themselves into the job with great energy, with Walsh-Peelo and Boynton delivering touching and impressive performances and Mark McKenna particularly worthy of note channeling a young John Lennon. My top acting accolade though goes to Jack Raynor (who was until recently rumoured to be in the running for the role of the young Han Solo: a role that's now just gone to "Hail Caesar's" Alden Ehrenreich). Playing Conor's older and wiser brother, his frustration at his role in life boils over in a vinyl- smashing and hugely impressive rant that I would like to see credited with a Best Supporting Actor award. And amid all of the teenage love and band efforts, it is this aspect of brotherly love that eventually shines out as the beating heart of the film. The film is a little rough at the edges ? a dream sequence looks like it could have had a few more dollars thrown at it - but this often adds to the charm. John Carney seems to have quite an Indie following, but I'm not familiar with his other work. This film left me wanting to dig into his archives. It left my wife gushing with tears from beginning to end! A must see film.(I loved it - did you?

		<fullReview>Sing Street is another of director John Carney's sweet and entertaining tributes to musicians and love following the magnificent Once and the appealing Begin Again. Sing Street is perhaps ultimately the most endearing of the three films as it follows young Conor ( Ferdia Walsh-Peelo in an exceptional film debut) as he forms a band with fellow outcasts at his Dublin Catholic school and as he attempts to woo Raphina (the lovely Lucy Boynton), who appears in the group's music videos. Sing Street sets its action in the 1980s, the glory era of music videos and modern pop music. The film treats the vintage music used throughout with fond remembrance, and it is a true joy to hear blissfully wonderful songs by Duran Duran, Hall and Oates, Spandau Ballet, Starship, Genesis (even if the song is dumped upon by other characters), and The Cure. While this music is sensational, what really helps Sing Street to become a must-see is its wonderful ensemble cast (Jack Reynor is a true force of nature in the role of Conor's older brother, Brendan, who has made mistakes that he wants to save his younger brother from making), its appealing story, and brilliant new songs that feel like the 80s are back again. Walsh-Peelo and Boynton have great chemistry together, and their scenes together are funny, honest, and sweetly poignant. Likewise, Walsh-Peelo is also convincing in the scenes involving his interactions with fellow band members. Of the new songs, "Up" is a great power anthem, "The Riddle of the Model" has a good avant-garde approach, "Girls" and "Brown Shoes" are both solid, "A Beautiful Sea" is wonderful in the little bit of it that is heard, "To Find You" is a moving ballad and very poignant, Adam Levine's closing song "Go Now" is terrific, but the true standout song is the high-energy "Drive It Like You Stole It". This song, an extremely catchy and bouncy concoction that sounds like some of the best 80s pop, is staged in a fantasy sequence that serves as a homage to Back to the Future, and the scene is filled with so much joy and poignancy that to watch it is to be reminded that it is for scenes like this that we go to the movies in the first place. The ending of the film too is magnificent, a lilting end to a truly marvelous film. Sing Street is definitely one to savor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream big, and listen to your older brother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for movies about musicians, and John Carney has already given us Once (2007) and Begin Again (2013). Now he delights once more with Sing Street, a tale told with humor, drama, and some pretty catchy songs, all set in the backdrop of 1980's Dublin.Yes, Sing Street is set in the 80's so it undeniably lends itself to comic relief as these schoolboys are forced to navigate through hair, makeup, clothing and music video choices along their artistic journey. We get plenty of laughs as we watch them try to forge an identity and look like bona-fide rock stars in this crazy MTV generation. And for good measure, they insert the obligatory Phil Collins joke in the mix.There is quite a deal of drama as well. We see bullying in an all-boys school, dysfunctional families, the economic hardships of Ireland in the 80's and young people's wish to break out of societal malaise and seek their fortunes elsewhere. I haven't lived in Ireland but the desire to pack your bags and start over in another place is a universal one. Audiences in every continent can relate to that.The cast is solid and I was very impressed with the leads, especially Ferdia Walsh-Peelo who plays Connor. He can be charming, kind, insecure but out-of-nowhere gutsy which is an accurate depiction of a blossoming musician. After the first hour I began to be doubtful of the character of Connor's brother Brendan for seeming to be too wise for his age, but by the end of the film it all made sense, and Jack Reynor was a fine choice for that role. Lucy Boynton (Raphine) is great as the love interest and mysterious but troubled muse; she packs an emotional performance and probably looks the most natural in 80's fashion, although she didn't quite convince me as a 16 year-old and it wasn't because of all the excess hair and makeup. On the other hand Mr. Walsh-Peelo (Connor) was only 15 when the movie was shot and he's got that boyish appearance. Finally Mark McKenna (Eamon) has such an uncanny resemblance to Julian Lennon it's scary! But a good actor too.As far as concerns I had only a few major ones but they didn't detract from the enjoyment of the film. First is that the story moves very quickly in the first 30 minutes or so, then takes the foot off the pedal for the remainder. And second, it's a little unrealistic that these kids can write quality songs right out of the blocks. It would have been fun to hear a real stinker when they're starting out. I'm a musician and believe me, our first attempts are pretty bad. That's true even for the all-time best.There were a few other minor things but they're not worth mentioning. This is a great story, it got all the laughs, cheers and tears in the right places and I would recommend it to everyone, especially those who want to express themselves through art and aspire to greatness. Dream big, all you adolescents. A big thanks to John Carney et al for reminding us of that and making a quality film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks for the music lessons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant. Once will forever be one of my desert island films, but Sing Street comes really close. Together with Begin Again, John Carney has made an amazing trilogy of 'music' films that beat with warm hearts of gold. This one is about a boy living in the 80s who wants to start a band because he likes a girl. A rather simple storyline but the execution is bliss. If you were weaned on songs from the 80s you are so going to love this. The music is of course A1, but I never counted the familiar story to be so winsome and endearing. It fricking made me tear up. The reason why it is so good is because Carney knows how to portray the kids and adults like how we think them to be in our idealistic minds. In our minds, at one time or another, we all wished we were like them. I love the banter between the boy and his older brother in the music man-cave. Doesn't anyone want an older brother like that. A bro that knows, feels, loves and understands music, and talks music like it is the only knowledge in the world worth knowing. Carney knows music and he uses it to bridge relationships and incidents in our lives, and it is about getting the girl. It is also about "finding the happiness in sadness" that transcends us to a new level, and "no woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins". I will remember that one &#x1f62c;Thank you for the music lessons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carney is a great director of music movies. His back catalogue includes Once and Begin Again, and he's captured the same magic in his new movie Sing Street (loosely based on his own youth). Its beauty is its simplicity and naturalism, it feels like real people having real conversations.As with his others, the movie would not work if the songs weren't so good, - written by Carney and Gary Clark - which I would buy on vinyl if they sold it in the cinema foyer! Each have their own distinctive tone, from the uplifting "Up" to the gentle "To Find You", which are rough and childlike but strangely poignant at times.Although the script is well written and organic, it has to be said occasionally the acting isn't. The cast are well selected, and each do their part pretty well (especially for teenagers), but the ones that stand out are Jack Reynor and Lucy Boynton who brilliantly bring a level of maturity, humour, sentimentality and honesty.Great songs, solid acting and natural screenplay, Sing Street has more character than plot. Makes a happy movie out of fairly sad circumstances - a wonderful representation of the movie's own "happy-sad" message.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sing Street" is music to the ears - and the heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few (if any) of us were who we wanted to be when we were in high school. While high school girls often think they're not pretty enough or popular enough, boys fear they're not cool enough or tough enough. Of course, these are only a few of the characteristics that teens in high school ? both boys and girls believe they lack. The point is, during adolescence, all kids think that they're not "enough"? of something. Well, I say "enough already" ? and so does Irish writer-director John Carney, through his music-oriented comedy-drama "Sing Street" (PG-13, 1:46). This is a film that shows us it's okay to be insecure and sad sometimes, but you can also learn to be happy during those times and even to rise above them. "Happy-Sad" the film calls it. I call the film insightful, encouraging and entertaining.Conor Lalor (Ferdia Walsh Peelo) is, in many ways, a typical 15-year-old. He goes to school, where he has both friends and enemies. He has family members who love him, but also add challenges to his life. And, of course, he wants to earn the affections of someone special who has caught his eye. The details of the framework of Conor's life may differ from yours (as well as his gender, interests, location and even time period), but he should be easy to relate to ? for anyone who attended (or is now attending) high school.As for Conor, he lives in Dublin, Ireland in 1985. He has a brother (six years older) named Brendan (Jack Raynor), who is out of school but still lives at home, and a younger sister named Ann (Kelly Thornton). Their parents (Aidan Gillen and Maria Doyle Kennedy) argue ? loudly ? about money, their kids, their marriage, etc. Conor has the experience of changing schools, starting at Synge Street Christian Brothers School, where, as the new kid, he quickly runs afoul of the principal (Don Wycherly) and the school bully (Ian Kelly). However, Conor soon makes a friend named Darren (Ben Carolan) and is quite taken by a mysterious girl named Raphina (Lucy Boynton) who lives across the street from the school.As a way of getting to know Raphina, Conor asks her to be in a music video for his band. She agrees, so now all Conor has to do is? start a band! He gets Darren to be the band's manager ? slash ? music video producer. Darren introduces Conor to Eamon (Mark McKenna), who is skilled at a variety of instruments. After the guys recruit from among their school mates, adding friends Larry (Conor Hamilton) and Gary (Karl Rice), along with Ngig (Percy Chamburuka), the only black kid at Synge Street CBS, they choose "Sing Street" as the name of their band, and start working on their band's musical and visual identity.Heavily influenced by early-mid 1980s acts like The Cure, Joe Jackson and Hall &amp; Oates (whose songs appear in the soundtrack), Sing Street works up a cover of Duran Duran's "Rio" and then Conor and Eamon start writing original songs together. Brendan makes use of his misspent youth to school his younger brother in the finer points of modern music and encourages Conor to stretch musically. Soon, Raphina becomes Conor's muse and a regular in Sing Street's videos. Raphina and Conor also grow closer, in spite of her "it's complicated" relationship status and her plan to move to London to model."Sing Street" features a whole lot of talent ? on both sides of the camera ? and the microphone. Carney's direction and his script are sensitive, engaging and fun. The story has a lot going on, but still keeps things simple, and derives its entertainment value from a variety of sources. The drama comes from following the development of the band, the relationship between Conor and Raphina, the relationships within Conor's house and Conor's problems at school. The comedy comes from the behavior of the film's colorful characters and the natural awkwardness of teenagers discovering life.Carney says the film is "wish fulfillment of all of the things I wanted when I was the age of the character and didn't do." To portray a fictionalized version of his own adolescence, he cast unknown, but talented actors ? with terrific results. Raynor creates an interesting and passionate character, who is dealing with the fear that life is passing him by. For their part, Walsh-Peelo and McKenna, besides being fine young actors, are talented musicians in real life ? all the better to perform the film's excellent original songs.As the main character, Conor's struggles are relatable, his dreams are understandable and his story is enjoyable. The film isn't completely original or realistic, but it's very effective as a representation of the trials, tribulations and potential triumphs of the teenage years, and offers hope as to what could lie ahead ? for those who make the most of those years ? and the lessons they produce. "You can never do anything by half," is one character's heart-felt proclamation. "Sing Street" continually speaks to the heart ? through its comedy, its drama and its wonderful music ? and doesn't do it by half. "A-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joyous yet refreshingly real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The warm and idealistic yet poignantly real Sing Street?about an Irish high-school student in the 1980s who starts a band?has the power to make you nostalgic for a childhood that wasn't your own.We meet the fifteen-year-old protagonist Conor hiding in his bedroom with a guitar, as his parents argue about their financial troubles and failing marriage. When Conor must transfer to a state Catholic school in a different part of town (based on director John Carney's childhood school), viewers aren't spared the harsh first encounters with his classmates and headmaster. He is, for example, punched and threatened by a school bully and forcibly handled by the school's headmaster after a dress-code violation. These moments and others carry with them a palpable realness, devoid of melodrama or sentimentality. The film's unique realness is present in the difficult moments (the bullying and rough family situation); it is also present in the mundane and witty?from Conor's family watching early MTV music videos together, to the extensive record collection and the poster of Freud in the older brother's bedroom, to Conor's friend's unapologetic love of rabbits. It's the realness of many of the film's moments that makes its accompanying youthful idealism powerful. The film's plot-line itself is one centered around youthful hope and naiveté. Conor starts a band to impress a beautiful aspiring model who lives across the street from his school. Although she is dating an older man, Conor hopes his music and persistence will win her over. The characters' budding romance is accompanied by a soundtrack of 1980s rock and roll hits and Carney's original '80s-inspired pop tunes, sung in the film by Conor's band. Sing Street is a life-affirming story about what one can do with hope and music, but it also gives a nod to those with unrealized dreams who use music as a form of escapism. Conor's brother (a frustrated college drop-out), like the movie's viewers, rejoices in Conor's triumphs, and Carney celebrates the older brothers of the world who pave the way (sometimes at their own expense) for their younger siblings. Sing Street is a film that is both realistic and idealist, that both celebrates the glories of youth and playfully mocks them and that both nostalgically celebrates the music of the 1980s and makes viewers want to, like Conor, be a "futurist" who, without looking back, drives life "like you stole it."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relatable, charming, and musically tight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As charming and cute as it is dramatic and heartfelt, Sing Street does a beautiful job of touching on so many different themes whilst still keeping its musical wits about it. The film does a great service to staying true to that special era of 80's music, hitting almost every beat in genre, and doing so in way that building the characters and story. And the story and character are nothing short of perfect, in handling an emotional drama, and giving the audience funny, compelling, and relatable characters. I hate to compare it to John Carney's other great musical film, Once but he has a certain talent when it comes to writing a film around the music, and having the music tell the story in a special way. It always puts a smile on my face when a song comes together in the way they do in a John Carney movie. I highly recommend you see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice nostalgia tour, but a little too much style over substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a nice film. It's a coming of age tale with heart, it's got a great soundtrack, and some pretty good performances. However, rather than telling a properly compelling story, Sing Street often feels a little too preoccupied with portraying its time period. It undoubtedly paints a picture of mid-80s pop culture very well, but that's at the expense of a genuinely engrossing story, making this seem like a little too much style over substance.Directed and written by John Carney, who also made Once (which I didn't like) and Begin Again (which I loved), Sing Street is a bit of a middling film of his. As we've seen in his other films, there's always a real passion for making music, and how it can bring people together, and that does feature once again here.Time and time again, we get some great original songs mixed with classics of the 80s, and that's one of the things that makes this an enjoyable watch. It's a toe-tapper of a film, and, particularly if you have a strong nostalgia for the time period, you'll love seeing it portrayed on screen so well.However, unlike Begin Again, which weaved that music in with an engrossing and emotional story, Sing Street suffers from a very thin story, and pretty plain characters, which means that it's never as emotionally resonant as it needs to, and clearly wants to be.There were numerous moments where the story takes a step back from the fun of making a band and singing songs, and tries to look at the various problems in the characters' lives in order to get you to connect with them more. However, seeing as none of the characters really stand out from one another, and all just feel like very generic coming-of-age movie teenagers, it was a lot harder for me to care about whatever was happening in their personal lives, which meant that any time when the film tried to be more emotional, it really fell flat.And this is where I'm going to bring in a comparison to The Commitments, which was clearly a big influence on this film. They both have great music, and they've both got a great sense of fun about them, but the major difference is the characters. In The Commitments, the varied personalities gave the film a great dynamic, and also meant that you could care about each individual person on screen, whereas in Sing Street, considering that we don't have that, it loses a huge amount of its power, and makes the majority of the story feel very thin.The characters may be thin, and that does impact on your interest, but the performances are still very good. Although they may not have so much to do, young actors including Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Jack Reynor and especially Lucy Boynton really do shine, and do very well to keep you entertained and engaged by what is in truth a bit of an average and generic story.Overall, I liked Sing Street. It's a pleasant, fun and musical coming-of-age movie which brilliantly portrays its time period and features some strong performances. Its story, however, feels very thin, and that means that it's never as emotionally effective or interesting as it should have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carney's highly entertaining and youthfully vibrant, Sing Street will be the most delightful riot of eighties-reminiscent nostalgia you never thought you needed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following Carney's stunning hit Once, his attempt at 2013&#x2032;s Begin Again, although (at first glance) full of indie music-lover potential, never quite felt like it understood what you wanted it to be. Since re-watching Begin Again, hoping to find some reasoning behind this, it became apparent that the film never finds its own voice or identity, like Once did, despite its great cast and original music. Instead of ignoring this, Carney has focused on this misstep with Sing Street, creating a truly genuine ode to not just the seventies and all coming-of-age youth, but his own personal experience. There is a deliberate personal touch here, and the film is all the better for it - it is present in the relatable character of Cosmo (played by the impressive Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) and his hormone- infused ambitions to simply "get the girl". Instigated by the presence of the beautiful and mysterious Raphina (played by the lovely Lucy Boynton), Cosmo starts a band. He is guided by his older brother Brendan (played by the excellent Jack Reynor) and his rebellious 80&#x2032;s taste in music, to inspire his own band's music. What follows is a musically-charged narrative of experiments in identity, rebelling against oppression and hilarious attempts at parodying classic 80&#x2032;s music videos. You have to wonder how interesting a character Carney must have been at that age, growing up in conservative Dublin and gaining a taste in new music that opened up his world, like his character Cosmo. Frieda Walsh-Peelo does a fine job, although not leading man quality yet, he carries the film considerably well for his first acting role. More impressive, is his vocal talent. Frieda is a trained opera singer and musician at only 16. His broad vocal range is apparent and works really well with the many different songs in the film. It will be exciting to see what other projects he tackles in the future. Lucy Boynton is stunning and so believable as the sure-footed and mysterious Raphina - she really wears the eighties wardrobe well as she fully embodies this role, rather than the other way around. Early on, her character is saved from Manic-Pixie-Dreamgirl syndrome and she becomes a real, imperfect, three-dimensional character. Boynton's light, airy voice lends to her character's naiveness, which is a stark contrast to the image she projects. Perhaps the most enjoyable character (aside from the underused band members, who do deserve some more love) is Cosmo's older brother Brendan, played by Jack Reynor. Reynor manages to make Brendan into both a reckless, failed dreamer as well as the older brother we all wish we had. By the end of this film you'll empathize with him even more and that's not just because it's written well. The only concern will be that most notably, at the TIFF Next Wave film festival, it was acknowledged during the Q&amp;A's how approximately 90% of the audience were 50 or older. The soundtrack, if marketed correctly, could become a hit. Tunes like "Rhythm of the Model" and "Drive it Like You Stole It" were clearly audience favourites. It will be interesting to see how this will be marketed though. The music, although catchy and fun, is not "mainstream" and younger audiences may not bite. Older audiences who come for shoutouts to Duran Duran and The Cure may be put off by how toned down and slightly unrealistic or easy the plot plays out. There seems to be some confusion with this film, if it was made for adolescents or older audiences or just John Carney. I would have to agree with all three. I found Sing Street similar to a Pixar film in that it's marketed toward the younger set with a story that doesn't get too ugly but is pulled off well with a strong message. References that only adults will get will go over kids' heads. But ultimately - this is a movie for and by John Carney. And that is why is it so unlike Begin Again - Sing Street has it's own voice and identity. Overall, the message is so clear and true in this film. The world Carney places his story in is so rich that it refuses to lack depth despite it's expected younger audience. There are relatable subplots about family and marriage, the bond between brothers, oppression in society, and the desire to achieve your dreams despite where you come from. Admittedly, there are some underused characters who still manage to naturally add charisma and charm. Perhaps a missed opportunity, but the rest of the band members fall to the wayside to make room for Cosmo and Raphina's boy- meets-girl plot. This could've easily become a completely different film about the band itself and made into an ensemble's story. However, Sing Street is much more than that - it's a personal journey through adolescence. It's about daring to dream beyond what is put in front of you. (Reviewed by : COLD KNEES)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes a film sneaks up on you and is so enjoyable, so feel good that you forget everything else that's going on in your life and just enjoy it.For me that's what 'Sing Street' did. I'd seen and enjoyed Carney's film 'Once' and loved the music but disliked his other film 'Begin Again'. 'Sing Street' though is on another level.It's got a great story, the characters are identifiable, and each of the songs sticks in your head.Whereas 'Begin Again' seemed to get bogged down by bad language and ex references, here Carney goes back to the basics of 'Once' - characters, stories and music. It's a perfect combination.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. As the final song says, go on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movie-experiences of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know a motion picture is great when instead of saying, "I have seen that movie," you say, "I have EXPERIENCED that movie." This is one of them.Story: Sing Street follows 15-year-old Conor, who belongs to a troubled family. In hopes to escape this, and please a girl he met, he forms his band which shows him the colors of teenage life.15-minutes into the film, I already know that this movie is special. Sing Street has a beautiful story that is immersive and can just warm any cold heart.The music in Sing Street is nothing less of brilliant. It echoes the magnificence of the music of the 1980's, which still has big influences to how music is written today.The tone of the movie also is reverberating with that retro vibe which is so cool! The cinematography makes you just want to experience the disco ages. There are so many modern movies that, for example, have a 1950s setting that try so much to give you the feel of the '50s but fail. Sing Street is NOT one of them. It is a 2016 picture made to look like the 1980s, and it DOES look (and feel) like the 1980s. I also like how these movies have open-ended endings. You are into the story so much that when it ends, it challenges you to write the story in your own minds.Sing Street is no doubt one of the best films of the year. In my opinion, it is the second best next to Captain America: Civil War. See it, ASAP.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>band of Ireland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you only hear about John Carney's "Sing Street" you might think that it has the same story as "The Commitments". They do have similar plots but go in their own directions. This one incorporates the theme of the bullied kid. In this case, a boy gets moved to a new school in 1980s Dublin and starts a band. The movie at once serves as a coming-of-age story and also a look at its era. The mom mentions that Ireland doesn't allow divorce (it now does).I thought that the most impressive scene was the "Back to the Future" sequence, where the principal dances (naturally it turns out to be in the boy's imagination). When you look at the kind of school that this is - and what a jerk the principal is - it's understandable why he and his friends decide to start a band. There has to be a way for people to unleash their creativity, especially under these circumstances.Basically, this movie is worth seeing. I now want to see Carney's earlier "Once", which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song (most people probably didn't expect it to win since Disney's "Enchanted" was also nominated in that category).I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is 100% worth watching. It's a unique, merry film that will get you smiling and inspire you in so many ways. The film was about so much more than just the main tag-line: boy meets girl and tries to impress her. It had so many little sub plots to it, and although it was a very optimistic film, had elements of realism and conflict in it. The way the characters bond throughout the film and the inspirational stories of what they go through together is truly remarkable. I would say it was a solid 9/10 production-wise, but overall the film was a truly recommendable piece of art and if you are someone who enjoys music and films, this movie is perfect for you. The songs were catchy, the characters were extremely likable and different, and it was its own film that didn't try to be anything else. Magnificent and enjoyable, with key messages and admirable role models within.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is the eighties, with fashion that made you cringe and swoon for and music that will stay forever ? mostly. Connor is being taught by The Jesuits in Dublin but his father 0- Aiden Gillen ? is having financial problems and so needs to make some cutbacks. The first victim is Connor who gets sent to the rather dilapidated Synge Street school run by The Christian Brothers ? he is not best pleased.On arrival he enters a world of strident teachers, bullies and a strange show policy. He also meets Raphina ? and is immediately smitten. She is an aspiring model and so he decides to get her to be in his bands pop video. Problem number one is he does not have a band ? so he sets about pulling one together.This is a wonderful film from start to finish, the actors are all perfect in their roles and the writing and direction for John Carney ('Begin Again' and 'Once') are superb. Plus you get some great fashions, great songs and even some brilliantly bad videos. This is a film that will brighten your day, make you laugh and affirm your faith in humanity ? absolutely one hundred percent recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a young man in a troubled family, whose parents are breaking up. He is bullied in school and basically is a nobody, until he decides to form a band to attract a mysterious orphan girl."Sing Street" is a low budget film, with no fancy sets and no fancy clothes. However, it has this mysterious aura around it, and I like it a lot. The main character, Conor, is a very likable youngster, and I particularly feel for him because of his experience in school with the bullies and the headmaster. His friends are all very realistic and down to earth. The whole film breathes of positivity, as it tells a tale of chasing dreams, breaking out of the comfort zone and living the life you want. Maybe that's what attracts me to the film. And of course, the very nice songs that the band performs also make me like the film loads. It is unusual that I like the songs in a film about music, but in this film I find myself singing along to that song "Drive it Like You Stole It". I enjoyed watching "Sing Street".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock n' Roll is a Risk !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Sing Street' is set in 1980s Ireland. Right at the beginning of the film we are given footage of a news reel showing numerous Irish people leaving their deadbeat lives in Ireland to look for a new life in England. This little bit of footage actually establishes the overall binding theme of the film. This desire to leave the dying, hopeless economy of Ireland to go somewhere with more scope has a direct connection with the life of our protagonist Connor. His parents' marriage is on the rocks and on the verge of collapse. He and his siblings are living a depressed existence with no sense of freedom. Connor gets transferred to a Catholic school. Although initially he gets bullied in his new school, but later on he finds some new friends who share his love for music and they help Connor in forming the band 'Sing Street' in order to impress the girl Raphina that Connor becomes deeply infatuated with.The only other John Carney film I had seen before is 'Once' which I think is a masterpiece. 'Sing Street' is very different in style to 'Once'. While 'Once' has a raw, stripped down style of storytelling, 'Sing Street' has a much more upbeat, energetic style which kind of reminded me of the 2014 film 'Pride'. The upbeat style of the film's screenplay and style of direction embody the spirit of Connor and his teenage friends who also want to make their presence felt. Just like the people flocking to England to have a promising future, Connor also isn't contented with his present life and wants to do something with his life and pursue his love which is music. He doesn't know what awaits him on the other side if he pursues what he wishes to, but his romantic teenage heart is willing to take that risk and break free.The relationship between Connor and his brother Brandon was beautiful and in a way the heart of the whole film. Through the backstories and other hints that are given, it is implied that Connor is the spiritual successor of Brandon. Once upon a time, Brandon had also found himself in the same position that Connor finds himself in. He also wanted to escape the metaphoric prison and live his life the way he wants to, but unfortunately couldn't. In the film Connor is standing at that same crossroad where he wants to escape the suffocating oppression of his teachers, the depressing state of his family life and go away along with his special girl Raphina to live their dreams. Brandon is a a very likable character, one can easily understand him, his opinions and his decisions. The way he helps Connor is nothing short of heartwarming. It is because of the existence of this loving brotherly relationship between Connor and Brandon that I think 'Sing Street' can be used brilliantly in a double feature with Ken Loach's 'Kes'. 'Kes' is another film where the protagonist Billy tries to escape the grim and depressing reality of his life through his pet bird. But instead of being loving, his older brother is adversarial which beautifully contrasts the relationship between Connor and Brandon in 'Sing Street'.The romance between Connor and Raphina felt cute and believable. The chemistry between the boys of the bands also felt great. Apart from his real brother Brandon, Connor's relationship with the members of his band especially Eamon felt very tender and sweet.John Carney uses flashy directing techniques here to complement the rebellious teenage spirit of the characters. We see rapid use of zoom, 360 degree shot that transitions into another scene, a whole fantasy-like sequence that almost felt like it was from another movie,etc. This completely contrasts the toned down approach in 'Once', but considering the subject of the film, the upbeat tone is perfect.The acting is great from everyone involved. The actors give three dimensional performances. They are funny, likable and relateable. Special mention has to be given to Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Jack Reynor and Lucy Boynton.If I can find a flaw in the film, I'll say that the music in the film, although being great to listen to, sounds a bit unrealistically professional which took me out of the film at times. I know that this is a feelgood film which at times flirts with elements of fantasy, but I think the quality of the music could have been intentionally lowered a bit and for me, it would have made the film even more personal and intimate and lovable.Overall, the film is really enjoyable. It is funny, emotional, thought-provoking and has a big heart. It pays a tribute to all brothers all over the world. The romance between the leads is cute and believable. It didn't move me as much as 'Once', but it is certainly a worthy entry in Carney's filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the 80s with rock and roll and romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seriously thought this might be an overrated film. I knew it was too early to judge it, so I was not expecting anything extraordinary and then it struck me with its progress, I was clean bowled by its style and cuteness. I don't what others think, but this is John Carney's masterpiece according to me. I liked his other films, but this is something I think a perfect dose of contents. In two words to say it is a Golden Touch. I rarely like music and musical films, and it had been long since one I had enjoyed very much like this. Definitely this should be one of the top ten films of the years.This is an Irish-British film that is set in the Dublin, 1985. It is about a high school boy named Conor, who just got transferred from a private school to a free state-run boy's school after his parents imposed a plan on the budget cut. New school and problems are ahead where he has to come out of it on his own. During getting used to it, he meets a girl who lives nearby the school and to impress her, he lies that he has a band and looking for a female singer. So then he forms one with the amateur musicians and the journey begins for these teenagers that reveals in the remaining film how long they are willing to go."Your problem is that you're not happy being sad. But that's what love is, Cosmo. Happy-sad."At the end of the final scene, there is a note that says 'For brothers everywhere'. I was impressed by that, because I did not pay attention on that while watching the film. What I meant was, this is not some teenage love story, actually it was about the brothers, but overshadowed by romance theme. I recalled my memories on those parts and quickly realised the centre of the story that how it was developed. The one who played the older brother of Conor simply looked alike Seth Rogan and that is the character you have to watch out for. He's only a supporting character, but the impact was indirectly larger on the story.Of course, falling in love might make you do crazy things, even you can become a rockstar overnight. But there's a first step for everything and it is not assured that you will be succeed by those attempts. That is where comes the experienced hand, the brother, a close friend who stood by us since our birth. It is easy to fall in love, but it is not easy to have a brother who guides us in every move on that.In this film the sreenspace between them was very little, but that did not stop to disclose how one's inspiration that got from love to mold accurate shape and to lead the right path. I don't have any brother, but I felt how it would be to have one. So all the brothers in the world must see it, this is dedicated to them."It's like when you don't know someone, they are more interesting. They can be anything you want them to be. But when you know them, there's limits to them."I did not grow up in the 80s, but was very close to it and I know how it would feel to be born in that generation. Jeans, thick hair and curls, everybody was so thin, weird make-ups with strong eyeliner, big eyeglasses, cassettes, you would love this film if you remember those stuffs from your fading memories.A very stylish music-comedy and on the romance side, this film was very cute. All the actors were brilliant, especially the lead boy whose first film was this and the girl amazing with her totally electrifying look. They both going have a great future in filmdom. Not to miss out the supporting cast who did their part so well, especially the brother I talked about in the other paragraph.All the sound tracks were awesome. I should start adding them to my 'film songs' collection, especially 'The Riddle of the Model' which defines this title and the film's climax song 'Go Now'. So from the cast to crew, equal credits must given to the music composers and lyricists from the real 80s bands. The film had a perfect runtime, I would have had no issue if it was extended for another half an hour.The pace of the narration always kept in a same position, but towards the final quarter it has gone up. Yes, I loved the ending, it was touching, but I don't know how to describe it, only one can experience it by himself. A film I watched without any anticipation, now it is one of my favourite films. Todays generation might take it as another rock and roll inspired theme, but only the middle aged guys and some old ones would know how to enjoy it. So don't miss it out if you are one of them.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When his family decides to cut expenses because of the recession, Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) a teenager who loves music, is transferred to a public Christian school where he finds to be totally out of place. One day he sees a girl, Raphina (Lucy Boynton), waiting out of the school and goes to talk to her, deeply moved he decides to put a band together so she can star in their music videos and mainly to impress her. This brings him and her and his new friends in the band into a coming-of-age tale that is a powerful as it is romantic.I think "Sing Street" is the kind of movie that would enable a director to do whatever he wants next, that's how brilliant of a piece John Carney has put together and by looking at how confidently and effortlessly it manages to be alive I have now moved to the church of John Carney, despite not quite enjoying his past film "Begin Again".This is the kind of film that filled me with joy about filmmaking and storytelling, a beautiful, coherent, original, hopeful and thrilling piece that moved me throughout its duration and hasn't left my head for quite some time. This is an exemplary piece where everything just clicks and matches, be it the director being so inspired by the content, the actors giving it their all, the music being so on point it could already go down in history, everything is simply delightful and touching without ever being sugary or melodramatic.It is hard to believe that so much is fitted into a one hundred minute frame, but I guess that it all starts and ends with these characters being so alive and so effective, in a setting so perfectly fitting, they just become this overwhelming figures that speak so intimately to us without even having to do anything. Their portrayal is so well realized and so incredibly touching it naturally brings an audience's heart to soar.These people are first and foremost relatable, yet after that their representation on screen become so unique and especially original you don't know where to look when they are on screen. The casting department deserves a raise after having worked this out, there isn't one actor that feels out of place. Even some of the extra's work is key to the film and enhances moments to even further meaning. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo manages to play this person without ever stepping into grounds we wouldn't appreciate, yet he manages to walk on that fine line really tightly and emerge with a characterization that is as three dimensional as possible and one that will certainly stand the test of time. Yet, the real knockout here has to be Lucy Boynton. No doubt her unbelievable charm and unique beauty help build the role, but this is a performance that goes well beyond that. It is the classic performance you get a crush on and that is always the sign of really excellent work because it means you have brought your character to life in such a complete and convincing way we start to project ourselves onto her. This is inspiring character work.And I still haven't mentioned Jack Reynor or any of the band mates. Every single one of these people is made to be on screen portraying this role, it enriches the film so much to see such perfect casting and execution. However, we cannot ignore the gargantuan work Carney has put into this and the way it comes through to us. Every action, every shot both in foreground and background, all that is going on bears meaning and development, it really shows how much passion went into this.The visual language just flows effortlessly and you are never lost, we go through fantasies, an ensemble cast, video cutaways, it all molds into one beautiful story that has something magical about it. It moves your emotions endlessly and makes you get carried away with these people. Even the music, which often in these kind of films results as a kind of gimmick, here it is used to brilliant effect, it molds organically into the narrative and gives "Sing Street" that punch that truly takes your breath away, even though it can feel a little too advanced for its own sake. The thematic exploration in the key of the coming-of-age story is pretty ambitious, the themes range from the complications of love to the wild world of teenage fantasies and dreams, exploring their reflection in reality and the very complicated and bittersweet relation that exists between them, resulting in something that literally everyone can truly be moved by. Still all of that is achieved not only by not taking away the fun of the film, it is actually integrated into that, it in fused into this energetic narrative, with very clear and logical touches, of which the result is a constantly alive film where every action has a thematic effect.The only criticism that "Sing Street" might be subject to is possibly in its overwhelming romanticism. Whilst there is a point to that, I just think that the film world is realized in such a way that where it never oversteps itself and makes for the romantic side being earned rather than forced. It really does turn into almost a modern fairy tale, but it knows that and that is its aim, making the pay off so incredibly effective. There might be a little bit too much hope-fullness in the air, but it is so well portrayed it is impossible to be mad at it.All of these abstract and probably unclear thoughts above are indicative of the power of this film: a piece that emotes even with its smallest and most insignificant moments. A truly original and unseen formula that is as inspiring as it is beautiful. One of the best films of the year and a must see for every single person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sing street is a brilliant, inspiring, feel good film which will leave you pumping your fist in the air once you walk out of the cinema. The movie manages to balance fun, 80's vibe, original songs and a brilliant soundtrack (which is not forced upon us) that makes the viewer feel like they are in the era in which this film was set. Also, the performances from every character were absolutely fantastic from the young acting debutant, Ferdia Walsh-Peelo (who you cannot tell is acting on screen for the first time) to the consistently rewarding Aidan Gillen, who makes the most out of the rather small role he is given. The film is directed and written with a consistent, fast pace yet it allows the audience to digest everything happening on-screen. These characteristics make way for one of 2016's best films so far. My only issue, however, with this film is the stereotypical "bully character" who's arc seemed a little rushed throughout the film as they were trying to conclude the story (still a decent character though).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carney's best film yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'SING STREET': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another comedy-drama musical film, from writer/director John Carney (the man who also brought us 'ONCE' and 'BEGIN AGAIN'). It tells the story of a boy, growing up in Dublin (during the 1980s), who starts a band to impress a beautiful girl he likes. The film stars newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo (in his film debut); and it costars Lucy Boynton, Jack Reynor, Aidan Gillen and Maria Doyle Kennedy. Like Carney's other films, it's received rave reviews from critics, and it's also been a hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well (like Carney's other films).The movie takes place in south inner-city Dublin, in 1985. Robert Lalor (Gillen) sets his family down, to explain that they're struggling financially. In order to save money, he's taking his youngest son, Conor (Walsh-Peelo), out of paid schooling; and he's sending him to a free state-school, called Synge Street CBS. It's a Catholic school, run by a sadistic principal (Don Wycherley). Right away Conor feels like he doesn't fit in. Then he meets a girl named Raphina (Boynton), and he immediately takes a liking to her. In order to impress Raphina, Conor tells her he's in a band. This leads Conor into making more friends, to start the band, and a journey of self-discovery begins. The movie is extremely uplifting, and inspiring; especially if you feel like you're an outsider. Like Carney's other films, the music is really catchy (and well produced) as well. The performances are all good, and the characters are almost all lovable. Carney just seems like a master, at making this type of movie; and I think this is his best one yet!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writer-director John Carney repeats his familiar (Once) boy meets girl rock and roll story in Dublin, Ireland in 1985. The soundtrack features Duran Duran, The Cure, Hall and Oates, and others from that time period. Conor(Ferdio Walsh-Peelo) is a fifteen year old who falls in love at first sight when he spots sixteen year old Raphina(Lucy Boynton) standing on the front steps of a building. He works up the courage to speak with her. She tells him that she is a model who aspires to travel to London and the big time. He says that he is in a band and asks her to star in a music video. The problem is he has no band, and so he manages to gather up some locals and they actually become rather decent musicians and Conor has some talent as a song writer. The rest is fairly familiar and somewhat predictable, but the leads are so charming that Sing Street is worth watching. It is not as good as "once" but Carney keeps the film interesting and the music is not bad, so crank up the surround sound and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boys and Girls on Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really enjoyed watching this I suppose you might call it musical-comedy film set in 1985 Dublin. Mixing in recognisable parts of various earlier films and TV programmes such as, deep breath, "The Commitments", "Gregory's Girl", "Back To The Future" "About A Boy" and even "Grange Hill", you can tell from all of these that we're firmly in teenage angst territory. To be fair, the setting in Dublin doesn't add too much to proceedings as there's no special references to the sectarian divide which was more prevalent then, so that the film could have been set in Anytown, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. However the Dublin placement is as apt as any in demonstrating the outreach of popular music as well as the romance of young folks yearning for a better life away from home and of course the unique Irish accent and humour.Of course a certain amount of stereotypical characterisation can't be avoided in a feel-good movie like this, with the supposedly unattainable dream girl, old-fashioned, domineering school headmaster and lunkheaded bully who all interact with the young lead as he arrives new in school wearing an immediately distinctive pair of brown loafers and who makes it even tougher for himself in a way by going all Robert Smith as he forms a New Romantics-inspired band with a bunch of talented schoolmates and dolls himself up in eye-shadow and multi-coloured hair.Most of the scenes like I said have resonances from the other films mentioned with many of the scenes seeming familiar from elsewhere but there's enough flair, charm and energy to make it pull through and come together. My favourite scenes were the recruitment of the only black boy on the estate, the songwriting sessions with his multi-talented schoolmate and the "Back To The Future" dream sequence but episodic as it is, it's all directed and acted very engagingly so that you accept and acknowledge the sometime clichés as you laugh along with the humour and get behind the teen hero as he chases his dreams of sorting out his dysfunctional family, getting the girl and chasing his musical dream. The ending's good as we're not shown if any of them work out but at least the lad's trying to make a change in his life.The original songs are all very good, if not always strictly in-period, there's little profanity in the dialogue and the acting and singing of the young cast are very good, making it a fun, enjoyable dare I say it, family entertainment movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sing Street: Entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carney's movies are always nice. He does with musicals what Richard Curtis (Notting Hill, About Time?) does with sophisticated comedies: he revitalizes the genre. He writes (and directs) musical films made of good ideas, beautiful people, catching tunes and not-stupid romantic stories (check 'Once', 2007 or 'Begin Again', 2013?).Sometimes the outcome is a big hit ('Begin Again', 2013), sometimes a less inspired production. Sing Street is a nice movie, that introduces a very talented actor and singer (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) and gives the beautiful Lucy Boynton (also probably previously unknown to greater movie audience) the chance to play a major role.The story is rich of events, the characters are nice and the songs are good (and well produced). And the result, once more, is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a joyful upbeat film that expresses youth's unshakeable belief in the power of music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many people, garage bands are synonymous with adolescence and its associated yearnings for identity, independence and fun. The Irish-produced Sing Street (2016) steps into this space with a more complex mixture of ingredients than is usual for such films. Described as a musical comedy, it is also a coming-of-age romance and a period film set against themes of economic recession, family discord and school bullying. Director/writer John Carney prefers to call it a 'stealth musical': one that sneaks up on audiences who otherwise might not choose to see a traditional musical. Whatever you call it, this in one of the most engaging and enjoyable films of the year so far.Set in Dublin during the 1980s, this simple story is told through the eyes of 15 year-old Conor whose quarrelling cash-strapped parents move him from an expensive private school to a local parish school. It is a cultural shock and violence from schoolyard thugs and priests are standard fare for a community where drugs, alcohol and beatings are commonplace. He meets alluring but unattainable 16 year-old Raphina who has left school to become a London model and asks her to join his band (which does not exist). The rest of the film traces the formation of his band called Sing Street and its growth from hopeless wannabes to a credible group of musicians. Unlike traditional musicals where dialogue slips into song at the slightest provocation, the music works naturally both in and for the film to underscore the humour and pathos of growing up. The first-time romance runs parallel to the evolving music while Conor's maturing outlook on life helps him rise above the limited opportunities that Dublin offers.Sing Street has no pretensions to thematic originality and it relies entirely on genre-familiar ingredients. But it soars well above its class because of outstanding casting and a brilliant soundtrack. Conor and Raphina are immensely attractive and likable personalities and their remarkable acting range lets them glide effortlessly from precocious youth through adolescent angst to unrestrained exuberance. They are the soul of the film and become as one with its music. The toe-tapping soundtrack includes Duran Duran, Joe Jackson, Hall &amp; Oates, The Jam, The Cure, as well as performances by the Sing Street Band and others, making this is a joyful upbeat film that expresses youth's unshakeable belief in the power of music. This is a great little gem from The Emerald Isle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It gets a 7 for me and that is good. 8-9-10 are off the charts good. This movie has little scenes that you can not help but look at and see other things. The 2 boys who get together and write the lyrics and music make you see McCartney and Lennon. The lead singer gives you the feel of Billy Joe Armstrong from Greenday. The soundtrack brings back ''That Thing You Do'' but with better songs and background. The boy who plays the older brother is great-- really connects with the viewer, (Jack Reynor) The story...old as time- Boy sees girl and starts band to meet girl. As in most movies the band is quite good. Some good one liners and funny parts, like when the young man is concerned because she may have a boyfriend and says he picked up in a car with music playing. The brother asks what band and he says Genesis, to which the brother says ''it won't last''nobody dates a guy who likes Phil Collins. Overall a good movie and it just rides along...before you know it, it is over. So if you have a little over an hour and a half give it a whirl. The young actors are good for the roles they had and one had a John Cusak look about him-- Like I said it makes you find similarities to other people and subjects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sing Street (2016) Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sing Street is a 2016 drama written and directed by John Carney and starring Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Lucy Boynton, Jack Reynor and Aidan Gillen.Being directed and written by John Carney, the man behind movies like Once and Begin Away, it's clear from the start that music is going to be a huge part of the movie. The story is set in 80's Dublin and follows our main character, Conor Lalor, who, after he has a crush on a girl, he decides to start a band so he can win her over. Even though the plot doesn't sound that original, it's the characters and the setting that really shine in this film. Ireland in the 1980's was a harsh place, with economic problems. Conor is forced to move to a school, where he faces bullying and teacher abuse. Also the state of his family is on thin ice, with his parents being on the verge of divorce.All these things might make the movie seem a tad dramatic, but there is always a light shining on the main characters, mainly from the antics of the band members, how they struggle to film their music videos, and also the romance that's about to blossom between our protagonist and his crush. Also, Conor receives a lot of support and training provided by his older brother, Brendan, portrayed by Jack Reynor. I was a bit skeptic about Reynor, knowing him from the last Transformers movie, but he really does a great job in portraying the older brother who refuses to conform, but is aware of the state of his family, and tries to take care of his brother at all costs. Sing Street is guaranteed one of the best movies released this year, with great characters, epic music, a touch of drama and hints of comedy, with breakout stars like Ferdia Walsh-Peelo and Lucy Boynton. This movie is a must! Final Grade: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely brilliant coming of age film which is at turns hilarious, life-affirming and thought-provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking place in Dublin in 1985, this is an absolutely brilliant coming of age film which is at turns hilarious, life-affirming and thought-provoking. It has a superb script by John Carney which hits all of the right notes and his direction is certainly up to the task. The film has an excellent soundtrack featuring various styles of music from the period such as the Cure, the Clash, A-ha, Duran Duran, the Jam, Spandau Ballet and Joe Jackson as well as original compositions written by Carney, Gary Clark, Glen Hansard and others. However, in spite of the fact that it was likewise written for the film, "Go Now" by Adam Levine seemed like a somewhat awkward fit as it sounded more 2010s than 1980s. The film paints a convincing portrait of dysfunctional families, some of which are considerably more dysfunctional than others. It perfectly captures the essence of 1980s Ireland, which was not exactly a land of opportunity. Actually, Ireland has never been a land of opportunity.The film stars Ferdia Walsh-Peelo in a very good performance as Conor Lalor, a 15-year-old boy who is pulled out of his posh, fee paying Jesuit run school (presumably either Belvedere or Gonzaga) and forced to attend the rough innercity school Synge Street CBS due to the fact that his family is having serious financial problems. Walsh-Peelo is very impressive in his first film role, let alone his first leading role, but he is an even better musician. Incidentally, his elder brother Tadhg was in my year in law at UCD. I don't recall ever actually speaking to him but he always seemed like a nice guy. As Conor's parents Robert and Penny's marriage is rapidly deteriorating, his home life is far from ideal. He finds comfort in his love of music. Considering that his new school has a very different atmosphere from his old one, it is not a smooth transition. In his first week, he is targeted by both the school bully Barry Bray and the sadistic headmaster Brother Baxter, who objects to the fact that he is wearing brown shoes in contravention of the strict black shoe policy. After he meets a 16-year-old model named Raphina, Conor tells her that he just so happens to be looking for a model to be in his band's first music video. The only problem is that he does not really have a band. Thankfully, Conor has made his first friend at the school in the form of a budding entrepreneur named Darren Mulvey, who agrees to manage the band and introduces him to the eccentric rabbit enthusiast Eamon who can reportedly "play every instrument known to mankind."Lucy Boynton is extremely strong as Raphina, a seemingly strong, confident girl who uses her air of mystery and sophistication to mask her vulnerability and inner pain. The band's first original song "The Riddle of the Model" concerns the perception that people become less interesting the more that you learn about them as anything is initially possible (at least in your head). However, Raphina becomes more and more interesting as we learn more about her. She is without a doubt the film's strongest and most memorable character. Raphina dreams of moving to London to start her career as a model, in large part because she desperately wants to escape her often traumatic life in Ireland. Her mother is a manic depressive who is in and out of hospital while her father, a drunkard, was killed in a car accident a few years earlier. In the film's most heart-breaking, gut-wrenching moment, Raphina tells Conor ? albeit not in so many words ? that her father sexually abused her. As a result, he gains a new insight into not only Raphina but his own situation as he realises that his home life is nowhere near as bad as it could be. In comparison to many other teen films, Conor and Raphina's relationship is unusual in that it never goes beyond kissing. In that sense, it is very pure and sweet and, as such, it serves as an effective contrast to Raphina's serious personal problems. I think that Conor means so much to Raphina in part because he is one of the few people in her life who has not taken advantage of her, one way or another.Conor's extremely close relationship with his elder brother Brendan, played very well by Jack Reynor, is just as important to the storyline as his relationship with Raphina. Brendan offers a great deal of valuable advice on both musical and romantic matters. A college dropout, he initially appears to be the stereotypical Generation X stoner and pop philosopher but Carney expertly deconstructs the stereotype by revealing that he regrets his wasted potential. As much as he loves Conor, he is clearly envious of him to some degree as he is the golden boy in the family but he eventually gets over it. Ben Carolan is an absolute laugh riot as Darren, who gets all of the funniest lines and delivers them impeccably. There is an inspired comic moment when he suggests getting Ngig, the school's sole black student, to join the band for the sole reason that it would look cool to have a black guy in the line-up. Mark McKenna is very good as Eamon, Conor's writing partner who becomes his best friend. Aidan Gillen, the best known actor in the film in or out of Ireland, and Maria Doyle Kennedy are excellent as Conor's parents Robert and Penny. The same is true of Don Wycherly as the film's main antagonist Brother Baxter, who physically assaults Conor in a very powerful scene. Ian Kenny is perfectly cast as Barry who, like Raphina, Brendan and Penny, is a far more complicated character than he appears at first glance.Overall, this is an excellent film which is just as effective in its character development as in its treatment of music.</fullReview>

This is much more like it. Boasting a coming-of-age drama as well as a music film, he unleashes some really memorable and likable characters that carry us through this charming, sweet film. I don't think it does anything too extraordinary, and the music isn't to the same level as the music from Once (few music is) but it's really good and entertaining, not to mention very emotionally- investing. That final scene is also really magical and beautiful and surely to resonate with a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good music and setting, but lacks in story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to enjoy Sing Street - what's not to love about a story of a teenage band in the era of some of the best British music? Unfortunately, the overall story disappoints, with a shambling plot, underdeveloped characters and a confusing ending. Mainly it suffers from trying to be too many things at once. Sing Street has elements of kid-vs- bully, kid-vs-bully-teacher, punk-kid-vs-society, kid-vs-parents, kid-trying-to-get-the-girl . . . And then the film surprises us almost at the end by revealing itself as more of a big-brother-mentor story. Too many threads, too many messages. It would have been much better for the subplots to remain in the sideline. That's the magic of film - some small suggestions of the parents' divorce, for example, would have set the scene fine without having to show us everything. If the story had just focused on the one journey of the kid trying to woo the girl, it would have been far more successful. It felt like there was too much unnecessary drama, and too little lighthearted musical fun. As for the characters, the main kid's motivation wasn't convincing. He suddenly decides to start a band with some people he doesn't know, just to impress the girl? And all he knows about pop music is what his brother told him the night before, which he parrots to his new-found friends. If he was a true music lover from the start, perhaps his character would have been more likable and relatable. The other characters are mere cardboard cutouts. Teenage characters can be really cool and convincing, like the hilarious gang in JJ Abram's 'Super 8', but Sing Street's teens had no personality at all. You don't even find out the love interest's name til halfway through, and although she's supposed to be mysterious, it ends up taking away from the character. The ending of Sing Street was unconvincing as well. What, these two fifteen-year-olds are just going to drive a little boat all the way from Dublin to England? This kid who never showed an interest in music at the start of the film is going to try forge a career as a singer/songwriter in London? Sorry, but it was totally unsatisfying. It should have ended with them running away into the night with the city lights behind them, just as the love interest alluded to earlier. There are some cool songs in here, except the finale song wasn't quite as awesome and climactic as some of the others. It was cool to see and recognise bands and stuff from that era, and I guess the film was entertaining. I recommend skipping the intense, uncomfortable drama and just watching the "Riddle of the Model" music video scene on YouTube instead.</fullReview>

It can be summed up in a few words :John Carney strikes an immaculate balance between a light- hearted,funny and feel-good 80s trip and an heart-tugging emotional drama that nearly everyone can relate to in some way, shape or form.There's something for everyone here ; the 80s music, the feelings of trying to woo the girl, trying to become your own person, the list goes on. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is excellent as Conor Lawlor and Jack Reynor puts in a fabulous performance as his older brother. The rest of the cast are fantastic as well if not slightly underused. Lucy Boyton's "Raphina" is a perfect fit for the character, making her mysterious and believable all the time.This is definitely my favourite film of the year so far, and I doubt anyone will come close anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carney now has a trilogy of these "let's make music and fall in love" movies. Sure, they're mostly the same, but they're all delightful. This one is probably my least favorite of the three, but it's still very enjoyable. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo plays Conor, a teen boy with a dissolving family, who ends up in a new school when his parents can't afford a better one. He's immediately the focus of bullying, but that doesn't matter at all when he runs into Raphina (Lucy Boynton, a born star if there ever was one). He lies to her, telling her he's in a band, so he and his friends quickly form one. This film is all about the romance, unlike the previous two films where the romance developed from the music. Yet the love of music is a strong theme in this one, too, with Conor's older brother (Jack Reynor) tutoring him passionately on the subject. And the music the band, Sing Street, ends up creating is excellent, at least if you're cool with '80s music. Carney's trilogy probably represents the last three times I felt I had to buy a soundtrack as soon as I left the theater. I'd be perfectly fine with Carney just hitting these same notes in the future, because they're lovely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem of a movie with heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this John Carney written and directed film, newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo stars as Connor/Cosmo, a young boy whose parents Robert, played by Aiden Gillan and Penny played by Maria Doyle Kennedy, are splitting up and in an effort to save money they move him to a new school, all-boys Synge Street Christian Brothers School, where bullies, including the head priest, conspire to make his already miserable life worse.Noticing a beautiful girl who always seems to be waiting on the steps opposite school, Raphina (Lucy Boynton), he approaches her and when she tells him she is a model he asks her if she wants to be in his music video. To his surprise, she agrees to think about it and this leaves him with a problem, he has to put a band together. His one friend Darren (Ben Carolan), introduces him to loner Eamon (Mark McKenna) a great musician who can help him put his lyrics to some great music, then they recruit Ngig (Percy Chamburuka), Larry (Conor Hamilton) and Garry (Karl Rice), now they have a band.Helped by his brother Brendan (Jack Reynor), he keeps his mind off his parents and school by concentrating on trying to get the girl by putting together a great look and sound, followed by some promo videos. Can Connor/Cosmo lure Raphina away from her older boyfriend and into his arms? There are some great performances from new actors in this film, which produces a feel-good movie with heart. I think Ferdia will be one to watch and Boynton, but for me, his brother stole the movie, Reynor encapsulated the essence of the theme of the movie. With a great soundtrack of both classic 80s tunes and original music (a soundtrack for Sing Street will be available when the movie hits cinemas), this little gem deserves to punch above its weight in among the blockbuster superhero movies of the moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Musical with laughs and heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Maybe you're living in my world. I'm not living in yours. You're just material for my songs." Cosmo (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) By all measures Sing Street is just another teen-band birth in the style of the second British invasion. Difficult love, broken homes, and rebellion are plentiful. However it's not just another cliché because the sentiment is real and the tone light to make a thoroughly enjoyable musical from the pen of writer-director John Carney. His Once set the standard for reasonable romance coming from the street into our hearts.In 1985, fifteen-year old Cosmo (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) switches to a Christian Brothers school because his current Jesuit school is too expensive. The ensuing chaos comes out of his posh look and a disciplinarian Brother Baxter (Don Wycherley), who bans Cosmo's brown shoes (all students are supposed to wear black). The universal truth, however, is that music will transform Cosmo's band, formed to catch fetching, Raphina (Lucy Boynton), by inviting her to act in a video for a band he has yet to form.The feckless parents and the usual bully who changes to good guy make appearances, as do the dorky but lovable band members, a motley crew to be sure. Their diversity, from diminutive dweeb to cool black keyboardist, Ngig (Percy Chamburuka), is enchanting; the creation of songs is gently witnessed, not always an element of any musical history, fact or fiction.Arguably the most endearing relationship of Cosmo's life is with his brother, Brendan (Jack Reynor), who could be Seth Rogan's brother. Brendan is a free spirit who has lost his chance to make it in music but has endless patience with his young brother in providing him the wisdom and means to break loose. His sincere love for his brother is a touchingly true part of an otherwise romantic dream.Mostly the musical emphasizes the mandate for talent to will its way to success, despite the counter-circumstances that keep him home and quiet his talent. London is, as usual, the promised land, even for kids from Dublin, and several times in this romance eyes look across the sea to that great island with its transforming city.Sing Street is a formula and a most enjoyable one. Filmmaker Carney will bring a tear to your eye as the young'uns break from the imprisoning world of broken homes and repressive schools to play the music of freedom.Often cited in Sing Street, "finding happiness in sadness," is a mantra worthy of this musical. I'm not arguing with that cliché because I had too much fun watching it play out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant acting with a tight script along with great music. Not one boring moment throughout and just enough of every emotion you can name without being over the top. The balance of the film is superb never leaving the course of being a class film. Quite simply genius....... Just go and watch and you will relate to this movie in many ways and come away wanting more of this type of film. It shows what you can do without a big budget, major stars or special effects and without resorting to cheap clichés and hackneyed scenes that movies tend to put in to get good ratings. This one is from the heart without any padding and is better for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carney returns to his hometown of Dublin but this time to 1985 with a group of kids forming a band, rekindling his childhood what ifs and wishful happy endings. I adore Carney's inspirational Once (2007) going straight out and getting the soundtrack. Little did I know, that this wouldn't be the only music masterpiece Carney will come out with. I missed Begin Again (2013) but this urges me to now watch it. We follow Cosmo, played excellently by newbie Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, who gets moved from his expensive school to the Synge Street Catholic Boys School due to his parents struggles. What appears to be a step backward eventually turns into an accidental chain of events leading to the formation of a band called 'Sing Street'. It's all about the girl, and isn't it always? Social Network tells us Facebook came about because of a girl, James Cameron tells us the Titanic sunk because of a girl. This girl in question is Raphina, played by the gorgeous Lucy Boynton who is little older than Cosmo but with boyish creative courage, their relationship blossoms as he forms a band to impress her. The film started to remind me of The Girl Next Door (2004) with Cosmo being Emile Hirsch, Raphina being Elisha Cuthbert and Paul Dano being Eamon who's played by Mark McKenna who, incidentally doesn't like acting. Chris Marquette would be Darren who's played by the tiny yet confident Ben Carolan and the minions from Girl Next Door making up the rest of the band. The colourful, misfit characters are greatly portrayed including keyboardist Ngig, Father Baxter, Bully Barry and other band members Garry and Larry whose bass is larger than him. Raphina quickly becomes his inspiration though never openly admitting to it (us boys are stupid) and he gets great words of wisdom from his older, drop-out, stoner brother, Brendan played by recent Tranformers starrer, Jack Reynor. His script is incredible, especially his 'paving the way' speech, thought he looked like a hippy Irish version of Chris Pratt. I don't think he can escape that and don't think it's a bad thing. It brought me back to my childhood, reminded me of all those teenage crushes, the lengths boys will go to just catch a glimpse and the heartache that came with it. That innocent attraction without any sexual tension. The chemistry between the two, both together and alone is superb, see Raphina's reaction to Cosmo's love letters disguised as songs on a cassette. As with all of John Carney's films, the soundtrack is amazing, the songs written and performed solely for this film are catchy and brilliant. Accompanying is a range of eighties classics that older brother, Brendan uses to educate Cosmo with. Adam Levine returns writing 'Go Now' for the film's end credits. If there's one thing Carney is truly passionate about, it's real music. Street music. The singer/songwriting and what goes on behind these extraordinary artists, earning Once an Oscar and Begin Again nominations. It's his key material and he does it so well. It's touching, emotional, inspiring and empowering. A definite feel-good movie about boy meets girl that tackles the bullies of life and all in the name of love. Certainly loaded with a cast of actors I'm going to be watching out for. Great gig Sing Street, great gig. One moooore! One mooooooore! Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 8 Script: 9 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 10 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being full of heart, reminding me of what innocent attraction felt like and for an epic soundtrack. 91% 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I the only one with issues with Sing Street?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen some comparisons with The Commitments for Sing Street - an Irish musical so I understand the comparisons. However, even though The Commitments had ten main characters all of them have screen time. Unlike Sing Street- only 2 members of the band are given any screen time.The other 3 members of the band are glossed over. The black member of the band is ONLY asked to join the band because of his skin colour. The other 2 brothers could have provided so much more.The main female character in the movie - I only registered her name in the second half of the film - but the songs are catchy so it's fine, right??So many underused actors/characters. It's clear the director has a close bond with his brother. It's shown between the two brothers in the movie and hat the film is dedicated to brothers - then what's the point of the sister in Sing Street? What was her name again? Racist and sexist. And a waste of talent.But catchy tunes, right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been lots of great Irish films in recent years but, in my opinion, this is not one of them. I just found it so hard to believe virtually every aspect of the story. There were some fine performances by young actors but there were also moments of strangely exaggerated emotions. If you enjoy the film I'm happy for you ... but I fail to understand!IMDb requires that reviews have at least 10 lines of text (strange) but I cannot write more about this production without giving away part of the story and without picking out the flaws in some people who may not be ready for such criticism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate 80's music, but I love this movie. It captures the innocence of making music for fun and romantic profit.It's not realistic, it's not historically accurate - but it is FUN! Probably 90% of humans felt bullied by someone in school, this flick turns that resentment on it's head! It has a lot of "style", and substance: broken home, broken school, broken town, broken country - what's a kid to do? Form a band that's what! The dichotomy of one brother who got beaten down by the "system", and one who fought back the only way He knew how is the underlying theme! For all of Us who ever wondered about the girl who got away, because We weren't cool enough - this is Your Movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Musical Trip Down 80s Memory Lane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this with "The Commitments" in mind, hoping it would be nearly as good, and it was. Not nearly as raw, gritty or with as much forward motion as its predecessor (my rating = 9), but an always interesting tale.As a 80s child, this was a musical trip down memory lane coupled with a the enjoyment of being in on a budding musical career, even though it was fictional. The characters mostly all rang true, although some of the insights seemed a bit far fetched for teenagers.There wasn't a whole lot of conflict throughout, so there were a few slow periods, but the film was nicely paced in total.The heroine of the film reminded me of Ione Skye (where are you?), which added a feeling of 80s realism in addition to the wardrobes and music, and the red-headed kid reminded me of a fellow I knew in high school, so I kind of felt like I knew these characters.Overall, a very enjoyable film with very few missteps and a hopeful ending that at that time and place in history (and in the film) actually seemed to make sense for the characters involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I could have been that kid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of I could have beens in this movie including mine after I've seeing it. Makes me pick up the guitar again.The first one is the the elder brother Seth Rogen jet engine scene, he could have been that kid if he only had the discipline to pursue the dream.the second is the drunkard father who smacked the bully for not respecting the power of Rock and Roll, because the father, probably, could have been that kid if he only had the discipline to pursue the dream.the third one is after the movie when the credits were rolling, I realized that the director too could have been that kid, actually he wrote the songs in the movie, ergo, he actually is that kid.and the fourth one is me picking up the guitar again, because I could have been that kid and there is still hope, I could still write and play the guitar.There are so many lessons in this movie. To continue life and rise to the top, in spite of being bullied.To walk the walk and talk the talk, to pay your dues to play the blues. The importance of discipline for music beginning at early age, good parenting in spite of being a single mother, displayed by the guitarist's mom.brotherhood in music, multiculturalism.the capo was only seen clipped twice and never seen again, because hey, you are not John Denver, kid. You're in a Rock and Roll band.Songwriting and the importance of jamming.The end of the movie probably paid tribute Jim Morrison, Jim's father was a ship captain and he rebelled against his father's parenting style.quoting from the wiki:Morrison's early life was the semi-nomadic existence typical of military families.[48] Jerry Hopkins recorded Morrison's brother, Andy, explaining that his parents had determined never to use physical corporal punishment such as spanking on their children. They instead instilled discipline and levied punishment by the military tradition known as dressing down. This consisted of yelling at and berating the children until they were reduced to tears and acknowledged their failings. Once Morrison graduated from UCLA, he broke off most contact with his family. By the time Morrison's music ascended to the top of the charts (in 1967) he had not been in communication with his family for more than a year. A very good movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the coolest story of a misfit who meets a girl and starts a rock band to impress her. That in itself made it pretty awesome.I'm a huge fan of movies about Rock and Roll and this movie is that. It goes from the start of the band, just a group of misfits who found other misfits to play music with. One of my favorite parts is watching them come up with original songs to play.Also like the story about the bond between two brothers, one who is descent for greatness while the other knows that his brother is descent for greatest and encourages him to see it through. I was not to keen on the boy meets girl story and I also thought the songs were not the best, but it's still a great story about a band.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Futurist Band Forming"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sing Street" (2016 release from Ireland; 105 min.) brings the story of Conor, a 15 yr. old boy. As the movie opens, we are reminded that this is "Dublin 1985", and we see Conor strumming the guitar in his bedroom. At dinner time, Conor's parents inform him and his older brother and younger sister that Conor is being transferred to a Catholic school to save money. Conor has a hard time adjusting to the new school environment and is picked on by another boy. Then one day, Conor notices a girl across the street. He gathers all his courage and asks her to be in a video for his band. When she says "okay", Conor realizes that he needs to out together a band, on the double! At this point we're not eve 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest music-related film from writer-producer-director John Carney (Once; Begin Again). In fact, one can make the argument that "Sing Street" is the spiritual prequel to Once, as "Sing Street" looks at the life of 15 and 16 yr olds as they are starting to make decisions for themselves and trying to make something of their lives. And what better motivation to start a band than to impress a girl! Carney nails the musical landscape of the mid-80s in Ireland perfectly. "Thursday, 7 pm, It's Top of the Pops!" screams a voice on TV, and we witness Duran Duran's "Rio" video. When Conor struggles to recruit like-minded kids for his band (called Sing Street), he posts fliers in various locations, "Futurist Band Forming". And how might such a futurist band sound? It sounds remarkably like Duran Duran-meets-Franz Ferdinand (check out first song "The Riddle of the Model"). While much of the movie is light-hearted, Carney does not forget to shed light on some darker aspects of Irish society (mass-migration to England; stoner older brother is college drop-out, and of course the role of religion (Catholic, specifically) in society. But in the end, it's all about the music. Carney co-wrote and co-plays on all the new songs with Gary Clark, and Once star Glen Hansard is listed in the credits as one of the studio musicians. Last but certainly not least, props to the performances given by the two leads: Ferdia Walsh-Peelo as Conor, and Lucy Boynton as 16 yr. old Raphina. Ah, to be young and having your whole life ahead of you... Bottom line: this movie is sheer exuberance."Sing Street" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at was PACKED, I am happy to report (perhaps the lousy weather had something to do with it). I had a smile on my face for much of the movie. If you are looking for a feel-good movie that happens to showcase a lot of great music, you cannot go wrong with this. "Sing Street" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

All day long I listened to cassettes on my Walkman, I know the words to all the songs. I went to a tough school, but the masters at Connor's school were off the Richter scale. I am glad I didn't grow up in Dublin. I felt the movie was relatable in so many ways. The family situation, survival against bullies, finding your voice. The organic development of the band, how such diverse characters came together, pure magic. I was impressed by the insight into the problems of a first born child. Connor's brother did pave the way for him and coach him honestly and with great love. The music was unique, I really loved the slow song at the dance.

		<shortDescription>"Sing Street" is a Beautiful Modern Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carney's "Sing Street" is a masterful modern musical. It delves into the relatable complexities of aspiring talents everywhere. It is a fun, engaging, charming, and often beautiful reflection on what goes through the ever-changing minds of those who want more in life. Carney's previous efforts are all in the similar vein of hopeful desperation, but something about the youthful approach in this film makes it stand out as an absolutely must-see.The film follows Cosmo, a 15-year-old guitarist. As his parents enter the final stages of a troubled marriage, Cosmo is sent to an All- Boys Irish-Catholic Preparatory Institute. This new school is strictly run by Brother Baxter, who leaves no room for personal endeavors into one's soul. That is, until one day, when Cosmo first meets Rafina. An eccentric and perplexing character, she embodies the idea and beauty of chaos (something that the refined find ever so appealing nowadays, it appears). But more importantly, Rafina is the catalyst for Cosmo to pursue some sort of artistic endeavor in his life, and begin to explore his greater expressions. In an attempt to woo her, Cosmo creates a ragtag band with his fellow cohorts, a selection of hilarious misfit students. From here, the film delves deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of love, music, art, and the pursuit of happiness.When "Sing Street" works, it works. The film is composed of simplistic cinematography that helps capture an enlightened look of (often gloomily portrayed) Ireland. The performances are all superb, especially the chemistry between the lead performances of newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo (Cosmo), and the beautiful Lucy Boynton. The supporting cast is great, but the best moments often come from the under-utilized fellow band-mates, who are hilarious. Most importantly, the energy of the original music, and the scenes enveloped around the various compositions, are beautiful. Every song is fitting for the era, and deeply meaningful. I suspect this soundtrack will go very far in the future. The peak of this film falls in the end of the second act, during a well-crafted fantasy sequence for Cosmo, as he pictures the young, charming, musician ideals. He imagines performing to an energetic prom-night crowd, all set to the theme of "the dance scene in Back to the Future." He pictures Rafina coming in to dance, the crowd parting ways, and everything being resolved in his life. But as the song finishes, his fantasy ends, and he returns to the bleak reality of the world around him.These beautiful moments are littered throughout the film, and make it all the better. Unfortunately, I have two major qualms with this film. First and foremost, the performance from Jack Reynor as 'Brendan,' Cosmo's elder brother, who acts as a secondary catalyst for Cosmo's interest in music, is mediocre at best. Despite a hilariously well-written character, Reynor's attempt at an Irish accent often slips in and out of authenticity, and makes it very distracting to believe in him. The second critique I have regards the clichés of modern romance films. Rafina is first presented as a strong, independent female. She desperately wishes to leave the clutches of her home in Ireland, to sail to the shores of Britain, and pursue her dreams of being a model. And despite these strong ideals, she is reduced down to a Siren for Cosmo. Their affection for each other is palpable, but in the end, her dreams are set aside. She becomes a weak, secondary character.Why this peeves me so much is that I have seen this before. Millions of times. I could list off film after film after film where a male character is introduced to some amazing female figure, strives for her, temporarily loses her, but after some time, they reunite. It's so beyond cliché at this point, that I want something more real to happen. I had hoped the film would have taken a more cynical or realist approach, and have Rafina leave the island for good, off into the world to pursue her dreams of becoming a model. This loss would have been a more connectable motivation for Cosmo, and to see his music to take form. Per typical romance film clichés, though, this was not the case. The two get together, and live happily ever after. Overall, "Sing Street" has the potential to be a classic coming-of- age film for future ages. But more importantly, this film is a perfect musical. The age and days of the American musicals are done and over. "West Side Story" is gone; "Chicago" and "Oklahoma" can remain places on a map. If "Sing Street" gives us any sign on the new musical approach in film, we are in great hands. There is a beautiful line in the film where the sinister Brother Baxter, after forcing Cosmo to wipe away make-up from his face, says to him, "No more Ziggy Stardust." And, as sad and timely as that statement is (Rest in Peace Mr. Bowie), it's true. The time for classic music and artistic expressions of the past have come and gone. But what lies in their wake, and what rises from the ashes, is something to be excited for. I would give "Sing Street" an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to love this film. But, this movie is possibly one of the most overrated films of the year. Prior to watching the film, I was quite excited to see the new John Carney film. Two hours passed and I sat there in my seat, cringing at the film's atrociously clichéd ending. I loved the first half of this film, tapping my foot to the great soundtrack and relishing the lively characters. But when the second half of the film began, I started to cringe, roll my eyes and sigh at the sheer lack of energy it had. Without spoiling anything, I can say that the ending is the worst part of the movie quality wise.Moving on abruptly, onto the filmmaking, this film is relatively well shot and directed, with some interesting choices with framing and the use of hand-held shots as well as some VHS footage to boot. The soundtrack was fantastic and upbeat, with great songs to move the film along. The dubbing was pretty shocking. As a musician myself it was more than obvious how bad this dubbing was, with the drummer on-screen hitting a ride cymbal when the soundtrack was playing a hi-hat etc. The screenplay was mostly competent, but had some cringe-worthy moments when it came to dialogue. The editing was quite good too, yet not anything noteworthy.I would say that this film is almost like 'Me and Earl and The Dying Girl' meets 'School of Rock'.I did not personally enjoy this film, yet I was still entertained. The first act is considerably better than the film's unsatisfactory second and third act. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves classic rock and pop music or anyone who wants a light watch with not much to think about.That said, this film is a 5.5/10 for me. You're better off watching Hunt For The Wilderpeople or Swiss Army Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A charming movie from Ireland about a half-dozen Dublin boys at the Synge Street Christian Brothers School who start a band. We sort of know this story. We've sort of seen it before. But the freshness of the acting make it fun all over again. Conor Lalor (brilliantly played by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) is a new student at the school and the adolescent boys there plan to make his life miserable. Life at home is bad, too, with his parents fighting and splitting. A real place, the Synge Street CBS has a long history, and this movie takes place in a time of pupil loss and relatively low achievement (a line in the credits mentions that the school is "not the same place" it was in the 1980s, when the film is set). The first scene of Conor in his new classroom shows the elderly priest who is their teacher, hearing aid dangling, writing on the blackboard with his back to the pupils who are creating holy hell. The principal steps inside and the students stand to attention. The principal glances at the board and points out to the teacher that in this class he is to teach French, not Latin. Teacher: "French. How modern." The school's Latin motto "Viriliter Age" ("Act Manly"), is translated by Conor's older brother as "Rape your students." In short, the school is chaos. Conor channels his creativity toward writing songs and creating the band, Sing Street. These musical ambitions have a lofty goal: impressing the older teen girl, Raphina (played by Lucy Boynton), who stands near the school every day and claims to be a model. If she is a model, and if he has a band, she can star in his music videos! Simple. The fact that he mostly carries it off is wondrous, resulting in a feel-good movie about a collection of near-misfits who make music work for them. The band's songs are by Gary Clark, lead of the 1980s British band Danny Wilson, and it's good. We don't know how Conor hears it, but what he sees in terms of music video potential is the pole star he's determined to follow?and take Raphina with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film so far of the year that will be an academy award nominee. It was corky and just full of heart and great music. Sing Street is pushing the PG-13 rating to a R rated film, but it was still a really good film. The acting was absolutely flaw less from start to finish.It had a lot of good music in it that is still in my head this minute. I bet Sing Street will get nominated at least for 8 Oscars and 9 Golden Globes.Now parents there is a lot of rude and sexual content in this movie that could be effective on the little ones. The main audience I think is older teens and up from what I saw at my showing of this masterpiece. This will be a movie that will be a film of the century and empire forever it was great GO SEE IT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Optimistic and well paced but rather standard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is one film that is getting quite a bit of recognition straight out of Sundance. While it didn't come to many theaters, the general consensus is that it's pretty great. So, naturally, I went in with high expectations. However this film is unfortunately quite standard. It's about a young man who finds a girl that he likes. She tells him that she is a model, so to get her to notice him he says he is in a band and wants her to star in a music video. Of course he isn't actually in a band so he recruits some kids for said band and they start writing some songs. From here the film follows a pretty cut and paste love story formula. The only thing really new is the music.Which was pretty great. The soundtrack in the film is one of the better ones that I have heard all year. With its main characters being in a band the music can not only accompany a scene but can interact with it. The lyrics in many of the songs are written by said main characters so they obviously directly correlate with what we are watching on screen. Then are the songs that just in the film to heighten a scene.Those songs are pretty great as well. Another interesting aspect to the film is the cast. Most of which are all but unknown. And for the most part they do a pretty decent job. There are a few of them that struggle but thankfully those actors screen time is held to a minimum. But the ones that do a good job are all the more impressive because the amount of the different things they have to do.They don't have to show a whole lot of range though, because this film is on the optimistic side. There aren't many moments of conflict in the film and that works for the most part. It keeps everything very upbeat and crowd pleasing. That being said, whenever it does try to introduce conflict or stakes it doesn't land very well. Which mainly encapsulates this movies entire B story.The B story mainly follows our main characters struggles at home. Where his parents and brother are going through an existential crisis. This side story doesn't pop up all to much through the movie so when it does it feels oddly forced and cliché. It's nothing we haven't seen before and it doesn't do much to change that. This has mainly to do with all side characters being flat as a board.There isn't anyone outside of the main few characters that are even remotely compelling. While this mainly affects the B story, the main story we have isn't really that great either. This doesn't have to do with the bland characters or it's abundance of optimism, it has to do with the overly familiar plotting. The whole, trying to impressive a girl with something your not story has been used hundreds of times over.It's hard to call this movie good when it doesn't offer anything interesting with its story. Its characters are fairly bland, the story is overly familiar, and it doesn't have any conflict to really get you invested. But Its cast and soundtrack are good and there's a decent message embedded deep in there somewhere. While, I may not enjoy these types of feel good movies but if this kind of film appeals to you, you'll definitely have a good time with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's very best. By all means GO SEE IT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SING STREET (2016) **** Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Aidan Gillen, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Jack Reynor, Lucy Boynton, Kelly Thornton, Ben Carolan, Mark McKenna, Percy Chamburuka, Conor Hamilton, Karl Rice, Ian Kenny, Don Wycherley, Lydia McGuinness. Wonderful coming-of-age romantic comedy about a Dublin teen (Walsh-Peelo, a cross between Paul McCartney/George Harrison and Colin Hanks) during the 1980s who attempts to fit in his new Catholic school when things go from bad-to-worse with his family forcing him to come into himself by forming a musical group while falling in love with the local babe who wants to be a fashion model (beguiling Boynton). Filmmaker John Carney hits all the right marks from the motley crew assembled as bandmates and friends, to the way of the trendy times of the era (the look and feel are dead-on accurate) and populated with jukebox fervor and passion. The original songs are catchy and fun (best bit is the fantasy take on Back To The Future's Enchantment Under The Sea homage!) and the film will have you grinning from ear to ear from the get-go; one of the year's very best. By all means GO SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vapid Teen Flick Devoid of Real Musical History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that the usual slew of paid shill IMDb reviews are in, it's time for the sober minded crowd who actually care about the music of the eighties, and film, to set things straight.From the moment the all knowing, witty mentor of an older brother tells our little 15 something hero and his father that Duran Duran is an artistic statement that belies criticism and is conquerable to The Beatles, I knew something would be sorely remiss here. In fact, Duran Duran seems to be the sole band of any real importance to the eighties if you fall for this ridiculous film's 'perspective'. I can even see a wry little uncomfortable smile on Simon Le Bon's face (whom I have met), as even his ego would allow that such comparisons are ludicrous. Oh yes, sorry, I get it now. He has been assured royalties from a whole new generation being sold his music as a result of this crappy teensploitation film.Where are bands such as The Clash, who after all, were voted the most important band of the eighties by Rolling Stone - despite their already breaking up by 82? It is quite obvious that his movie intentionally glosses over any of the truly revolutionary artists of the UK eighties wave, such as Elvis Costello, The Stranglers, The Pretenders, The Police, The Specials, Joy Division, and so, so many others that simply do not exist in this telling of the tale to a new generation.Perhaps these bands would be too dangerous an influence (certainlyThe Clash) to let today's teenagers in on?Okay, there is one snippet of a Clash song, and maybe a couple other decent tracks quickly used, but without mention by name of anyone of importance except... Duran Duran. Oh, and Hall &amp; Oates do get treated to the same sort of rip off song writing created by some professional song ripper offer paid by the film producers, that are barely acceptable as music except that they are such accurate rip offs - which of course our 15 year old hero is supposed to have written with his musical cohort who okay, kind of looks like The Edge... but once again, forget U2 even being mentioned by these Irish teenagers in 1985. Hmmmm.Jokingly, they recruit a token black band member and whereas this could have been a great vehicle by which his character would develop and show them up for their stupidity... in fact he remains exactly that. A token black cast member without any real dialogue. Wow.The 'love interest' between a milky faced 15 year old and a mid twenties actress (playing a young girl) too, whose character wants to 'get into' modeling and looks more like she's almost too old for prostitution is just bewildering to me. How can anyone take it seriously? Both characters obviously have little in the way of real love for one another, but simply find each other advantageous and desirable for their own self images. Perfect brain washing for today's teens.Because yes, although compared naturally by many to The Commitments, which is a real story that can be enjoyed by anyone who loves good music, this is blatantly targeted solely at today's teenagers who will find a 15 year old boy being persecuted for wearing heavy make up to school so close to their own painful deeply significant struggles today... To any adult who was there though, and cared about it, it is a criminal whitewashing of musical history. One I submit is not without intent on the part of the film makers.The final scene is absolutely priceless though. It's as though these film makers wanted to end by showing how ridiculous the whole thing has been all along... and to think you lasted to this final absurdity of an ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read reviews and thought oh goodie, 80s music. The only tunes I recognized were Duran, Duran; Hall and Oates. The rest I'd never heard. The actors were good, the cinematography and sound good. The storyline was interesting and I liked the characters. However, the whole film was presented with so many negativities, some downright nasty and hateful that is was depressing. And many lines were obscured by heavy accents which made it hard to understand at times just what was going on. I was also disappointed to see so much smoking; I do believe our consciousness was already raised about the evils of tobacco during that era that it was not quite that prolific. I stayed till the end altho tempted to leave earlier but really cannot recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>
