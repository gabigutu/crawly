		<shortDescription>Hilarious, oddly influential dark sports comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mostly hated by critics on its release, as much for its cynical viewpoint as its relentless profanity, "Slap Shot" has since become something of a cult classic.Set in the low-rent world of minor-league hockey, the movie follows the efforts of player-coach Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) to turn around the Charlestown Chiefs' final, losing season in a dying Pennsylvania steel town. Reggie is not above using a dirty trick or two to manipulate his teammates or psych out opposing players, and cheerfully gets physical when he has to. Even Reggie recoils in disgust, however, when his tightwad manager (Strother Martin) brings in the Hanson Brothers, three thick-lensed, thicker-headed goons who are more interested in fighting than playing Reggie's brand of "old-time hockey".When it becomes apparent that the hometown crowd loves the Hanson's rough and bloody style, Reggie decides to go with the flow, and to fire up his other players concocts the story that, if they can win the championship, the owner will be able to sell the franchise to a group of rich retirees in Florida. To do that, though, they will have to get past an opposing squad specially stocked with the league's most notorious goons...A sometimes uneasy blend of slapstick and kitchen-sink realism , "Slap Shot" has some pertinent things to say about the American worship of success at all costs, and (long before the rise of the WWF) our fascination with violent sports. Echos of its gritty style can be seen not only in many later sporting films, such as "Bull Durham" and "Major League", but even in the wave of British movies in which characters fight to hold onto their lives after the collapse of hometown industry, such as "The Full Monty" and "Brassed Off".The film really shines as a straight comedy, though, delivering some classic characters and set pieces: virtually every appearance of the Hansons; a clueless, toupee-wearing sportscaster (Andrew Duncan); the team's tiny Quebecker goalie (Yvon Barrette), and Newman himself, in one of his personal favorite roles. The females fare less well, although Jennifer Warren stands out as Dunlop's long-suffering, estranged wife.Note: in the VHS version, the background music has been replaced by an inferior, generic soundtrack. The DVD version, with the original music, is preferable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old-time hockey at its finest!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw SLAP SHOT; I laughed so hard that I thought I was going to puke. The best thing about this movie is that all the banter between the players, the attitudes, and the jokes are ALL TRUE! I worked in the locker rooms for a minor-league hockey team and I saw every character in this movie: the aging veterans, the eccentric goalie, the lazy pretty-boy, the young players looking for a chance, etc. It is so true to life and accurate, moreso than any other sports related movie out there. And having all the actors do their own skating is a big plus also. I really can't find a fault with this flick.And for my most favorite part of the movie? No question it is Moe Wanchuck! I have yet to find a character in any movie that everytime he open's his mouth, I go into hysterics. Along with Chunk from THE GOONIES and The Dude from THE BIG LEBOWSKI, Moe is up there towards the top of my list of favorite characters in any movie I have ever seen.You know you have a classic film when the topic of SLAP SHOT comes up with your friends, or even people you have just met, and you spend hours reciting all your favorite quotes, trying to out-do each other. Do yourself a favor and see this movie so you can be part of the fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one belongs on the list of the greatest sports comedies ever made. The humor (and the language) is some of the saltiest you'll hear in a movie but it doesn't seem excessive at all. This tale of a minor-league hockey team having one last go at greatness is boisterous and bruisingly funny, even if you don't care for the sport itself. As the aging captain of the team who's constantly amazed at the crazy happenings around him , Newman is at his roguish, charming best. Rent it with "The Longest Yard" for a perfect double-bill. A four-star **** classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>C'mon, this is pure comedy. No breaks, no lull parts just funny all the way through with the appropriate cheesy 70's soundtrack. This movie not being in AFI's top 100 comedy films is a travesty. If they want a period piece this was it. They sighted Fast Times, it just stands to reason that Slap Shot should fall into the listing. The Hanson's deserve special consideration. The casting is perfect</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a @#$% time machine back to the 70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in south 'jersey when the Flyers were still the Broad Street Bullies and all lived on our side of the Walt Whitman Bridge. They had handlebar mustaches. Many spoke with thick French-Canadian accents and wore wide ties, jackets with lapels you could park a truck on, and more than the occasional leisure suit. Many were just kids when they were pulled from the farmlands of the North and found themselves in the middle of suburbia by day, and at night, playing "Old-time hockey" while the chanting and organ music echoed to the rafters. Now whether you played pro hockey like they did, or were on the semi-pro Johnstown Jets that inspired the crew here, there seems to be a prototype player who played a certain style of game for the rest of us to watch. Sadly, that era is long gone. Marketers and big business have left the game in smoldering ruins. But we still have Slapshot. It perfectly captures what the game used to be and the guys who used to play it. Paul Newman is incredible as Reggie Dunlop, the aging player-coach who seems to be the last guy to figure out his team is on the verge of folding. The fictional town has hit the skids so that means no more hockey team. But instead of going out with a whimper, Dunlop has a scheme to get his crappy team back in the standings and the fans in the stands. And as the plot develops there's locker-room talk that would make even today's teenagers shut up and take notes. Nancy Dowd's story, which she wrote after seeing her brother Ned play in the minors during his career (and parody in the movie as Ogie Oglethorpe) translates into a total classic. The raw banter between Newman and his GM, between the players -- literally all through the movie -- makes for the most quotable flick I know...but I have to be so careful where I can recite my favorites. One such place was out on the fishing boat of a hall-of-famer from the old Flyers. (It's rumored one of the characters in the movie was modeled directly from HIM.) Slapshot brought even this guy to his knees with hysterics. Just rehashing a few quotes from the movie triggered his REAL stories of his own team that won the Cup two years in a row, and then never again since. That's how well the movie tells the story of hockey. There's a lot of social commentary here, too, if you are into such a thing. Lots on relationships, male bonding, machismo and the like. Some of the subplots take the story off the ice for too long, and the movie tends to drag in spots, admittedly. But when play is on, the brutal scenes reach such a sublime level of violence all you can do is gape and laugh in astonishment. The players here have all become like Reggie himself: They don't seem to notice that they've gone too far and they are creating a goonathon just to fill arenas. Meanwhile, those with real talent get benched right along with the national anthem. It's pretty clear -- both on the screen and during the times when the movie was being made -- that Old Time Hockey was on its way out. But it didn't go with a whimper, either, and at least Slapshot was there to give it a send-off to remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have played goal for 32 years.. On many of the men's rec teams I STILL hear someone say: "How about it tonight, guys? Old time hockey?" and everyone yells : "Pi** on old time hockey!!!" then "Eddie Shore???": "Pi** on Eddie Shore!!!" It still gets a laugh in the locker room!The goalie being allergic to the fans is a quote from my favorite pro goaltender: the late Jacques Palante.. He was allergic, he said, to the Toronto Fans.. and would often sit the bench.You can tell the actors are having fun making this movie.. it comes thru loud and clear!Another locker room favorite that has survived is when you ask another player getting dressed what he is doing.. He might just answer: "Puttin' on the foil, want some???"I've even been told on occasion that my wife is a lesbian as a joke! She ain't but I often react with mock anger and dash out of the net.After a bad game where my defense let me down I told our coach in the locker room : " Trade me right fu***** now!!" (and the player to my right said "Now hang up")A movie that survives this long after release is is is .... A CLASSIC!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie That Started It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you look back at all the outrageous sports comedies this is probably one of the first. It has set a new standard for comedy across many movies. With Paul Newman in here he kind of gives this movie a soul. Maybe not a great one, still something is in here. Lately there have been many sports comedies such as Dodgeball, Balls of Fury and many of Will Ferrell's movies. Yet none of them, except maybe Dodgeball have reached the originality and such witty lines from Slap Shot. I think this movie really has something more to it than just the comedy. It actually displays the faults in hockey and professional sports in general. It really shows that to many owners that the idea of having a team is like a cool new toy. All kids eventually get bored with toys and give them away or just throw them in the trash. This is exactly what we see in Slap Shot with the owner, she just plays with all their lives and can just make them a simple tax write-off. It also shows the desperation of the players. Paul Newman talks about going out with style about as soon as hears scout are at the game he quickly goes back to the team's brutal and dirty tactics (This made out to be a hilarious scene). The difference between this and other sports comedies is that it actually has a lot of realistic situations ( THough sometimes exaggerated). I would definitely recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every hockey fan I've ever met, no matter how pedestrian, identifies with this profane, but prophetic 1977 cult classic. SLAP SHOT perfectly nailed the circus we know of as the now-defunct Johnstown Jets: a former farm team of the World Hockey Association's Minnesota Fighting Saints. Real life is truly stranger than fiction, but SLAP SHOT seems to combine the best of all worlds.As legend goes, screenwriter Nancy Dowd got the brainstorm of doing a documentary on minor-league hockey, spending a few months in Johnstown, PA with her brother Ned Dowd. Ned, who was working his way up with the Jets from the U.S. college ranks, toward the WHA Minnesota Fighting Saints, was Nancy's inspiration for Michael Ontkean's Ned Braedon character.Nancy, whose 1979 screenplay for "Coming Home" would cop her an Oscar, was like a fly on the wall when all of these bizarre events began to play out before her eyes. She managed to capture "the spirit of the thing" and compose what is surely one of the most spectacular sports film plays in the history of cinema.As the storyline in SLAP SHOT was true to life, names had to be juxtaposed to protect the innocent. The Johnstown Jets became the Charlestown Chiefs. Real-life Minnesota hockey-playing siblings, the Carlsons became the Hansons. Real-life player "Killer" Hanson, inspired the "Killer" Carlson character. Brophy, the tipsy captain of the Hyannisport Presidents was so-named for juxtaposing with the Reggie Dunlop character, allegedly patterned after a career minor-league player named John Brophy, who went on to coach the NHL Toronto Maple Leafs.Everyone who lived in the seventies reported sightings of one incarnation or another of toupee-wearing sportscaster Jim Carr. And when it comes to sports-writing, Reggie Dunlop said it best: "If Dickie Dunn wrote this, it MUST be true!" Some of the classic character names in this film must be honored also: Barclay Donaldson, Tim "Dr. Hook" McCracken, Andre "Poodle" Lucier, "Ogie" Oglethorpe, Ross "Mad Dog" Madison, Clarence "Screaming Buffalo" Swamptown and Gilmore Tuttle.With all the other strokes of brilliance and genius SLAP SHOT has become famous for, we cannot forget the contribution of the star Paul Newman, who is believable and sympathetic as washed-up Chiefs player-coach Reggie Dunlop.Minnesota native, the late George Roy Hill, who also directed "The Sting" and "Slaughterhouse Five," could arguably claim SLAP SHOT as the master stroke in his illustrious career.Miraculously, several stars of SLAP SHOT would go on to make other hockey movies: Yvon Ponton starred in the French-Canadian TV series "He Shoots He Scores" and the "Les Boys" film series; Paul D'Amato starred in "The Deadliest Season"; Jerry Hauser appeared in "Miracle On Ice."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the knocks that has always been given to Paul Newman was that he was not right for comedy. When you're talking about stuff like A New Kind of Love or Rally Round the Flag Boys that's probably true. But Slapshot shows that what Paul Newman needed to be good for comedy was something not quite so sophisticated.Slapshot ain't Oscar Wilde, but it's not quite to the level of the Police Academy movies. It's just right for Paul Newman as the veteran player/coach with a team of misfits from one of hockey's minor leagues who's forever looking for a break from the majors.The Charlestown Chiefs who seem to be the hockey equivalent of the New York Mets are having a perennial losing season. The town itself is one flush away from despondency with a mill that was the main employer in the town shutting down. That means the paltry attendance the Chiefs already have will diminish more. It's an uncertain future.So with nothing to lose, Newman's boys turn the sport into a hockey facsimile of the World Wrestling Federation. In no other sport are fights among the players so accepted. But Newman ratchets it up to an exponential level. And his team actually starts to win and the Charlestown Chiefs become a gate attraction. There's a lot more to the resolution of the team's problems, but that championship game is unforgettable. All Hail the Brothers Hanson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate hockey film, a resounding success as both drama and comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a dismissive response from critics on release, "Slap Shot" has become THE hockey film everyone knows and loves, and it's easy to see why. It's also easy to understand its initial reception. The film is perhaps excessively profane, it doesn't really seem so today but taken in the context of the time one could easily see it as straining for shock value. Paul Newman's least classy role for sure, and George Roy Hill had made some big movies before this one.Of course there are still plenty of people who accuse this of being vulgar, crass, cartoony trash. The comedy is, sure. But it's also good at being what it is in that regard. Kevin Smith is making a hockey movie about the goon era of hockey based on the Warren Zevon song "Hit Somebody!". If that isn't a rehash of "Slap Shot" I'll eat my hat. The humor is pretty much exactly Smith's style. I expect far more sentimentality from him than "Slap Shot" offers, though. Still, it's GOOD lowbrow humor, with the occasional clever bit that keeps it afloat. Incredibly sharp, memorable dialogue as well.But what really sets "Slap Shot" apart from most sports flicks to me isn't the comedy, it's the drama. The characters are convincingly-drawn, even the ones which exist purely for comic relief. Nancy Dowd was a good writer and George Roy Hill was a great director. Together they found a perfect balance. Sure, you can watch this movie and laugh and get wasted with your buddies after a hockey game one night, but there's so much more to it. I find it works remarkably well as an examination of the society and community which the sport creates, and which lives around it. The portrayal of marital strife and a town in the midst of economic meltdown is tremendously affecting, the character's relationships and Reggie's story being the film's greatest achievement.It's also a great examination of hockey, a sophisticated debate over what hockey is or should be. A recent survey found 99.5% of NHL players were in favor of keeping fighting in the game, but that's to the extent that it exists today. How many would want the goon era back? There are still people who 'watch hockey for the fights', "Slap Shot" seems to acknowledge that the goon era reduced hockey to nothing more than a freakshow. The WWE on ice. Don't get me wrong, I'll jump out of my seat with the rest of the crowd if a fight breaks out, but never have cared for hockey as played during the 70's in the US, with violence as the main attraction. The movie does away with the verbal arguments about the nobility of the sport for a comic finale, but even that makes its point quite clear. The very last scene of the film, the ambiguous ending, is even greater.Great director, great cast, great writing. That's the recipe for a great movie. "Slap Shot" most certainly is one. Gene Siskel's biggest regret as a film critic was giving this a mediocre review on release, as he came to absolutely adore the film on repeat viewings. I think it's easy to mistake this for just another sports comedy, but there's so much more to it, and if you can't see that... well, I feel sorry for you, but to each their own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slap Shot is truly the greatest sports film of all time. It took a serious issue, such as violence in hockey and showed exactly what it did to the sport. With subtle humor, it shows that violence in hockey has made a mockery of the sport. At the same time, a clever story which also includes a sports issue that is rising to importance in current society is included. Owners versus players. Another serious issue is the fact that Charlestown (think Charleston West Virginia) is dying, as the region has been in real life.All the subtle humor (Ned the gambling winner, homophobia, drunkeness, hockey wives missing husbands, the Canadians totally out of place, strange promotions, the ignorant stupid sportswriter, and the oblivious sports commentator) blended with the physical humor (the hansons flipping over the hotel guy, the 70s styles, hockey puck to the head of the organist, mooning the chiefs protestors). Its a perfect blend of hilarity and yet a perspective on life as it is. I own the movie (and have a poster with the Hansons on it) and I have seen it a million times and I havent found a better sports movie out there. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilariously raucous and raunchy sports comedy treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wonderfully wild, riotous, raucous and raunchy humdinger about the blithely amoral do whatever you gotta do in order to win hyper-masculine sports mentality was an undeserved box office bomb when it was first released in '77, but has since rightly amassed a sizable cult following which considers the film to be one of the best, funniest, most gleefully rough'n'rowdy sports comedies ever made.The Charleston Chiefs are a strictly mediocre hockey team who invariably lose one game after another. Audience interest in the Chiefs is rapidly dwindling and their no-account, conniving cheapskate owner Joe McGrath (an excellent, uproarious comic turn by the late, great Strother Martin) informs them that their current season will also be their last one. Paul Newman gives one of his finest, most enjoyably down'n'dirty performances to date as Reggie Dunlop, an aging, womanizing, chronically infantile veteran player/coach who leads the team on a sudden winning streak by inciting his crude, childish, insecure fellow players to use every last petty, loathsome, audience pleasing illegal trick in the book when playing against rival teams. Pretty soon the Chiefs are back on track and on their way to a big championship game with Reggie's formally sagging career on the up and up.Directed in a terrifically adroit and punchy fashion by George Roy Hill, who makes the most of Nancy Dowd's coarse, astute, smack dead on the money barbed script, edited with fluid swiftness by Dede Allen and shot with tremendous invigorating élan by Victor Kemplar (the bang-up all-out hockey games seriously smoke), this boisterous and often sidesplitting dilly offers a marvelously pointed and frequently hilarious critique of the puerile, silly and actually quite pathetic overgrown kid mentality evident in both the fiercely competitive athletic macho guy mentality and cheerfully dumb, maturity be damned bull-headed machismo in general. However, despite the picture's acrid edge, the Chiefs still manage to be a nice, charming bunch of idiosyncratic manly man bozos; my favorite moment is when our jock heroes occasionally make a few raw, angry comments about a soap opera they're all watching together in a bar! Moreover, the cast is uniformly first-rate: Michael Ontkean as a touchy college grad who disapproves of Newman's boorish tactics, Lindsay Crouse as Ontkean's fiery, irascible, dissatisfied wife, Jennifer Warren as Newman's patient, neglected wife, Melinda Dillon as the flighty Suzanne, who's one of Newman's many sexual conquests; Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson and David Hanson as the moronic, barbaric, bespectacled Hanson Brothers (watching these geeky maniacs pulverize the opposing teams with their ferocious anything-goes tactics is an amazing gut-busting sight to behold), M. Emmet Walsh as local sports journalist Dickie Dunn, Swoosie Kurtz as one of the player's chatty, catty wives, Andrew Duncan as smarmy, motor-mouthed hometown sports announcer Jim Carr, and Paul Dooley as a rival team's hometown emcee are all fantastic. Ontkean's climactic striptease on the ice rink is a definite comic highlight. Brash, profane and hysterically unruly, "Slap Shot" overall rates as an absolute hoot and a half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hockey is the only sport where you beat the crap out of and curse each other for seven games in a playoff series and then line up at center ice to shake your opponents hand, while telling them how much fun it was to play with such gentlemen. This movie is about that time in hockey, old time hockey, when bloody fighting was a necessity. It's a comedy. Look no further than Paul Newman's stylish duds to solidify that statement. Yellow leather? It is also crass, crude, and bloody. It is hard to pinpoint who will like this movie. It ranks number 31 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Greatest Cult Movies, so it will surprise you for better or worse. I had to watch it twice. I was a little dejected by the fact that the on ice striptease was performed by a man, but the payoff, that it was fine family fun when they were fighting and disgusting when the stripping began, is a great jab at the sex and violence debate. It's also just damn funny, especially when the band kicks in, playing that old stripper anthem. Da da da, da da da da da. Da, dun dun, da da, dun dun, da da, dun dun.Reggie(Taunting a goalie): "Your wife is a lesbian! A lesbian!!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Newman is the coach of third rate failing minor league hockey team, The Charlestown Chiefs. The town is hit hard by unemployment and this appears to be the Chiefs' last season, however, if the coach can whip up the team up into a winning frenzy, then the unknown owner might just find a buyer and save all their carers? The management bring in three odd looking brothers who, once unleashed, take the whole team on a blood thirsty winning streak right to the championship final. The crowds flock in thirsting for more blood, but then the problems start to arise.Slap Shot is a tremendously funny film, it's also incredibly violent and often vulgar in dialogue, but be sure to know that both things go hand in hand here (or should it be glove in glove?) to create one of the smartest sports pictures in the modern age. The hockey sequences are excellent (especially to a non fan like me), and the script bristles with course and biting humour. Slap Shot on its initial release was frowned upon by many critics, it was considered too profane and overly harsh with the win at all costs theme driving it forward. However, it's now rightly embraced as the smart and intelligent piece that director George Roy Hill wanted it to be seen as. A new generation of movie fans have started to seek it out and its reputation and fan base grows ever more larger by the year.Newman was a bona fide star, his hair silver grey but his good looks still firmly intact, his performance has a grace about it that oddly sits nicely amongst this cynical stab at professional hockey; even if his characters' clothes are, in truth, icky. It would be a big disservice if I didn't mention the impact of the Hanson Brothers, surely one of the finest combinations to have ever graced a sports movie? They are at once unassumingly likable, the next gleefully violent, they are the glue that binds the whole picture together. Film is filled out with sparkling support work from the likes of Strother Martin, Michael Ontkean, Jennifer Warren, Lindsay Crouse and Jerry Houser.Not long after originally writing this review, the legend that was Paul Newman sadly passed away, he left behind a movie legacy that few can touch, and trust me, this is one of them. A sports movie that never gets old and continues to pay off on repeat viewings. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Foul mouthed (this was one of the first films ever rated R for the language alone) comedy that has held up beautifully over the years. The story concerns The Charlestown Chiefs a minor league hockey team thats on the way out. The coach, played by Paul Newman doesn't want it to happen and so he takes matters into his own hands in order to assure that the team's attendance goes up and they have a shot of playing on. There's much more going, I've forgotten to mention the infamous Hansen brothers, three guys who a few short of a dozen but can fight and play hockey like nobody's business. A hysterical adult comedy, this is also one of the great sport films of all time. The film works, and has held up over the past 30 years, because the film is ultimately not so much about the jokes or the hockey, but about the characters and for the most part you'll like everyone of them. This is a wonderful movie. Just keep it away from the kids if you don't want them to pick up some very colorful language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Slap Shot, a hockey club hires a trio of thugs to beef up its mediocre hockey team.Fresh and unexpected, this is one of the best of Paul Newman's mid-period movies (also note "The Drowning Pool"). Set vaguely in Canada or upstate New York, the picture loses steam in the second half and gets bogged down in soap opera; but the memorable first match appearance by the Hanson Brothers--the aforementioned thugs--is a magical movie moment, not to be missed."Slap" takes the time to investigate an array of pro sports themes: sadistic player violence; boorish sexuality; fan behavior; fan loyalty to athletes and vice-versa (or total absence thereof); the bloodless, detached world of athletic club ownership. But the film is better than the snide satire it has been portrayed to be, and in its own manic way, it conveys much of the joy of sports.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underdog story about a team that plays to reach the top in a immoral way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a hockey comedy and I can see why this movie is known by some people as one of the best hockey movie that adults and probably teens can enjoy. It just has certain elements that make it a cult classic. But I don't know, maybe this movie just wasn't for me because I didn't find it all that enjoyable, it was entertaining. But just didn't meet the hype that I was expecting from this cause just about every movie critic seems to have enjoyed this. The plot is about a constantly losing hockey team run by Reggie 'Reg' Dunlop(Paul Newman) and the team is hated by everyone because of there constant losing streak. But soon the team builds a reputation for being hockey goons and some dislike them but they also gain a lot of fans and most audiences want to see them play. So basically they turn hockey into WWE smackdown on ice and the audiences just seem to enjoy watching violence more than a game of legit hockey. And Dunlop is all for this because his team is starting to get popular. And there is bunch of comedic moments thrown in between or in the game. Paul Newman was good in this as a carefree coach that just wants his team to survive and get popular over how good the team is in hockey which makes him some enemies. His carefree but ambitious attitude just worked well in this flick. Despite it not feeling all that engaging for me as an audience or feel really connected to the team or anything like that or most of the characters. It does have legit aspects to it, since there is no special effects and everything that happen on screen is basically real. Now like I said I can see why this movie has elements that make it a cult classic but I can also see why this movie would appeal to small audiences. It just isn't a movie for everyone, but for those that like the 70's feel and nostalgic elements during the 70's and put together in a well crafted manner...You just might really enjoy this flick. I just thought the build up was pretty weak and didn't feel emotional or anything like that or even wanted to root for the main team and it's not because they are hockey goons.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie got bad reviews,when it was released ,way back yonder ... yes I know this. The reviewers are simple minded folk. The fact is this movie is a spoof, an enigma , simply, a caricature of hockey and sports and life in general. What a genius flick. I truly mean that . Every scene was thoughtfully done with ironic splendor. From the last scene where being nude is a MOCKERY... LOL, but shedding blood is not. Paul Newman gave a great acting performance . This movie rocks and I especially love the scene where Paul Newmans character parades into the lady owner of the Chiefs and declares they are 'human beings'.... thus human beings that are predatory animals . This movie was simple yet deep. Deep and hilarious, can't beat that. This movie was , in fact, a microcosm of life in general. This showed human emotions beyond the realm of sports and hockey of course. Simply put , a very underrated movie and a classic to be sure. The Hanson Brothers were fantastic and really the wild card of this movie. I felt this movie has stood the test of time and the fact is the critics have been silenced because this movie is a classic and one this guy can watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, I needed one complete viewing just to get a load of Paul Newman's wardrobe! Checkered pants. Fur-lined jacket. Buff leather jacket and matching pants. Great artists sacrifice for their art, and Baby Blue Eyes certainly does so here. Dropping a few F-Bombs must have been nothing to him after dressing up like that.It's for a good cause. "Slap Shot" is an enjoyable, one-of-a-kind sports film. Like many other sports films from the 1970s, such as "North Dallas Forty" and "Rollerball," there's a strong focus on how athletes are used and abandoned in a capitalist society, but the message here is leavened, and largely bypassed, by the over-the-top humor, courtesy of Newman, Strother Martin as a shyster owner, and a team full of colorful misfits led by three brothers named Hanson whose thick Dilbert glasses and love for toy race cars doesn't distract them from committing felonies on the ice against their fellow men."Slap Shot" is about as much a guy's movie as can be, so naturally the screenwriter was a woman, Nancy Dowd. She wallows in all the profane banter, casual misogyny, and random acts of brutal violence in a way that might play a bit on the page like "Clockwork Orange" but is saved by the film's amiable humor and sense of fun.The darkest thing about "Slap Shot" is the premise. The Charlestown Chiefs, a minor league hockey team, are about to fold, and player-coach Reggie Dunlop schemes to turn his motley crew into winners by getting their blood up, along with their fans, by transforming them into thuggish winners to attract the attentions of an outside buyer that might keep the team running in friendlier climes.As played by Newman, Dunlop is very likable in his rascally ways, even while taunting a goalie about his lesbian wife for a cheap score. Newman throws up some vivid detail in this scene and others that must have caused a few people to blanch when "Slap Shot" hit theaters in 1977, but his banter is perhaps a bit less scandalous today and the movie as a whole seems to be improving with time. It's about the only thing out there, other than maybe "Youngblood" and "Miracle," for hockey-loving moviegoers, and it remains the most popular, perhaps even best take on one very odd sport.The film is disjointed, though, with a strange subplot about one player named Braden who resists Dunlop's "gooning it up" and Braden's long-suffering dipso wife. The story here seems to strive for pathos a bit, and to give us something other than jokes, but as the pair are played by the unlikeable Michael Ontkean and Lindsay Crouse, it's hard to care much about them or how they turn out. They only slow down every scene they're in.The film scores better in the dramatic department with Dunlop's attempts at winning back his estranged wife. Dunlop's sincere in this, but easily distracted both in his machinations to save the team and by all the easy quail he finds on the road. One of the best things about the film is that it doesn't tie this plot thread up so neatly."Slap Shot" works best as a comedy. Like when Dunlop blackmails the owner's identity from Strother Martin, or how one mild-mannered player transforms himself into a guy named "Killer" who shows up at the big game wearing a Dracula cape. There's a driver who takes a sledge hammer to the team bus to "make it look mean," assorted opponents who look like they escaped from "Oz," and especially the Hansons, who are used very well because they are used sparingly.Director George Roy Hill was never wedded to any one style, and this is as far as you can get from other films he made that same decade, like "A Little Romance" and "The Sting." He does very little to dress up "Slap Shot," even the credit sequences are perfunctory, but he knew how to make a good movie, and did so here. If you don't mind sports films that are a little raunchy and mean of heart, you will be entertained by this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when Slap Shot came out; all my friends saw it and said it was great, but mom wouldnt let me see it due to the amount of profanity and other unsavory parts of the film.So, I had to wait until I was much older to see it, some 20 years after release. What strikes me first about the film is how how low budget it looks - very much in keeping with team and the town it is set in. Its the gloomy 1970's in factory town, and like in a Bruce Springsteen song, the factory is closing down, with rumors of the team moving to Florida. Newman's own (ha) character, Reg Dunlop, is too old to be playing but doesn't have a great record to make him a desirable coaching candidate. So, changes are made...It's a fun movie, but also very much about the human condition - limited success in life, bad relationships, bad choices. Throw in the Hanson Brothers, a nutty Quebecois Goalie, a profane pervert and a college boy and you have a colorful cast of characters.Oh, and if you think the violence is a bit overrated, a couple of years ago I was treated to a minor league hockey brawl in Jacksonville, Florida where the Orlando Defenseman actually BIT a Jacksonville player and was suspended for 5 games.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason or another, I felt I had to rent the movie Slap Shot. I really don't know why but Saturday afternoon was spent watching it instead of doing other more important (?) things.This film came out in the 70's at about the same time as the Philadelphia Fliers (more to the point the Broad Street Bullies) were using the same rough house tactics as was depicted in this movieOne of the big jokes that came out at this time was "I went to the fights and a hockey game broke out".This movie comments on the life of a hockey player and what goes on behind the scenes in the front office as well as how hockey players are at the mercy of the owners. The owners can do just about anything to make a buck and the poor hockey player is just a piece of meat. Maybe the baseball players have the right ideas as far as being free agents after a specific period of time.Some of the funniest scenes are with those Hansen brothers chewing up the rink, the opposing players and the opposing fans. I'd like to see the scene where they are coming into Hyannisport on the buses, being met by irate fans and the busloads of hockey players and the cheering sections pulling moons out the windows, happen in actual fact.The piece de resistance is the final strip scene on the ice. It made about as much sense as all the fights that were and had been taking place in all of the games with the new Charleswood Chiefs. Simply amazing!!!!!This movie is a must see for just about everyone--if you don't mind the swearing and brief nudity and explicit language and violence. It's just a comment on the reality of a hockey player's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Canadian friend of mine recommended me this movie as one of his favorite comedies. Since he loves hockey, I did not give it much thought. But, eventually, I rented it.It stunned me. This is a movie that is just too smart for its own good. A fabulous script that any studio nowadays would reject. This is a film that an be read on so many levels. A jewel of American film that has been disregarded by critics and audiences. By the reviews here, it seems even hose who love it might not have seen how deep this movie goes.This is a movie that is in the comedy genre, but just as with Chaplin's films, it switches back and forth to drama, too. And just as with The Great Dictator, there's a huge irony and social criticism behind it.On the surface, it is a comedy about a small losing hockey team and how they turn their luck by the use of violence. With this new tactic, they end up attracting fans, critics and disorienting rivals as the team rises to the top. The characterizations are vivid. Paul Newman's character is given a true motivation behind his antics: to win back his wife, who is about to divorce him. This is all standard Hollywood stuff, but still is some of the best. The scenes are terribly realistic, the dialog is never direct but subtle, and the comedy, except for the fights in the ice, is never played for laughs. There's excellent slapstick humor, but there's also some great lines that fans of the movie will probably repeat forever. The main characters are so real that it feels you can touch them. Paul Newman's role is a complex one and this is one of his best performances I've seen from him, with many facets. Both manipulative, romantic, womanizer, workaholic, leader and father figure. And the other characters share also that complexity: the other players, his wife and the wives of others, the team manager/agent, etc.But... this is just the surface. Sure, violence in the NHL may not be such a hot topic now that new rules have been put in place and sanctions have become more severe.But it is the secondary themes that really earn this movie my respect. It is in these areas that it has aged so well. In some aspects, it is even more important today than when it was made. The isolation of the wives of the players, enduring cheating and struggling with drinking and divorce. A real reflection of the dark side of our society then and now -- an analogy of the struggle between work and family, between professional and personal success. There's a good punch aimed at the sports media, another topic that could not be hotter in a time where basketball, football and even golf players are quickly turned into movie stars.Watch this movie once. Watch it twice. Watch it several times. It will keep getting better each time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild, woolly, insanely homophobic but lots of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another film directed by George Roy Hill, one of the best Oscar-winning directors (THE STING) who is barely (and unfairly) forgotten, a man of great style and humor who deserves far more credit than many of his flashier contemporaries (check out his credits on IMDb). Paul Newman gives one of his wildest, most delightful performances as the crafty, foul-mouthed, aging player/coach of the Charlestown Chiefs, a failing ice hockey team that is energized when it starts playing fast, loose and dirty. Hard to forgive the homophobic, guys-will-be-guys language, but but it's still pretty funny, and Newman gives it his all. And what ever happened to sensitive, hunky Michael Ontkean, a Canadian actor who showed amazing promise, but whose subsequent film choices (VOICES, WILLIE AND PHIL) pretty much killed his future starring career. Strother Martin, one of Hollywood's most popular character actors, was always fun to watch, and the on-ice pummeling keeps the action moving. And three cheers for the Hansen brothers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like offbeat sports comedies like 'The Longest Yard' or 'Bull Durham', or if you like the irreverent realism of a movie like 'Mash' and haven't seen Slapshot...you are in for a real treat. Although the aforementioned titles still pop up on TV periodically, and I even caught the similarly gritty, rowdy cult classic 'North Dallas Forty' on a premium movie station recently, unfortunately Slapshot seems to have disappeared from cable TV. Like many of the other forgotten classics from the 70s (the greatest American movie decade ever), Slapshot, which contains so many great lines and satirical scenes, should go on the need-to-rent list.Paul Newman plays Reggie Dunlop, the aging player/coach of a third-rate minor league hockey team the Charlestown Chiefs. Reggie has been chewed up and spit out by life and as the film starts, his team of misfits is losing on a regular basis. Attendance is down and the news comes out that the local mill is closing and this is going to kill ticket sales. Reggie sees his playing career (as well as his marriage) is about over and figures the only hope is that the team can get sold and relocated. This is going to require a winning streak and it just so happens the chiefs general manager Joe McGrath (the incomparable character actor Strother Martin) has just finagled a deal for three near-adolescent, coke-bottle glasses wearing brothers name Hanson.In one locker room scene one of the veteran players ask the Hansons what they are doing as they wrap their hands, one of the Hansons answers "putting on the foil". At this point Reggie is appalled and swears these guys will never leave the bench. Its funny to watch all the players reaction to the Hansons and when Reggie finally gets desperate enough to put the Hansons in a game -thats when the fun really begins. To say the Hansons are dirty players is an understatement, and that initial scene where they hit the ice is hilarious.So Reggie suddenly changes his tune and decides the chiefs will become the dirtiest, rowdiest team in the league. Before long they are on a winning streak and rumors start floating around about the team being sold to some buyers in Florida. One of the great, cynical scenes in the film is when Reggie finally meets the teams female owner (Kathryn Walker) and finds out the truth. It's not a politically correct scene by any stretch, but its a hoot and sets the stage for the third act.Newman's performance hits the mark(as usual)as Reggie, and Micheal Ontkean also scores as the brooding Ned Braden. Braden had formerly been the chiefs golden boy before the change, he doesn't like the chiefs new "image" and his playing time has been cut. Ned also is having problems with his wife (Lindsay Crouse) and this sub-plot with Ned forms the basis for the rousing, crowd-pleasing finale.In the climactic game between the Chiefs and Syracuse, the top team in the league, we find out that Syracuse has brought in some thugs of their own and the result is literally a riot! This is when both Reggie and Ned see their fates converging and both see the foolishness of their lives and their decisions; -Reggie, for his abandonment of "old time hockey; Eddie shore" and Ned, for abandoning.. his life, and his wife. Reggie probably can't save his own marriage, but he may yet save Ned's.The final scenes on the ice bring together both the insanity and the redemption in a heartwarming and still uproarious montage. It's a very satisfying conclusion and one more reason I score this so highly.For as funny, cynical and satirical as Slapshot is in its best moments...for example, when Reggie keeps buzzing past the opponents goalie disruptively shouting "your wife's a lesbian!...she's a lesbian!"...it also finds a way move us...high praise indeed for a sports comedy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best "real hockey" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slap Shot has to be the best pretrial of hockey in a movie, the great Paul Newman is Reggie Dunlop, the player/coach of a pathetic minor league hockey team the Charlestown Chiefs. His career at a standstill and his marriage in tatters, Dunlop has nothing to lose by taking on a new group of players who are one evolutionary step above Neanderthals. Only when the team begins winning does he decide to get behind these players, and to encourage the rest of the team to play as down and dirty as the newcomers do. Straight as an arrow team member Ned Brained (Michael Ontkean) resents this influx of goons, preferring to play clean. Dunlop does his best to keep the upset Braden on the team. Slap Shot is the sort of film for which the "R" rating was made, it is full of profanity. The Hanson Brothers will make you laugh these guys are hilarious goons. Slap Shot is a good movie for 1977 it is still the best hockey movie I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had only heard of Slap Shot as a hockey movie with Paul Newman in it. Boy was I in for a surprise. In the opening faceoff, Newman is told by the center of the other team he will pee on himself if he gets checked. Not much into the game, Newman sends a guy out there to promptly hit him. The profanity count rises throughout the film along with the hijinx done by the Hanson brothers. The Hansons make the team, as well as the movie, click. Solid film, unlike its sequel 20 years later. My advice: buy it on VHS, DVD, or catch it on premium cable. The edited version takes all the fun out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slapshot is my favorite sports movie for a lot of reasons, but the one that sticks out the most is this: it is not like every other run-of-the-mill sports films. Unlike Major League or Unnecessary Roughness [both of which I like], it isn't about a bunch of misfits who stink but then find the will and way to win. Slapshot is about a bunch of guys who have the talent to win but can't, but eventually find the way. In the first game, we see that Ned Braden is the league's leading scorer. A few guys speak little English, which would add to their troubles. The team had some hope. Yes, it wasn't until the Hansens showed up that the team started to win, but the Hansens brought in a whole new aspect to the movie: to play fairly and lose, or to play the dirtiest hockey ever and win the whole thing? Another thing that makes it great is that its not a pro team, instead its a minor league in some part of America, we don't know where. Another great thing about Slapshot is that the only person you've ever heard of or seen before or after is Paul Newman, who isn't even the most popular character! Newman is excellent as the aging coach/player who wants one more chance before his idiot owner sells the team or puts it into bankruptcy. This is the best hockey movie, [The Might Ducks offer little competition] and is a cult classic that any sports fan will love. There are so many great scenes in the movie, from Newman taunting a goalie by calling his wife a lesbian, to the infamous "the stupid machine ate my quarter!" line, to anything the Hansens do on the ice. This is a great movie that is severely underrated. A true sports classic, I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie caused some change of attitude toward Paul Newman by his fans. Newman using prolific vulgarities and scheming dastardly deeds on the ice is pretty far out from his norm. He is great. His mean spirited and sneaky deeds turn out quite humorous. A failing ice hockey team led by playing manager Newman is on the auction block. Three geek-like brothers come to the team and are well practiced hoodlums on the ice; they also help turn the team into a gang of thugs hated by the rest of the league.Included in the supporting cast are Michael Ontkean, Jerry Houser and Strother Martin. The classy Jennifer Warren is Newman's estranged wife. David Hanson, Jeff Carlson and Steve Carlson play the three brother wrecking crew.Strong language and moderate well placed violence prevail; but the dark comedy itself sells the movie. Paul Newman like you have never seen him before, but hey that's alright! He pulls this one off as smooth as ice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Takeoff On Goons In Hockey, But Be Warned About The Language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to shake my head watching the outdoor NHL hockey game on New Years Day this year (2008) at Buffalo. In between periods, NBC announcer Bob Costas reminisced about his favorite sports movie. It was this one: "Slap Shot." Although I did enjoy this movie 30 years ago, I can't say I echo Bob's sentiments today, but I laughed along with him when it came out in 1977.It seemed that films in the '70s were either outrageously good or ridiculously sleazy regarding language, sex, or irreverence. Most tended toward the latter. Many movies - like this one - had tons of overdone profanity, As for sports movies, none was more profane than this one which, in essence, was a real takeoff on goon style of hockey. Kudos for that, and the NHL finally woke up 30 years later and cleaned up its sport.After not seeing this in over 20 years, I was shocked it looked and sounded so seedy with almost every sentence seemingly having a cuss word!. It sounded like slob-like Animal House mentality on ice skates. However, I do admit there were a lot of funny scenes and I'll always remember the Hanson brothers, along with Oggy Ogglethorp." If hearing the Lord's name in vain constantly doesn't offend you, you'll get a lot of laughs out of these characters, on and off the ice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slapshot from 1977 is one of the best hockey movies ever. It strikes a chord with me because I associate hockey with tremendous skill and excitement as well as respect and community spirit. At heart, Slapshot is about those same values. The storyline is a team's struggle to survive when the closure of a steel mill threatens the existence of the town and its hockey team. The 1970's obsession with goon style hockey offers the players hope that they can use such tactics to save their team and their jobs. The team leader Michael Ontkean and the player-coach Paul Newman are at odds with each other over the strategy. Both have strained relationships with their wives because of hockey. There are Canadian elements with games against Canadian teams and stereotypes of French Canadian hockey players. Paul Newman drinks Canadian Club. The Canuck touches are clearly to draw interest and chuckles from Canadian audiences. I thought the Hanson brothers were great with their thick horn-rimmed glasses and geeky behaviour, who are treated as "retards" but inspire everyone with their skill and enthusiasm. Other touches are the surprise scene at the end by Michael Ontkean. The plaid clothes and hair rugs herald back to 1970's fashions. The whole thing is totally dated but this snapshot movie from the 1970's is part of its charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slap Shot (1977): Dir: George Roy Hill / Cast: Paul Newman, Strother Martin, Michael Ontkean, Jennifer Warren, Lindsay Crouse: Hilarious hockey comedy about taking chances. Paul Newman plays Reggie Dunlop, an older coach and hockey player whose team, the Charlestown Chiefs are at a losing streak. Dunlop is manipulative and uses various tactics to ensure a win, including making remarks about a goalie's lesbian wife. Eventually he hires the three Hanson brothers as a trio of goons who delight in brawling on the ice. This sparks interests from fans as well as a winning streak. George Roy Hill hit big with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting and here again directing Newman at his best. As Dunlop Newman struggles in balancing the future of his team with his wife. Strother Martin plays the team manager who is about to cut the team loose until Dunlop brings on his newest brand of manipulation. Michael Ontkean plays Ned Braden who desires to be a real hockey player and avoid the antics his coach pushes him to do. Jennifer Warren plays Dunlop's wife who is tired of her husband's antics and inability to balance time with her. Lindsay Crouse plays the depressed wife of Braden. She has resorted to drinking and steering clear of Dunlop's advances. While the humour is questionable in terms of the merits, the film succeeds in showcasing a harmless sport becoming a media frenzy brawl. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be completely honest, "Slap Shot" would've charmed me simply for being a hockey movie. We could do with more of those, without Emilio Estevez. But it earns its place among the better (best?) sports movies not for having underdog skill, a committed dream or thirst for winning, but for dabbling in the gutters of blue humor and distilling the sport down to its most low-brow of beer-guzzling violent fun. The closest thing I can think of to compare this to is "Major League", which is a compliment unto itself.Even if you don't like the sport, the movie is absolutely worth your time for an unusually profane (and always likable) Paul Newman and for the psychotic Hanson brothers.Thoroughly entertaining.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is all around exceptional. It has a fantastic performance by Paul Newman, a character that he said was most like his personality in real life (I think I read that somewhere). It's a movie about hockey, and violence, and relationships, and fighting, and sex. It has a large amount of swearing, so if you're put off by swear words you might want to stay clear.It has it's fair share of violence, so if you're put off by violence you might want to stay clear. It has some nudity, so if you're put off by nudity you might want to stay clear.It has hockey action, so if you're put off by hockey action you might want to stay clear. I really identified with the guys on the team.. The swearing reminded me of the years I played in minor hockey (this was one of our favourite movies back then), and I know what it's like to be on a losing team that is going nowhere. If you like sports movies, good old fashioned 70s movies, Paul Newman, swearing, nudity, violence and hockey then this is the movie for you. You might even get to see a drunken girl driving like a maniac in her van.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite sports comedies - a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hockey is my favourite sport to watch, pretty much the only sport i really watch and am into. I love reading and watching movies about it.Slap Shot is the classic hockey comedy. Directed by George Roy Hill and starring Paul Newman, the film follows a minor league hockey team known as the Charlestown Chiefs who after hearing they will be folded by the end of the season decide to play more violently/dirty in order to attract more popularity.The film has some very funny moments, great performances and is a must-watch if you're a fan of ice hockey or even a fan of sports films in general.This film, Goon and Puck Hogs are the only R-rated comedies about ice hockey I can think of.The sequel to this film is nowhere near as good and I haven't even bothered watching the third film as its Rated PG and seems to be more like mighty ducks, even though I do love the Hanson Brothers.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this again, made me realize, just what a great if uniquely natural actor we lost. I'll be honest, I don't really like films, centered around sport, especially basketball or golf, although I did like Blue Chips and Caddy shack. What makes Slap Shot a winner, owes much to it's script, that really screams profanity, and doesn't mind getting bloody, hence the R rating, with comedic themes, and great characters. The Chiefs, a dying ice hockey team, led by Reggie Dunlop, (Newman O,naturel and great) earns their wins with dirty plays, instigated by insults, towards the opposing team. Slap Shot also has another plus: The Hanson Brothers, savages, who join Reggie's team. They also brought their little toy cars, and train set, which I guess, really makes them unique. The only guy, not for the dirty play is Newman's second man, Braden (Ontkeon, who's cheating on his average looker of a wife (Crouse, who's so entertaining, thanks to her anger) We have an older randy player, who likes to ramble on with old tales, as well as some ethnic players, one not really getting the character exposure he should of, while the other one, opens the movie, in what you could say, is a funny and hurtful interview. Why I like this film so much, to me is an enigma. I guess partly, it's because the players really get bloody, where the blood looks real, but too, like I said at the beginning, a lot of thanks, goes to the screenplay. We have two young female fans, in matching attire with matching hooters. One scene has Newman, going off at a would be female representative, who folds, as she can make more money the other way, thus making Newman spout an unsavory remark, firily, about the woman's little boy. We pretty much know how the film ends, with that "last game must win", scenario, only this victory doesn't go the way you think. Newman's performance really pulls you in, and there's fine work, from veteran, M Emmet Walsh, as a sports writer, while other performances from our other playes (double meaning) captivate too. Slap shot is a well made sports film, just as good now as it was then, comedy with does of drama then blend beautifully, with a great beating music track, attached. Definitely one for sport movie fans, regardless of the movie's age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and again, a movie comes along late on a Friday night being aired on some obscure cable channel that pulls you in and keeps you there, despite the premise being something that interests you less than collecting rocks - and Slap Shot is one of them.Paul Newman plays Reggie Dunlop, an ageing Ice Hockey coach who is torn between a genuine love for his soon to be leaving wife, and an undying love for the game that has allowed him to remain a child all of his years. On the back of a series of heavy defeats, he decides to tear up the rule book and bring what is described as 'aggressive hockey' back to his side of dysfunctional misfits, the Charlestown Chiefs, in order to draw attention to the side in the vain hope that the team won't be foreclosed along with what appears to be the entire town.That's the premise, but what lies beneath is something incredibly fantastic; a genuinely funny, raucous and carefree movie that has clearly benefited from not only the time in which it was made, but also from the seeming freedom the director had when making it.If you don't like Ice Hockey or any sport for that matter, it doesn't make a blind bit of difference. This movie works in the same way that Airplane! and Blazing Saddles does - with an effortless fluidity and style that will have most viewers going back for repeat views again and again in search of another comedic nugget of gold.The character combinations here are superb, and the casting agent did a wonderful job getting Paul Newman on board, who seems to revel in this sort of role - this movie makes you feel good because it's clear from the start that it was a whole bunch of fun to make.Full to the brim with one-liners, appropriate and hilarious cursing, memorable catch-phrases and all the dysfunction you could ever hope for in a slick 123 minute runtime. Some of the scenes are genuinely laugh out loud funny; my favourite, the Charleston Chiefs organ player who gets clouted in the head and knocked off his chair by a stray puck shot from distance, only to appear in his next scene resplendent with a protective helmet - I had to spit my drink out.As mentioned in other reviews there is a small amount of social commentary here, but not enough to spoil the jokes, of which there are plenty. Hilarious, compelling and wonderfully carefree in a way that studio executives dare not entertain in this day and age, Slap Shot will surprise and revive you on one of those rainy Wednesday evenings after a bad day at work. So spend a couple of hours with the Chiefs - you'll be glad you did.8.1 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aggressive Hockey is Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the mid-70's and Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) is the ancient player-coach of the Charlestown Chiefs, a minor league hockey team in the Northeast. Reggie, the Chiefs, as well as Charlestown are pretty much on life support, barely hanging on. He has a motley group of players, not exactly hot NHL prospects. But Reggie and his team all share one thing?they absolutely love playing hockey and everything that goes with it, the male camaraderie in the locker room and road trips, drinking, poker and their groupies. Unfortunately, with the steel mill getting ready to close in Charlestown, the team will be folding at the end of the year unless an out of town buyer can be convinced to purchase the team-so Reggie Dunlop figures the best way to attract attention is to raise the level of violence on the ice to a new pinnacle.What unfolds is absolutely hilarious, but it's not just the action on the ice. Although to do a sports movie well the participating actors have to look somewhat authentic and hockey is not an easy sport to play. You can't fake it and everyone, including Newman are believable in their hockey skills. SS has some memorable dialogue and moments, whether they are about hockey, sex, marital relations, machismo? hanging out with the Chiefs for 2 hours is a blast.Newman is the only really big star and he's terrific. But some other memorable faces in this including Strother Martin as the teams seedy GM, Michael Ontkean as a talented ex-Ivy leaguer who enjoys the life but has a wife (Lindsay Crouse) who hates being a hockey widow. Jennifer Warren plays Reggie's estranged wife-they are still in love with each other but she's realized it's time for her to move on. Melinda Dillon, who would become famous for "A Christmas Story" has a memorable nude scene with Newman, as the ex-spouse of an opposing goalie who also has discovered she's bi-sexual. Swoosie Kurtz also plays one of the wives who delivers a few memorable one-liners. As far as the Chiefs, great performances by virtually everyone, my favorite being Brad Sullivan as the perpetually horny Moe Wanchuk.And then there are the Hanson Brothers?simply put the most destructive line in hockey history!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edgy In 77 But Tame By Today's Standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a high school student living in a minor league town when this movie came out and it instantly became a "must see" among my friends. I think some of our teachers got sick of hearing some of the quotes. While the language was considered extreme in 1977, it is tame by today's standards. I recently took advantage of a frigid winter day to actually count the F-Bombs. On my DVD there are a total of 68 with Reggie Dunlop leading with 28. The funny thing is that none of them are gratuitous or forced and just seem to naturally fit in with the characters.This movie is a nice trip in a time machine. You have to love the vehicles all the players drive. Newman's outfits are so 70's it isn't funny. Back before the internet we actually got news from papers and not instantly like today.The action scenes are very well filmed and come across as very real even by today's CGI enhanced standards.Sure there are a few plot holes but it's a movie, not a documentary. Every character is believable to a certain extent.If you are a sport movie fan not only is this a must see but I have to wonder if it doesn't make your top 3 (it's my number one as well as making my all time top 25).This movie is a joy to watch over 35 years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest hockey movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Charlestown Chiefs is a hopeless losing hockey team in fifth place. The team has to do ridiculous events to make extra cash. Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) is a player/coach with a rag tag team with the latest being the goonish Hanson brothers. Their best player Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) has a jealous wife (Lindsay Crouse) who hates the small town. With the town's mill closing, the team has to close at the end of the season. Reggie Dunlop decides to pump up the team and attendance by planting a story of the team moving to Florida and starts playing goon hockey.This is an inappropriate movie and it's all the more funnier because of it. It is possibly the funniest hockey movie of all times. Director George Roy Hill rejoins Paul Newman after the success of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. It is more fun and more hilarious than either one. However you have to prepare for the language, the homophobia, and the goon hockey. It's certainly not a pretty movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gay men are guardians of the masculine impulse. What is anonymous sex in a dark alleyway but a homage to male freedom?" &#x2015; Camille PagliaRelease "Slap Shot" in any other decade and it would feel like a vulgar comedy cynically put together by a marketing committee. Release in the 1970s, though, and it'll feels like some kind of social statement. With F bombs.Directed by George Roy Hill, "Slap Shot" stars Paul Newman as Reggie Dunlop, an ageing hockey coach based in the steel town of Charlestown. With the closing of local steel mills, money has become scarce. To make matters worse, the owners of the Charlestown Chiefs, Reggie's team, are thinking of liquidating the club. Reggie's plan, to keep his team and his boys marketable, is to resort to violent sensationalism. He re-brands the Chiefs into a band of barbarians on ice. The public love it.Despite being set in the macho world of sports, "Slap Shot" was written by a woman, Nancy Dowd. She has the film develop two parallel strands. One focuses on various women who find men to be emasculated, boorish and immature. These women, most of whom reject traditional femininity and are perpetually dressed in dour clothes, are unfulfilled by men and even go so far as to turn to lesbian relationships. The men put up with this. The times are changing, they rationalise.The other half of the film deals with the arena of sport being appropriated and perverted by Big Business. Whores in skates, our band of foul-mouthed performers cater to the baser impulses of spectators. Always playing with toys, and childishly homophobic, they're also incapable of mature relationships with women. There's an infantalizing and emasculating quality to both sport and business, Dowd argues, our heroes essentially castrated and so feminized, regardless of their foul mouthed, macho tirades. Dowd's women, meanwhile, are masculinized, made courser, more cynical and harder by the market. Indeed, it is Reggie who insists upon turning women "back into women", taking them to beauty parlours in an attempt to restore old modes of masculinity and femininity.Reggie is further shocked when he confronts the fact that the Charlestown Chiefs are owned by a svelte businesswoman, a woman who has so little regard for the bloodsport that hockey has become, that she refuses to let her own children watch games. Reggie fumes. He's deemed a pathetic product by the very people who profit from his antics.The film ends with a Princeton educated player, Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean), staging a little protest. Throughout the film, Braden refuses to sell-out for the sake of the box office; he refuses to fight. During the film's climactic game, Braden then goes further and stages a strip-routine. "Make him stop! That's disgusting," rivals yell. The act not only makes a mockery of boardroom and bleacher violence, but the machismo of audiences, owners and players, all of whom deem violence less obscene than innocence and nudity. Ironically, Braden's wife, for the first time in the film, is here given feminine clothes, and it is an act of violence committed by the oppositional team which swiftly leads to the now-pacifist Chiefs winning their final game.The 1970s saw a number of gritty, foul-mouthed sports movies ("The Longest Yard", "Bad News Bears" etc). "Slap Shot" was one of the last in this wave. Interestingly, Hill has the film end with a husband and wife splitting. She's a successful businesswoman who skips town, he's left alone in the rubble of Charlestown. The film's signature song is Maxine Nightingale's "Right Back Where We Started From", the song's lyrics ("it's alright, and it's coming along, we got to get right back to where we started from") perhaps speaking, amongst other things, to a masculinity which dreams of one day reasserting itself.7.9/10 ? See "Bull Durham". Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recommend people read "Hilarious, oddly influential dark sports comedy" (ggh6; 27 July 2001). Also, "Funny, cynical and irreverent" (JohnRouseMerriottChard, 27 September 2008); "Enjoyable romp" (Big Neil-2, 20 July 2002) and "...a hockey game broke out (Gary M. James; 8 May 2001)."Slap Shot" is a very complex movie. It works very well as a sports comedy that that can seen in a party setting. For many people, that is all it needs to be.I really like how it looks. The extensive use of natural lighting, the grainy quality of the film is appealing. I also admire George Roy Hill's visual style. There are a number of interesting compositions.The opening credits begin in a cutaway section of what was previously the blue square of an American flag. The finish concludes with a parade for the Charleston Chiefs. The Chiefs win using disreputable tactics. It is hard to deny that Slap Shot is making a statement about the falsity of American life; i.e., Americana.Then there is the homophobic quality (which Gary James mentions in his 8 May 2001 review). If one reads between the lines, Slap Shot can be viewed as an out-of-the-closet statement for Paul Newman. (If not Newman, then his character, Reg Dunlap.) Contrary to what many have written, Newman's Reg Dunlap does not originate the idea that if the Chiefs become a goon-squad it will bring in a financially depressed crowd. Reg Dunlap is a classic weather vane. What he thinks this minute is determined by who is around him. He cannot decide which woman he wants. He also repeatedly contradicts himself about what style of hockey he wants his team to play. (He even tells the police he thinks the Hanson brothers should be locked up, then works for their release.) Given the transient nature of Reg Dunlap's opinions, and the clearly identifiable scenes where Dunlap encounters the subject of homosexuality, it seems easy enough to interpret these scenes as Newman (or Dunlap) acknowledging that he has a gay impulse, regardless of what Dunlap says about homosexuality in scenes where he is more in control.Slap Shot depicts not not just the corruption of hockey, but also with American society. We are made to believe both are acceptable. Like the team's fanatical boosters, we are rooting for the Chiefs to win by using disreputable tactics.There is a powerful sense of indoctrination in Slap Shot. It does make the audience welcome thuggishness and the breakdown of civil society. (If the CIA made it that would explain why.) I laughed from start to finish, and the introduction of the Hanson brothers to ice is a riot. Slap Shot is amusing. There are many layers of interest beyond the mirth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you accept sports as entertainment with machismo and honor, you can appreciate this film for its' dressing room cliché humor and small town usual killing time on the road for the Charlestown Chiefs, a minor league hockey team led by an over the hill payer-coach and in a town one plant closing short of collapsing. Loving hockey, I saw this in the theater and still see it as a small town story. It may have a cult following, but that is not to say it doesn't light the red light for new fans as well. Quoted as much as Spinal Tap and The Godfather, the writing is crisp and action hilarious as Paul Newman works his con man act on a memorable team of cast offs. This film remains both relevant and funny with some really silly scenes countering a few heartfelt moments. I said, a few, as the transformation of this hockey team of cast offs into a goon-a-thon on ice. The characters not on the ice are just as memorable for their proliferation of the problem that Nancy Dowd was writing about</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This profane comedy sport classic, is really a slap in the face, if you happen to be in the warring path of the Charleston Chiefs, a loser ice hockey team. Newman again owns the movie as Reggie Dunlop, the coach of the team, a true supporters who'd back any of his players, if in a rut. Only out there on the cold rink, there's more pucks hitting the skin of faces of the opposing team, instead of disks. Newman loves to provoke the opposing players with personal insults, one of them, involving doing one of the player's wives. The chiefs will use any violent or under the belt tactic to win. One of them, Brandon (Michael Ontkeon) Newman's right hand man, isn't comfortable with this play either, describing one of their shots as "A bulls..t win". Yes, it's dirty out there on the playing field, more blood, than victory. Slapshot is a lot of fun, but also the film, has a really good script working for it. The opening scene with a nervous Iranian player, being interviewed, yes one of the chiefs, will crack you up, for starters. The real stealers of the film come later, a twin brother trio, who you don't want to judge by the electric car set they bring, giving an angry Newman some great lines. Basically this team is being sold down the river. They're on the way out, hey but the bad news bears quit. No. Same moral applies here. I loved the scene with Newman confronting a woman sponsor, who has a change of heart, telling him, the games too violent. You should see how Newman responds, which makes for one of the great savoring moments of the film. Newman even has a player on his team, named killer, (Jerry Houser) a lot of fun. Incidentally Houser played Marsha Brady's husband in The Brady's Comeback Reunion, only here, he's another player, you don't want to rub up the wrong way. We also have two young twin groupies with big, you know, an older randy player, another of the chiefs eating them up with his eyes, behind stinking beer breath. Another player that's a plus here, was Ontkeon's wife, who's pi...d off at hubby, cause he's sticking his, you know what, in every woman. You should see her in a rage, especially when she's behind the wheel. Her and her bigger shaggy dog, end up crashing at Newman's. One thing certain, I could see a mile off, was that Ontkeon was eventually gonna slug mate, Newman, who ends up smiling, glad he took the initiative. Another Mitchell confession: Slapshot is my favorite sport movie. Why they brought a sequel out over thirty years later I'll never know, even though I've never seen it. It even marks the return of that same deadly trio. Believe it. This film was just so enjoyable for some reason. Newman, as well as being such a fine actor, has one of the most killer handsome smiles, I've ever seen, a smile that launched such an acting great, who like many other greats, are no longer with us. Highly recommended for any sport movie fan. Almost a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Slap Shot" is a very, very adult sports film. It features LOTS of profanity, lots of politically incorrect language, references to masturbation, nudity and LOTS and LOTS of violence. Even by today's standards (which, admittedly are pretty low), it's a very adult film. But, it also is very funny and, like a terrible traffic accident, it's something you may not want to watch...but you keep on watching! The Charlestown Chiefs are a lousy minor league hockey team in a lousy city. Their fans don't care and the team seems imminently in danger of either being sold or folding completely. However, the player-manager of the club (Paul Newman) is a bit crazy and has come up with a plan to POSSIBLY save the team and his career--get his players to play as dirty as possible to create fan spirit. And, after playing like a squad of nothing but goons, the team starts to win and fans come pouring into the stadium. And, to further excite his team, he begins spreading false rumors about a buyer for the team. It all culminates in an incredibly stupid finale at the championship game. Unfortunately, it's no longer a sport--just a punch of thugs hittin' folks!The bottom line is that "Slap Shot" is a funny and distasteful film. My wife even enjoyed it--and she normally doesn't like sports films. It's also pretty wild seeing Newman and some of the other actors on skates--as well as those Hanson brothers...who are kind of like Napoleon Dynamite combined with three Tasmanian Devils!

Then, they start to play rough. Violent antics end their losing streak and Mr. Newman's brawling icemen are suddenly bruising for the championship. They're also filling the stands with blood-thirsty fans...With outrageous comedy, writer Nancy Dowd and director George Roy Hill capture the sport well; there is a lot of truth here, satirical and otherwise. Newman receives his main support (more or less) from closet exhibitionist Michael Ontkean (as Ned Braden) and their possibly gay manager Strother Martin (as Joe McGrath). As a boozing neglected wife, Lindsay Crouse (as Lily) is a stand out. Especially noteworthy are the hilarious "Hansons" (Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson &amp; David Hanson).******** Slap Shot (2/25/77) George Roy Hill ~ Paul Newman, Michael Ontkean, Strother Martin, Lindsay Crouse</fullReview>

Amazing to of had such a talented and respected Director, his background being Czech I'm sure added to the 'realism' placed on action scenes and the mentality of North American hockey players of that time period. To some extent still permeates in today's professional hockey leagues, Euros always promoting the idea that they have all the skills, and North Americans all the grit and heart... Anyways, the movie is for sure in the top 10 all-time great sport movies; grittiness, dank and dark steamy arenas, the clothes, vehicles, hair styles, the characters, humour and empathy you can't help but feel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Slap Shot" is always in the running when folks start the list for their top sports films. First amazing thing about the film is that it was written by a Ms. Namcy Dowd and she based it on her local hockey team that had her brother on the rooster. Paul Newman turns in one of his best overall performances as the beleaguered losing player/coach, Reg Dunlop. The supporting cast is tops all down the line but the one stellar stand out is the GM of the team played by Paul's perpetual co-acting buddy, Strother Martin. The skating scenes are authentic as they used many real hockey types for the team roles. Even Newman does his own stuff on the ice and he isn't that bad. Latter versions of the tapes and DVD's of the film had a different music soundtrack...seems there was a contract problem with some of the music on the original print. Try to watch the theatrical release on Netflix to capture the original flair and feeling of "Slap Shot". The humor is raunchy and real and if you are like me you will watch it over and over again and still laugh out loud at the right places. If you have never, ever seen "Slap Shot" I am amazed...BUT don't sit there. Get up and turn it on now! You will experience great film making (thanks to George Roy Hill) and above the boards acting by the entire cast. Enjoy "Slap Shot". I always have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slap Shot is a film that depicts the Charlestown Chiefs,a minor league hockey team that resorts to violent play to gain popularity in a declining factory town.It stars Paul Newman in a wonderful comic performance together with Strother Martin,Michael Ontkean,Lindsay Crouse and the famously known "Hanson Brothers" namely David Hanson,Steve Carlson and Jeff Carlson.The plot has Newman play Reggie Dunlop, the coach of a pathetic minor- league American hockey team,Charlestown Chiefs. His career at a standstill and his marriage in tatters, Dunlop has nothing to lose by taking on a new group of players who are one evolutionary step above Neanderthals - the Hanson Brothers namely Jack,Steve and Jeff.Only when the team begins winning does he decide to get behind these players, and to encourage the rest of the team to play as down-and-dirty as the newcomers. Straight-arrow team member Ned Braden,played by Michael Ontkean,resents this influx of gonzo talent, preferring to play clean. As the film's multitude of subplots play themselves out, Dunlop does his best to keep the outraged Braden on the team. To keep them motivated, Dunlop plants a story with sportswriter Dickie Dunn that the Chiefs are being sold to a prospective buyer in Florida. The owner turns out to be a rich widow who couldn't care less about hockey. She intends to fold the Chiefs and take a tax write-off. Disgusted with her, he storms out, and realizes that his lies blew up in his face. One last playoff game remains, and Dunlop reveals to the players that there is no buyer and he made the whole story up. After apologizing to his team, he decides that this is to be his last game, so Reggie wants to go out with dignity and not like a goon. Despite being conned, the team follows Dunlop's lead and vows to play clean.Unfortunately,the fight ensues later in the game.Braden, sulking on the bench after refusing to goon it up, finally snaps. He skates out to center ice and strips off his uniform. Both teams stop fighting and stare in amazement at Braden's striptease, hypocritically more offended by Braden's antics than the violence they have been engaging in.Slap Shot has become a cult classic especially among Hockey fans.Its nonstop barrage of profanity and its raunchy action sequences are of such intensity is probably what the movie will be remembered for.But it is more than just a comedic film for it is about a man, a town, a team, a league and a sport that are all dying, and Hill has created characters who are desperate, selfish, lonely, deceitful and violent.As for the themes or should I say "dark" themes of the film,it was basically a social commentary about the attitude of "winning at all cost";the power of the media;the Americans'love for sports and their fascination for violence as professed for the sport of hockey; and a view to the world of capitalism.Aside from that,it also touches on broken marriages, selfishness, manipulation and deceit, sports-fan blood lust, battle between players and team owners and the effects of an economic downturn to a blue- collar town. George Hill created an absorbing flick that is frank,violent and extremely hilarious and the same time that states something about our society.It was one of the greatest sports comedy I have seen in my life.It was raunchy,violent and very funny.Slap Shot will rank among the best sports comedies and social commentaries ever made in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film that's going to appeal to a relatively small audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewing a movie that came out in 1977 means thinking about what kind of people might want to watch this movie, because you're basically up against everything else that's on the shelf at the DVD store or that you see scrolling through the listings on Netflix or whatever.First of all: "Slap Shot" has a lot of swearing. A LOT of swearing. F-bombs, among other swear words, being thrown helter-skelter all over the place. It also has some "boobs and bums" shots, including what was probably the largest group mooning scene prior to the battlefield mooning scene in Mel Gibson's movie "Braveheart." And it drops some homosexual epithets and some graphic sexual references. So this is not a movie that you're going to want to sit down with the kids or the church pastor or your elderly and sensitive mother to watch.Second, this is a movie that is really about hockey. Hockey does frame some relationship sub-plots and there's some slice-of-life background stuff, but it is unabashedly a sports movie. So people who don't like sports, and especially don't like hockey, are going to want to take a pass on "Slap Shot." Third, this movie is set in a time (the 1970's) and place (a small semi-industrial town facing the closing of the factory that is the major employer) that younger people may just not understand or identify with. So people who are still uphill from thirty may draw a blank on this film.So who is going to want to watch it? Well, first of all, if you're a Paul Newman fan, you're going to want to see this film. Newman plays the lead, Reggie "Reg" Dunlop, a player who is also coach for the minor-league hockey team the Charlestown Chiefs.If you enjoy a movie that's full of bawdy, raunchy fun; that speaks of dealing with disappointments and the powerlessness of being just a depreciable asset on somebody's balance sheet without being preachy or angry or depressing; and that is about loving hockey, and minor league hockey at that, in the days when players didn't wear protective head-gear and a brawl with intervals of skating was the way to play the game, this is your kind of movie and you're going to love it.Newman's character, Dunlop, is middle-aged, this is probably his last season in hockey as a player, it's been his whole life. The Chiefs, the team he plays for and coaches, are one of the few entertainments to be found in a gritty blue-collar town that's facing the closure of the factory that's the major employer. Always on the ragged edge of perdition, stocked with players who are one waiver away from having to get a REAL job, the Chiefs are facing disbandment by the unknown owner because, as a business proposition, they're a dead loss.Dunlop's wife, played by Jennifer Warren, has long ago gotten tired of the role of hockey wife-- husband forever on the road, the vagabond life of moving when he gets traded, the groupies who go after her husband, the uncertainty-- and has left him. She's just had enough and without bitterness or angst is moving on. Dunlop hasn't accepted the finality of her decision, and throughout the movie he keeps trying to find a way to make her change her mind.Dunlop's assistant and fellow player is Ned Braden, played by Michael Ontkean. Braden didn't come into hockey through the blue-collar route of junior leagues and working his way up through the minors; he played on a scholarship at college, he's preppie, he's got a future outside of hockey if he wants it. His wife, Lily Braden, played by Lindsay Crouse completely deadpan, is also college-educated. She comes from a wealthy family and she HATES the whole minor-league, small-town, small-world, hockey-wife scene. She doesn't fit and she knows it, and endures it only by drinking early and often.Dunlop finds out the team is to be disbanded, and decides that if he can somehow cobble together a winning season, he can persuade the anonymous owner to sell the team instead of dissolving it. And so he sets out to inspire his rag-tag bunch of no-hopers and losers to win, to scratch and scrape and fight out victories any way they can.And he's aided in this by three new players who've just arrived, the Hanson brothers, who are certifiably nuts but can skate, can shoot, and can FIGHT like junk-yard pitbulls, and who are happily madly satisfied to win any way their coach tells them to.And that sets the stage for all the rest. Make no mistake, this movie has some howlingly hysterical moments, including one of the all-time best striptease scenes ever made.I loved this movie, and if you like sports movies and aren't a sensitive soul who cringes at the language and the non-PC references and nudity, and especially if you enjoy watching Paul Newman, you're going to like this movie too. It's a real gem of it's type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Newman's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best Newman films I remember seeing, although I was somewhat taken aback at first by the level and quantity of profanity, although in retrospect, I guess I shouldn't have been. The film was made about Professional Hockey, not the High School variety. I was also very surprised at the level of skating demonstrated by both Mr Newman and Mr Ontkean. Those who for some reason feel it is necessary to burden us with their intricate knowledge - real or imagined - of Hockey Team and League rules and regulations, and how the movie appears at times to play loose with them, should keep in mind that "Slap Shot" was not ever intended to be a Primer for anyone wishing to know all about the sport of Hockey, nor was it intended to portray a 100% accurate bit of source material. It's not supposed to be a history lesson, it's supposed to be entertainment and - well - a very good movie. It does both quite well.</fullReview>

It's based on the North American Hockey League's Johnstown Jets (still in existence as the Johnstown Chiefs in the East Coast Hockey League) The team, at one point, was coached by Steve Carlson (Steve Hanson in the movie), who, along with his brother Jack Carlson (Jack Hanson) went on to play briefly in the NHL. There was no third brother. Note: Jack Carlson had 248 penalty minutes in 50 games with Johnstown in 1974-75.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one great hockey film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There haven't been many hockey movies, but among the small lot, this is easily the finest. It takes a cock-eyed look at the sport, and what it takes to make it work at the lower levels.One of the most violent anti-violence movies, Slapshot puts itself right in the middle of a debate between using "goonism" or not, in order to win hockey games. Newman is the player/coach of a failing team that is suddenly "blessed" with a trio of goons, the Hanson Brothers (no, they don't sing). Through them, the team starts winning by beating up the opposition, which causes an argument over the ethics of it, and how it affects the game. The answers are given on both sides, making its statement that the only clear path is ambivalence.Another good theme is the look at the small-town life, when the industry is failing. Newman and his troops, like all the workers in the town, must show a lot of passion for their work, even when it's tough to see the light at the end of the tunnel.While there is a decent degree of seriousness in the movie, it is the physical comedy that prevails, offering the funniest moments ever seen on ice. The great thing about "Slap Shot" is that is doesn't try to do too much, it just plays itself out, and like Newman's character, is what it is, and that should work just fine, thanks!This won't make any movie-of-the-year lists, but it's worthwhile watching for some very funny moments--if you're a hockey fan, then it's indispensable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slap Shot Is a classic Hockey film that everyone needs to see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved Slapshot, i saw it many times as a kid and it still holds up just as well today in my opinion, I absolutely loved the Hanson brothers, they just cracked me up with the things they did, Paul Newman was also brilliant as Reggie. The hockey action is pretty exciting as well with some amusing fights, and great humor as well. It's also very similar to what was happening in Hockey and NHL at that time with all the goons in hockey, so I also enjoyed that too. There's lots of vulgar language,blood, nasty humor and I absolutely loved it, cause i love controversy, as I believe this is one of the best Sports movies ever made it has everything you want. There are lots of funny jokes in this film one of my favorites was Strother Martin's joke about the Masturbator as that cracked me up big time. Overall Slap shot is a must see for any film buff as it's a true classic and hasn't dated one bit in my opinion.The Acting is very good. Paul Newman is terrific as Reggie Dunlop,he was funny,cocky but never overbearing and always had this great charm about him that you couldn't help but love he really is a class act I believe this is one of his finest roles!. Michael Ontkean is good as the hot shot Ned Braden who Doesen't like to fight as he has a classic moment near the end where he strips off his gear and starts doing dances that was the highlight for me.Strother Martin is good as the crook Owner he just brought lots of class and laughs to this. Jennifer Warren is OK but nothing spectacular as the love interest, and didn't really have much to do in my opinion her chemistry with Newman was OK. Lindsay Crouse is decent as Ontkean's love interest but got on my nerves with her constant snotty attitude. Jeff Carlson,Steve Carlson,David Hanson are all hilarious as the Hanson brothers and cracked me up whenever they were on screen as they were the highlight for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Newman was asked of all his roles, which one was his favorite. He replied that he didn't really have a favorite, but if you were interested in which role was closest to Paul Newman's character, he said Reggie Dunlop.This is a laid back look at the 70's. The economy was headed for the toilet, people were trying to understand what was happening around them as traditional values had been held up to ridicule by a generation that was still trying to figure out what to do with themselves. The movie can be taken on many levels if you begin to consider the mantra of "old time hockey". The story never tries to provide a definitive answer, but shows that when you try to answer the big questions, only more questions will arise.It ranks up there with M*A*S*H, Fast Times, and Caddyshack. Each has its own merits and makes various comments on society, some more deeply than others. If any of those movies appeals to you, then you will enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Roy Hill's underachieving "Slap Shot" wasn't a huge hit when released in 1977, but cable and video turned it into a word-of-mouth success and now the film is defended with solemn righteousness--as if it were anything more than a violent cartoon. Scrappy Massachusettes hockey team plays dirty to win, with player-coach Paul Newman getting to show off a rare mean-spirited side of himself which doesn't sit particularly well (the whole movie is full of gratuitous put-downs, but hearing Newman tell a bitchy woman, "Your kid looks like a fag to me" has no kick to it--it's just ugly). Nancy Dowd's screenplay purposefully makes the characters mangy and vile, though Hill still wants us to respond to them with hearty merriment (this isn't quite "The Longest Yard" where abusive Burt Reynolds grew up a bit). By putting the audience in the same position as the dolts in the stands who cheer vicariously, "Slap Shot" is actually rather insulting. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Wining Equation !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wining Equation.. Nobody knows it, and that's what makes it too interesting, and the quest for it a history of art.At the 1970s the genre cinema lived a crises, Hollywood producers were going crazy, and most of the production went to be different than the previous, any different. As you see, the winning equation was lost, to an extent made 4, mostly terrible, extra parts for (Plant of The Apes ? 1968) only because it had succeeded; which was ? back then ? a rare thing to happen and a blessing to utilize ! Then, 1977 arrived. Yes, it's one particular year in the history of the American cinema. It's the year that the mainstream production got its equilibrium once again. (Star Wars) bursts out, declaring the return of the audience to cinema, or rather the return of cinema to the dream, the well-made one.(Star..) had a bizarre formation of genres; Western + Old legends + Sci-fi. And it did work incredibly. As unprecedented as that, (Slap Shot) came out in the same year. It wasn't less surprising at all. Look at the formation this time: a To Sir With Love story (with underachievers being mentored by a leading teacher) + a Seven Samurai's flavor (a war to be won at the climax, yet on sporty playground, in which the kids triumph together heroically) + some vulgarity (where you listen to filthy lines, non-stop, and said by one of the old, polite, classic age's stars : Paul Newman). And all of that did work, big time too. It has a gritty realistic sense; for instance most of it, if not all, is shot on location with no polished studios, exactly a la the rest of the realistic 70s flicks. The dialog is loose, and I mean looooose. You read that at least 55 F-words were said (Too heavy for its time !!). The sexual, sometime ugly, references are swarming. In brief, there is a nuclear bomb of filthiness had exploded in this movie. The matches were designed as fair battles. And Newman is the man. I believe this comic B-movie participated in forming the new Hollywood's winning equations. Watch carefully a spoof like (The Comebacks ? 2007) to understand (Slap Shot)'s effect on other movies in the next 30 years.This movie tried something new by mixing all of the above together, to earn a lot of money and fame. Obviously 1977 was so fit for that equation to hit. So no one knows what would make a movie a success, they just try, time after time after time, hoping to click with the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legendary Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slap Shot is truly a masterpiece. A legendary film in the hockey world, as well as in the sports world in general.The Chiefs, a team in the minor Federal League, faces a challenge as their team is expected to disband. With the team seemingly down and out, three brothers come to the Chiefs from the Iron League. Jack, Jeff, and Steve Hanson (who all three were actual hockey players at the time) come to the team and goon up the game, bringing the fans to the games. Although the fans and some of the team embraces the new style, leading scorer Ned Braden disapproves, going so far as to risk being benched to keep his game clean. To keep the team's hopes up, player/coach Reggie Dunlop makes up a story about the team relocating to Florida, rather than disbanding. He even goes as far as to lie to the town sports writer to make the story seem legit. When he finally meets the actual owner of the Chiefs (who, to his surprise, is a woman), she tells him that the team won't be sold. When they play in the championship game, Dunlop encourages his team to play clean hockey. But to their surprise, they are playing against the meanest players in league history. After a grueling first, they revert back to goon hockey and win the championship game.In the end, Dunlop is offered a coaching job in Minnesota, and states he plans to bring the Chiefs team with him.If you're a fan of great movies and purely hilarious comedy, then you're already a fan of this movie. It's truly an awesome movie, you won't regret watching!</fullReview>

This film brings back a lot of memories;from the god-awful clothes to the failing economy in an industrial town, to the loser local sports franchise.I grew up near an industrial town in the 70's and early 80's and this film brings back the memories of that time and place: the depression and despondence brought on by the economy and the fact that your only sports team sucks!I'm not much of a hockey fan, but I love the games in this film. The progression from a hapless team to carnival freaks is great fun. Who doesn't love the Hanson brothers? From the silly announcer to the crazed general manager to the team of losers, half-wits and just plain weirdos; this film adds new meaning to the term "cast of characters"!Looking back on this film, you wonder how it happened. Paul Newman in a hockey comedy? Ralphie's mom (Melinda Dillon) topless? The sheriff of "Twin Peaks"? That "failure to communicate" guy? That was what made some of the films of the 70's great. They weren't the predictable fare we see today. Big stars weren't above making character movies or just having some plain old, goofy fun. What other decade gave you Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now and Superman?This film is still a lot of fun, and if it seems dated, it's only because you didn't live through that time. And given the current economic climate and fashion, it still looks pretty timely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well...believe it or not...despite it being around since 1977 and me much longer, I have just viewed this film for the first time. I knew it existed, but doubted it's veracity. I lived hockey for many years at many levels and can relate to all of the film's sequences, albeit cliché by now.The film was a 'hoot' and I can understand why it has become a cultish phenomena. I am glad that I had not seen it before as it gave me a fresh outlook to a part of my life that I didn't think could be transposed to film so effectively and with such humour. It rightly deserves to be a classic and I know it is now deemed as almost a 'right of passage' for all upcoming players.Congratulations to the producers, directors and all involved in its making. I am sorry for the delay in watching, but I will watch again and again from now on!As a sidebar, the following link to a newspaper article written at about the same time is probably one of the best 'true testimonials' about the nature of hockey as I then knew it. I hope you enjoy reading. Perhaps there was some inspiration in this article that led to the thought processes of the movie's writers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who knocks this movie as being unrealistic, or "dated", is clearly ignorant of the inside of sports. Instead of trashing you for being closed-minded or clueless, I will simply leave it as "ignorant" since not everyone has been in a hockey locker room.Obviously, this movie is a parody. There is exaggeration for effect. But the film is so otherwise dead-on accurate, it may as well have been a documentary. From the shenanigans of the general manager, and the ownership situation, to the winning at all costs mentality, to the bus trips of the minor leagues, to the hotels and women, and bars, and team comraderie and machismo. It's all there.I've spent 10 years around hockey, including 5 travelling with minor league hockey teams. Trust me.Today, the violence is not nearly as pervasive, since the rules have been changed - though I've seen my share of bench clearing brawls in the minor leagues. But all you have to do is listen to the Hanson Brothers commentary on the DVD to get any idea. Listen to them as they say "Hey, remember when that actually happened in Syracuse" - or - "Hey, remember that crazy guy who..."Of course, none of this necessarily makes this a great movie. I believe it is, though that is just my opinion. I believe it is because it's making a statement about a number of issues that surround sports - the violence and the hero worship and the business side of things - while also being hysterical.There are so many baseball movies that are pure junk because of how unrealistic they are. This film holds up for even hockey players because of how true it all rings.This is a 10 - all the way around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's "The Dirty Dozen" on ice and scores.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In desperate need of talent and larger crowds, the player-coach of a struggling minor league hockey team, Reggie Dunlap (Paul Newman) suggests to his players to pick fights or hit on the opposition instead of scoring goals. The players who carry out Dunlap's message are the three Hanson brothers and they also become the heart and soul of the squad. And the result isn't nasty as the original "Rollerball", but it sure produces plenty of shockingly funny moments that range from what the Newman character says to the antics that the Hansons resort to on and off the rink. Even Strother Martin and Michael Ontkean have their turns in providing a laugh or too during the movie. It's "The Dirty Dozen" on ice and scores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happy 25th Anniversary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Slap Shot" turns 25 on March 25, 2002. So many people have seen this film and can quote lines from it, perhaps more than any other movie. I think the movie is one of the most underrated pictures ever made. There's more to it than the foul language or the violence. It's about a hockey team's last ditch effort to save itself. Reggie Dunlop may con and manipulate his way to the championship, but that's what is great about his character and this movie, and that is the psychology within. There's something in all of us that is like Dunlop and his players...we're all underdogs, we fight for what we believe in and may even be a little underhanded to get to where we need to get. More important, Dunlop has something to prove...that he can be a winner, and he can be successful. It's what he wants for himself, and for his players. Fans of Paul Newman criticized his decision to play this role, but nobody else could have pulled it off. It was one of his best efforts, and in interviews over the years, he has maintained that it was one of his favorite films to work on, and Dunlop was one of his favorite characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A minor league hockey team tries to salvage its losing season while dealing with the possibility of being sold. It is not clear what this film is meant to be. It's advertised as a comedy, but there's hardly anything funny here. There are endless scenes of home and road games that do little to propel the narrative. Newman is the player-coach, although he's too old to be playing and is not shown doing any coaching. The characters are undeveloped and uninteresting. This is inexplicably regarded as one of the best sports films. Director Hill is reunited with Newman, but the magic of "Butch Cassidy" and "The Sting" is missing here; perhaps if Robert Redford played Newman's teammate...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good if you can keep the foul-mouthed, political incorrectness in perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were writing a paper on political incorrectness, dirty language, and obscene behavior in film and you were trying to find its roots, you would certainly find "Slap Shot" to be one of the earliest examples. For 1977, this film is absolutely littered with it, and considering it's that old, some of what was politically incorrect back then is even more politically incorrect now. This is not a film for the sensitive people, particularly sensitive people that are feminists or homosexuals--unless you can keep it all in perspective."Slap Shot" is a sports comedy, but by sports comedy I mean it is more a celebration of childish, hyper-masculinity. The legendary Paul Newman stars in one of his few comedic turns as Reggie Dunlop, the player head coach of the Charlestown Chiefs, a B-league hockey team with abysmal attendance and a losing record. When the local mill announces it will shut down, putting townies out of jobs and without cash to support bad hockey, the Chiefs announce it will be their last season. Dunlop, now staring retirement in the face, decides to promote violence as a way to energize his players, win games, and draw attendance in hopes that the team will be sold.The premise alone glorifies violence (operating on the assumption that people will pay to see it) and the film showboats physical humor. Hockey games consist of almost nothing but fight scenes. It's funny at times, but quite redundant. Insulting other players is also part of the agenda, whether calling them gay, their spouse gay, or other insults to their manhood. Some of the humor is the absurdity of the insults and the absurdity of these low-life hockey goon characters that shout them.Bottom line is this a guy's film. Don't even watch it with your girlfriend, that's how politically incorrect it is. Even the obnoxious masculine humor aside, the drama consists of following these guys around and showing their even worse off-the-rink habits. Even if you're girlfriend loves Paul Newman--and he's good--but he's good in the not very socially acceptable way. These characters are all uneducated, except the one who not coincidentally doesn't fight, and know nothing else but hockey. You kind of even pity them at times.That's not to say this film uses that stuff as a crutch, because there is comedy that is a bit more acceptable to all in the film, but the pervasive attitude is dirty, plain dirty. You either have to like that or be able to deal with it to enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly one of the greatest sports comedies of all time. There are plenty of comments which are saying just this for good reason. Not sure how one could have a spoiler in this one since there are no major plot twists (no major plot save a low-level hockey team trying to stay afloat). Paul Newman is the lead car in this character-driven flick. He doesn't over-shadow the rest of the excellent cast, many of whom have seemingly remained in obscurity, save this one great. Yet many have had busy, interesting careers. I've seen Slap Shot several times and it ages very well, better than most of its time and genre. Though the men have better-defined parts (it is a story about hockey, after all), the women are great in their subtle, shadowy roles. They definitely help balance out what could have been simply (only) testosterone run amok.Of course: Hanson, Hanson, Hanson! Heck, I think I'll pop it in again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous - of course, but Clever - absolutely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite how many times I've been told that Slapshot is just a stupid sports movie, I am willing to take my admiration for this film to the grave with me. Slapshot is easily one of the most clever comedies ever written, and most definitely one of the better sports films of all time. What it lacks in seriousness or artistic merit that a movie like Raging Bull might have (it's hard to compare Slapshot with Scorsese), it makes up for in extremely clever, pointed dialogue and a brilliantly written relationship between the entirety of the cast. Michael Ontkean is outstanding, even more so than he was as Sheriff Harry S. Truman in David Lynch's Twin Peaks, and of course Paul Newman gives the movie the star quality it probably needed to flourish.Don't knock this movie for being just a stupid sports film. It may be exactly that, but for Slapshot, that's all its trying to be, and it's not a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Slap Shot" is apparently a cult-classic hockey movie. As a Texan, ice hockey is utterly irrelevant to me, but this is still a flick worth checking out. Paul Newman is, as always, utterly believable in his character. Lindsay Crouse, and Melinda Dillon were notable, as were the Hansons. The language is pretty salty in this film, and in this day and age, I'm surprised that I noticed it, but I did. And some of the clothes! I didn't dress like that in the seventies, but I suppose a lot of people did. That coat with the fur collar Newman wore! Whoa! The officially-allowed fighting was what made hockey a minor/regional sport back then, and the memory of it keeps it in that place to this day, whereas international/Olympic hockey is somewhat watchable even down here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raunchy, filthy, sophomoric, f**king hilarious movie with a great message....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just recently watched this movie again. I forgot how damned hilarious it is and how easily you can miss some of the funnier lines tucked inside an endless stream of profanity and crazy sports hi-jinx. The movie is set in a run down steel town ( I lived in Johnstown, PA, the town where they filmed slap shot in the 70s and then again in the 90s) that is finished financially and so is the team. Their player-coach Reg Dunlop, played superbly by Paul Newman, launches a plan to save the team some way some how. He involuntarily recruits the team to come along for the ride accept for Ned Braden, played by Michael Ontkeen, the one player who sees through Dunlop's scheme and sees the eventual goon show as a degradation of the sport.You will love this movie. Sure it is a statement on violence in sports, but having attended Johnstown Jet games as well as Johnstown Wings and Redwing games, the real teams that played where Slapshot was filmed, the violence was not too overdone. In the end, Ned Braden counter's the violence with his own ideas... and you have to listen to Chiefs' announcer, Carr, in that scene, the irony is freaking hilarious!!!!!! The guys who really steal the movie are the Hanson Brothers Played by two of the Carlson brothers and by Dave Hanson. The third Carlson, Hanson, was actually called up to the NHL and missed his Hollywood moment. I saw these guys play hockey in Johnstown, they were only mildly over the top in the movie.I think the movie also runs in the tradition of Easy Rider as well. You never hear anyone talk about this but it is an anti authority movie I think. The owner is mysteriously missing and is just referred to as the Charlestown Chiefs Corporation. Unlike easy Rider though, Reg Dunlop gets to confront the heartless soul of the corporation who only sees the chiefs' as a write off. Another great scene.The movie is set in my old home town which is a perfect backdrop for this movie. Johnstown also was the setting for a movie of less caliber filmed in the earlier 80s, an early Tom Cruise vehicle, All Right Moves. It's kind of interesting to me to see scenes in each movie that were only filmed feet apart. Another Ironic note to me is that the player coach,and also my next door neighbor, for a very short time for the Johnstown Redwings (the team in town after the movie) was a Christian who never swore and went to church regularly!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Ever, Play "Lady of Spain" Again!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolute classic and must see for anyone who is a fan of slapstick or hockey. I remember in January of 1982 when 18" of snow paralyzed St. Louis on a Sunday morning. That night, after we found out we would not have school for several days, the whole family watched 'Slap Shot' on ABC. Even the edited version was hilarious. When we got back to school, everyone was talking 'Slap Shot' and recreating all the best scenes. I think the entire snowbound city watched the movie that night. Although the movie slows in spots, the comedy and characters are classics. The first night the Hansons play, complete with slapping the puck at the organists' head, is some of the best comedy ever. The Championship game, with all the thugs from the '70's Philly Flyers-esqe Syracuse team, contains one of the only really original endings in a sports movie. (My favorite line from the game: "We'll straighten you out, you little PR*CK".) Great Fun, although not for the humor-impaired or overly PC-Types.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...and a hockey game broke out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first time in a number of years I checked out "Slap Shot". I remember the movie being very profane, dirty and extremely funny. It still is a funny film after all these years though I did notice a number of things in the movie that made it even more than just a funny sports movie.Nancy Dowd's very observant screenplay and George Roy Hill's sharp direction showed the trials and tribulations of being a minor league hockey player: the long road trips, the drinking &amp; partying, the competition against other teams that are going through the same lifestyle.(Arguably, writer/director Ron Shelton did a slightly better job dealing with the same plot in a different minor league sports movie several years later: "Bull Durham".)The characters and the subplots still have me laughing out loud: Dunlop putting a bounty on a competing player's head, the rug-wearing radio announcer (wonderfully played by Andrew Duncan), the French Canadian goaltender (Yvon Barrette) who makes Yogi Berra's malaprop statements sound grammatically correct, the underhanded general manager (the late, great Strother Martin), the unexpected striptease by the Chiefs leading scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) which catches many players, who were beating each other on the ice, totally off guard. I love the line by Ogle Oglethorpe (Ned Dowd, Nancy's brother) after beating up a Chief player and then seeing Braden taking his uniform off: "This is disgusting...." How about that for irony!I do have to admit that what still has me laughing but not as much as before was the overall homophobic atmosphere in the movie. To insult another player (or, most notably, the Chiefs absentee owner) is to call someone a derogatory name. Despite mentioning this observation, I still laughed out loud when Dunlop taunted a competing team's goaltender, among other names, a lesbian. As a hockey fan since the 1970s. I believe screenwriter Nancy Dowd was very accurate in depicting what goes on inside and outside the locker room. At the same time, when it comes to trash talking, and the possibility that the person on player may trash, might be gay (e.g. a character in "Les Boys". For the record, I was not too impressed with the movie.), I wonder if "Slap Shot" is more dated that I first thought (bad fashion notwithstanding).The relationship between Reggie Dunlop and his still married but separated wife still sticks out to me as very bittersweet. Jennifer Warren's performance stood out for me when I first saw the movie and it's one of the many strong aspects of the movie. I got the feeling that as much as she loves Reggie, she was not a happy woman in the relationship.Paul Newman gave some great performances before (Hud, Cool Hand Luke, The Hustler) and after (The Verdict, Nobody's Fool, arguably, The Color of Money &amp; Absence of Malice) "Slap Shot". I certainly don't think it's his best work but I though he did a good job of what it was like to be an "old man" in a young man's sport.Note: For legal reasons, a number of songs that appeared in the movie on the big screen and on cable TV do not appear on the U.S. home video version. They include "Get Right Back Where We Started From" by Maxine Nightingale, Elton John's "Sorry Seems To Be the Hardest Word", Leo Sayer's "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing", Fleetwood Mac's "Rhiannon" and a song called "A Little Bit South of Saskatoon".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slap Shot is a film that I grew up with. Hard to believe that an adolescent could watch "Slap Shot" over 100 times and grow up to be a mild-mannered schoolteacher who doesn't utter a word of profanity. Slap Shot is a not a family movie...profanity abounds, and the sexual talk is frank and realistic. Paul Newman, who plays lead Reggie Dunlop, taunts an opposing goaltender, with whom he's shared a bed, by bringing up her lesbian sexual encounters with another player's wife. However, while the dialogue is frank, it does ring true. Slap Shot is a classic movie which both highlights, and degrades, the sport which is at the focus of this movie: hockey. Strong supporting performances from Strother Martin and Michael Ontkean, as well as a host of unnamable foreign hockey players, further serve to strengthen this 1977 underappreciated sports classic. Easily one of the ten best sports movies ever made, and definitely the best hockey film ever made (then again, what is the competition, Rob Lowe's low-brow 1980s movie Youngblood?), Slap Shot is definitely worth a viewing...or even a 101st!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst visiting the Virgin Megastore a few days ago with a friend, I decided to have a browse at the budget video collection. After looking at a few b-movies, I came across a film by the name of "Slap Shot". At first, it looked a little dated, but then I noticed that Paul Newman was in this film. After much debate with my friend, I decided to purchase this film, as it was only ?5.99 (about $10). I must say that, after watching the film, I was rather pleased with myself for discovering such a good film.Okay, so it may seem a little dated, and some of the jokes are a little dated, but for the money, it was a great laugh. Essentially, the film is a slick blend of comedy and violence (lots of it). All of the characters have their little quirks about themselves (such as the Hanson brothers and Ogie Oglethorpe), and Newman is excellent in the lead role.A very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone (expecially those who enjoy a bit of humourous violence and a good laugh).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original English version of Slap Shot is great. For many it is considered a cult clasic. But everyone who doesn't understand French are missing one of the best Hockey movie of all time. It might be a cult clasic in English but in French it's a masterpiece.First it's about Hockey and we French Canadians are the bigest Hockey fans in the world. Second, we have shall we say a distinct dialec with our French. While most movies are dubed in France this one was actually dubed in Québec Canada. So you have a Hockey movie that's using our expresions so where can you go wrong?But still like I said it's still good in English. This is the kind of movie that grows on you. After seeing it once you might hate it and think it's the worst movie ever, but just try to watch it a second time and you might change your mind. This is exactly what happened with Siskel and Ebert. They gave it two thumbs down and a few years ago while on the David Letterman show when asked if they ever changed their minds they both replied that yes they did after seeing Slap Shot a second time they both gave it two very big thumbs up.So judge by yourself. Go rent Slap Shot or better yet rent it a second time and who knows you might end up loving it after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true hockey fan can watch this movie every day and recite every line word for word.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the drive-in when it was released in 1977. I had to go to the theater to see it again over and over to be able to hear the dialogue well enough. (I looked older than my age.) These were the days before videos and DVDs. I can recite the movie line for line, word for word. I had a HUGE crush on the Hanson Brothers! I couldn't decide which one I liked the most, and my girlfriends all called me crazy! Hey, I guess I have a thing for the long hair and the glasses....This has to be Paul Newman's BEST movie, and he was totally convincing as a hockey coach/player. The Hanson Brothers were the funniest guys I have ever seen or heard ever!! Their scene with the toy slot cars is hilarious, a totally a classic scene. The movie was so realistic. I grew up in a hockey town surrounded by hockey players in my neighborhood, so I was impressed. They couldn't have cast this movie any better. The use of real-life hockey players and former/retired players from the minor leagues was a great idea. Things were way different back in the helmetless era of hockey, which was just winding down at about the time the movie was supposed to take place. Everything about hockey was more exciting back then. I was so impressed that a woman, Nancy Dowd, wrote this screenplay. She really humanized the players, not just portray them as "goons." I thought that the swearing and constant cursing throughout the film only added to its charm. Most guys talk like that in that kind of environment anyway. It seemed so real. Buy or Rent this movie, pop some corn and get yourself a stinkin' rootbeer (or just beer!), and watch "Puck Talk with the Hansons" on the bonus features, too! You will laugh through it from beginning to end, even if you aren't a hockey fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hansons don't disappoint, but the movie does...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When forced to admit to my hockey-playing friends that I had never seen "Slap Shot", I was always greeted by a slapping of the forehead and the admonishment that I simply MUST go rent it and experience the best hockey movie ever. I did this, and I hate to admit that I was disappointed by a movie that so many people seem to love so much. Almost from the very beginning of the movie, I wasn't sure if I was watching a drama or a broad physical comedy, and this is a main beef I have with many of these 70's films. Too many of them would mix dramatics with humor in a way that is not satisfying to me. The story is very rambling until the Hansons arrive and I hungered to see them do funny things like beat people up in creative ways, but that is a long ways in the coming after their introduction. Paul Newman sees the "Boys" playing with their slot cars and comments that they "brought their TOYS with them!" on the road trip. This is funny and should have been explored more, but it isn't. As a matter of fact, the Hanson's and their background are not explored at all, and they have a small amount of total screen time. This is too bad because they are the best part of the movie. Paul Newman is a great actor and he plays a well-worn old player who is on the slide down in his career just as the steel town they play in is on a slide down with everyone becoming laid-off. But if you are like me and want to see cool hockey footage of guys playing without helmets, wacky stuff happening at the rink, the Hanson brothers doing their thing, etc. , there just isn't enough of it there. If this movie was made today, there would be less social commentary, less human interest, more Hansons, and more hockey. And, sadly, it would probably be a better movie because of it. See it so you know what it is to "put on the foil , Coach", and so your friends don't slap their foreheads when you say you haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>depressing "slice of life" movie - but NOT a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was improperly prepared for this film. I was told it was a comedy. I found nothing amusing. I then decided it must be a inspirational/message film about team work, ethical playing, violence, trying to make money by any means necessary, a gender and class commentary. Maybe just a commentary on violence, sportsmanship and game playing. Wrong again. If I had just been told it was JUST a film showing what life was like in a minor hockey league in the 70's I might've appreciated it more instead of looking for humor or meaning. There is no payoff. No growth in the characters (in fact they degenerate into nothing but goons).It was just a sad movie about some pathetic losers who were losing their dreams, their livelihood and their spouses. Very few of the hockey players were likable people so it was hard to keep watching when you don't care what happens to them. I think Paul Newman's character was supposed to be sympathetic but I thought he was just selfish and rather despicable.There were so many sideplots that could have been developed and would have interested me more. A town losing it's entire point of existence? Barely mentioned. The alienation and clinical depression of the wives? Shown, but not really addressed - just a given. A few hints at a critique of the violence taking over the sport - but in the end there was just an embrace of the new "style".It's also hard to watch from a modern sensibility. Having spent decades trying to overcome the sexism and homophobia of previous times-I really have no desire to return to those days (though it might be instructional for younger audiences who have no idea what it used to be like). The epithet F*G and the word lesbian used as an insult were pretty much the entire dialogue. While I respect that it is probably an accurate reflection of the times and the dialogue - I no longer find it funny.***SPOILER***The end was just sad. Watching them give up on sportsmanship; lose their jobs (was Newman lying about his new gig like he'd lied about most of the rest?);and delude themselves into thinking they'd stay with their wives. Nothing/nobody had changed (or at least not for the better). I saw this film as an indictment of hockey - not as a positive fan tribute as it seems most of the other commenters saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slapshot has not aged well - only Hansons score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too often Slapshot is mentioned at the top of such lists as: best sports comedy, best sports movie, best hockey movie etc. - sometimes even best comedy. I recently saw it again after many years and it has not aged well. The main problem is with the script and dialogue and that is a very serious problem. I appreciate the main plot and themes of a minor league hockey team struggling to survive, but the actions and events are very contrived, especially the climactic striptease scene. The other "comic" actions and the "comedic" dialogue don't just fall flat, but they are outright embarrassing. Even Paul Newman manages to induce cringes. The only redeeming parts of the movie, and the reason for my score of "3" is the appearance of the three "Hanson" brothers. Played by actual pro hockey players, the scenes where they are prominent are a joy to watch. Not only is it obvious that they are very good players and skaters, but their comic scenes are the only genuinely funny scenes in the movie. The only reason to watch Slapshot is to observe the "Hanson" brothers in action. They don't appear until nearly halfway through and they only have about a half dozen short scenes - so keep your thumb near fast forward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly original movie. Newman proves yet again why he's the best actor of all time in this seedy, hilarious little slice of hockey heaven. Plenty of great movies since owe a debt of gratitude to it, including Fargo and Almost Famous. This movie really tells it like it is in a way that seems to have been forgotten. The script zings along like they're all just making it up off the top of their heads. Truly inspired and probably slightly shocking to today's audiences. Even better, there are no clunky sentimental plot threads. The "romantic" story lines are realistic and touching in a blunt sort of way that really rings true. Fun and crazy sure, but also hugely influential and important. One of the ten greatest movies of all time, no question. Go the Hanson brothers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up as a kid who played all kind of sports, there are usually two sets of movies that you can watch to get some fun out of them. For instance kids will watch The Sandlot while adults watch Major League and kids will watch Little Giants while adults watch The Longest Yard. This movie is the adults hockey movie to combat The Mighty Ducks.The story is a struggling independent hockey league franchise is about to go down the drain until the player/coach (played by Paul Newman) gets the idea to spice the game up with trash talking, constant fighting and vicious violence.Think about that, back when I was a kid most of the kids who liked hockey were watching Mighty Ducks to learn how to skate and stuff like that I was watching Slapshot, learning how to curse and beat people up. The Bash Brothers or The Hanson Brothers....hey cake-eater or hey hanrahan, it was a great time.Back to Slapshot, it was so hilarious watching Paul Newman shout invectives at a goalie about his lesbian wife. You have to watch this movie to love the feel and atmosphere, its a great one.9 out of 10 (would have been 10 but the soundtrack puts me to sleep)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Guy's Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slap Shot is not your typical Paul Newman movie. Although Newman's addition to the movie makes it somewhat serious, this is by far a different sports comedy in its own right. Listed as one of the top ten "guy" movies on several if not most top ten lists, the rules are broken as a struggling hockey team fights on and off the ice in this crazy comedy. While the story has more to it than that, it is the characters of the movie that has made this somewhat of a cult classic. It's safe to say that every sports bar in American has a picture of the Hanson Brothers above or near the bar. For hockey fans, this is the best hockey movie ever made. For Newman fans, this is one of his more interesting, yet challenging films. While on the bus, off the rink and during the games, the audience relates to their struggle and the hilarious bond the team shares as brothers. Newman leads a cast of jokesters in this comedy "classic" if not soon to be classic. Don't take this movie too serious, the point of the movie is to make you laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some artists paint in oils. Hockey players paint in curses. There had never really been the ultimate hockey movie before Slap Shot came out in 1977. As a matter of fact, I don't know if there was a hockey movie before 1977. It does not matter, as Slap Shot is the only hockey movie worth discussing. Hockey is a funny sport. It has lots of action, fighting, men who drink buckets of beer. Why has this not become a more popular sport??????? All of the charm of being in the world of hockey is captured in this movie, written by Nancy Dowd (North Dallas Forty, Ordinary People) and directed by George Roy Hill (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting), on ice action is only matched by off ice shenanigans involving a minor league hockey team that will be folding at the end of the season. Paul Newman plays an old, ready-to-retire-4-years-ago player coach who has to motivate a bad team that is about to fold after the local plant shuts down. The lasting image of the movie is of course The Hanson Brother, 3 lugnuts straight out of Canada who only know how to fight. Their fighting leads the team into a "new attitude" that makes them the most feared team in the entire league. They ride the fighting all the way to the top, at the expense of self pride in some of the players. There is lots of cursing, but it roughly captures the spirit of a hockey game, so don't be put-off by the four letter words. You also do not have to be a hockey fan to get the movie either. There is enough human aspects to the movie to entertain most audiences, and the comedy is brash and hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hockey of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched the movie again. It is a very witty movie that comments a lot, not only about hockey, but the American way of living in general and the average man as a part of it. The minor league hockey team in a small industrial town is in trouble. The team has obviously no future as well as their home town. Factory is closing down. People are losing jobs. Today, when every pro sportsman seems to be a zillionaire, it is quite surprising and refreshing to see how Slap Shot portraits the faceless and nameless minor league players as average working joes. Clever coach/player Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) develops a new disinformation and game strategy to help the team survive. Women of hockey are portrayed as a three types. Reggie Dunlop's wife Francine is already on separating stage and will eventually leave his husband and hockey for good, Wife 2 is a solid figure who has accepted her role as a hockey wife, and Lily, whose husband is a skillful scorer and a sissy player Ben, will have in the end finally closer ties to his man than ever before. Part of coach's new strategy is to play hard, even criminally, and that is illustrated by the retarded Hanson brothers, who use every illegal trick imaginable. Team begins to win. They draw fans. Violence draws the attention. Violence is a way to gain followers. The main figures are men, so there are many male references to sex but naturally it doesn't belong to the ice rink, until at very last moment, when Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) starts his famous strip tease number. The Syracuse Captain Hook type sees it as blasphemous. That eventually leads to the Charlestown's victory. Hockey as an example? TV as an example? When Reggie Dunlop finally finds his way to the owner of the team, he will hear the owner's kids are not allowed to watch hockey. The owner believes - categorically and straightforward way - that it gives harmful ideas. Right after that scene Reggie Dunlop hears on his car radio how one of his players, nicknamed "The Killer", praises his religion and peace of mind! When the hard hockey guys gather to the bar, what show are they watching on TV? A melodramatic romantic soap opera. Things are not so simple indeed. What Slap Shot really brings home, is the idea that the whole thing called "hockey", as any performance for the audience, is just a set of patterns. Violent patterns by Hanson Brothers are as possible as those blasphemous patterns by Ned Braden. If the coach Reggie Dunlop could dictate the rules, he would like to show class and play "old time hockey", but that idea leads to disaster in the first period of the final game. It's too late. Let's find out something else. Finally, in the victory parade, where whole township gathers to celebrate, we see the military bands, old war veterans, and they receive the victorious team as winning soldiers. This is the base where sports as well as every competition has been founded. To defeat the enemy and every obstacle. It is useless to criticize just hockey, in the case someone wishes to do so. It is just a part of society. And as we have very clearly seen, the hockey individuals are individuals from sex maniacs to followers of Eastern mystics. To make a generalization here, any generalization, is false. Essentially, whatever Slap Shot tells about "hockey", it tells about life. That's why it's such a great movie, and darn funny too. And finally, has there truly ever been winners and losers in the game of life?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I love to pop in this movie every so often and laugh together with this rag-tag group of hockey players that turn around the fortunes of a season with a physical, violent style of play. The movie does drag at some times, but there are plenty of laughs, especially from the on-ice action that does not always revolve around the game. Most impressive is the extraordinary number of characters on the club that are so memorable: the infamous - need I saw more? - Hanson brothers, Denis and his difficulty with the English language, Morris and his unhealthy fascination with the opposite sex, Dave "Killer" Carlson and his pursuit of Zen, and Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) who works every corner to save the club from folding. It's "The Bad News Bears" on ice and it's worth sitting through at least once.Four out of five stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slapshot is my favorite sports movie for a lot of reasons, but the one that sticks out the most is this: it is not like every other run-of-the-mill sports films. Unlike Major League or Unnecessary Roughness [both of which I like], it isn't about a bunch of misfits who stink but then find the will and way to win. Slapshot is about a bunch of guys who have the talent to win but can't, but eventually find the way. In the first game, we see that Ned Braden is the league's leading scorer. A few guys speak little English, which would add to their troubles. The team had some hope. Yes, it wasn't until the Hansens showed up that the team started to win, but the Hansens brought in a whole new aspect to the movie: to play fairly and lose, or to play the dirtiest hockey ever and win the whole thing? Another thing that makes it great is that its not a pro team, instead its a minor league in some part of America, we don't know where. Another great thing about Slapshot is that the only person you've ever heard of or seen before or after is Paul Newman, who isn't even the most popular character! Slap Shot is without a doubt, the greatest hockey movie ever made. If profanity and violence are your thing, that this is your movie! If you are a major hockey buff, this is your film! If you like to laugh, this is your moving picture! It seems like massive beatings are handed out by the second! Enough blood to fill a small swimming pool... not to mention enough profanity to last for the rest of your life... but hey, that's hockey! Any hockey fan will tell you that this movie is the best in the genre, so why should I tell you different? Also Slap Shot" takes the time to investigate an array of pro sports themes: sadistic player violence; boorish sexuality; fan behavior; fan loyalty to athletes and vice-versa (or total absence thereof); the bloodless, detached world of athletic club ownership. But the film is better than the snide satire it has been portrayed to be, and in its own manic way, it conveys much of the joy of sports. That was what made some of the films of the 70's great. They weren't the predictable fare we see today. Big stars weren't above making character movies or just having some plain old, goofy fun. What other decade gave you Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now and Superman? "Slap Shot" is a movie that is more than the foul language or the violence. It's about a hockey team's last ditch effort to save itself. Reggie Dunlop may con and manipulate his way to the championship, but that's what is great about his character and this movie, and that is the psychology within. There's something in all of us that is like Dunlop and his players...we're all underdogs, we fight for what we believe in and may even be a little underhanded to get to where we need to get. More important, Dunlop has something to prove...that he can be a winner, and he can be successful. It's what he wants for himself, and for his players. Also the characters and the subplots still have me laughing out loud: Dunlop putting a bounty on a competing player's head, the rug-wearing radio announcer (wonderfully played by Andrew Duncan), the French Canadian goaltender (Yvon Barrette) , the underhanded general manager (the late, great Strother Martin), the unexpected striptease by the Chiefs leading scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) which catches many players, who were beating each other on the ice, totally off guard. I love the line by Ogle Oglethorpe (Ned Dowd, Nancy's brother) after beating up a Chief player and then seeing Braden taking his uniform off: "This is disgusting...." How about that for irony! The only thing that could improve this movie is for their to be more Hansons arrive and to see them do funny things like beat people up in creative ways Paul Newman sees the "Boys" playing with their slot cars and comments that they "brought their TOYS with them!" on the road trip. This is funny and should have been explored more, but it isn't. As a matter of fact, the Hanson's and their background are not explored at all, and they have a small amount of total screen time.

		<fullReview>In the history of cinema, there has been a lot of movies based on the sports of football and baseball. It wasn't until 1977 when a hockey movie came into existence. Although hockey movies are still a rarity, you can't fault this one for that reason; after all, one of Hollywood's greatest actors is the star.Paul Newman plays Reggie Dunlop, the player-coach of a low minor league hockey team called the Charlestown Chiefs. His team is in danger of folding because the owner is cheap, attendance is low, and the local mill in the city is closing down. Also, there's some apathy on his squad (unhappy marriages, despair, unhappiness with the management) as well. Along with a poor record, the team decides to change its image by relying on a violent, brutal, bloody brand of hockey that would make the Broad Street Bullies proud and scare off the Jaromir Jagrs of the world.There are plenty of colorful characters here, such as Denis the goalie, a French-Canadian who speaks in hilarious broken English, and Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean), a Princeton graduate who's on the team so he can still play hockey despite the objections of his wife. Of course, the most famous of the outcasts are The Hanson brothers, three goons who introduce that brand of hockey that turns around the fortunes of The Chiefs.The acting is very good and the story is interesting. However, the humour isn't as good as it was in 1977, it hasn't dated well; but there are still some good bits, especially the hockey games, It's a bit more darker, but a feel-good movie all the same. The movie was the first to have an script with liberal profanity used normally, sexually, and scatalogically, which made the movie unpopular with critics, but it didn't deter people at the box office. Still, not bad.The 25th anniversary edition of Slap Shot has commentary with The Hanson brothers, a special scenes section that features sections of the movies that feature the Hansons, as well as the normal one found on DVDs, a trailer, and a short interview featuring the Hanson brothers. There's a sequel that I might never bother to see, but at least it didn't tone down its content the way Major League did for its sequels; it's rated R by the MPAA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who wants to see Butch Cassidy smash some heads in a hockey rink?George Roy Hill directs Paul Newman yet again (sans Robert Redford) in a violent, smutty, gritty take on... semi-professional hockey? Well, regardless of the unreality of it all, it's still quite a good movie. Newman brings his trademark skill to the role of a seasoned hockey vet determined to turn his losing team around, by any means necessary. I'm no hockey expert, so I have no idea why he hopes to do this by having his players start fights on the ice right before every game, but it works. From his initial tactic (telling a goalie a very interesting fact about his wife) to jail to the final game, it's a film that almost never skews preachy (until, of course, the obligatory final locker room pep talk scene so typical of sports movies) and culminates in a rather unsettling manner involving a hockey uniform.The movie's strength is in its tongue-in-bleeding-cheek humor and fantastic cinematography, as well as (you guessed it) Paul Newman. It'll never be one of my favorites, but it's still something else, really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie fully for the first time ever on video late at night. I wasn't that enthralled by the movie. Paul Newman was not that great or dynamic in this role. I thought the hockey violence was exaggerated, even by hockey standards. The Hanson Brothers were funny, but they were a side story to the plot. The movie seemed awfully dated. I think in 1977, it might have appealed to the libertarian audience who wanted some entertainment. However, today the movie seems awfully dated. I also felt that there was poor character development. You never really got to know what was really going on between the hockey player and his girlfriend. Then, suddenly the young hockey player sees his girlfriend and starts stripping. Is this supposed to be fantasy, reality, or satire. It was never clear. The ending was very confusing. I guess the part I did like was when Newman's character goes to meet the snobbish owner of the team. It really highlighted how business could be so cold and impersonal. In general, I wasn't that impressed by this movie, and found it a bit boring. I don't think that the hockey World is that insane. And if this was supposed to be comedy, the creators of this movie couldn't decide whether they were making a comedy or a documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated but funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film helped ruin hockey, most people don't understand that fighting in hockey is usually done to protect the better player from getting hurt form a cheap body check, but enough of the hockey lecture. I seen this movie too many times, but it still makes one laugh. Some of the humor is dated, goes back to the 70's, but its still enjoyable too watch. I love Doctor Hook Mc Craken in this film, he plays a 70's hockey goon perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny movie, one of the few which swearing enhances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good yarn. Good acting by Newman (of course) and the supporting cast. Very amusing movie. Favourite scenes: 1. The 3 "retards" entering the ice-rink and slapping all the opposition players in the faces as they skate past. 2. The sledging (and you reckon the Aussie cricketers are bad). 3. The player who checks himself in the mirror whenever he gets the chance. etc.Even if you don't like swearing in movies you'll agree it is a relevant part of the script in this very enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious hockey comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slap Shot is a very funny flick starring, the always so handsome, Paul Newman, Michael Ontkean and Jennifer Warren with a rather hilarious ending. I was not even meant to be watching it but I did, and it was really really funny. Recommended!Newman, as Reggie Dunlop, is a playing coach for the Charlestown Chiefs, which is a very poor hockey team in the minors. Things are looking better as the Hanson brothers arrive to the club to set things straight (were they ever meant to do so?).However, I can recommend this to everyone with a sense of humor. Now go rent it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has hockey, Paul Newman, and comedy so I gave it thumbs up. It's hard to believe a woman wrote it, considering the foul language, the violence, and the lesbo talk. This is a real hoot, but sends a bad message for goons and thug hockey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hill/Newman Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An original, expertly crafted comedy from the underrated George Roy Hill. Paul Newman plays the captain of an inept semi-professional hockey team trying to stay afloat in a dying industrial town; when the team adds a trio of blood-seeking brothers (alone worth the price of admission), the team's notoriety catches fire with the depressed community. Hill captures this with a flat, no frills, documentary-like style and with Newman's intuitive ability to play on his aging charm, the film is absolutely convincing in its detail. Newman's contribution to cinema cannot be overstated: as an actor growing his immense talent through his beauty, he has given us insight into our preoccupation with our ideals of the American physique throughout its lifespan. He insists that aging has its grace and comedy and he's ruthless when it comes to examining himself. Hill also deserves credit for presenting Nancy Dowd's well-written screenplay directly and with a sense of timing that causes you to double over with laughter even as you're affected by the characters' plights. A masterpiece that underneath its knowing smirk lies a sense of childlike innocence in presenting things as seen, without embellishment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love hockey, so this movie hits all the right notes. Hanson's are hilarious as the fighting players, and Newman is funny as well as the long-suffering coach. The opening scenes are too funny as well. Watch for hilarious fun, and if you are a hockey fan like me it is even better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails At Either Comedy Or Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it at a house party last night. I heard it was a classic, but unfortunately I wasn't very impressed. It had some laughs, and was farcical in parts, but not enough to make this film a genuine comedy, and it didn't work as a drama either.None of the characters are really developed or win our sympathy. The coach's marriage has fallen apart, but why shouldn't it have? He's quite an obnoxious hole, really. The Hansons add comic relief by being overgrown boys who happen to be extremely dirty players, and they induce the rest of the team to do the same and they start winning by abandoning their former clean play, though one player stops playing in disgusted reaction. On top of that, the movie is full of profanity, nudity, vulgarity, and cheap homosexual jokes. Anger at the woman who was about to let the Chiefs fold for profit is one thing, but calling her little boy a fag who would suck cock when he got older was genuinely ugly.Lowbrow entertainment can be funny; this isn't the case here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Convoluted script didn't make me laugh enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With so much adulation heaped on this 1977 satire of minor league hockey, this critic was prepared to laugh hysterically. But sadly there were only a few big laughs and some muted chuckling that escaped my lips. All the makings were here for a terrific sports movie. It's just too bad the film tried to do so much else when it should have just stuck with the on-ice antics or the antics on the road trips. The locations, wardrobe, and cheapness of minor league hockey at that time are all spot-on. The dialog is crude; scandalously so for the time it was released. But that's the way these guys would have talked to one another. The Hansons...... oh those Hansons! Absolutely hilarious! But why so much time dedicated to the wives and girlfriends??? Paul Newman is top billed here as player/coach Reggie Dunlop, a man who was once a great player but is now barely hanging on in both respects. His team stinks, his wife has left him, and he just seems helpless. And that's part of the problem with Newman in this film. He really doesn't add up to much. The supporting characters seem to get all the interesting lines and things to do. By the end of the film, the viewer could certainly care less if he wins his wife back even though we are constantly brow-beaten by this subplot. We are led to believe that he is sleeping with a teammate's wife, but this subplot also seems to go nowhere. Strother Martin steals every scene away from the blue-eyed star as well.I don't know if the film meanders mostly because a woman wrote this script or what exactly is the deal. Since her brother had experience as a hockey player, she should have just stuck with the team and their plight. Too much time is wasted on relationships that end up having no bearing on the team's performance. There is much made initially about the town's main factory closing, and then this is dropped too. There is much talk about the team perhaps moving to Florida, but this is just a ruse devised by Newman.... for who knows what reason. It just isn't clear what any character's motivation is. The film churns on for just over two hours and really, besides the parts with the Hanson's antics, turns out to be much ado about nothing. Is this a sports movie, a relationship movie, a social commentary about industrial towns??? Maybe it helps if you're a hockey fan.... 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slap Shot is the comedy film. My father had always told me it was hilarious but I never thought it could beat out such comedies as Happy Gilmore and Blazing Saddles, it has. Slap Shot covers a far-fetched story of a minor league hockey team about to go under.Paul Newman plays their aging coach Reggie Dunlop who is out to win, but after discovering that his team is going to fold at the end of the season, decides to work a new plan of offense. With the help of his players they take a more aggressive plan by fighting, insulting, and swearing with opposing teams to win. In the end they're are able to fight their way to the championship. Along the way, one player (Michael Ontkean) takes a stance against the violent ways and brings about the question of what they're doing is exactly right. Paul Newman is in one of his best roles to date. He acts with enthusiasm and skill and comes up with a great line in every scene. It seemed every time he got angry he said something that made me fall out of my chair laughing. Michael Ontkean is next in his fantastic portrayal of a man taking a stand against violence. But above Newman, above Outkean, are the Hanson brothers. The three idiots of hockey. They're violent, they're stupid, and they're all look like Jesus. They hold the funniest scenes in the movie with the senseless punches and acts they do and even managing to get thrown into jail. I've never laughed so hard in my life. Every scene, every line is funny in its own way. I couldn't' believe it at first. Slap Shot is the tied with Dumb and Dumber as the greatest comedy ever made. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy.Slap Shot. Starring: Paul Newman, Michael Ontkean, Strother Martin, Jeff Carlson, David Hanson, and Steve Carlson.5 out of 5 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe a bit dated in its "shock" value but still very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Slap Shot" caused controversy when it was released in 1977 because it was essentially marketed on the basis that it was the rudest movie you'll ever see - and it starred Hollywood's famous "clean man" icon, Paul Newman.The movie is a bit outdated now in the sense that its "shock" value isn't relevant - it looks tame compared to anything else profane out there (in terms of language) like "Nil By Mouth" or "Casino." However, in terms of humor it still delivers. Paul Newman stars as a hockey coach who tries to revive a dying team - they begin to use on-ice antics such as swearing and violence to help win games.The Hanson Brothers (a trio of nerdy, vulgar players) are responsible for most of the outrageous humor whereas Newman relies more upon the stuff he's always been good at.The overall finished product is hardly great but it's effective. This was yet another George Roy Hill/Paul Newman teaming and it showed once and for all that they really are a terrific duo (like Scorsese and De Niro or Burton and Depp) and even when "Slap Shot" is failing it's still amusing because of Newman's presence and Hill's direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Hockey Movie. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>which when you come right down to it, doesn't really say much. How many other hockey movies are there? Apart from the Mighty Ducks movies, are there ANY other hockey movies? I watched this on VHS last night after hearing so much about it for years. It is poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted apart from Paul Newman, has a completely implausible story, and for God's sake to call it a great hockey movie - the most unrealistic hockey. I grew up in Philly in the '70's at a time when the Flyers were the legendary Broad Street Bullies and they never were half as violent as what is depicted here. I know that this is parody - exaggeration for effect, but the one thing I kept thinking while watching was, "Are there no refs?" The Hanson brothers would have been out of the game inside a minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have seen the future of rock and roll and it is the Hansons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman as foulmouthed captain of bad minor-league hockey team that gains a following when they bring on the legendary Hanson Brothers and shift focus to beating people up. This one is a totally hilarious parody of machismo, without moralizing thank God; there are gestures toward conventional Hollywood morality, but they are almost always brutally undercut. The characters are all recognizable types that you never see portrayed in movies with such rigor, eg the sex-crazed teammate who is also totally disgusting (he keeps wiggling his tongue). And now I understand why the Hansons are punk-rock heroes, they are absolute superstars in the Warhol sense of the word. An American film that actually refers to Peterborough, Ontario by name; meanwhile Canadian features were doing everything possible to conceal where they were made in the name of being more like American films! Oh the irony. NB there is one 'kind but stupid' Francophone which I suppose constitutes a stereotype. And yes, it is Written By A Woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think that this movie is very overrated, I can't support my comments with all this sophisticated movie talk like alot of Imdb users do, but the few things i can say, in laymans terms, is that there was way too much dialogue, too much talking and stuff on the side that nothing to do with anything and not enough hockey, also not enough of the hansen brothers, those guys were hysterical, i was laughing pretty hard in the scene where they all take the ice for the first time and paul newmans line "i cant let them on my team, those guys are retards!" but this movie was nothing like how i thought it was gonna be, it was a dissappointment in my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This is one of the most ill-conceived movies of all time, despite being remade several times: Roy Hill and Newman together after doing Butch Cassidy. It was extreme for its time so far as profanity and violence, though nothing here is remarkable by today's standards.There are a lot of things screwy here: Sometimes it follows a very strict formula, sometimes departing rather radically as if there were two, incompatible scripts tossed together. (The remakes stick to the formula.)Newman never finds his character -- at this point, he's still not a real actor. He only becomes great later. Without an actor to anchor things, everyone goes their own way. Comic and dramatic effects fizzle, except a couple scenes at the beginning that goof on Queebekkers. Then, one slow mudslide into confusion, only slightly distracted by the skating.It's a great example of the power of the writer. No one can overcome a bad script, and writing this sort of thing (social comedy) is too hard for yer average hack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Over The Top Caricature Of Hockey In The 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What do you mean this is a serious game?" asks the referee to one of the players. "This is hockey!" That about sums up the movie. It starts out with an amusing scene of a hockey player (played by an actor using an atrocious French-Canadian accent) "explaining" the rules of hockey to an American TV audience. From that point on the movie becomes a very exaggerated caricature of the game. Made in the era when the "Broad Street Bullies" (the nickname of the Philadelphia Flyers) were brawling their way to two Stanley Cups, this follows the exploits of the Charleston Chiefs and their player-coach (played by Paul Newman). The Chiefs are perennial doormats in the minor league "Federal League" and their owner is about to fold the team when Coach Dunlop stumbles upon the key to success - fight and brawl your way to the top - as a way of making the team attractive to potential buyers. There's references to the battle between those who like the new style and those who want to play "real" hockey "like Eddie Shore" - presumably a deliberate irony, since Shore was a very dirty hockey player in his era. I thought the movie spent too much time on the players' personal lives, although it made the point about the players' wives having to put up with the dreariness of minor league cities, while the players had to put up with the interminable bus rides. This is somewhat amusing, although the caricature gets taken way too far by the end, when the Chiefs' opponents for the championship change their entire roster the night before the championship game to bring in a bunch of toughs, and the player stripping on the ice at the end was just plain dumb. To its credit, the on ice action (when it was portraying hockey rather than hockey fights) was pretty well done, but overall I didn't care much for this. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mess (not recommended)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is as mistaken as a comedy ever got towards thinking moviegoers seeking a few laughs required an elaborate plot (or any plot). There is no scene involving Paul Newman that is funny or interesting. I just didn't care if he repaired his marriage and understood why his wife wouldn't want him back. His character is a doofus. The movies merits and fun have nothing to do with plot or star power. If you're distracted by the snooze-inducing plot, you might miss some funny situations and lines in the middle. The Hansens are a very funny idea especially considering the timeframe; the further development of the anti-hero to the point where they even cease being physically attractive.The 60s anti-establishment viewpoint is eeking into absolutely establishment movies like this. Newman reasons his way to a now untrackable blow-up for unknown reasons. Whenever a laugh is needed you can be sure gay men and women will provide an easy punchline. The combative Lyndsey Crouse subplot is wrong-headed in every way. To see Jill Clayburgh young, playing this dumb, horny role is strange and unpleasant. Michael Ontkean plays a constipated pretty boy. God the 70s were hideous. Awful sound recording/mixing and really ugly technicolor process.Dozens of sports movie tried to recapture it's success. I love the movie Bull Durham but I had no idea how much of it's vibe Ron Shelton stole from this. Bull Durham is a virtual reshuffling of scenes from Slapshot.</fullReview>
