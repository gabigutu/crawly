		<shortDescription>A Memorable and Intense Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of film that invites much thought during and afterward. The story leads you to constantly question what is really happening at any given moment, and whenever you are certain that you know exactly what is going to happen, something new appears to make you question that. There is a powerful and intense atmosphere of dread and stress throughout, all building to a terrifying conclusion, but I was taken unawares by how emotional the whole thing would be. This is a very poignant film. The characters seem real, and the performances are excellent, especially from the lead, Logan Marshall-Green. This film casts a very potent spell and I can say that days later I am still thinking about it. I can't think of anything quite like it. It certainly made me frightened to visit California.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A powerful feature film. Despite some reminiscence (group of friends, dinner, the house atmosphere, colors) with "Coherence" is undoubtedly an original movie. A very interesting point made by the director (who had already done Girlfight and Jennifer's Body) over a possible processing of the pain of a loss, in a quite denying way, perhaps cynical, reaching extremes of aggressiveness. A lot of tension, making us doubt who you believe (or even what is real) at every step, until the crux of the matter comes; you may wait a little for that, but it's worth it. Point for the director for not using low blows. Worthwhile if you want to spend a very intense time. With regards to actors' work, "Will" comes out unscathed. "Eden" maybe a little artificial, but I think it is an intentional nuance given by the director. The rest comes off well. The screenplay is pretty good. Although it is not revolutionary, the pace is accurate, keeps the suspense, and plays with ambiguity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slow burn horror and tense psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invitation is the new psychological thriller from Karyn Kusama (the superb Girlfight and the awful, messy sci-fi action thriller Aeon Flux, etc) and is a study in delusion, paranoia and suspicion. This is a slow burn horror story about a reunion of old friends that goes horribly wrong. Will (Logan Marshall-Green, recently seen in Madame Bovary, etc) has reluctantly accepted an invitation to attend a dinner party reunion with some old friends at the house he once owned with his ex-wife Eden (Tammy Blanchard). But since their divorce Eden now lives in the house with her new husband David (Michiel Huisman), whom she met on a retreat in Mexico while recovering from a nervous breakdown. Will is still grieving over the tragic death of his son, and is in a fragile emotional state. He begins to feel that something is not quite right about the gathering, but is he unnecessarily paranoid or does he have reason to be concerned? There are early portents that something is wrong, and a palpable air of uneasiness and distrust soon overtakes the gathering. When the hosts insist on playing a rather unsettling parlour game the awkwardness further enhances the growing sense of uneasiness. Writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (Crazy/Beautiful, the dire buddy cop comedy Ride Along, etc) have created a cast of oddball characters to add to the creepy atmosphere. Most of the cast is not that well known, which works in the film's favour. John Carroll Lynch has a vaguely sinister and menacing presence as the mysterious stranger Pruitt. The action is confined to a single location and Kusama makes the most of the claustrophobic setting, slowly ramping up the tension until the film bursts into full on mayhem and carnage. The impact of the final shot is devastatingly effective as the full horror of what is happening is revealed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one blew me away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched this movie, already kinda knowing the feel of the story but wasn't too sure of the premise. But as time progressed, it became crystal clear where this movie was going. This is the kinda of movie that really have you think that people are people, are not people, but live very dark lives, and that, nothing is as it seems. This one blew me away. Even after realizing what this film was about, I was still taken aback of how the story unfolded. This movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. For mature audiences only. Overall I love it, story, characters, even the ending took me by surprise. This is a conversation movie, you know, the kind you talk about after leaving the theater. I'll watch again, this time with friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly tense, oddly realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the score for this film. It doesn't do it any justice, and some of the reviews I've read here don't make valid points in my opinion. So, I felt I owed this film my own review.First of all, the tension: man this thing has a killer build-up! You could call it slow (if you're a Transformers kind of guy), but it never gets "boring". You're on the edge of your seat from the moment the film starts, partly due to a very subtle but creepy soundtrack, which reminded me of sound effects in some of David Lynch's movies. Adding to that is the fantastic performance of Logan Marshall-Green as the tormented Will. He, and the events that follow, will keep you guessing about his mental health and whether his paranoia is justified or not, almost until the end. Michiel Huisman plays the very smooth and lulling host to great effect, and the rest of the group of friends is also very believable and natural.THE scene (no spoilers, you'll know which one I'm talking about when you see it!) was so well done I really had the feeling I was there. It all happens so slow, so eerily apropos, and so jaw-droppingly unexpected that you really get the feeling of "oh my, that could be me out there". The little twist in the last couple of minutes is the cherry on the cake, and makes you even more uncomfortable than you already were.This is a case of an "ignore the scores, just watch it already!" film, and I hope you enjoy it every bit as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant! Great thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invitation is by far the most suspenseful and creepy movie I have seen in a long time. From the very beginning I was pulled into the story and the characters, couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I can't say enough about the actors, they made the characters come alive and you felt something for each of them and their situations. Tammy Blanchard was superb as Eden, the goddess of her own home. Michiel Huisman, as her new man, delivered a fantastic performance as he carefully balanced that line between good and evil. And Logan Marshall-Green made me feel his grief, even before I knew what he was grieving about. The rest of the cast is equally as good. Some of the best moments are between Huisman and Marshall-Green, like two alpha males posturing for the upper hand.This movie really makes you feel uncomfortable with its awkward dinner dialogue and questionable party games. Its a slow burn, but not as slow as I was expecting as the dinner party antics keep you engaged. I loved the pace - I could feel my tension grow and subside along with the scenes. The ending is superb and thankfully not too drawn out. This is one where you say "hold on tight and enjoy the ride".Kudos to Karyn Kusama for giving us this gem that I might just break out at say, a dinner party?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Suspense early on and a Solid Climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invitation will certainly go down as a hidden gem in the thriller/horror genre in the coming months. It was recently released on VOD with damn near no publicity so hopefully word-of-mouth will save this movie. So far it is a critical hit (over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes) and was a hit at the numerous film festivals it premiered at months ago.LMG plays a damaged man who has been through a lot in his life and is still grieving for his past mistakes. He and a few others get invited to a mysterious dinner party where things go from normal to strange very, very quickly. But the interesting thing is only one character (LMG) seems to see the strangeness while everyone else is laughing it up and enjoying the night. It's interesting because he isn't afraid to speak his mind about how he feels the night is going and what he finds 'strange'. But the sad part is, he's seen as a damaged soul so his outbursts are immediately dismissed. It's the subtle clues he notices (something as basic as a drinking game or a bottle of expensive wine) that make The Invitation suspenseful. Tiny clues that leave you guessing that something larger is at play, which may or may not be the case. To say anything more would be potentially spoiling the movie, and with most movies, it's the ending that makes or breaks a movie and this one is no different. The ending is well worth the wait, so if you are a fan of suspenseful movies, this is one of the years must see thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Builds up for Nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, movies like this should not be categorized as horror since it is a thriller at its best. There is a big difference between a thriller and a horror. Movies like 'The Exorcist', 'Paranormal Activity' are horror movies, whereas movies like 'Scream', 'Saw', 'Final Destination' are thrillers.Regarding 'The Invitation', the first 1 hour and 20 minutes just "build up" to what is coming next: 15 minutes of quick and easy deaths.It was very easy to predict what is the "big and unexpected" revelation or twist. The moment they played the video of the dying woman and you realize a cult is involved, it became obvious that a mass murder or suicide was the intention behind the invitation.I was expecting, or let me put it this way, it would have been much more dramatic if the characters were convinced to take their own lives. especially since it was mentioned that "everyone has suffered from a loss". The guy who showed up late for example, imagine that he had arrived 3 hours earlier for real and was convinced to take out his own life on video, and then the tape was played to his girlfriend, who thinks she has nothing to live for and was the first one to do it. I know this might sound a bit crazy, but I think it would have achieved a much better dramatic and intense outcome for viewers.The only surprising element was the ending when they realize that it was not only them in this situation.To sum up, the build up should have been much shorter and more suspenseful, and the last 20 minutes of the movie should have been more intense and better written and directed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the surface level, a very good thriller. It had my heart racing and my palms sweating bullets to the end, and I really appreciated the completely unique approaches to situations we've seen in movies our whole lives. There are many layers to this film but I'll first address the surface. I see many reviews here saying the plot was predictable....... Please understand that knowing that these people were indoctrinated into a cult is necessary. The film didn't really rely on the fact that the bad guys were in a cult to scare the audience. The tension was built and mounted upon knowing this, and slowly seeing the dinner party (red wedding) go from catastrophe to catastrophe without there being a killing spree. You think the killing is going to be around this corner, or that one, but they keep the tension going. This was the scary element (or one of the more obvious ones.) So if you didn't like the movie because it was "too easy to figure out they were in a cult": Congratulations, you're retarded. I noticed a few details; for example, there was red in every scene. There were very delicately placed pillars in very importance scenes; it's funny how Hollywood will leave their clues while explaining very important concepts that are perhaps beyond the storyline of the film. There was a repetitive symbol, which appeared to be an x within a circle (Has many meanings) plastered all over all the windows and many pieces of furniture, while curiously placed on the red lantern (again, very interesting symbolism) hung up in the lawn. The lantern in and of itself is worth mentioning, I can't decide it if signified the blood sacrifice to the ox (x within the circle) or what, but it's significant can't be appreciated here regardless. This film definitely paid attention to details. One of the key details in indicating who made this film and what it is actually about was the six point star not so randomly stitched into the pillow on the couch, seen as soon as will arrived at the house. I liked the sun salutations at the beginning of the (oc)cult video on the laptop, followed by an image of the moon at the end, and I especially liked the aleister Crowley look alike who spoke of his wife, who reminded him of "the morning" and "the light." What interesting descriptors! And then one detail that really spoke to me: David (David was very interesting name choice for historical reasons, he was the father of Solomon) was a music producer. He seemed pretty manipulative to me; David was very manipulative over Eden (also interesting name, nice pure white dress) while the anorexic waif like insane character was obsessed with the aleister Crowley doppelgänger, he clearly had her (psychologically) unde his thumb. And she very clearly had been traumatized from past abuse. Interestingly enough, the movie mentioned "redirecting trauma".. Anyways, According to Eden and David, their program was practiced by thousands of people in la and New York. How interesting. How interesting, that he was a music producer, and the end reveals that he is one of many sacrificing innocents to the ox. A legion, almost! Well played Hollywood. The devil certainly is in the details. Trust me, no one has a clue what your movies are actually about. It's probably better that way. I for one certainly don't explain to people what these movies are truly about anymore, because they'll think I'm insane, maybe not so ironically- just like the main character of the film who could see through the friendly facade and everyone thought he was paranoid. Well played, Hollywood. But that all aside, great acting, great script, score, beautiful cinematography, and a great thriller. I highly recommend this fascinating film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tense thriller that keeps your attention even with a straightforward plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon seeing the trailer for this movie, I thought I had figured it out for the most part. While not explicit in revealing the plot, the scenes and dialogue snippets used give a lot away. As the credits rolled, I was amazed at how much of the movie I had expected, and amazed at how it retained my attention regardless.The movie is set at a dinner party, where most of the guests are friends or their +1s. Once everyone is gathered, it quickly becomes clear that there is an ulterior motive to sending out the invitations. I won't say what that motive is, but you can probably guess from the trailer. The main character is the archetypal unreliable narrator. At any given moment, my opinion of if he was delusional or perfectly reasonable was in constant flux. The tension is maintained throughout, both through the camera work and the soundtrack.The main character continues to cause a scene, and soon the dinner party swells into chaotic action. While much of this is unsurprising, the final scene is what blew me out of the water. Again, I'll say nothing about it, but I was rooted to my seat for countable minutes thinking about what had just occurred. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would you do?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is beautifully acted and the pacing was done beautifully too - a mark of a good director! Early on, the setting starts as a normal get-together with friends - all too familiar when most of us here have experienced this kind of setting. The right mix of diversity was captured well in the film. The main character Will has flashbacks of his son's death and he seemed to be the odd one out not really enjoying the party. He senses that something is not quite right about the event but can his senses be really trusted when he is still grieving about his son's death? Overall, this movie was made very well and it lingers in your thoughts asking what would you have done as a reaction to Will's behaviour. The casting was done correctly in this film and execution is good for a thriller movie. I would recommend this watching with your group of friends while sharing a red wine!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While some invitations shouldn't be accepted in the first place, there are also people you probably should not have invited in the first place. And just like that, you find yourself in a house with a lead we are supposed to care for. And we do feel his struggle, his pain, but also his tendency to kind of lose it. But why you may ask, is this happening? We can't get any more in the head of the lead than we already are, so it's up to you to piece the puzzle.A great lead performance, with a wicked script that constantly is challenging the viewer to guess what is going on. It's wicked in the best sense possible and I certainly will not dive into more "story" (though some would argue I haven't anyhow up until now). But the way this progresses and the more is revealed, the more the viewer is intrigued by what is happening - or sometimes not happening. What and where do we play now? Can we believe what we see and what it ultimately means? This was one of my highlight films of 2015 and I may have added an extra point (so 9/10 may have been applicable too), but I just love how this played out ... literally!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful &amp; suspenseful thriller that keeps you guessing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Karyn Kusama's "The Invitation", is one of the most suspenseful horror thriller's (may not be for the faint of heart) I've since 2008's "The Strangers". With suspense built in ways that will make you physically tense in anticipation while feeling impossibly nervous, this movie will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what the %#^&amp; is going on?!Because trust me. You will think that. What the %#^&amp; is going on?! But you will find yourself genuinely caring about what's actually going down and why.I don't want to tell too much about the plot of the movie. Its best to go into this one knowing its simply about a dinner party.That's it. That's all you need to know. At one point, my jaw muscles were so tense, I had to pause the movie and relax a bit. True story.The cinematography includes dark rich colors, shadows and lots of fun, ingenious camera tricks that makes for beautiful eye candy. My favorites being the slow camera zoom as a story is told by one of the characters in the house and a lovely face-to-face father/son shot. About half-way through the movie, there is a crazily stunning infinity mirror shot of the main character Will, that may actually reflect the way you're feeling at this part of the movie.And we must talk about the main character Will and how ridiculously good looking he is. For any woman (and man, for that matter) out there who is a fan of Tom Hardy, you are in for a pleasant surprise. This man looks like if all of the times Tom Hardy has EVER been hot met the super scruffy, dirty, man hulk, hairy Tom Hardy and they had a lovechild, Logan Marshall-Green would be their spawn. This man is the epitome of the perfect Tom Hardy, if there was such a thing because let's face it, Tom Hardy himself is ridiculously HOT.But that's beside the point. Tom Hardy is NOT in "The Invitation" but a lovechild spawn of him is.There are times in this movie when homeboy Will (or Hottie Hardy) should have left after things were said. I found myself audibly telling him so by yelling at my TV screen. But I reckon if he left, this movie would not exist so therefore he stayed, which made for a most excellent movie. I truly believed everything about everyone but also that nothing was it seemed. The character chemistry was fantastic from Will's suspicion to Eden's sadness to Kira's defeat, with scenes where the tension was so thick that I found myself forgetting to breathe.Theodore Shapiro's music throughout is intensely alluring, gracefully building the suspense and heightening the overall mood to allow the audience to truly get caught up in what the %#^&amp; is going on?!Several scenes were so powerfully sad that they almost made me forget that this was a horror thriller but then something would quickly remind me of just that and I would become nervous all over again. The acting was SO well done and the backstory was told beautifully between flashbacks that easily intensified the entire theme of the movie: grief and how people deal with it."I've been waiting to die ever since the moment it happened". Bravo for this line and the delivery of it.Grief is an overwhelming feeling that everyone deals with differently. Some days are easy to get through and other days are full of the most exhausting anguish there is. But knowing that we all go through our own share of heartache and sadness helps to make it a little easier to realize we're not going through it alone. Small, teeny tiny underlying message of the movie but absolutely not the main focus.What I'm trying to say is "The Invitation" is SUCH an amazing emotional roller-coaster that will keep you guessing until the very end. Fantastically paced with a payoff that you'll be thinking about well after the movie has finished, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as you can.I've watched it four times since my first viewing. And I'm probably going to go watch it again. Excuse me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a small thriller that morphs into a horror picture. There is plenty of back story or baggage as to who and why this group is reunited at a dinner party. Our favorite guest thinks something sinister is going on. Guest are locked in the house with no communications to the outside unless the writer needs him to check a message from a missing guest. Why the cult stuff on computer and the freak out games if the hosts intent is to make this the last dinner party?Guests are poisoned, shot and stabbed, in a bloody killing spree. If you can take the over the top violence there is a great final scene that is so good you may excuse the why not just leave the party when it gets weird or walk out on the movie.It's a small film that was released to home platforms the same day as theatrical release. No need to search this out in a local art house, it will be as good or bad in the comfort of your home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An invitation to accept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Invitation" is a suspenseful, exciting, paranoia inducing, and thrilling film about a group of people who meet at the house of their mutual friend for a dinner party. What follows is an hour and ten minutes of a slow, effective, engaging, and brilliant build up to a disappointing climax, but the buildup alone makes this movie well worth the watch. Logan Marshall-Green plays Will, one of the people who were invited to the dinner party. The thing about the character of Will is that he is legitimately smart and acts like a normal person would act during an increasingly uncomfortable situation. As you, the viewer, start to notice things that are odd, Will does too. The host locks the front door? Will sees that, and calls him out on it. A weird video is shown to the guests that makes everyone uneasy? Not only does Will point out that the video made everyone uneasy, but he also demands to know why in the world that video was even played. He acts so realistically, not like you'd expect someone to act in a horror movie, and because of this he is magnetic. I couldn't take my eyes off of Logan Marshall-Green, and trust me, neither will you. He is a truly talented actor, and in my opinion, his acting made the film. Of course everyone else in the movie does a good job as well. Nobody feels like a fake person or a filler character, and by the end of the film I felt like I had gotten to know each and every character. As the night goes on, as stories are told and as old friendships are rekindled, so do you feel as if you have personally spent time with these people and gotten to know them. And because of this, you really do feel invested into what is going on.The buildup of this movie is also really well done. Some may consider it slow, but I never did. It was consistently riveting and always engaging, and you'll be wondering just how bizarre this dinner party is going to get. And as Will gets more and more paranoid and suspicious of seemingly inconsequential events, so do you share his feelings, worries, and suspicions. The acting is phenomenal, the tension is palpable, and the buildup is masterfully crafted. "The Invitation" is one of the best thrillers I've seen in years, and despite the predictable climax, I would recommend this movie to anybody. Definitely accept this invitation.</fullReview>

Here we have this guy who against all his better judgment accepts an invitation to see his ex-wife, who has been in a nuthouse for two years where she apparently met her new husband. Yeah, sounds like a party!Anyway, the "old gang" (from college?) gather for this reunion and there is the typical (obligatory) progressive, hip melange: interracial and gay couples (who are the most PDA of course) and the whole thing is just stupid.New "friends" are introduced too - all creepy and enough to make anyone who was not already high, get the hell out of there.

I don't know why, but this reminded me so much of the Australian film "The Gift" which I had just seen - low budget, not much happens, but you can't miss a blink. You just know something's gonna go down, and you have to wait and see. It's worth the ride right until the end...I don't want to spoil it for you, but I think you'll have an idea of what's going to happen...a tiny itching feeling in the back of your neck, the hairs rising, little isolated events that just keep going until...all out war is declared.

This movie is exactly like a punch of people who met in the streets of LA and thought like lets make a movie! I mean yeah what the hell! The actors are terrible, they are all a punch of amateurs! The director thinks that he made an artistic brilliant movie! you know those who really struggle to look artistically bad with no story?... The movie is very VERY VERY boring, slower than anything I've ever watched, I'm not even exaggerating when I say that nothing great happened during the first 80 mins! the drama starts only in the last 15 mins and it is not even good! I kept skipping parts of every scene because it's unnecessarily long. I don't have to see him walking for 2 minutes or breathing that long! also the music they use to create suspense doesn't make sense! The way they start the movie is so confusing it's a stupid way of revealing a crappy story.**Spoilers starts here**The opening scene where they hit a coyote is unnecessary. And the whole story doesn't make sense! why would you go to your ex wife's dinner party with your gf at the house that your child died in?! and what's with all the hugging, it made me uncomfortable. I don't think any sane person would stick around with a punch of weirdos that long, I'd leave right away. I don't even understand why the killing happened if it wasn't a cult thing, just because a bold guy on the video asked you to do it?! And the ending scene, I don't even know wtf was that it's like the writer just decided to act like a smart ass all of a sudden, and it wasn't smart nor cool it was DUMB!!!! a wast of time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A serious movie about coping with loss where atmosphere is more important that the plot itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story plays completely at residence of Will's ex-wife. She and her new husband organize a dinner for a few old friends thus inviting Will and his girlfriend. Will finds this dinner party quaint. He starts to notice some weird behavior patterns which make him question the purported reason for the party.But Will is still coping with the loss. He's not completely mentally stable. Other people look so happy, especially his ex-wife. This way movie sets the tone for guessing what might be really happening.There's really not much to the story. For the most part of the movie we watch people hanging out and wait to see if Will is just imagining or is something more serious going on. Those of you who like fast paced movies with evolving plot are not going to like this one.There's a wealth of material for thinking under the hub. The Invitation invites us to think about dealing with loss. Do we have to get rid of the pain no matter what or is it OK to do a little about it? How come some look so happy and strong even after tragedy stroke? This questions are what we should focus on while watching the movie.Yeah, I know it's sometimes boring to watch liberals hanging out. Acting is pretty much average. Characters are profiled superficially. Nevertheless, atmosphere is what matters and it builds slowly and keeps getting more stressful.Overall, if you like psychological thrillers where atmosphere is more important that the plot, I invite you to see The Invitation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gave me nightmares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this last night, and I was totally impressed with it. Normally the cinematography drastically outpaces the story with these types of thrillers, but it wasn't at all the case here. The writing was outstanding-I loved how the host characters subtly ran over social boundaries, from the minute our hero walks into the house. This movie actually affected me personally. As a teenager I was semi involved in a cult- they were trying to recruit me anyways. Fortunately I got out before anything happened, but there's definitely an eerie energy to cult types. It was shocking and unsettling to me how well these filmmakers nailed the creepiness and condescension of people like that, from the weird "talks" about being "distant" to showing their dinner guests a video of a woman dying before everyone even had dinner! And of course, there's the strange aggressive slutty girl who is always around groups like this. I loved that the hero Will was appropriately reacting to all of these inappropriate things. The climax was amazing and had my heart rate jacked. I loved the life affirming things Will said in those moments though. As I said, I watched this last night. I actually had a nightmare about being at this house. All morning I keep thinking about those terrifying red lamps all over the hills, and the sounds of violence. I'm not sure if it's bc I've had experience with cults, or if this would affect someone else in a similar way, but it creeped me out to the core. Thank you for such a vivid movie experience and reminding me to stick with stable friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cult horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a eerie movie revolving around a dinner party. Except this dinner party is with guest that have past scars and trauma they are dealing with. The people that invited the guest claims that it's a place of healing and trying to relieve the pain they are dealing with. Now despite the low budget I thought the cinematography was alright. It even had two actors I recognized. One being that one bald actor that either plays the awkward guy in the group or the complete jerk. And that second guy to play Daenerys bodyguard in "Game of Thrones". So yeah, when it comes down to it this is a cult horror movie but it doesn't depend on taking it to the extreme. Or having gruesome violent scenes to engage the audiences. Instead it takes a more subtle approach by showing bits and pieces of how some people in the house just might be unstable in the head. Overall this is a okay watch, it's main drive is more on picking up bits and pieces of the strange things that are going on over the crazy violence and scare factor.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To The Invitation, I Send My Regrets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invitation is, in a word, irritating. It overflows with unnecessarily jumpy flashbacks and blurred memories in an effort to appear mysterious. The movie wants you to believe that it is complicated and deep. But it isn't. The movie is simple and shallow.The filmmakers spend so much time stuffing our faces with distracting, strange music and even stranger behavior of the dinner guests in an attempt to unnerve viewers. They want you to find the evening weird (which it is) and confusing (which it isn't) so you will have doubts about what will happen (you shouldn't because the answer is obvious).Here is the premise of the movie (I will write this as simplistically as the movie presents it). Old friends who haven't seen each other in years all arrive at a dinner party hosted by one friend and her new husband. The night is basically a reunion except everyone is a little uncomfortable to see each other again. So actually it's just a reunion.As the evening carries on the hosts exhibit increasingly odd behaviors, which make the guests uncomfortable and the protagonist (a bearded, long-haired man named Will) suspicious. The hosts are both awkwardly happy, which the hostess explains is due to their choice to do away with negative emotions. As if human beings can simply choose not to experience any undesirable feelings. Her pontification is extremely irritating to hear and extremely false.Later, the hosts show everyone a video of a 20something year old cancer patient dying and beam about how wonderful it is, how wonderful death is because it is the only way to truly be free."Are you guys in a cult?" One guest blurts the question that needed asking.They are. Obviously. Of course they deny half-heartedly then attempt to distract everyone with a bizarre new party game. I'll spare the details, just know that it makes the guests uncomfortable.After watching this scene, most viewers probably expect the remainder of the movie's plot to play out in a painfully predictable sequence. It does. Once again I will spare the details since certain readers may still want to watch this movie for some reason. Rest assured that nothing will surprise you.I mentioned how much this movie irritated me, and I want to briefly speak on that point once more. I will mention particulars about the opening scene and how it connects with the remainder of the movie. Here we go.*Minor Spoiler Alert* The film opens with a couple (Will and his girlfriend) driving to a dinner party that neither seems particularly excited to attend, a relatable concept for many of us. The car suddenly hits a coyote, in serves as the first jump scare of the movie. Will exits the vehicle to inspect the situation and eventually mercy kills the animal with a tire iron.I am uncertain about the purpose of this scene. Maybe it was merely an unsettling appetizer for the uncomfortable dinner party that followed. Perhaps it was just a red herring, like much of the movie. Maybe it was intended to introduce the cult's message that dying is the only way to escape from pain.Maybe, but I hope not because it's a terrible parallel to the beliefs of the cult member dinner hosts. The coyote's circumstances don't apply at all to any of the attendees of the dinner party. The coyote experiences excruciating pain and will die within minutes. The people were not injured. None of them were hit by cars. None of them are sick. They are going to live healthy and happy lives for the next 40 or 50 years. Sure, they have their struggles, but they will have plenty of opportunities to be happy. The coyote will not.*End of Spoiler* And I'm finished. Sorry for the rant. The whole movie caused me such irritation that I needed to vent to make myself feel better. To avoid similar irritation of your own, I recommend watching something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Startlingly Tense, Clever &amp; Effective, The Invitation Is A Dinner Party You Don't Want To Attend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drenched in never-ending dread, told with striking composure &amp; cleverly playing with the viewers' expectations by neither giving in to their predictions nor discarding it entirely, The Invitation is an expertly crafted, steadily paced &amp; solidly performed thriller that smartly encapsulates its premise with an ominous ambiance from the very beginning and effectively sustains it for the remainder of its runtime.The Invitation tells the story of Will who, along with his girlfriend, is heading to a dinner party at his former house which is being hosted by his ex-wife &amp; her new husband. Still haunted by the tragedy that befell the former couple a few years ago, Will finds himself detached from the rest of the guys and over the course of the evening, begins suspecting that their hosts may have sinister plans in store for everyone.Directed by Karyn Kusama, The Invitation opens with a brief sequence that serves as a warning of more disturbing stuff to come and is splendidly directed. The atmosphere is dark &amp; foreboding, its menacing tone is consistently maintained, and there is always an apprehension that things may go south at any given moment. While majority of characters aren't that interesting, the two leads do exhibit little depth in their arcs.The technical aspects work in tandem to make its predictable premise as effective as possible, for it is aware that viewers may figure out beforehand how things are going to end and then, it makes them wait for the inevitable. And it is this apprehensive element that brings &amp; uplifts its tension to an unbearable level for just when we think that things are about to fall apart, the film takes a sharp turn to make us wait a little more.The slow, steady &amp; fluid movements of camera, in addition to its warm colour palette &amp; low-lighting permeate each frame with incessant bleakness, and the dark, gloomy vibe never leaves the setting at any given moment. Editing is patiently carried out for the most part although the film still feels a tad longer due to its unhurried pace. And then there is this muted presence of Theodore Shapiro's murky score that adds further chills to the experience.Coming to the acting department, the cast comprises of Logan Marshall-Green, Tammy Blanchard, Michiel Huisman, John Carrol Lynch &amp; others who play their roles convincingly. It's easy to mistake Marshall-Green for Tom Hardy &amp; then get impressed by the latter's improved work on his American accent but the lookalike does a solid job with what he's given and delivers an emotionally resonant performance while the rest of the supporting cast play their part accordingly.On an overall scale, The Invitation is an intelligently executed slow-burner that tackles the themes of grief, depression &amp; distrust in a nuanced manner, and is at its best when it toys with the audience's expectations &amp; familiarity with the genre. But its eventual decision to give in to the ending most of us predicted way earlier instead of taking an unconventional route is where it misses out on the opportunity to set itself apart the crowd. Cleverly stimulating the senses &amp; wrapping itself up with a spine-chilling final shot, The Invitation is definitely worth a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>goes beyond the usual "thriller" genre' with its own unique twist . . . very well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a psychological thriller which truly lives up to the genre', and goes beyond with its own unique twist.Yes, it does start out a bit slowly at first, but in this case, this appropriately fits the emergent story quite perfectly.The character studies are remarkably well done, capturing the essence of a collection of friends from various walks of life who are called together for the somewhat mysterious invitation . . . which appears suddenly after several years of absence from the key couple who sent them out.And this is where it begins. No, I won't tell what exactly the invitation is actually for, but let's just say, what starts out as a somewhat awkward reunion with various tensions from the past coming to light as the group comes together, what emerges is something truly, well, terrifying.But not in the usual cookie cutter type thriller plot line. No, this one is different, quite different actually, which makes it truly worth the watch.The emergent premise which becomes evident may seem a bit extreme or unbelievable to some, but actually, this is not that far off from similar situations which have really occurred, and no doubt were the likely inspiration for this production.Karyn Kusama deserves some serious directing credit for pulling this off and really making it work. This production could have turned out to be a cheesy disaster without the right pacing, and emphasis on the emergent psychological traits and fragilities which bubble up to the surface as the night progresses in this scenario.It's a bit difficult to pick exactly who delivers the best acting in their roles, since all was delivered with remarkable accuracy for what was being portrayed, but if anything, Marieh Delfino's "Claire" is chillingly spot on. The desperation to acquire a newly defined version of "normalcy" and resolution via a horrifically bad path towards achieving such is captured perfectly.There is a bit of gore here, but that's not the real point of the film. The real point is the bizarre extremes to which once quasi normal people will drift toward, particularly if seduced under the trance of a charismatic prophet, who propels them to what may seem as bizarrely illogical ends to others, but makes perfect sense to them.Apparent normalcy is a surface veneer, marginally disguising a hideously distorted restructuring of reality, for those who are easily swayed under such circumstances.Trust me on this, there really are people out there who fit this description, and predatory prophets with bizarre agendas who are all too clever at manipulating such vulnerable targets.That is what this film explores and delivers. This is not a "big budget" production by any stretch of the imagination, but for what it is, this is remarkably well crafted.Even if the typical thriller genre' is not your usual cup of tea, you might want to consider watching this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Invitation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not convenient to know too much about The Invitation, in order to preserve all the things its screenplay has to offer. However, thinking about it well, the story is predictable to a certain point, and it doesn't exclusively rely on surprises on unexpected twists. On the opposite, its slow and precise development takes us exactly to where we knew it would take us... but that's exactly what makes the experience intense and satisfactory. In other words, The Invitation is a "slow burn" film, which takes its time to build complex characters through subtle details we have to interpret in order to know their nature and function in the drama. There's some patience required to connect the disparate elements of the screenplay, but once we recognize the narrative territory, things get accelerated in order to take us to an explosive ending. The Invitation represents director Karyn Kusama's late return to independent cinema. In 2000, she earned the admiration of cinematographic industry with Girlfight, her first movie, and she was then hired to develop projects in Hollywood. Unfortunately, her ride through the "big leagues" didn't end up being very satisfactory, since her two mainstream films (Aeon Flux and Jennifer's Body) ended up being critical and commercial failures, something which many people attributed to the interference of executives who didn't comprehend Kusama's singular style. But that belongs to the past; The Invitation allows Kusama to express her vision with all the creative liberties of independent cinema, with the value of approaching a story which is more interested in defining the relationship between the characters than offering us a "scare" every 10 minutes in order to satisfy some marketing requirement. The actors make a perfect work in their roles, bringing absolute conviction to their characters while having a solid chemistry with each other, and by the second half of The Invitation, I had already even forgotten I was watching a film... and that's the best thing I can say about it, something which isn't only a testimony to the talent of the cast and Kusama, but also of co-screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, whose previous credit was the execrable R.I.P.D. (I guess they were also victims of "executive interference"). In conclusion, The Invitation is a very entertaining experience, and I consider it worthy of a recommendation. Besides, it can be employed as a perfect justification not to attend any "dinner with friends". I never get invited anyway...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some good movies don't receive enough attention and end up being classified as underrated. The Invitation, from the director Karyn Kusama, is one of these cases. The less information about the plot the public know the best will be the cinematographic experience. Will (Logan Marshall-Green) was married to Eden (Tammy Blanchard), but after the accidental death of their young son, they divorced and she went away without giving news. Two years later she returns to seek her ex-husband, inviting him and his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) over for a reconciliation dinner, a reunion with the couple's old friends. Sadie (Lindsay Burdge) and Pruitt (John Carroll Lynch), unknown people to Will, are also present in the dinner. Accompanied by her new husband, David (Michiel Huisman), Eden is totally different from what she was before, awakening in Will the suspicion that the hosts have sinister plans against him.The Invitation offers the audience a story with slow pace, projecting drama, suspense and mystery, besides the touch of paranoia that turns out to whet the curiosity of the viewer. As the protagonist we feel increasingly uncomfortable, seeing bad omens everywhere. The house, the visitors and their attitudes begin to arouse doubts and queries.It is worth mentioning the great performances of the entire cast. Will (Logan Marshall-Green), unpredictable and suspicious to the level of almost become paranoid, Eden (Tammy Blanchard) with a melodramatic instinct, Sadie (Lindsay Burdge) extroverted, detached and wild and Pruitt (John Carroll Lynch), with a calm and very peculiar coldness. All these traits, together with a well-dosed soundtrack, arouse an eerie feeling in an environment where everyone seems suspicious. After all, is there a conspiracy or is it just the protagonist imagining things?Originally posted in: http://vikingbyheart.blogspot.com.br</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A kinda psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Invitation" starts off with a bit of violence with the killing of a coyote after Will accidentally runs over it with the car. That cold blood act of killing an animal with bare hands gives us a glimpse of what the character is capable of and he does it without hesitating. After these first 5 minutes I expected the film to build its tension and hoped to be in the edge of my seat halfway through it. However, even though the suspense gets quite intense, the film turns out to have a really slow pace. The showing of the institutional video of the sect Eden and her boyfriend now below to is extremely long and gets boring. The arrival of the character "Pruitt" and the behavior of Sadie makes the viewer as uncomfortable as it makes Will. One good thing this film has is that you build your suspicions hand in hand with the main character and, like that, you start to question everything like he does. We reach the climax at the dinner after having small flashbacks to Eden and Will's life and loss that, in my opinion, should have been a bit more long and revealing. We hear the first gunshot and see two characters die after the toast and then we receive a big dose of tension and fear and shock. But the resolution takes only about 10 minutes and the film ends abruptly leaving you, still in shock, saying "thats it?" To me, the film lacked a lot in the ending and had too much in the beginning. I give it a 6 for the tension and the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable story with good cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to predict most of the plot of this film within the first ten minutes, but somehow still ended up watching it all the way through to the end. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe it was the clever way the film was shot, the camera angles that made otherwise normal situations seem otherworldly and foreboding. Maybe it was because it took far too long for the film to reach its climax. Maybe it was because I kept expecting it to be a little less bleak. Maybe it was the acting that somehow brought trope-laden and potentially flat characters to life. I don't know.The film's redeeming qualities were more in its design than its content. It is not a pleasant film. It is not an easy watch. It is quite thought-provoking, but only inasmuch as the subject matter already was before it was used in the film.Watch it for the acting, the cinematography, and the one redeeming twist at the end. But do not watch it anticipating that you will be surprised by much or be particularly blown away by the story line. Watch it for the discomfort. The sour taste it leaves is probably intentional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Invitation" beckons to an evocative experience both emotional and harrowing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What begins as an emotional exploration of coming to terms with unbearable loss evolves into something even more decidedly dark in the psychological thriller "The Invitation".Logan Marshall-Green ("Prometheus", "As I Lay Dying") is Will, who along with his girlfriend accepts a request to attend a dinner party hosted by his ex-wife and her new husband at the home the former spouses once used to share. The couple's devastatingly tragic past is gradually divulged, soon after which all hell breaks loose in and around the ostentatious house and grounds.Director Karyn Kusama ("Aeon Flux", "Girlfight") deftly guides this deeply unsettling narrative toward a shift in tone that is both abrupt and startling. And her film's jaw-dropping ending delivers absolutely one of the most viciously wicked wallops you're likely to witness in any movie all year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though some may argue the merit of the scene with the coyote as foreshadowing, it was nothing more than superfluous and uncomfortable. Once the protagonist and his girlfriend arrive at a get-together with old friends, it is painfully obvious that something is amiss. It does not take long for the incredulous cult theme to manifest due to the insane appearance and ramblings of the protagonist's ex-wife. The film drags on, attempting to create a mythos or intrigue surrounding "The Invitation" cult that the ex-wife and a few others discovered in Mexico. They proclaim this "invitation" alleviates all sentiments of pain, negativity, and suffering. After some red herring paranoia portrayed by the main character, the film finally reaches the predictable and incredibly dull climax emulating Jonestown in which the guests are served poison (albeit unknowingly to most).I'm certain all involved worked hard to try and produce something of which they could all be proud. However, "The Invitation" simply repeats the stereotypes associated with religious cults rather than bringing anything novel to the narrative.</fullReview>

This film is utterly negative, depressing and for no good reason, by which I mean that the negativity and depression delivered so finely by the characters/story serves no actual purpose. The film is hopelessly empty.On the more technical aspect, the performances of the actors are awful, plot is non existent as it is clear from the beginning till the end what is going on and is summarised in the IMDb description pretty accurately.

		<fullReview>What can I say, but next time leave me off the guest list. Basically this was 99 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. Everything about this movie was sub-par. The writing, directing, editing and the acting were mediocre at best. The premise of the movie is great, but the execution is miserable. Nothing, save for the last 15 minutes, had me captivated or even compelled to keep watching, and I would have stopped, but for some reason I kept expecting it to get better. I kept holding out hope that the last __(insert number of minutes here) minutes of trite drivel are finally justified, but that never truly happened. It was like the world's most boring, slow motion train wreck. Mind you, it isn't the worst film I've seen, but it certainly ranks pretty low on the list. Everything about the plot and supposed twists were pretty evident and foreshadowed obviously. Guy talks about a cult, guess what happens. Guy talks about killing his wife, guess what happens. Guy freaks out over someone missing from the party, guess what happens. And yeah, I had a pretty strong idea of what was going to happen when guy lit the red lamp. In essence, virtually every event in the beginning of the movie may as well have been a neon sign saying "Guess what happens next!".Now, with films like this I never know who to blame, the writer or the editor. But someone needs to choose a different career path, because one of those two elements (or perhaps both) failed spectacularly. There was no actual character development. Nothing to genuinely explain why the main characters behaved the way they did. Oh sure, there was an attempt to do so, but that attempt was shallow and all but worthless. I get that the guy is mourning the loss of his son, that was explained pretty early on, but what's the reason for his bizarre and erratic behavior? Has he always acted that way, or is he still that deeply traumatized by his son's death 2 years earlier? Does he always snoop around people's houses? And why don't we ever see what actually happened to his son? The event itself seems to play pretty heavily to explain his mind set, but it's never fully revealed. Maybe if we knew what happened to his son it would help us relate to this character, but no, we're robbed of that opportunity and he becomes another dull, lifeless character in a dull, lifeless film.Insofar as the directing is concerned, meh, I've seen vastly better. I think, overall, the direction was handled thusly...Director to Actor: "You act crazy and unhinged because this dinner party has reignited your unresolved grief over the loss of your son"Director to other Actors: "You all act like you don't know what his problem is because it wasn't your kid that died in some mysterious fashion"Director to all Actors: "And remember, getting an invitation out of the blue to see a group of people you haven't seen for years after their one of their kids died and was buried isn't slightly odd at all, so act like everything is normal...except for Mr. Unhinged."Since all of the characters have the depth of a puddle, directing this movie doesn't seem like it was much of a challenge, and presumably didn't take any more effort than the writing or editing.Overall, the film has all of the look and feel of either a film school drop-out's mediocre attempt at mediocrity, or a first-year film school student's first project. Either way, not the stuff of legend, and certainly not worth the hype.If your goal is to see an incredibly well thought out and put together film, pick another. If you're really into seeing good concepts ruined tragically, then this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where the hell did this one come from?? ?The best, as they often say, is saved 'til last and that certainly proved to be the case when I caught Sunday night closer The Invitation at the 2015 Mayhem Film Festival in Nottingham UK six months ago. It was one of those rare occasions when a movie proves to be so creepily flesh crawlingly disturbing, that your levels of stress rise to the degree where you want to climb into the screen and scream "Make it stop! Make it stop!" It certainly did for me!Opening with a turbulent car journey, the story introduces us to invitees Will (Logan Marshall Green) and his partner Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi), arriving at his former home in the Hollywood hills. He is gathered with a group of old chums for an evening of fine cuisine and claret on tap hosted by his ex-wife, Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her slimy new beau, David (Michiel Huisman). Anxiety prevails and the atmosphere is still thick with fallout from the 'event' that drove Will and Eden apart.The hosts' have a couple of freaky new friends in attendance too, both of whom add ill-fitting girth to a conversation of new-age enlightenment born from Eden and David's explanation for their two year absence. Tremors of discomfort occur, not least from Will, who strongly begins to suspect his ex-Mrs and her creepy new fancy bit might be up to no good, harbouring sinister intentions for their guests. But as there is evidence to suggest Will may not have his mental faculties in order, his questionable grip on reality may be inducing paranoid delusions of the worst kind...Directing from a faultlessly constructed screenplay by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, helmer Karyn Kusama's very modern day Californian horror yarn plays like a riff on Brian Yuzna's Society gate crashing The Big Chill (albeit with a better soundtrack), locking the audience into a swirling, dreamy toxic whirlpool of wobbly social etiquette versus let's-get-the-hell-out-of-here stigma that will keep you guessing which way it will fall from the first to last.The foundations of the story are built solidly on tragic events of the past and how the different paths people take to cope with personal trauma can lead to not necessarily opting for the best route home. There's also room for subtly humorous social commentary too, bravely poking fun at the money laundering spiritually guided pursuits of rich &amp; gullible desperados residing in CA's tackiest resort. We see a landscape still terrorised by the odious spectres of Manson Family home invasions and Applewhite charlatan mantras casting long dark shadows across the backyard swimming pools and sun-bed patios. All of this is backdrop gravy however, and Kusama is sure never to let it drown out the supper's baton passing queasy mystery-drama into full blown thriller/horror trajectory.Cast iron control is wielded on the twelve strong cast too: the actors may get varying degrees of screen time, but every single character will, at some point, have your full undivided attention. Standouts John Carroll Lynch and Lindsay Burdge as Eden &amp; David's brand new besties, Pruitt and Sadie respectively, will have you writhing in your chair with profound uneasiness, and Corinealdi as 'trophy wife' Kira, blows expectation out of the water when, with immaculate timing, Kusama finally lets her bolt from the stable.But it's Logan Green as Will who really gets under your skin. After vapid fare such as Devil and the disappointing Prometheus, he momentarily looked cursed with a 'We couldn't get Tom Hardy' millstone round his neck, doomed to a career clearing up in third rate fodder passed over by his thespian 'twin'. Not a chance. Coiffured in a 70's style Jesus locks &amp; beard combo, he resembles a young, lean incarnation of The Big Lebowksi's Dude, going the whole distance with a performance worthy of Bridges at his haunted, brilliantly despondent best.And then there's Kusama. Up until now her slim CV - consisting of the acclaimed but forgotten Girlfight, and the unfairly maligned Aeon Flux and Jennifer's Body - had hardly set the world on fire. But she finally delivers on her initial promise with a muscular, mature and expertly nuanced piece of work that, if there's any justice in this sorry little world, will rightly escalate her profile into the ranks of the A- List.Her draw of influences is to be highly commended too where a recent interview had the director citing 1978's Invasion of the Body Snatchers as being at the forefront. The nervy edginess &amp; unearthly autumnal lighting of Phillip Kaufman's remake is perfectly recaptured in texture &amp; tone, not least with Will's explorations of his old residence (courtesy of production designer Almitra Corey's trippy &amp; treacherous interiors) as he spies through door cracks and windows to be frustratingly denied the incriminating evidence he so desperately seeks. This beautifully mirrors Brooke Adams' similar detective antics in IOTBS as she surveys the in clandestine activities of her duplicated pod person fiancée.And just like Kaufman's undervalued masterpiece, Kusama reveals her Ace trump mere moments before the end credits roll with a final reveal outrageous and terrifying enough to freeze the blood, savvily hitting the satirical, lunatic heights of Network and Fight Club's most Iconic beats on its way. This one's a night to remember.Thought-provoking and powerful, The Invitation is a modern day master class in the art of suspense building and an instant classic that deserves to be seen in the cinema on a big screen.

		<fullReview>The Invitation is a film that I did not know of its existence , there decided the chance, and surprises me a lot, it is a good suspense, even with a predictable script, and a slow pace , the film's plot is interesting, the highlight of the film is the excellent performance of Logan Marshall-Green that is much like the actor Tom Hardy , the direction of Karyn Kusama is good, it is good camera rolls , the soundtrack works with the tone of the film , the performances are good , the cast is competent , has very good moments , some very tiring are the film can is tiring for those who do not have patience , but I believe that the last 20 minutes will be worth it , since they are very good , the Invitation it is one of the best 2015 films, has great moments , and quite tense at various times.

		<shortDescription>keeps you fixated on the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is one movie that still makes me think about what happened days after i had watched it . fantastic play and script , the subtle way the director increased the suspense throughout the movie , was incredible . first time i actually researched other movies of the same director and will watch them later . very realistic approach to a creepy story that i believe could happen. the beginning was somewhat strange , but watching further, it all made sense. definitely worth watching and definitely not alone . still i think later you might have a doubt or two when friends you haven't seen in a long time , invite you over . i think the script bears a similarity to infamous historic events from the 70s but i will not mention which as that will spoil the surprise at the end .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Captivating Presentation and Criticism of Masonry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It made me sad that despite of the rich film review of intellectual audience in this site, none of these people mentioned about the element of Masonry in this film. The whole film revolves around the correlation between pain and the way of tackling it which is Masonry. Masonry is initially taken as the "treatment,cure" to the agony and anguish experienced beforehand by the characters. However, it turns out that mostly it wrecks the person instead of salivating him or her. I think it was genius and extraordinary to expand Masonry in this film since it was not something to exploit in film industry.It is initially about sharing something, loving all without judging and without any gender distinctions.But at the end it comes to the fact that it also involves death as redemption and is against human nature and nearly all religions in the world as murder not psychologically recovers you and that no matter how shitty your life is you always get away from death. You hesitate when will you commit suicide or kill a person because its opposing to your nature again. This film puts an argument about Masonry. The pros and cans which will make you decide what Masonry means to you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great thriller that keeps you engaging and guessing all the way till the end. When you think you know whats happenings , its takes a different turn. Even the pace of movie is bit slow , it never leaves u bored , that's what makes the movie more likable . All the characters had their own importance &amp; gave good performances . Especially the lead character Logan Marshall-Green did a great acting and looks like twin brother of Tom Hardy , that shocked me . Even i liked some philosophical touch about pain , grief . The climax is highlight of the movie , it leaves you good impact on you. Finally i want to say "The invitation" is the best thriller of 2015, that keeps you engaging from starting to end .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ultimately, "The Invitation" suggests the idea of an enticing premise that it never quite delivers. The soul-searching dialogue often feels heavy-handed, and once Kusama shifts gears for the bloody finale, the running and screaming automatically yields a lesser kind of movie crammed into the narrative. But it still has sufficient payoff, with a memorable final shot that paints an even broader picture of the lunacy in play.If Kusama's films to date have a single theme linking all of them together, it's that life is a constant battleground, no matter the specifics. That makes "The Invitation" her definitive statement, as it lands on the suggestion that surviving one tumultuous experience only leads to more of the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Invite You to Pass on You're Invitation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not written a review on here in quite sometime, but after watching this film I felt the need to voice out a bit on some thoughts I've had regarding it. First and foremost, I am a huge fan of how horror films are being more legitimized in the last few years and look forward to the merging of more art meaningful stories in creepy and freak out narratives. So this is in no way written with a bias against this genre of cinema, however, when I feel a film is being granted as much praise as this one is and it isn't, in my opinion, quite deserving of it... it's time for some criticism.The Invitation centers around a group of friends who have long since gone their own ways, some due to a tragedy; others just life happenings, meeting up for a reunion of sorts at the house of our main Will and former wife Eden. Will brings his girlfriend Kira with him to the gathering where said friends act all kinds of polite, while try to reconnect and avoid addressing the elephant in the room. Will senses something very off about his ex-wife's new man David and that elephant begins to rear its head more and more as the film paves a path towards it's climactic ending.Without giving too much away at this time, The Invitation is worth it for about the last minute, if that is too much spoiler for you than I apologize, but it almost feels like it is inviting you to a challenge of sorts; a "how much of a slow burn can you tolerate" challenge. With that being said, slow burn films can be amazing, especially in the horror genre. Other horror films like The Witch, or artistic films like Upstream Color, even Primer are perfect examples of low key slow burn films that deliver on their concepts and stories. But The Invitation just keep dragging you along for a ride that you know is going to go south at some point, just at what point? This is so much so that eventually you start thinking to yourself that whatever place it arrives at cannot possibly satisfy enough due to how long it takes to get there.**Potential spoilers** Further harm is done when the emotional pull of the film, mostly regarding a tragic event in the former married life of Will and Eden, is seemingly overshadowed and rendered practically moot by the films third act. To some I guess it all can serve as a way to bottom line the films theme of failure to cope with loss, but everything that ultimately happens at this party will be a far worse loss, with far worse memories gained for everyone involved. No one wouldn't require a massive amount of therapy afterwards. **Actual spoilers** Also, David, again, that new boyfriend dude of Eden, has never met any of these friends of hers beforehand. He is sided with his own group of friends that also don't know anyone prior to their meeting. Choosing their roles to be that of the outsiders makes their involvement in the films big scene take everything to such a clichéd old-school horror level that it bails completely on it's own potential. What do I mean by this? How about it would've been so much more gut-retching and gushing with emotion if this was friends against friends with layered characters and multiple arcs. Histories and agendas that have something to gain and lose from it all? It really blows a chance at something revolutionary in horror cinema in favor of a more accessible and clichéd final act all for the sake of sticking to a much more grounded and less complicated set of themes. **end spoilers**In closing, if you are okay with being dragged for a long ride that pays off at the very very very very end, then by all means watch this movie. It's not horrible, it just doesn't strike me as a film that deserves a lot of the praise it is being given. You have better artsy horror film choices out there in It Follows, The Conjuring, Beyond the Black Rainbow, The Babadook, The Witch, even You're Next. Basically any other well reviewed horror movie of the last few years was serve as a better dish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know more then the little synopsis they written here on IMDb, but i saw that many people seemed to like it so i thought i'll give it a shot... well, i found it to be to long and to boring...The movie is about Will and his new girlfriend/wife ( i don't know which one but it doesn't matter ) who are invited to Wills ex girlfriends and her new husbands house for a dinner party/reunion with some old friends who he hasn't meet for two years, but something doesn't seem right...This movie is way to long for it's own good, the twist ( at least the big twist ) is to easy to figure out to early in to the movie and if you have seen the trailer you might even figure it out even faster because it spoils to much, so once you figured out the twist you are just sitting there waiting for it to happen... and it takes for ever... and that is the movies big weakness, there is so much build up for nothing, our protagonist is such a boring and annoying character to follow, he is suspicious even before they get there and it's just so boring following him around when he is searching for evidence that something might not be right and even more boring since you as a viewer figured it out long before he did! There is nothing about him that makes you rot for him, i wouldn't care if he died ( which he sadly doesn't ) all the other people are much more fun to follow then him which makes me feel so disconnected to the guy. The movie looks great how ever and is well acted, but it's just so boring... so see it if you have trouble sleeping because this movie might help you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert: One of the most thrilling movies I have seen in a long time! Perfect creepy atmosphere and does not tell you where it will end until the last few scenes. What I found surprising is the way they built up the thrill where an uncomfortable dinner party turns into something completely different when one of the guests tells the story of how he murdered his own wife, for example. Some people wrote in their reviews that in the end the outcome was predictable but the main character could just as well be losing his own mind especially due to his past and how the memories of his dead son are all coming back with him being back in his old house with his old social circle. The end was really refreshing as A, the only brown person survived for once and B, there was actually a third person to survive instead of the usual lead role/main couple. Also very proud of my fellow countryman Michiel Huisman for such a wonderful role in where spoke English without anyone ever being able to tell he was born and raised in the Netherlands, way to go man!!Don't trust bad reviews on this one, either competition or just ignorant people who have yet to learn about movies or maybe never will ;)</fullReview>

Drama might be more of the correct category.I watched this movie with a few friends and I kid you not, we all fell asleep, including myself. Perhaps expecting to see a horror, as it's categorized, was the biggest let down. This reminds me of The Big Chill, but with unknowns and less interesting characters. Nothing happens on top of nothing. What I would like to warn people about is this is not a horror nor a thriller by any stretch of your imagination. This is a mundanely slow developing drama. If you're into that, you'd probably enjoy this film. Also if you're having one of those nights that you just can't sleep, this film is guaranteed to do the job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You are invited to...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the last weeks I've been in the mood of watching a (non romantic or comedic) indie movie,but have been struggling to decide on what to watch.Taking a look on IMDb's Classic Film board,I noticed a discussion going on about a creepy indie title,which led to me opening up the invitation.The plot:Driving to a dinner party with his girlfriend Kira,Will runs over a coyote.Finding it still alive from the hit,Will kills the coyote.Arriving at the dinner,Will and Kira meet David and Will's ex-wife Eden (who left Will after they struggled with the death of their son Ty.) Joined by David &amp; Eden's friends Tommy, Miguel,Ben,Claire and Gina,the gang start to get to know each other,Arriving late,David and Eden's friend Pruitt.As Will remembers spending time with Ty in the house,Eden and David gathering everyone up to play a party game.During the party game,Eden and David reveal that they have joined a group called "The Invitation",whose activities include taking peoples last breaths.View on the film:Offering a (false) voice of reason, John Carroll Lynch gives a great performance as Pruitt,whose casual manner Lynch uses to hide a brutal force.Sliding around the house, Tammy Blanchard does very well at breaking the glamour in the façade that Eden protects herself with.Whilst his thick beard is carried with a world-weary sigh on his worn-down face, Logan Marshall-Green fails to fully express the grief on Will's shoulders,with Will's outbursts being hit with a short burst from Green,instead of a lingering,bubbling mood which would have given Will more psychological depth.Set mainly in Eden and David's house,director Karyn Kusama &amp; cinematographer Bobby Shore glaze the title in light amber's which sink the film in a false calming atmosphere which is broken by the bursts of dry blood.Putting everyone round the table,the screenplay by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi passes plates of absurdist chills and dark indie Drama round the table.Although the writers set out the table nicely with death cults and glimpses into a tragic pasts,everything is kept on a separate plate,with the writers blocking the characters from the entwining growth and simmering unease that they each appear to offer,as they all start to regret their invites with death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Karyn Kusama's 'The Invitation' is an Absorbing, Slow-Building Horror-Thriller, that springs a surprise. It may not be "conventional" in terms of its narrative's pacing, but its a rewarding experience, as this one chills &amp; thrills.'The Invitation' Synopsis: While attending a dinner party at his former home, a man thinks his ex-wife and her new husband have sinister intentions for their guests.'The Invitation' is a disturbing story, about a man haunted by his past. What makes it worse for the protagonist, is also his present, when he realizes there is something very wrong happening at a dinner party, with close people around. This is a twisted story, that takes its own time to come the actual crux of the story, but it remains absorbing. The resolution, is definitely shocking &amp; the climatic portions are surely nail-biting. Phil Hay &amp; Matt Manfred's Screenplay is first-rate. Although, despite all the goods, I do wish the Writing was a bit more crisper. Nonetheless, the Writing is superior. Karyn Kusama's Direction is superb. She nicely treats the eerie narrative &amp; maintains the mood throughout. Bobby Shore's Cinematography creates the claustrophobic mood, perfectly. Editing is sharp. Art &amp; Costume Design are good. Background Score is mention-worthy.Performance-Wise: Logan Marshall-Green leads the show. As the protagonist stuck in nightmares &amp; in one himself, he's Excellent. Tammy Blanchard is top-notch, while John Carroll Lynch is creepy to the core. The Supporting Actors, all of them, are tremendous as well. On the whole, 'The Invitation' deserves a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film seems to be splitting people into lovers or solid haters. I honestly was so surprised by this movie. I put it on expecting to be let down by so many other recent Hollywood horror films (eg. The Boy, The Witch) however it really did stick with me. I think apart of this is that its such a small film with a limited budget. It has fairly unknown actors but shines bright with its eerie atmosphere. Yes it is a slow burner and takes a while for you to care about the characters but the film has a way of making you feel seriously freaked out and then perfectly safe, just to creep the hell out of you again two minutes later. I really enjoyed it and loved the big climax and the final scene. People are being harsh. I really think its worth a watch. It's not terrifying, more curious and keeps you guessing until the very end. I loved it.</fullReview>

This movie not only builds itself up on bizarre grounds but also never explaining anything.There is an array of characters, all without any story. There's also going to be some hope for sensual drama, but don't hope for too much there too. The characters are so non-relatable that you not care for what's happening to them in the movie. The movie keeps you hoping for a thrilling end but believe me nothing will ever happen. The only good thing about The Invitation, like it is for the guests, is the imaginary smell of good wine.

		<fullReview>This didn't do a thing for me. Half way through it I just found myself not caring what happen to these insipid people who didn't know the difference between a party and a therapy session. To me a party is a happy place, with laughter, dancing. No death films, or deep talks about the death of loved ones. It was more like a wake. I can stay home with my stuff and be happy instead of being in a room full of people who were weird. Even those they called friends didn't seem to have much of a likable personality.Now let me say this...if my ex invite me to anything he's throwing in the old domestic dwelling we called home, after I haven't heard or seen him in two years I wouldn't go. Period. Will knows his ex-wife well enough to know something is off with her which means something is off in general.So of course, no one wants to believe the man in the room who knows ll really well except for three people who are just weird in general and don't fit in. They wouldn't have come if it wasn't for the fact they all loved his ex-wife, who none had heard from in two years.Now as for the Black woman he brought with him and I'm telling you as a Black woman, if my man suggested we go party with his ex I would have said hell no especially if in the entire time we were dating he's never introduced me to not one person at the party before the party. I need to know at least one other person to feel comfortable about walking into the unknown. The unknown being a woman he loved very much once into a home he lived happily in with this woman until they lost a child. Also, if I see my man going through something in general I would have not allowed him to go through it alone and side with these people I didn't know.When he was upset and went the bathroom, I would have been there with him to make sure he was okay and tell him I was ready to go. By the times this character gets to that point, he thinks he's just going through things because of his son's death. So they badly wrote that character's reaction in the beginning because cultural upbringing matters. I figure it wasn't written with a Black woman in mind but they wanted diversity.One of the things I found most irritating is these cult people wanted to die why they felt the need to take others with them. They should have explained their reasoning and a bit far fetched that all of them would be in that same area of town in a large city.The only plus is the two leads were alive and their relationship stronger for it. They both know they loved each other enough to kill for the other to protect them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge disappointment (Contains Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I forked over $6.99 to see this "tense, psychological thriller" on VOD after my newspaper wrote a glowing review. I was extremely disappointed. The filmmakers effectively create a suffocating level of tension and creepiness. The viewer is continually guessing what is really going on. What I imagined was going on was more interesting that what actually happened.**Spoiler Alert**The disturbing tone was set in the first scene when the characters needlessly run over a coyote and then had to kill it to put it out of its misery. Why such gratuitous animal cruelty? It had nothing to do with the story. The climactic ending made me think Quentin Tarantino had wandered on set and decided to take over. Hello? When did this movie turn into "Django Unchained"? The final scene had me wondering, "Oh, so this is a commentary on violence in our society?" I was actually relieved to be out of that suffocating house with the bars on the windows and the locks on the doors. The sirens were like a breath of fresh air. Whew! There's a world out there. And how exactly were Will and Kira able to carry crazy Eden outside and dump her in the yard when no one could get out of the house during the murderous rampage? Did she have a key in her flowing white gown? (You always know that the character in white is going to be blood soaked before it's all over.)Finally, if I were at that dinner party I would have left within minutes. Granted, some sadistic bald guy who parked behind me would not have let me leave, but at least I would have tried. I kept wondering why everyone stuck around long after it got seriously creepy. It just didn't ring true. I want my money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my gosh... the handful of people who have written good reviews of this must be cast or crew of this movie. To summarize: lame direction, no musical soundtrack whatsoever until the last few minutes, and a nonexistent plot. Poor continuity too, i.e. amateurish, e.g. woman sets wine glass down on table, then cuts to another angle showing her still holding it. And now to the spoiler (which may not be a spoiler at all): There isn't even a hint of a plot for the first 45-50 minutes--it's just some friends sitting around a house talking. Boring stuff too, like: how are you? What have you been up to? Who cares?! So, I skipped ahead toward the end, and.... (spoiler).... lots of stabbing and killing. I did back it up and watch the movie through from where I left, and finally, mercifully, it ends--with a nonsensical, unoriginal scene that the producers undoubtedly thought was clever.The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is the vague anti-cult theme, but that's not even apparent until near the end, i.e. it isn't developed at all. But you do get to watch long videos--on a laptop screen--of some guy talking. Was that supposed to build tension..? I can't imagine.</fullReview>

Really poorly acted too.There is an incredibly attractive man in there for the ladies, an exact replica of Tom Hardy. His character's ex-wife is a pretty good character, but I wondered for the whole movie... "who in their right mind would stay at this "party"?!".I could rant on for a lot longer, but I only need three lines for this one...Bad story. Bad acting. Terrible movie.Oh yeah, one last thing...

My husband watched it with me, or attempted to, but he fell asleep watching it. I think the only thing that kept me awake was the fact that we were snuggling while watching it and my leg fell asleep and I was unable to get up and turn it off.

		<shortDescription>This film makes no sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of the film has a man and his new wife/girlfriend going to a dinner party thrown by his ex-wife (who has just returned from a long time off the grid in Mexico) at his old house- where their son had died. Once they get there some ominous things begin to happen and the happy reasons for the party are fund to be rather quite dark.I am puzzled that this film is getting a solid buzz when the people I saw this with were kind of left scratching their heads. I absolutely hated the film finding it the sort of film where you have to not only suspend disbelief but kill it to have it make sense on any level what so ever. This is the sort of film filled with moments where you can't believe that anyone would be so stupid as to actually go along with any of it beginning with returning to a house haunted by memories to be with a woman you left on questionable terms. Once the cult leader locked the door I lost all respect as no one batted an eye to the obviously ominous way it was done.If you've seen any number of horror films you've been here before, especially anyone that involves a life changing new way of thinking. This was one of the worst films I saw in 2015 largely because it makes no real world sense-with a final denouncement that is beyond ludicrous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie/cult was suppose to alleviate emotions like suffering, pain, etc. BUT it induced anger, frustration n regret for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on a DVD recently. I was excited to watch this after reading some good reviews. I totally regret watching this film and wasting my time. It is simply very very slow, boring and predictable. They spend so much time building up the movie, and nothing happens. Even the cinematography, some decent acting n one redeeming twist at the end cannot compensate for this senseless film. Zero tension n zero thrill. Well it was about some cult. At least they could hav added some titillating erotism, nudity/sex. But nothing. They wasted the character of Lindsay burdge. This film was more like a cult giving discourse in life, death, emotions n to let go. *uck man, too boring. This cult/movie was suppose to alleviate all sentiments of pain, negativity, and suffering, but rather it induced anger, frustation n regret. There's really nothing more to say about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Los Angeles, Will (Logan Marshall-Green) is driving to a dinner party with his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) invited by his ex-wife Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her new husband David (Michiel Huisman). Will and Eden were in love with each other but when their beloved son Ty (Aiden Lovekamp) died, Eden vanished. Now she has returned apparently healed with David from Mexico where they participated in a mysterious cult. Eden invites her old friends Gina (Michelle Krusiec), who is waiting for her always late boyfriend Choi (Karl Yune); the gays Tommy (Mike Doyle) and Miguel (Jordi Vilasuso); the couple Ben (Jay Larson) and Claire (Marieh Delfino) for the dinner party. David also invites to the party the promiscuous Sadie (Lindsay Burdge) and the weird Pruitt (John Carroll Lynch) that they have met in the cult. Soon Will notes that the house now have security bars in the windows and David has closed all the exit doors. Further, David is trying to brainwash the guests with messages from his cult. He also finds a strong pill in the bedside table and he suspects David and Eden want to poison the guests. When he finds a message from Choi in his cellular, Will also believes they have killed Gina's boyfriend. Is Will paranoid or having a premonition?"The Invitation" is a low-paced thriller, with a confused beginning and boring in some moments. The mystery is kept to the end and the surprising conclusion is great. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>17 minutes of fun is what you get.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I like suspense movies normally. They build plot and with the right pace, make for great tension. This movie however, drags for about 77 minutes and then packs everything of interest in the last 17 minutes. Not very well acted but plausible story makes for a fair to OK backdrop but a few holes.One, they never really showed you what the invitees learned down Mexico except they filmed a death. Two, who visits their ex they haven't spoken to in 2 years with a new gf in tow and finally, EVERYONE HAS A LANDLINE THAT DOESN'T HAVE PHONE SERVICE A HOUSE THAT SIZE.The end was kinda neat and unexpected. The lanterns all being lit up let you know this was a mass event. The end of the movie makes up for a boring beginning but still just OK to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damn, this is one polarizing movie. Viewers seem to either love it, or hate it. After a watch, I'm going for a six of ten. This isn't an easy movie to pigeonhole. Is it a thriller, or horror? Actually it's both. The plot has been spelled out by many others commenting on this odd flick. My take on reviewing is to attempt interpreting what the director was trying to tell us. While the movie itself has a number of flat sequences, there are enough shock sequences to keep you awake in the latter moments of the enterprise.The opening sequence is simply a foreshadowing of what would occur later. Charles Dickens did this in "A Tale of Two Cities" when a cask of wine is broken in a Parisian street. The wine is blood, soon to be spilled. The killing of the coyote, seen before the titles, is simply something that will come around again by the end of the movie.There is a fair amount of thinly- veiled religious imagery as well. The lead character looks pretty much like the Sunday school Jesus, who's forced to take part in a "last supper". There are any number of such "forshadowing" elements seen here. The color red. The lighting of the lantern. The knife in the red velvet cake. The vapid LA characters seem to be a microcosm of the brainless and easily led new-age hipster drones. The party guests just accept the weird behavior of the hosts, based on a friendship that's a couple of years dead. It's not too hard to see where the movie is going, once "The Invitation" is revealed on a laptop for the guests' amusement...or conversion.Taken in entirety, "The Invitation" is an interesting observation on a number of levels. Obsessive behavior fueled by money. Damaged people giving up to some charlatan guru in the Est fashion. The cross-section of attendees at the dinner party wasn't random, rather, it was an attempt to show a PC ideal of millennials that occupy the Hollywood hills. Some Manson, some Jim Jones, some "self help" pop psychology, and the inevitable arc of useless, lost souls in the Heaven's Gate mode. Death is never pretty, no matter who tells you it is. This isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. Perhaps the mirror it holds up doesn't reflect what the viewer wants to see? Despite it's slow pace, "The Invitation" actually succeeds in a vision of dread.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this story had been adapted to a half hour or hour program like the old " Thriller " or " Outer Limits " or others of that ilk, it may have been highly entertaining, however watching the proceedings for about an hour and a half before things start to really coalesce malevolently is somewhat tortuous. A gang of old friends, essentially a crew of largely narcissistic airheads as usual, gathers at a west coast manse to reflect not too deeply about their lives at the invitation only event. Love is in the air or is that the faint whiff of arsenic? The characters are minimally sketched out, mostly acting like giggling goofballs, yet there seems to be some vague sense of dread as if someone might break out a pi?ata filled with scorpions and venomous spiders. Our protagonist gets his vibes tingled in the nick of time, sniffs out the host's lethal serving up of a Jonestown inspired pousse-cafe' and the action kicks in ... finally. The ultra - violence mode is fairly suspenseful although as the participants expire, we care about the departure of some and others, not so much. Decent acting with a special note of Lindsay Burdge as " Sadie " in her compelling and genuinely disconcerting performance providing some threatening vitality to counter the fatuous party goers. John Carroll Lynch is fine as well in his understated portrayal of the psafe as psorghum psychopath. Menacing iconography in the form of mysterious helicopters and red lanterns suggest an intriguing backstory that may have merited more development but does add to the overall sinister tone of the story. If you're going to a soirée thrown by a returning member of an expatriated cult located in Mexico, I recommend skipping the dessert wine. This is a movie about a cult that will never be a cult movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I made it through to the end of this movie without using fast-forward. That's quite an accomplishment these days. The acting in this film from the main character Will was exceptional. Given that the whole premise of the plot rests on a sense of palpable unease during an otherwise unremarkable dinner party, the creation of that atmosphere relies on this actor's ability to make us believe his paranoia. It worked for me. Having recently read the true story of the Manson murders, I found this movie eerily believable. If you like slower paced thrillers then I'd recommend you give this a go. It's not especially gory; the violence is realistic and the more effective for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to watching it after the "raving" reviews here, but came off feeling really unsatisfied. The acting was good, but the script and dialogue sucks.Had to wait for way over an hour before any real action starts. Even so, it left me with lots of questions unanswered. There were nearly zero tension building up to the finale. I can never understood how people find suspense in it. It would be nice at the end if Eden was the one to explain why it came to be that way. If there were some explanation, at least the film would be saved even if i had to wait over an hour and the last scene would be really horrifying instead of tons of question marks (????) floating above my head.A very unsatisfactory film. 3/10 for the acting and the Charles Manson's family like killing at Sharon Tate's. But do not be mistaken by the comparison, because this is less graphic and with absolutely no explanation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not sure if these are spoilers or not that I wrote...but just in case!This is not a bad movie. It is actually quite good. It is some kind of a suspense thriller and it does keep you guessing and on the verge of the seat most of its second part. And must say that I loved the very ending of the film! It gives an even more chilling feel to the movie ( that is what was happening inside of the house and makes you wonder how many people died and how they were killed in other houses, though it does seem a bit strange and odd that so many houses did light red light and makes you wonder if that neighbourhood was full of some kind of a cult crazy people).The leading role man was really good and believable in his character. However, most of the gathered people were really cliché and I found their acting bad. Also, I find it funny that among gathered people you have black person, gay person and Asian person - all in the name of equality or whatever. Maybe it was not on purpose, but I find it funny.All in all, not bad. Seven from me.I would have loved if the tragedy of the main couple was more told. Also, I would have loved the explanation why would you kill your best friends or close friends - I mean, were they also 'damaged' by some tragedy, so they chose them and wanted to 'light them off their weight? In that case, it would make sense. Otherwise, it would be completely insane and senseless.</fullReview>

The rest of the movie is a battle to not fall asleep, with unstoppable irritating conversations between a bunch of weirdo's.

		<shortDescription>Great movie ruined by silly forewarnings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea is a bunch of friends get invited to this womans home for dinner. She's an old friend who disappeared from their lives after a traumatic experience. Everyone knows going in that it's going to be weird and uncomfortable they do genuinely miss this person. The film tries to focus it's story around little forewarnings and twists to keep you guessing, all the building a kind of thick atmosphere that drags you along with the main character. In that latter part it succeeds brilliantly. The atmosphere, sound and acting for the most part kept even me in the long after I got tired of how ridiculous the characters were being in light of the forewarnings...and that's the problem. The moment in the film where the little warnings start. Instead of it being small things it's like a bomb going off and no one in their right mind would stick around to see if it was a dud and when you watch the supporting character go "well thats weird. more wine?" you just wanna turn it off right then and there. However if you can just turn of your brain and move along with the main character it's quite captivating. So I guess my recommendation is, if you can get past how stupid the movie is, it's worth sticking around for the end. I enjoyed it, no I'd say skip this if you can't stand silly plots. I'd compare this to "The Gift", that recent masterpiece by Joel edgerton. That's how you keep people guessing. This in comparison is almost a comedy in contrived the whole thing is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DO NOT WATCH THIS! It is up there with the worst films ever!Storyline was so diabolical. Acting wasn't the best. Nothing really happened till the end and even then it was predictable. If you want to watch a film about an awkward dinner party that turns out to be the hosts trying to kill the guests because of a cult then by all means watch it. But be disappointed. From start to finish it was dull. The group of friends were made to watch a cult video of someone dying.. only one friend felt uncomfortable and left... no idea what happened to her but she was probably killed by one of the other guests who was part of the cult. Because the poisoning didn't go to plan it turned it to a slasher movie.. not a good slasher movie either. Apparently joining the cult helped the ex-wife come to terms with the death of her son.. but why does she need to take her friends with her to be with him too? Doesn't make sense really.. I'm actually still frustrated with it.. it was just so bad!!Turns out a lot of other houses in the neighbourhood were part of the cult too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is loaded with unnecessary scenes that added no value to the overall plot, throw in some shoddy acting with unexplainable actions and you're left bemused as to whether you missed something or the script was that dumb.Will (the protagonist) arrived at this dinner party suspicious from the get-go. It's like he couldn't wait to get into character (which should happen 30mins in) so he decided to call it in and be suspicious of his ex-wife acting so pleasant. The guests seem to share equal dumbness where they thought nothing of the host suspiciously locking the doors and having their windows barred in the same manner as the state prison.Will happens to wander mysteriously in and out of the house and each time he is caught, the person pretends it's nothing and asks him to join them back to the "party" where everyone seemed to have drank from the Kool-Aid. Just when you thought things couldn't get worse (for the movie) things do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tense slow building atmospheric thriller ably supported by a relatively unknown cast but misses the impact climax it so needed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will (Logan Marshall-Green) gets an invitation from his ex-wife Eden (Tammy Blanchard) regarding a reunion comprising of her current husband David (Michiel Huisman) and a few of their common friends. He overcomes his anxiety in returning to his previous house where he had a very traumatic past and brings his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) along. His paranoia returns after witnessing an unusual sequence of events and behavior especially from some additional friends whom Eden and David invite separately. Will sets up the atmosphere with a silent demeanor but with a rage building inside which is ready to explode anytime. He has a feeling that something is not right about this reunion but his every doubt is countered with a clever interruption or a coincidence. When David and Eden show everyone a video of a religious cult practicing a process where its members meet their departed loved ones, things are not the same.A wafer thin storyline set in a single house requires a strong screenplay and interesting moments to keep the audience engaged - dealt with successfully. There are a few disappointing elements, one of them is its wrong billing as horror genre, its a suspense thriller and a drama at most. And the next is a dud of a climax - very predictable, poorly executed and doesn't pack a shock or impact element it so needed. Its a good effort for a low budget psychological thriller but there are other superior efforts that can easily shadow this. Better movies of a similar genre out there - watch 'Coherence' for a much better experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not for those who need constant action and little attention. This is a movie about subtle yet rising tension. Twists, turns, different directions and loads of questions follow the main character through an awkward and perhaps terrifying dinner party. This is for fans of tension through dialogue, people in a room type dramas that hold your attention through character actions and reactions all while begging the question, "What would you do?" It builds up through most of the movie and then it pays off. The third act is very fulfilling and I came away impressed with the movie. Very impressed. I'm hard to please when it comes to horror / thrillers, otherwise I would have given it an 8 or 9, but a 7/10 from me is a very good score.

The time this movie needs to show you the different background stories and relations between the characters is not in balance with the quick, almost hurried up ending that's just basically a quick showdown of who gets to die and how.The biggest let down for me, besides the ending, was John Carroll Lynch's casting. The man is a great actor but not for the role of Pruitt. Supporting the scenes with that frightening stare of his, almost like a suburban Pennywise, I hoped a more interesting and for the movie more important role for him.My golden rule with this kind of cinema: the ending is everything. And this movie's ending was if anything, too practical. Six out of ten stars, minus one for the wrong casting of the character Pruitt, played by mr. Lynch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Baby! I was excited for it because from the trailer, which thankfully doesn't give away too much, it seemed to be in the vein of Coherence. I pretty much got an endlessly intriguing film. I think that's what makes it work the most, the fact that it's always so interesting. What is really going on under the surface isn't really that surprising and is probably something you can pretty much guess within the first 30 minutes. What's ingenious about it though, is how the film even kind of outright tells you and still doesn't make things black and white until its very last 15 minutes. The way the characters interact is what really drives this thing. The suspenseful and mysterious, ominous tone is incredibly strong and, for a film like this, was always what would be needed the most. I'd say it's much more build-up and much less busy than Coherence, but that film's premise was also more unique and more inventive. The premise here doesn't need to be because the emotional resonance and emotional core is what makes it work. It's essentially a film about the extremes that people will go to, simply to eliminate and alleviate their emotional pain.I would definitely say that the climax is a little too derivative though, of the kinds of slasher chase films that I do not sorely miss at all. I was so ready to mark it significantly down for it, but then it went back to giving attention to what really mattered, which was the shared pain of both Will and Eden. The final moments, them taking her outside, her revealing her one reason for all of this. What she did was awful, but not unlike the kinds of things many people in the real world do. Then that final revelation and final shot. How far will people go to get rid of their misery? Ultimately, I think the film remains to be one of the most tense, paranoia-inducing films of the decade so far. It's drenched in such rich, horrifying atmosphere. It's not perfect, but it is definitely very satisfying. The whole cast is great, but the ultimate MVP is Karyn Kusama for being able to have such a near-masterful control of the entire thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched Karyn Kusama's the Invitation (2015) and was both entertained and stressed. The film is best viewed if one knows very little about the plot so let's just say it's about some people that get invited to a dinner party in LA. Of course, it is a thriller, so there is obviously more to it than that.It reminded me of a few other dinner party films: the Dogme '95 film the Celebration (1998) directed by Thomas Vinterberg, Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game (1939) and the contemporary film The Perfect Host (2010).This film is of course completely original, but definitely fits into the dinner-party-psychodrama category with the above mentioned. What impressed me about the Invitation was also the balance between intense interpersonal drama and tense psychological mind games. I give it 8/10.This review originally appeared at http://paranoidcinephilia.blogspot.com/2016/04/paranoid-cinema- invitation-2015.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are scary thrillers and there are ones where you simply think "Holy kah kah there is a distinct possibility this could happen!". Like other reviewers have said you come up with all kinds of theories but you question yourself when your theory doesn't quite pan out. Then the slow build up becomes a very fast ride towards something you should've seen coming but didn't ever think it could be what transpires.Having to write 10 lines for a review is quite a bit. You don't want to give anything away but you have to write and write in order for your review to become part of the record here.Irregardless, my teeth chattered in the last scene. It's been a long time since I've had that happen! If you enjoy slow build up thrillers then I feel this is one of the better ones and you don't want to miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dinner invite you can skip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A grim slow burning thriller cume horror that never activates the fear button like it could've so easily done, Karyn Kusama's The Invitation is a film that's mildly curious for its first 15 ? 20 minutes but finds itself drawn into an increasingly slow paced mid-section before a fairly bloodthirsty finale tries to make all the hard yards worth the viewer's efforts to lacking results.The Invitation does often threaten to become a finely tuned mixing of thrills, chills and dealing with loss but Kusama can't string the right balance between the facets together and while the cast features somewhat noteworthy faces in the form of Logan Marshall-Green's grieving Will and Tammy Blanchard's newly minted cult member Eden, the film can't find a performer that takes the material by the scruff of the neck and run away with the whole thing even though recognisable character actor John Carroll Lynch (remember, that creepy guy from Zodiac) has a fair bit of fun with his seedy Pruitt, a dinner guest you definitely don't want to see on arrival! It was always going to be a major hurdle for the film with so-so performances and unlikeable characters, as the films slow burn nature means we the viewer are virtually locked away in Eden and her partner David's off putting hill top mansion for the films runtime and while brief moments will shock and make you stand to attention, a large portion of The Invitation's scenes drag out unnecessarily and fail to connect in the ways they were intended to do.Where The Invitation finds some wins is in its initial set up which bleeds ominous dread and terror and while it escalates into something far too silly to be taken seriously the films crescendo of carnage and out right battle for survival certainly makes an impression even if it's too little too late to truly rectify the wrong steps the film has already taken previous to its unleashing.Far better in theory than execution, The Invitation showcases small glimmers of a standout horror/thriller hybrid but can't ever get itself into a genuine run at becoming what it promised to be. A solid idea squandered around mediocre characters and uninteresting portrayals, The Invitation is certainly a dinner evening you don't need to RSVP for.2 coyotes out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Invitation Review: A Sinister Dinner Game that Would Make Hitchcock Proud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.6/5 stars"The Invitation" makes brilliant use of its tense premise to deliver a highly effective and unexpectedly smart slow-burning thriller. The plot is quite simple really, but it's narrated with such a wicked eye and shrewd hand by Director Karyn Kusama that the tension seems all too real and always simmering just beneath the surface, waiting to burst out at any moment, eventually culminating to a jaw- dropping, sinister climax that's wholly rewarding after approximately 90 minutes of buildup.When Will shows up to his ex-wife, Eden, and her new husband, David's, dinner party, he begins to suspect their intentions and even goes to the extent of thinking that the couple have something ominous planned for their guests. In the house that was once his, the haunted Will becomes more and more convinced, with the signs surrounding him, that Eden, her new husband, and her new friends have a mysterious and terrifying agenda for Will and her old friends. But, with Will still coping from the tragic loss of his son ? and Eden having moved on ? his grip on reality and the validity of his doubts come into question. As the evening moves on, things only get murkier for the guests at the house as well as those seated in the theater.If the movie works as well as it does, it's because Kusama adeptly elicits suspense through shadows, silences, and ricocheting looks, and, almost nonchalantly, makes us question Will's and our own suspicions, only to pull the rug from beneath our feat when we least expect it. She ratchets up the tension masterfully, building to a finale that's as chilling as it's brilliant, helped in no small way by a effective cast that's wholly committed to her vision.However, along with being a little gem of a thriller, "The Invitation" also draws some of its mysterious aura from the emotional undercurrent of grief that acts as a major subplot as the suspense unfolds. Besides tantalizing us with wickedly clever plot devices, the movie also takes a fractured look into people desperate to change even if that means becoming different people all together. With this instant winner of an indie flick, Ms. Kusama has more than earned her place at Hollywood's elite table, and not inviting her to dinner would certainly make the affair less appetizing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cripplingly eerie dinner with friends and strangers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Invitation" makes use of a long social gathering with all of its awkward tendencies and double the agonizing pain with eerie talk of propaganda and secret past. This presentation might be slow, but it's certainly effective in creating tension as questionable strangers pop up in a seemingly inescapable and increasingly uneasy soirée.Story follows a group of people invited by Eden (Tammy Blanchard), who was missing for a while and now returns with new company altogether, including a spouse. Will (Logan Marshall-Green) had a particularly dark past with Eden and as the night goes on it becomes clear that something is amiss in the luxurious house he once lived in.Tammy Blanchard plays the troubled female lead impeccably, she appears to be normal yet there's a jarring feeling that she fakes the whole thing. Also, there are occasional ticks, both subtle and straight up outbursts that trigger suspicion. The other guests are just like ordinary people with their odd behaviors and imposing gestures, so it creates a guessing game throughout the night to determine who has the few screws loose.It gets even more surreal when Eden brings an entourage of dubious people, some even blatantly voice their oddities. The movie progresses with anticipation whether this dinner party will turn into Hannibal movie or these people are just normally strange. The tension rises along with revelations from the past, although this aspect can feel a bit dragging at times.For a nice less-than-relaxing times, bizarre propaganda and partially threatening companies, "The Invitation" is readily acceptable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***possible spoilers****I caught this movie at a festival and loved it. The set-up is simple. A group of friends get together for a small party but everything isn't what it seems. Simple, right? -Acting was wonderful, believable, grounded. -the story had a ratcheting sense of tension and dread -the characters felt realistic, three dimensional and "lived in" -the conclusion felt deserved and served the story well. There's a lot to like about this film but it might not be for everyone. It has a deep mystery that reveals itself throughout the film but it's not "action packed". As others have commented it's a slow burn kind of movie that rewards your patience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the reviews of this film, I was excited to rent it. The first fifteen minutes were good, but the film went downhill from there. It was predictable, boring, and drawn out. The actors were very good even though the material wasn't. The film needed a complete rewrite, and a couple of the roles should have been recast while one character should have been eliminated all together. The film was not believable in any sense; you felt the writer was going out of their way to be politically correct: an interracial couple, a gay couple, an Asian couple, and a few other people all come together to attend the dinner party from hell. It was all covered in long, inane conversations between the characters while a disjointed plot attempted to pull it all together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a couple who is invited to a dinner party at a friend's place. They arrive, expecting a reunion of friends, only to find awkward and strange events in the party.The social interaction in the party is certainly very awkward, and the awkwardness lasts for far too long for me to enjoy the film. After an hour into the story, finally there's something to see. Unfortunately the events happen fast and in darkness, there are times when&nbsp; I can hardly figure out what is happening. This is a pity, as the story could have been thrilling and mysterious. It seems many people like this film, but I'm not feeling it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great premise, bad execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very apparent that this is an independent indie film, because it is not a typical thriller (like I hoped it would be). One of the first words I can say is boring, and pretty predictable. They spend so much time building up the movie, and just a little time with what we were looking for: chase scenes, interesting killing and so on. It is an interesting and creepy premise, and a great twist at the end, but the execution was overall bad, and very boring. Wish they spent half the time building it all up, and the rest following the "normal" friends where they tried to escape. Would have been so much more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie left me sitting with my mouth open for a few minutes. I liked the paranoia and ominous vibes throughout - is Will crazy or is something more sinister going on? The ending made it so much scarier for me though - after all the trauma and horror we just witnessed, you mean to say that's going on in multiple homes across LA?! The fact that it wasn't shown explicitly either added to the brilliance of it. The emotion shown really felt real, Will's pain made my heart hurt. You could feel how much his kids death broke him. I also really liked how the film didn't rely on clichés, I didn't see any of it coming and had a lot of fun making wild guesses about what would happen next. Overall I would recommend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main thing "The Invitation" does right is build tension, it has a nice casual tone yet they find little ways to slowly build up tension between the characters. The story is simple but interesting and does a good job of throwing the viewer for loop on a few occasions.Not a whole lot to say about this one since it is hard to really go into detail about it with out spoiling anything, it's one of those films that is probably best enjoyed knowing very little about it, I would suggest not watching the trailer if you haven't yet. They did good job with a low budget: Film is shot very well, the majority of the small cast is believable, and nothing ever looked fake or forced. If you don't mind a slow pace this is definitely worth checking out, one of the better new thrillers I have seen lately. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Element of mystery makes for a fine thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched '10 Cloverfield Lane' and was completely taken off guard at how much I enjoyed it. I went in expecting a standard horror movie and was instead treated to an excellent mystery/thriller that had me guessing until the very end. 'The Invitation' was almost exactly the same experience for me. I went in expecting clichés galore, predictability left right and centre and a bland story that I would forget the moment the credits rolled. Instead I found myself enthralled. Is an element of mystery becoming stock standard in horror/thrillers these days? I certainly hope so. The story is a little slow and could potentially try your patience if you're not in the right frame of mind for it, however I would implore you to stick with it. The person I was watching it with didn't like it and left early, then later when I explained to her what had happened in the second half she was disappointed she had left so early. It's a cast of mostly unknowns so the acting can be a little shaky at times but not to the extent that it ever ruins the experience. All in all this is an above average film that will be very enjoyable to everyone who gives it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent thriller revolving around broken people....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is NOT a horror movie. It is a very suspenseful thriller that builds until your blood pressure is at an unhealthy level.With the exception of the first five minutes, I could not move from my seat. I am glad I stuck with this after that first scene in the road.First of all, I probably would not accept a dinner invite from my ex with my new partner, but that's me. But I digress. Will plays the grief-stricken father with absolute, soulful conviction. His partner, Kiera, is very likable and provides some sanity through the chaos of the other...umm...shall we say, less grounded characters? However, some of the characters could have been more subtle - I mean, they just had "crazytown" written all over them. But I still loved it.The end (and by the end, I mean the last five minutes), was totally unexpected.This movie is a must for lovers of psychological thrillers and/or anyone who has been in such depths of grief that for a time, you would rather have been dead than gone on living with the pain.This movie draws a fine line between cautionary fear and paranoia - good luck telling the difference - it won't be easy with this thrill ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a sensational ride. I was left feeling breathless like I never have in a slow burn thriller.As other reviewers have said before, go into this film knowing absolutely nothing if you can.If you need a brief synopsis I'll keep it simple. Logan Marshall-Green plays Will, a grieving man that is, along with his new girlfriend, invited to a dinner party hosted by his ex-wife and her new husband. Over the course of the night, Will starts to think that something terribly sinister is taking place and he and the audience are left to figure out what, or whether there is any threat at all.The buildup was excruciating and the payoff was immense. I always say the best part of a thriller is the buildup, that excruciating sensation like you are watching something you shouldn't be but can't look away. The Invitation delivers on all fronts. It's character development and script writing are also to be noted. Every character felt real, and the performances, especially from Marshall-Green, were perfect. I found myself admiring everything that came out of his mouth, all his paranoid and suspicious accusations of the many off-putting things he witnesses are all exactly how I would (hope to have) have reacted. To seriously empathise with and respect the thought process and actions of your protagonist is a sign of a adept writing and characterisation.See this film. If you cannot handle the length buildup or get hung up on the nitty gritty details of it's shocking conclusion, you're not for this film. To those who can appreciate it's masterful qualities, enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

At the very least a creepy atmosphere.Something this movie definitely lacks.So it turned into a frustrating game of waiting until 'something happens' and when something 'does happen' in the very last scenes it's too late, I've stopped caring what happens to this characters (not that they gave me much reason to even in the beginning) and no cranking up the volume is NOT gonna scare me, more so annoy me at this point.And it ends up all feeling like a complete waste of time for me.There's really nothing more to say about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophomoric attempt at horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Invitation" feels as if it's a couple of drafts short of a finished screenplay. Most horror films are based on a simple premise. A sinful act unleashes a supernatural force that punishes the sinful, but spares the innocent and those who repent. Within this broad category, there is a genre of horror that Snyder calls Monster in the House. The elements are simple. The protagonist, who is usually a member of a group of people, is trapped somewhere (a house, a remote island, a spaceship, e.g.) with something evil that wants to kill him/them in some unimaginably horrible manner and he can neither leave nor summon assistance. TI puts a group of characters in a house with no cellular reception and no landline, with the windows and doors locked and barred, but they never seem trapped. The front door is deliberately left unlocked. They are free to wander outside. One guest leaves early. There is an intimation that the individual may have met some violent end, but it is never revealed. The protagonist repeatedly proclaims his intention to leave, but generally decides to stay on his own volition. Rather than building tension through an escalating series of frightening events, the story builds tedium, so much so that the protagonist frequently wanders off. Prior events and relationships supposedly impact the characters and their relationships, but aren't always clear. The death of their child several years earlier impacts the protagonist and his ex-wife in different ways, but it's not clear who was responsible for the child's death, which is an important element in horror, as the guilty are punished and the innocent are spared. The protagonist is supposedly conflicted with residual feelings toward his ex- wife and his love for his current wife, but neither relationship seems particularly vibrant or compelling. The composition of the dinner party is so blatantly politically correct as to seem unrealistic. We have an interracial couple, a gay couple and a woman who has lesbian tendencies with an ethnic mix including a couple of Asians, a Hispanic and an African-American. But none of the characters seems to do much of anything in real life. They marry, have children, take vacations and even go to jail, but nobody seems to have a career that defines them or provides a unique skill set that might help them survive. One is reminded of Checkov's gun. Much is made of the locked doors, barred windows and lack of cellular service, but when the monster reveals itself, none of it really matters to the monster's plan. The protagonist seems to be cast as a sort of Christ figure and is named (free) Will, while his ex-wife is named Eden. He looks a lot like the Christ in medieval and Renaissance paintings, with Aryan features and long tawny hair and beard, although probably not much like the historical Jesus. Eliminate the "monsters" and there are close to thirteen characters in the cast ? Jesus and twelve disciples, one of whom leaves early. There's a lot of talk about an exotic vintage of wine, finding peace and guilt. It seems the filmmakers attempted to work in some sort of last supper Christian religious allegory, but it comes across a bit muddled and sophomoric. The final scene comes out of nowhere. It is a possible outcome of events alluded to in the film, but nothing as built up to it and there is no reason to expect certain things to be synchronized. Ordinarily the protagonist fights his/her way up the hierarchy of villains. The villain is not supposed to knowingly cause his/her own demise. There is no apparent distinction between innocent and guilty parties as to who survives. The film is disappointing because it fails to adhere to the basic paradigm of horror films. Performances are as good as can be expected with a weak script. Production values are adequate but not inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hated it, then gave it a chance and it pulled itself together!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually turned this movie off after the first half an hour. It had all the cliché characters you would expect at a movie party, the flirty whore, the well groomed gay couple, the shy blonde who just wants to cuddle and the couple who found new meaning to life after traveling the world....which is all fine but these people are supposed to be in their thirties.Maybe those party stereotypes would be realistic if they were in highschool. They even play highschool games similar to truth or dare and end up awkwardly making out with one another.Then after an hour and twenty minutes things get crazy and the movie actually becomes very urgent, tense and frighteningly believable.So after the first 30 minutes I skipped to the end, and I thought the ending was acted so well and the last scene was so well done that I had to go back and sit through the entire thing. Upon doing this the characters annoyed me less, because although they were extremely irritating and flirty and drunk they were well acted characters and they were believable. I guess that people like this must exist somewhere, and with such an insane ending I had to force myself through the build up.The main character also is acted really well and was not very annoying and actually acted realistically, it was refreshing to see the main character not just cry and run from his attackers, he fought back and refused to go down without a fight. He was also skeptical and sensed that something was wrong early on, which is so rare in horror movies, I really liked his outspoken accusations and tantrums.So in summary, if you can make it past the first thirty minutes the end is quite the payoff, and try not to be too annoyed by the supporting characters and just focus on the main couple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going in completely cold to a movie is a highlight of my movie fetish. When I saw just a quick poster of The Invitation attached to a 4/4 star review of a professional movie critic friend of mine online, my interest peaked. Then, others followed with either anticipation or having seen it and praising it, as well. I stopped there.I was already hooked, and while it was a must-see, I didn't want to know any more. Especially when one of the commenters instructed us NOT to see the trailer. (This is an easy one for me; I hate trailers. They simply ruin too much for me, whether intentionally or not.)This movie was worth the wait. Oh, sorry, those posts were from a week or more ago. I truly liked it a ton. For such an independent/basically one location film, it was incredibly shot, crafted and had true acting from people you may or may not have ever heard from before. (I think I recognized one person, and while he was good, the rest blew me away on how I believed each of them.)While I encourage you to go in cold as I did, once you begin, you'll have an urge to put the pieces together from past movie experiences. That's natural and while the film tosses you around a lot, I was more enamored by the performances, mood, dialogue, tension and freshness to modern cinema. Typically I provide even a snippet of a synopsis, but I'm not going to be a hypocrite this time. Take my word for it: See it and see it cold. Let their world, words, direction and pacing enthrall you to the perfect conclusion.Most likely I will be thinking about this movie a ton and recommending it to anyone I speak with about movies, especially those who appreciate film. I am pleased I listened to my friends and accepted the invitation.***Final thoughts: Thanks, Dustin. I know we don't always agree, but the second I saw your post about this, and your stars/teaser first line of your review, I knew I *had* to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, predictable, strange, senseless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that a new film with Logan Marshall-Green came out, I had to buy it immediately, so far this actor has never disappointed me, and besides I am a fan of clever horror. This movie, however, is far away from being clever or suspenseful. It offers utter boredom, uninteresting characters having uninteresting conversations (this is something we know from Cloverfield, but at least this movie provided some rare moments with a cool monster at the end ...). The plot is also completely predictable, I knew immediately what it boils down to, and when it finally comes to a minimum of action, you are already so annoyed and turned off that it does not matter anymore. In addition, the film itself suggests strange assumptions, and I am not even talking about the resolution, but (spoilers): 1. Why are animals seen as so worthless, that they can be killed/sacrificed for gimmicky, unnecessary shock moments? 2. Why are the nut jobs/cult members always portrayed as vegetarians? Just because the people eating meat have no discipline and no morals and can't give up meat, does not mean that they may show/label vegetarians as crazy, the opposite is the case. 3. Sometmes suicide is obviously not bad, because if the wacko ex-wife would have killed herself after the death of her son as she wanted to, the others would have been spared. Strange. And the twist at the end is a complete failure, not credible and can't help it anymore/just makes it worse - too bad, could have been a good movie, but nobody needs this film.</fullReview>

If Kusama pretended to make it a Psychological thriller she clearly doesn't have a clue how to pace it, the protagonist Will he is a representation of the audience bored and uncomfortable the hole time, he knows there's something obtusely wrong and his ex is messed up, and it's hard to think as simple paranoia from Wills part, he doesn't hide how uncomfortable he is about everything. This could have work if they used some subtlety with the characters not making them some awkward stereotypes, the worst part of this movie is how boring it is and how uninterested you fill waiting for something exiting to happened and you have to wait too long for it.It's just not worth it.</fullReview>

At the beginning of the film on the spot is set the tone twisted for us we all recognize the people and the situation of concern in the film .we start the call with Will (Logan) and new girlfriend Keira where leads to the house where they were invited by his ex-wife, Leiden (Tammy Blanchard), who now lives with her new husband, David. Also in attendance a lot of old friends, who have not come together since the death of the former couple's children in the same house. Obviously this makes things a little confusing, and the constant tension make everyone screwed over for the film because of the antics of each one.film at times moving to the unease. Because all the characters do not really want to be present in the House, but they must accept the invitation from respect only, so the film is easy for us - as viewers - through not comfortable to interact with the story and tense and exciting way strangely, every friend of friends trying to get out of this call with the least damage. director presents us with some smart touches , while the choice of places and imaging wonderful .film disturbing enough to be scary, or playing to the situation of mental enough to be troublesome, but because the film connects each person scenes of the film plot permission on all wait to the end to find out who the victor in this plot and this great positive evaluation of the film for the movie i give 5.5 / 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious mix of flashbacks, drugs &amp; tears in creepy atmosphere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple is driving and they hit a coyote. The guy (I don't remember his name because the movie is so shallow), this guy kill the coyote because is very injured. Is a mercy killing. The end. This is the whole story because the rest is trash.At the diner party we saw few SHALLOW people, shallow talking, TALK TALK TALK, expensive wines and AWFUL FLASHBACKS, a kid died and the couple split. FLASHBACKS, DRUGS, TEARS, THIS MOVIE IS SO BORING AND POINTLESS, I DON'T SEE THE REASON WHY THIS HAPPEN IN A MIDDLE OF A CREEPY ATMPSPHERE. I HAVE A SERIOUS STRUGGLE TRYING TO SWALLOW THE BAD ACTING, THE ABUSE OF MELODRAMA AND SWITCH OF MOODS. This people is sick. I don't want to watch this film anymore. Sorry if you find my review lack of structure, I'M A VISCERAL PERSON.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Have I Just Watched?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel I've really missed something in this film judging by some of the positive reviews it has achieved - I however really didn't get it at all. To be totally honest I found it boring, drawn out and not particularly original.My first problem lay in the overall 'feel' of the movie - it just wasn't believable somehow. Any notion that something was about to take place was only weakened by not so great acting mixed with the constant thought of 'please let this be over soon'.Secondly (and perhaps my biggest gripe) is the fact that there are just too many lose ends. These people have supposedly been friends for years, but there's little if any chemistry on screen, so the cast almost become objects of little to no depth or real character. I found I really didn't care what happened to them in the end (or throughout for that meter).There was plenty of room for several great sub-plots to be created and introduced instead of flashbacks (which didn't really add much anyway); and none of which were incorporated or expanded upon - no twists or turns which could have really set the movie up for a great climax. Nope - none of that... Well - maybe a very small "oh" at the end... But it is a 'very' small one.I read that the movie was made with no real major backing, and after watching it, I'm afraid I can see why. Sadly (or perhaps luckily for some), it will be a film which will be easily forgotten.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>California Screaming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple accept an invite to a reunion of old friends with a troubled past, and find an unwelcome solution is planned for them.Interesting movie, but the concept is hazy. The music sets an edgy tone, and the photography and actors maintain the discomfort throughout, but I was expecting something less literal, more spooky. The final scene does add an element of the uncanny, but it doesn't really illuminate what went before. My ears pricked up with the speech about grief and pain being just a chemical problem, but that wasn't explored even though it's a practical approach that might blow spirituality out of the water.One big problem is too many characters with no convincing reason to be there. Disappointed that the girlfriend wasn't a pivotal character. And once you realise how plain the plot is, you're left with the expectation of a standard shoot out. I would have turned the memory of the boy into a vengeful ghost, only for it to have a part in the final resolution - nothing over the top, just enough to mask the real threat and fill up the space from paring away a few of the unnecessary characters.The vibe is tres California, with a bunch of privileged sensitives assuming they represent all of human experience - but I like that, and the hippiness is a nice throwback. Maybe they should gift their wealth away and go get jobs that matter. There's a real solution.Overall - intrigues but does not satisfy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sunshine of Psychological Thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Invitation is a slowly paced, carefully constructed psychological thriller. Will and his girlfriend are attending a dinner party at his old house, hosted by his ex-wife and her new husband. It's an understandably awkward situation for Will, whose eyes we, the audience, are watching the events through. As the film moves forward, the past is revealed and we come to understand why these characters are where they are. As this happens, questions about the present intentions of the characters become more predominant. As Will becomes more suspicious and paranoid, we do too. The subtle way in which this is done is absolutely brilliant.There comes a point where The Invitation begins to elevate itself into a devastatingly effective and tragic character study. Instead, the filmmakers decided to give the film a more audience-friendly twist, lowering the final act to the level of a cliché horror show. It almost works, as in the moment it is very satisfying. However, what follows is so terribly executed, it undermines what had been such an intelligent, tense, thought-provoking, mysteriously eerie, paranoid-inducing thriller.As disappointing as the final act is, the majority of The Invitation makes it worth watching. But, with a warning. The Invitation is to psychological thrillers what Danny Boyle's Sunshine is to science-fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie, Wasting my time, unorganized director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it was a nice scary movie when I watched the trailer BUT it was totally suck. Kept listening the actors talking to each other in the movie WITHOUT any point (is like talk something redundant without connecting to the movie) for 80% of the entire movie. I wanted to close my laptop about 50% of the movie because I felt pointless and boring, but I insisted watching until the end to see and laugh what exactly the director trying to do. It is a COMPLETELY waste of time movie.I AM A HORROR &amp; SCARY MOVIE ADDICT, I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS MOVIE IS SCARY IS DEFINITELY NEWBIE IN THIS FIELD.Don't waste your time watching this, appreciate your time, thank you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow, but refined film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely does a film come along and make the viewer ask themselves "Did I like that, or did I just lose 100 minutes I'll never get back?"The Invitation was that film for me. I almost turned it off. After 30 minute, then an hour and STILL nothing at all happened and it just seemed as if the film were not progressing at all, but just awkwardly bouncing around anxiously like a tin pan in a washing machine. But I hung in there, checking my phone occasionally, until things finally started to happen, there was something actually going on at an hour and 20 minutes in. Some call films like this a slow burn, others call them boring. The Invitation was neither, because while the pacing is super slow, a lot of factors save this movie from going right in the bin. First and foremost, the acting is exquisite. This film would not be half of what it is without the stellar performances of Logan Marshall-Greene and Emayatzy Corinealdi. The cinematography is beautiful, lit spectacularly to maintain the tone of the entire film.It's a thought provoking film that sometimes takes itself too seriously. Sometimes you're not sure if it's a jaunt through Valley of The Dolls or a Manson-esque dramatization. I think the biggest fault with the film was the fact it is a really a small, simple story that the writers take far too long to tell and then wind it all up in the last 20 minutes. That's not to say the film is not an intelligent examination of many facets of the human condition, and it's done so with a distinct sensitivity and grace that director Karyn Kusama should be lauded for. This is a film for the very patient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Contender For The Best Movie Of 2016.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy Smokes. I will first state that this movie is Insane in the most positive way possible and that it is a true Marvel to watch. I will start with the story which is about a man and his girlfriend who get invited to a dinner party at his ex's house with her new man along with a group of other friends after 2 years. The story then starts to unfold that something isn't quite kosher. The pace was scary good with some of the best pacing I have ever witnessed in cinema history. I will move onto the acting which is Absolutely Stunning with both "Logan Marshall-Green" and GOT's actor "Michiel Huisman" stealing the show. They both deserve awards for their performances. The entire cast did Amazing but those two stole the entire movie. I will now continue with the action and drama section. Wow this is where it truly comes to fruition that this is a contender for the best movie of 2016. I mean the atmosphere and the tension that builds towards what is in my opinion the most Awesome culmination to a film I have seen in the past decade. I will finish with the Cinematography which was Impeccable with every scene building up something sinister and not quite right with the whole entourage that is gathered for the dinner party. I will close with saying that this movie is a Masterpiece and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. OMG the ending was Epic and of course no spoilers. My hat comes off to Karyn Kusama who directed such a transfixing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The director Karyn Kusama turns this into a D movie. Don't waste your time and money!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An undergrad student director could have done a better job with the material. Karyn Kusama understands neither the genre nor how to direct actors according to the standards of even a B movie. As I said in my review title, this ended up being a D movie, where the audience at the Arclight Hollywood Cinema (which draws some discerning viewers that are not of the popcorn variety) ended up laughing at climactic moments that should have induced silent shudders. I was really looking forward to seeing a female director do something very special with the genre, but this woman seemed determined to prove to herself that she could be even more "raw" than a male director, and ended up generating utterly CHEAP, ludicrous and risibly melodramatic scenes (particularly during the "grand" finale). I feel sorry for lead actress Tammy Blanchard, whom I've seen live on Broadway, to have found herself in the hands of a director who reduced what should have been her most touching monologue to the stuff that Lifetime movie villainesses are made of. You are actually better off watching a Lifetime 'thriller' than wasting 100 minutes on this drivel. The movie could have easily been cut down by a solid 10-15 minutes if the director didn't spend as much time as she did on pointless close-ups and ridiculously repetitive shots. She keeps hitting the audience on the head with the fact that the main character, Will, is uncomfortable and haunted - to the point where you just end up feeling alienated from him altogether, half way into the movie, which is the opposite effect one would want to achieve when it comes to the protagonist. People like her should not accept assignments that are clearly way beyond their scope. She was in over her head, and the actors and writers alike ended up having to take the fall, in the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of 2003 movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a 2003 movie with the same name, same premise, just the person who the person who invited the movie was very much better person to play the role, in the 2003 version Lance Henriksen played the host of the dinner party. His portrayal with the rest of these actors taking over the other roles would have been perfect. It could have been made even better if it was a person or child of a person from the first movie who reprised the role of host. While the actors in this version are over all better, the director better, production value better, i can't help but miss that sense of seeing it for the first time, hoping there is some twist to offer the same old same old, even a glimmer of new light to look upon it as. If you are having trouble finding this movie to watch, watch Lance Hendriksen do a better job as host of this twisted dinner party in the 2003 version of the same name on netflix. Just warning for the 2003 version, its production value makes you feel like its a 90s made for TV movie.</fullReview>
