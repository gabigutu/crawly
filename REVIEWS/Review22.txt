		<fullReview>The movie GREATER was better than I ever could've imagined. Chris Severio did an excellent job portraying Brandon, Leslie Easterbrook was amazing at playing Barbara, and Neal McDonough gave his best performance to date as Marty Burlsworth. Nick Searcy is the dark horse of the movie - trying to make Marty (Neal McDonough) doubt his faith in God - allowing this to happen to his brother. Even if you don't like football, this story is one that proves that hard work pays off. More importantly, it is about faith and why bad things happen to good people. You will cry, you will laugh, but most of all, you will leave wanting to be a better person yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in Harrison and I was so touched by this film. Growing up with the real Marty, I saw a soft spoken and gentle soul. I never knew the hardships of his family dynamics. I cried and laughed through the whole film and was moved that this family opened up to be transparent for the world to see. When leaving the theater, most were crying and saying that they loved it. From a retired high school counselor's view, this is a must see for our youth. The struggles they deal with need to be seen as motivation and not stumbling blocks. This is an encouraging message to all! Brandon not only worked hard academically and athletically, he stood firm in his values and morals. I hope this message resonates loud to the audience to not be afraid of going against what is popular for the greater good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a movie worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie flow, acting, story line, actors, and levels of inference are all spot on. Is it the "perfect" movie? Of course not, but in the middle of all the overwhelming garbage being spewed out in the last decade, this is a breath of fresh air.Truly, in a time when the movies being made from the big studios seem to be ripe with blood, guts, sex, ghosts, demons, and mindless trash, this movie reminds us that the best stories are the real ones.I don't intend to go line by line critiquing the movie, just to give this a simple recommendation to go see it. No heavy handed words needed.Well done to all involved in this production, my wife and I really enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you need a story to give you hope for us all?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greater is the story of which we all wish we could a part. "Rudy" is often compared, but Brandon's story is much more. While Arkansas has nothing of the following to Notre Dame and the budget of the movie is meager, this movie will have you "all-in" form the beginning. While there are glorious, big scenes of SEC stadiums full of people, we also see the meager, Ozark small town existence of Brandon's upbringing. Neal McDonough and Leslie Easterbrook bring great performances. The "farmer" role and story line are too much contrived. I didn't care for the flashback style of storytelling . . . but then again, if you're watching this film, you understand what the spoiler will be. "GREATER" is story of a person who will inspire us all and a film that shows how the greatest examples don't need the biggest Hollywood budgets to make you laugh, cheer and cry. RIP #77</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Family Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW- the true story of Brandon Burlsworth is compelling and one that deserves to be seen. Bring your family. Hard work and persistence pays off for Brandon as this unlikely football star gets drafted by the Indianapolis Colts.You will laugh and you will cry. If you like "Rudy" and Frank Capra pictures. You will love Greater.The movie takes place in Arkansas. A poor kid with a dream to play for the Arkansas Razorbacks. The football scenes are good. The character development of his teammates move you from anger and frustration to joy and inspiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most of you I have seen many sport movies, this will go down as one of my favorite of all times. I live in Arkansas so I was already somewhat familiar with this tragic story. You knew going in that this story was not going to end well. It was extremely well acted and well written. I would recommend this movie to everyone whether or not you are a football fan or not. I am at the point where I like to research a movie a little bit before I pay to set down and watch one. There have been some very good movies and some very bad movies put out this year this is one of the great ones. Be sure and put this movie on your must see list you will be happy you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real story is even more amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greater is based on the real life of Brian Burlsworth - the greatest walk on in the history of college football. The movie is good, but the multiple flashback sequences are a bit distracting as are the multiple conversations with "the farmer" who I guess is supposed to represent temptation or doubt or Satan. The movie never really addresses who the whittling farmer is supposed to be. When you watch this movie you'll think some of the scenes are a bit hokey and that no one is that dedicated or that "good". I've talked to people that knew Brian and they say the movie doesn't even begin to show what an amazing, dedicated, and courageous person Brian was in real life. The truth is we don't have enough people like Brian on this planet and his death at such a young age was truly tragic.It's nice to see something at the movies where the basic message is believe in yourself and work hard for what you want in life. Brian's life was an inspiration - at the end of the movie they list some of the foundations and charities started in his honor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guys, really, it wasn't that great. TL;DR - INCREDIBLY clichéd, passable to bad acting, amateurish dialogue and directionThe challenges of modern religious cinema vary depending on writer, producer, and director's intentions. Are they trying to change someone's mind? Are they attempting to make a subversive, artistic work? Are they aiming to create and advertisement for Jesus? Depending on what the motives of the project heads are, though each is making a film about/involving faith, you will receive an extremely different result. Each of these results is acceptable in their own way and among their respective target audiences, but one thing should remain constant through all of them: objective quality.The film "Greater," about the life and death of Arkansas Razorback walk-on legend Brandon Burlsworth, unfortunately, fails to live up to this desired consistency. Though it is sprinkled with truly inspirational elements and a light touch of good humor, its obliviousness to commonly lampooned tropes and clichés hold it back from being called "good."To begin with, what I found most positive about Greater, I would like to say that, though his acting ability could be described as "subpar," Christopher Severio's performance as Brandon Burlsworth endeared me to the character. I honestly rooted for his success and sympathized with his failures and shortcomings. Though having a character that comes this close to being morally perfect is very often a point against realism and tends to break a suspension of disbelief (and I also doubt the real Burlsworth was as flawless as this film made him appear) I could not stop my enjoyment of him.Brandon's older brother, Marty Burlsworth (his senior by 17 years), was most capably portrayed. Neal McDonough's performance was without question the most honest and diverse one of the feature. Though he seemed much, much too old to be playing the age he was supposed to play, it didn't stop the relationships he formed with other characters from developing and growing on me. You began to understand Marty's struggles and difficulties along the way while also valuing Brandon's resolve. Without a doubt, they are the best elements of this film.As for the rest, its quality ranges from passable to cringe worthy to abysmal. The most notable of these offenses is the cliché riddled script. It doesn't bore you in the way that you can recite each line of dialogue before it's delivered, but it does resurrect many lines that were formally parodied so heavily they disappeared. The "clean out your locker" and "We did it coach!" tropes appeared so suddenly I was actually taken aback. Aside from these, the soundtrack was so trite and effortlessly generic it became slightly unbearable. The dialogue never breaches the barrier of "good" and frequently passes below the bar of "bad," though it does manage to average out at acceptable or, at least, comprehensible.There are a few more points I could make but they don't impact the story more than those I've already made. I would "go easy" on the film for understanding that it was low budget, produced by well-meaning individuals, and managed to have enough heart to wrap me in, but I try not to lower my standards for any film for any reason. I'm as hard on "Flywheel" and "VeggieTales" as I am on any other production.It is not very good, and to some, it could be seen as "bad." But, I can say I found a more honest and heartfelt story than in most hyper-religious films released in the past ten years. The cinematography during Marty's discussion with the old man became actually dynamic and intriguing at a few points, and the conversation's climax, though odd and underdeveloped, was still good enough to make me smile. Underneath the healthy coating of clichés, overused tropes, and amateurish writing/directing, is something that I could see as a perfectly fine "feel-good" film.</fullReview>
