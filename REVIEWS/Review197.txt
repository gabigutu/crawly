		<fullReview>SPOILER FREE ZONE Do not watch.Seriously, I warned you. This movie is so bad I felt the need to create an account on this site to tell people the truth about it.If you're a citizen of the USA who is overly nationalistic, if you buy into the hype of famous actors who end up having less-than-average performances, if you just started watching movies last year and aren't yet familiar with all the clichés you will find in this movie, if you think a blurry, confused action scene is a good action scene, and if you don't mind the poorly done CGI explosions and the plot-holes, then this movie is for you.If not, and if you're really curious about it, just watch the trailer. The entire movie is there anyway.SPOILER ZONE Here is how it goes: Main character is a typical American-marine-special-agent kind of dude. He is a reckless, aggressive, dominant alpha male that can't go one minute without saying a cheesy one-liner. In fact, almost all his dialogue are cheesy one-liners. He has a pregnant wife, which is the typical stay-at-home American mom who cares for his husband.Then there's the typical strong, maternal black women who dies courageously, the typical hot white girl female fatal which you "do not f*** with", the strangely naive USA president who is afraid to pick up a gun and shocked that so many civilians have died because of him (yeah, right), the typical eastern villain that hates America, the faceless enemies with storm-trooper syndrome, the traitor that thinks the system is flawed and accepted a bribe, and Morgan Freeman, who is presented as a major character but ends up playing a very minor role that could be done by any novice actor. Yes, from now on, beware of films with Morgan Freeman. It's not the first time (I'm remembering Oblivion, with Tom Cruise) that his face is plastered all around just to make the movie sell, but ends up being an insignificant part of it. He may have played great roles in the past, but now it's clear he is riding his own fame.Even then, Morgan Freeman is probably the best actor there. Others are just not competent. Part of the blame is on the dialogue. It's too cliché and far-fetched. As told before, Gerard Butler does nothing but throw down one-liners. He has one or two facial expressions: The angry look and the tender, loving father look. Which makes him an one-dimensional character that you won't be able to build an emotional connection with. He is also an insufferable Mary Sue. The USA president, on the other hand, is pathetic. They try to make him a determined, strong American leader, but the contrast with his best man is just too big. It makes him look tiny, fragile and incompetent. There is not much to say about other actors. All of them play minor roles and are easily forgettable. And all of them play stereotypical, far-fetched roles.Then there is the plot. Oh, god, the plot.It's bad. The pacing is horrible. Action scene, chase, small break, action scene, chase, small break, repeat. Not much happens in between. In part because there is no decent plot. It goes like this: the most heavily guarded funeral in history ends up having some serious security flaws. And all because one dude in the USA security agency betrayed them. That one dude is apparently so powerful, or the security agencies (American and English) are so pathetic, that his simple betrayal goes undetected and cause the entire defense operation to fail. How did he do such a feat? How could half the guards in that day be enemies in disguise and that go under the radar? How could the prime-minister of England "die in his sleep" and then no autopsy having been made in time to clear any suspicions of poisoning? Why is Gerard Butler the only one who "feels" that "something" is about to happen? Why is it that the most important target (USA President) is the ONLY ONE that stays alive, and the LAST ONE that the enemy tries to shoot at? Every single point of this movie is far-fetched.Okay, I'm aware that this is a mindless action movie, and plot and actor performance shouldn't be taken too seriously. BUT THE ACTION SCENES AREN'T GOOD EITHER! All of them are ridden with that annoying, off-putting blur and camera-shake effect. And they aren't original either. Oh, a last-second save. Oh, a car chase. Oh, the helicopter crashes and they are all alive and without a scratch. Except the black girl, of course. Oh, the enemies just send themselves at the hero at the most stupid fashion and end up dead, every single time. It's tedious, predictable and shows that they are lazy and didn't really spend any time to think on good ideas.So if the point of the movie is bad, and everything else is bad to, what's good? Well, I find the stereotypical representations of the other heads-of-state to be somewhat enjoyable. There's the female German Chancellor that is clearly Angela Merkel, the womanizer Italian prime-minister that is clearly Berlusconi, etc. But all it shows is that this movie could have been a parody. It is certainly a parody, with all the exaggerated nationalistic lines and the plot and action scene clichés, but it's a parody of itself. Its crucial sin is that it takes itself seriously. But it certainly doesn't deserve more than to be a punchline of a joke. A bad, boring, predictable joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If like me, you liked the original, this will leave you greatly disappointed. No breakdown needed. Just mindless cheese through and through. Whilst the original shocked (in particular the opening scenes) with a grandiose, beyond belief terrorist attack, London has fallen shocks with its stupidity, predictability, poor CGI, complete neglect for any realism (not a even a tad!) and tediously boring action scenes that would be more fitting for a new van dame movie.There's no need to break down this movie and pick it apart. Because the whole thing is just one big, boring mess of mindless BS.How this movie got over 6.0 is beyond me ! It almost falls into the 'so bad, it's good category', but not quite, so it's just horribly bad and you won't be laughing either. 3.6 Material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love a good, silly, dumb action movie. Truly, I do. But this one was just insulting... I felt like it was written by a bunch of 13 year old boys, cranked up on too much Red Bull.Totally avoid of any characterisation other than in the broadest possible terms... the dialogue was just horrendous... the plot makes very little sense to anyone with the slightest scrap of brain in their head (what, most of the London police force were taken over by terrorists and NOBODY noticed?)and as for the SFX... you'd be embarrassed if you saw them in an X-box game! I'll admit, there was one good action sequence when Mr Butler and the SAS were advancing on the terrorists lair amidst a hail of gunfire, that was quite nicely done... but five minutes of decent enough action isn't enough to make me think that this film is anything other than an utter turkey...Give it a swerve, IMO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the dumbest movie ever, idiotic plot, American chest- beating, USA chanting nonsense. There is absolutely nothing in this film remotely believable, and after the nonsense in the first one, you have to hope that this is the end of the franchise. What shocks me most is the appearance of Morgan Freeman in this movie. Is he so hard up that he needs to lower himself to this standard of film?Do Americans understand anything that happens outside their country? Save your time, save your money and avoid this crap. And please no more "has fallen" films. Let Butler retire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched and mostly enjoyed (with the inevitable suspension of disbelief) the sister film 'Olympus has Fallen' I had the chance to watch this over in the states. Assuming another dose of suspension of disbelief, I settled down to watch it.This film, despite its good lead cast appears to have left the brains of plot and due process behind as it made the leap across the pond.Set in London which is gleefully smashed up within the first 30mins of the movie along with most of the global heads of state it puts action scenes over plot devices (not that I was expected anything else) but there are some concerning portrayals of real life characters which undermine any amount of nice explosions and gun-play.The heads of state are all archaic stereotypes of what we assume to be the culture of each country rolled into one person.For instance, the Italian PM has a young 30-year-old-love who he meets in secrete atop Westminster Abbey. The Canadian President has the perfect family. The French President is conducting some kind of important state business in a kind of renaissance launcher boat on the Thames replete with Champagne (did he really use it to get from Paris to London?) and the Japenese PM is stoically quiet, patient and reserved until the moment when the Thames Bridge is blown up around him. Of course the US President is portrayed as a hip, fashionable humane and judicious man with none of these stereotypes (negative or otherwise).This marks the first concern - outside of their own nation, Hollywood really does not care how these cosmopolitan characters are portrayed - indeed - entire nations are mercilessly the subject of stereotypical derision as the hapless heads of state are killed in creative manners. Not that I mind red London buses being the unprinted cue for 'this film is set in London'.What happens next is even more incredible. Since the 'assassination' of the British PM, with the exception of some kind of funeral planning meeting early on, there does not seem to be any kind of UK government / leadership / disaster management faculty left. Rather than employ characters from real life counterparts like 'deputy PM' or 'Defense Secretary' or 'COBRA' or indeed our intelligence services like MI5 the film leads us to believe the the job of bringing order to this chaos falls to a Chief Inspector who thinks that yanks is still an acceptable term for our American cousins. (He is not even a Chief Constable though confusingly he does have chief constable epaulet rank badges) of London's Scotland Yard. Really - the entire intelligence and counter-terrorism effort. (This would be akin to a police captain in the WDCPD mopping up after a similar event took out the President of the US, though we know of course in Hollywood this could never happen).We have Morgan Freeman as Vice President giving strong suggestions (read: orders?) over some kind of skype thing to this Chief Inspecter who enacts his word like some kind of servile unthinking amoeba.Even our army is portrayed by a portly old man wearing something from the dad's army set who dares to suggest a military response but is denied this by Morgan Freeman and sheepishly accepts this reprimand.At some point the President asks to be shot by Banning should he fall into the hands of the terrorists. Of course as soon as this is heard we know that the president is going to fall into the hands of the terrorists and is undoubtedly going to be rescued again. This removes any anticipation of plot from the film and leaves the rest of it as mere action-porn than anything else.Other issues such as the NSA revealing that they have been spying on a London address for ages and the mindless insertion of armed foreign nationals on the streets of London are too numerous to mention.Should Aaron be re-elected for a third term in something like 'Paris has Fallen' then I think I might have to go back to watching nature documentaries on UK Gold to sate my action thirst. Beast hunting beast in the great oceans would have more twists and turns than this film.A bland, obtuse and frankly disturbing revelation of how Hollywood regards the rest of the world should be portrayed against the might and absolute 'good' of the USA. How arrogant, patronising and disgusting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a nutshell: Supposed best of the 'land of free' (the sunny place where everyone is happy and waves their spangley flag) come over to the London (where is constantly rains and everyone is incompetent and rather sad). London is blown-up but that's OK because they end- up single-handedly saving the most important person in the world (the US President of course) - so everything is fine! They do this by using a lot of fairly bad CGI and applying a script of continuous, cheesy one liners. The script is predictable and from the start full of hypocrisy. Where did the big, bad arms dealer get his weapons in the first place? Emmm... tough one that! You are constantly left wondering who is the real baddie in this movie especially when Gerald and co. rattle-off their crass one-liners!Summary: Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello everybody,I've just created my account on this website because of this one. I felt it was important for me to write a couple of lines about this movie.Unfortunately, while the title may seem interesting, I can't say the same about the film. Indeed, it's not a real movie in the proper sense of the term, it's a propaganda campaign.a patriot secret service agent, Gerard butler, saving the life of his beloved president while fighting the bad guys with a beard and some black skin they call terrorists.Just take a look at it, it won't take long before you understand exactly what I mean. I never thought they would release something like that, but they did.this should be studied at school as a tool used to brainwash people. but if you are a patriot and think that America is heaven, ready to give your life for your president, if you like closing your eyes while you're screwed by some politicians and if you think that everybody else who doesn't accept your opinion should die, then it might be the "movie" you 've been looking for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie gets worse by the minute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can decent actors accept to be in such a horrible movie? Morgan Freeman must have lost a bet to play a role in this movie. So much crap happens in this movie that basically needs the viewer to remove 99% of any kind of logical thinking. So the UK police, special forces, and military can easily be compromised according to this movie, and in front of real officers who are standing right next to them without wondering, hey who the heck are these guys? Bombs can be placed in every famous building without anyone noticing. Hundreds of bad guys can take over a city and have no army come in to confront them. The solution they found to deal with weading out the imposter forces, recall all the known good forces to sit inside while the bad ones can go about doing their terrorizing. WTF, directors, writers, who did they poll this movie in front of and had a response of "yeah this all makes sense". To be left with a feeling of not just wasting time watching the movie (even with forwarding scenes), and then being left with a feeling of how can smart people make such crap, is enough to leave the brain broken. I thought an IMDb rating of 6+ would be a watchable B movie, but this is not even close to watchable, how did this movie not get an avg rating of 3?!!! If you've seen it and liked it, think about this movie with a bit of logic, if you haven't seen it, don't, just don't, unless you enjoy feeling frustrated by stupid things that happen in movies.</fullReview>

Well when I watched this movie, I was understand straight to the point. One man, One hero, live happily after, and rich. Lol.England Has Fallen and U.S saved it only by one person, and England can't do anything for their countries.This movie really a propaganda, and underestimated other countries, England, Japan, France, Italy. The producer, the script writer and others involved in this movie should careful with what they made.As we saw the movie, Italy Prime Minister enjoyed the view with a girl, younger woman, and EEkkk..died, the France "Just hold for ten minutes, and EEkk..The Japanese PM stuck-ed in traffic and Eeekk. The Italy PM likes woman, The France a lazy person, and Japanese whose produces nice car but got jammed in traffic. Oh man, this movie insulted other nation.

		<shortDescription>Almost Good. Not So Much Action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sequel to the successful movie "Olympus Has Fallen." The story begins in London, where the British Prime Minister has passed away under mysterious circumstances. Leaders of the G7 attend his funeral.Group of Seven (G7), international organization officially established in 1985 to facilitate economic cooperation among the world's largest industrial nations; summit meetings of the member nations began in 1975. Members are Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, and the United States.However, what starts out as the most protected event on Earth turns into a deadly plot to kill the world's most powerful leaders, devastate every known landmark in the British capital, and unleash a terrifying vision of the future. Only three people have any hope of stopping it: the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart), his formidable Secret Service head (Gerard Butler), and an English MI-6 agent who rightly trusts no one.5/10 . It need more action scenes and a stronger plot.</fullReview>

A typical American guard who would alone kill an army of 300 terrorist, Survive Helicopter crash, survive heavy vehicle crash, (Hang on, it doesn't end here) and Terrorist are walking down on the streets of London, doing a lot bomb blasts and all of them are south Asians specially (why).Even In 2016 they are making movies like this without even thinking.I have watched hundreds of movies and even If I was going to make this poor movie, I would have made much better. With this nonsense story line, they could have tried to make it close real life and they failed to do that as well. Damnit.</fullReview>

Simply staggeringly stupid in every way. The basic premise could have worked, a terrorist attack on London, but absolutely no rational thought was put into the execution of the idea. Lazy, shallow, brain-dead film making. As it went on I actually thought I was watching a parody. Deeply depressing that so much money went into such a poor excuse for entertainment. Very, very sad indeed. I've actually run out of things to say about this movie as there's absolutely nothing to salvage. It's a train wreck.

The story, according to this movie, suddenly has about half the population of the police force, and of a guards regiment, turning out to be terrorists, prepared to kill most of the world's leaders. Of course the Americans to the rescue, were one guy manages to save the US President and kill a great number of terrorists in the process; meanwhile surviving helicopter crashes, car crashes, falls down elevator shafts and other miraculous escapes. How Morgan Freeman was dragooned into playing a part it this utter trash is totally beyond me, surely he's not that hard up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly I watched this movie just for fun I was expecting rubbish but this outlived even the worst action movies of the 90s. Lets put aside the primitive pro-US and pro-war propaganda, as in the political issues there will never be a consensus. I just hope we can all agree on the point that this movie is stupid and boring as hell. The script is implausible and for the most part laughable. There is no real story, no suspense, you have already seen everything in the trailer. There seems to be many characters in the movie, but why when they are not involved in the plot? Did they originally made a 10 hour series and than cut it to 97 minutes? Most embarrassing are the moments when the movie tries to be cool or funny, they are always out of place and many times just plainly primitive and disgusting. Watch this film only if you are serious about analyzing the worst movies of all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Die Hard 5.5: Just Die Already</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Olympus Has Fallen was a dumb mindless action movie, and as a dumb mindless action movie, it was great fun. It had some insane fight scenes and a silly plot with Gerard Butler kicking all kinds of ass without getting a scratch on him. It was basically what Die Hard 5 should've been. One thing it didn't need was a sequel, but here we are with London Has Fallen, one of the dumbest action sequels to ever grace the big screen. Everything about this movie is wrong. The plot is garbage - a bunch of terrorists blow up a crapload of stuff to kill world leaders attending a PM's funeral in London, and of course Gerard Butler is there and he has to save the day. It could've been another mindless fun action movie and that's what I was hoping for, but the faults in London Has Fallen are too glaring to ignore.The script is dogsh*t, and that's putting it lightly. Some of the worst one-liners ever spoken are in this movie. "Glad you finally came out of the closet," after the president comes out of hiding to save Gerard Butler's life has to take the cake. It's funny, yeah, but not in the intentional observational way but in the ridiculously out-of-place cheesy way. Pair that with really lazy action sequences and a plot that goes absolutely nowhere and you have Die Hard 5.5. It's essentially the same movie - Gerard Butler is invincible, he never misses a shot and dodges waves of bullets without moving a muscle. It's unbelievable to the point of stupidity. And it's not the entertaining kind of action either. It's just throwing crap at the screen to distract you from everything else.Morgan Freeman, Colin Salmon and Jackie Earle Haley are in this movie, God knows why. Complete waste of talent. Gerard Butler already proved he can be an action star but there was no moments to shine here. It's just an invincible dude running around London killing everybody and acting like a sarcastic douchebag to everyone including the president. The villains are awful. They're just Arabs, literally, no development whatsoever. The hero is an asshole so there's no one to root for. It's usually at this point where I say something positive about the movie, but there is absolutely nothing. The only reason it's not a 1 is because I did laugh a few times at how terrible the script is. But there is no conceivable reason for this movie to have been made, and there's even less reason to watch it. Die Hard 5 is better than this piece of crap and that's saying something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1 star? Not as good as the first movie? Let's get real! Olympus Has Fallen was equally ridiculous, jingoistic, lacking well-rounded characters, and originality - so why is everyone surprised when London Has Fallen is no different? Yes it's jingoistic. Yes it's still lacking well-rounded characters. Yes it's mindless violence. And yes it's ludicrous......ludicrously freaking awesome that is! The first thing I loved about this movie was the bad language. It was refreshing. I know that sounds like an odd thing to say, but go with me a moment... ...see, in an era of 12A action movies with tonnes of violence and no bad language, Butler dropping the F bomb a billion times ironically brings a level of realism to London Has Fallen, that is lacking in movies that take themselves far more seriously.Yes the entire concept is stupid, but that's not what we're here for. I'm here to watch Butler stab bad buys repeatedly in the chest and shoot AK-47s out of 4X4 cars bombing along the Thames at 80 miles per hour. That's what I signed up for.The pacing of this movie is perfect. It's never boring, and the action sequences are really fun. Yes, in places the CG is a bit shoddy, but the movie is still quite spectacular in pulling off some big set pieces in London.London Has Fallen is mainly a two-hander between Butler and Eckhart, with some nice buddy moments and fantastic action sequences throughout, including a mega shoot-out at Somerset House, a mega shoot-out in the Underground, and mega shoot outs in dark buildings, including the finale in Soho, of all places. This isn't going to get any Oscars, but it's a brilliantly retro action movie that takes itself far less seriously than throw-back action films like Taken, which is no less crazy in the plot department.Anyone who enjoys mindless action will not be disappointed, and where this movie lacks realistic plot, it makes up for it in pacing. At 1 hour 40 - in an age of bloated, long movies that think they're more intelligent than they are - this is frankly a breath of fresh air.Get a big bowl of popcorn and some sodi-pops, and enjoy relentless, shooting, stabbing, swearing and explosions. Great fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oy, this movie has to be one of the worst action plots that I've ever seen!Imagine if every top special forces and secret service units of the western world were all gathered together to protect their leaders in the same city, and within 30 min of arriving, all of them miserably fail to do their jobs and are killed by hoards of terrorist/militants who somehow have taken over and impersonated dozens of ground units of the London Police without anyone noticing, and only a handful of British Spec. Op. soldiers and one American Secret Service Agent remain alive to protect POTUS. Now add in that the terrorists were able to hack the entire tech grid of London, and Scotland Yard only had 2 tech specialists who could counter them (one of them being a terrorist collaborator). Plus, lets not forget, when we pick up POTUS in Marine One, we should remember to fly so low that a kid with a 22 could have hit them (not to mention RPG's from the rooftops)...I mean, who would have thought of that, right? What a joke! So many illogical and completely implausible series of events strung into one story line, it was a total fail! Don't waste your money renting it if you haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Donald Trump ever made a movie it would be this movie franchise.There too many things that are ridiculous, from the beginning to the end. To the degree that you think that this movie was made by a right wing / racist cult person and they had to put Morgan Freeman and Colin Salmon in the movie to avoid being obviously racist. That not including the propaganda factor, I guess Hollywood has used North Korean propaganda movies as a reference to enhance their skills. These are the types of movies and ridiculously romantic movies are the type that make me cringe.It feels like your looking at an 80s action movie but remastered, but still containing the mild racism and hypocrisy.\The last part, If people knew the line "____ didn't know" was the magic line to not take any responsibility. To think that someone thought we didn't know is a viable reason to not be responsible and considered it a positive point. It scares me to think that there are a number of simple minded people in this world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm giving it a higher score than most because as ashamed as I am... I actually quite enjoyed watching it. Do you ever see a film, get caught up in it, have a great time then see a bunch of negative reviews and think "well that's true... and that's true... and that.. oh my... this film really was crap now that I think about it?"That was my experience. Sure the CGI is nothing to write home about, the plot so thinly there as to be miss-able should you have the unfortunate luck as to blink... the acting mostly poor with a few standouts... the credibility factor somewhat on the order of the new Star Trek movies BUT for all that, it's still just a fun action movie to watch with a couple of beers and a couple of mates. For me, it fulfills a role... just maybe not the one it intended.The one thing that didn't elude us watching it, that did actually annoy us somewhat... was the ending. As I don't want to tick the spoiler box... I'll just leave it at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ordinary pedestrian flick, although it hardly demands to be considered as such</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>U.S Secret Service agent Mike Banning is back by studio demand for the second installment of the more popular Olympus Has Fallen and boy is he still dropping bodies. He is as quick and fluid as Chuck Norris in The President's Man albeit less taciturn. Much less. Yes, he is especially funny (or at least that's what he thinks)and suave as the American fleet approaches London but his sense of humor reaches a level so cacophonous, it had better been lost in transit. It is no secret that Mike is the focal point of the film, not the president of the US, or the Chancellor of Germany, or the Queen. Hell, not even the movie itself. He is the plot and it begins and ends with him.In the wake of the British prime ministers death, all of the world power in the hands of the most important and absurdly protected leaders converges in London for his funeral. It is said that he died of a heart attack in his sleep, but further investigation will confirm an assassination. It is during this event, the most heavily guarded as yet, that all hell breaks loose with the orchestrating hands of the archetypical bearded middle-eastern Yankee-hating mastermind. He is driven by the fact that the big bad West has claimed the life of his beloved daughter, and for that he's unleashed what may be one of history's most devastating terrorist attacks. No one is safe, except for anything that relates to the Star - Spangled Banner. That's right, anything American the bullets sidetrack.Agent Mike Banning fights every fight and endures one explosion too many but if anyone escapes unscathed in this yarn, it's him. He handles armies of assailants who are armed to the teeth using a single handgun which he reloads at least once or twice, and karate chops the others with his bare hands. He is just like the recent Deadpool minus the spandex.And is he ever jokey. Mike's one liners are so sporadic and twisted, he ought to depart from his duties as secret agent and opt for open mic Tuesday's. I'm guessing that's why he was composing that resignation letter at the beginning of the film. At one point the president of the United States asks him, as the two get trapped by terrorists, "What happens if you don't come back for me?" to which Mike answers after handing the commander-in-chief a gun, "Well, you're effed".This movie raises more questions than it provides answers. For one, why would terrorists choose one of the most heavily guarded events to launch an attack on and kidnap the US president? Even more odd, we are told they assassinated the British Prime minister for this sole purpose; to unite all forces of security in the world in one place then attack them. That's like trying to kidnap a Kardashian at the met gala.Why does every other person die but the president of the US? Is the only real target so hard to catch while everybody else is just collateral? It's like one of those alien invasion movies were only America is attacked and only America survives.What were the motives of the traitor who betrayed his country other than the cheesy "the system is broken" plot hole deflector? How can all of London Scotland Yard be infiltrated by mercenaries? Will Agent Mike's newborn be a wisecracking chip off the old block? All these questions come to mind but few will be answered, if any.London Has Fallen is a weak (but not terrible) successor to the first film and mediocre as a stand-alone. And if the first one was pro-America propaganda, this one doesn't stray any farther. It is quite watchable if you're generally into one-man shows where an individual kills 300 people with infinite ammunition a la Chuck Norris, and rescues people at the very last minute they were about to be executed. I'm referring to the last scene where the terrorist mastermind waits for agent Mike to come and save the president while holding a blade to his neck. Cliché much? No one kills the US president in a film on Mike's watch. If Gerald Butler was cast in a movie about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the story would probably end otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh is a feeling you get from this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Spoilers*****Personally I feel the Americans are the bad guy's in this movie, and here is why. They start of by killing the daughter and the guests at her wedding with a drone strike, missing their target completely though they get a piece of one of the sons. This makes the family go on a revenge trip, and who can blame them their little sister was killed for nothing. Their plan does not even involve "innocent" bystanders as we hear in the movie only 30 cops killed or wounded and they do not go after the civilian population, so in the eyes of war they fight more fair than the US, they do kill of their allies but again to them this is war, they could easily have bomb or nerve gassed the city instead, especially with all that hardware they got in somehow. All they are going for is the man that kill their sister, even Mike Banning is a terrible man. He tortures and kills a wounded man while he transmits it too his brothers and uses civilians as shields/weapons, he did't have torture and kill him but he did just to spite the enemy, and at the lair he disregards orders and charges in getting a lot of British soldiers killed in the process, he even kills a man in a wheelchair, and just to underline how insane he is he gives the order to blow up the building while he and the president is inside, burning to death all the "evil" men inside. And then it finish it of with yet another drone strike on the farther, because MERICA' doesn't need to learn from the past.And the plot holes are terrible too, hundreds of fake cops a couple of fake soldiers, that just joined the military in the right time and sent to the right unit to be selected for guards duty on the day of the funeral, all done years in advance as they have to go trough basic training and deployment. And then the cops apparently don't know how many there should be in one area, and they have giving the bomb dogs the day of it also seems, as one fake cop deploys a bomb under a car at one of their bomb checkpoints. We also learn of the bad guys location by their power use, but later Mike Banning blows up their generator and the power goes for all their equipment just before they where going live for the exaction of the president, which does not make sense if they are using a generator how did they find them by their power use ??. And when the power got cut of, why did the camera and laptops go out, those have batteries, they could just have tape the killing and then uploaded it when they got power back ?, and they did have one extra generator but the president was saved by slow internet, apparently terrorists has American internet providers. All in all this was not a well made movie, the actors where fine, it was the script that lacked any sense or moral justification for the "good" guys, as stated in the movie all the bad guy did was sell weapons like the US do, so why was he a bad guy as he says himself all he did was selling triggers.&#xfeff;</fullReview>

The story line was also bad depicting that the UK had failed and that the US was there to remedy everything. I have 1 question: where were the rest of the Police force from the rest of the country and where were the military? I realise you have to suspend belief in films like this. But come on, make it slightly believable...One thing that really annoyed me was the helicopter crash where by the helicopter fell out of the sky and came to a very gentle rest on the ground and most the occupants survived with no explosion.

World leaders come on down, tip top, right away, in cars and planes and boats and from rooftops float right into London just like Mary Poppins. Tippity Doo Mate!Meanwhile one traitorous man, British undersecretary of street lights or something, controls a vast network of the security apparatus. With one nefarious man, Buckingham Palace guards are actually terrorists, 80% of London police force are terrorists, the terrorists plant bombs everywhere, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, all the MP's favorite McDonalds - and nobody is the wiser, nobody ever thought it possible. Terrorists start blowing stuff up and killing all the world leaders who fall off bridges screaming in Japanese, or splatter their blood on German flowers.Well, everybody except the American president because he is righteous and just. He also has a very special secret service man, who, when faced with 100 foes says "Ha! They should have sent more!" Special secret service man escapes with the righteous and honorable American president. All communications are compromised, the undersecretary of street lights is powerful and not to be trifled with. Special secret service man stands under a satellite and Morgan Freeman back home, fulfilling his constitutionally powered vice presidential duties, understands the secret code. Check, Michael Bravo Tango Goodman 7. Wilco.Meanwhile, special secret service man must run away with the president once again. Safe house not so safe. Damn that undersecretary!

Bursts into the secret chamber just as the sword is raised above the president's neck, just as people all over the world are gasping in the streets while YouTube shines down from the buildings, like Blade Runner.Bad man going to pay! Bad man must listen to patriotic sentiments in between blows. We're not just one building! Smack! We're not just one man! Punch, Pow!

Evil mastermind looks up, sees and hears something bad coming. "All systems go, sir." says a tech, "there are no civilians in the area." "Natch," says VP Freeman, "that wouldn't be right?

He, in his wisdom and knowledge, does he not see the rest of the countries? Blah! The movie is atrocious to watch.

		<shortDescription>What a dreadful movie. Just appalling. A copy and paste of "Olympus has fallen"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We're bringing the war, to you. Make no mistake. This is the day, when your world changes forever."Dumbest movie of the year. A sort of sequel to "Olympus Has Fallen" but this time the battlefield is moved to the UK. Especially to the metropolis of London. The same key figures were gathered again. Aaron Eckhart plays again the role of US President Benjamin Asher who managed to survive a terrorist attack by overzealous North Koreans in the previous film. And this with the help of the disgraced secret agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler). Morgan Freeman is back again to take over the President's tasks as Vice President as soon as Asher ends up in an awkward position. This time it's during the solemn funeral of the Prime Minister of England. The idea of Butler to hang his secret agent braces on the peg (as he's about to become a father), is forgotten temporarily so that he can accompany the President to this state funeral.The moment the most important government leaders arrive for the ceremony at St Paul's cathedral, all hell breaks loose. London is being reduced to a smoldering war zone where major known landmarks are transformed into ruins and twisted steel. Admittedly, it sometimes looks impressive and this chaotic situation is shown in a convincing way. But you can't say that the special effects are very present-day. They look downright lousy sometimes. Especially the crash of the Presidential helicopter looked like crap.Don't get me wrong. I really enjoy an action-soaked movie once and a while. Such an action movie where you have to put your brains on mute momentarily. But there's a difference between mindless and entertaining action pulp and a plain utter dumb spectacle. When suddenly half of London throws off his disguise during the most secured ceremony and starts to kill every bystander (even a grenade launcher appeared from under a djellaba), this felt downright ridiculous. Maybe it's suitable for raising the level of spectacle. But after the terrorist attacks we faced recent years, this was absolutely insulting. I can imagine that people who do their best while working for the national security, would be p*ssed and turn their back towards this film after seeing such an amateurish organization.To be honest, I thought "Olympus Has Fallen" had a bit of originality, although it shamelessly copied the "Die Hard" formula. But this film smells purely of commercial extortion. So they can exploit the moderate success of the previous one even more. Adding the sentimental topic of Banning's pregnant wife and the wrenching dilemma Mike is facing, was a weak attempt to bring some variation. And don't get me started about the cheesy dialogue and failed attempts to bring some humor. Only the parodies on some European government leaders (with a flirty Berlusconi as highlight), I could appreciate a bit. I'm just hoping there won't be a group of insane morons who'll use this film as a guide to try something similar anywhere in the world.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>London Has Fallen Flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fall into a small category of people when I can openly confess that I really enjoyed the predecessor to this film, 'Olympus Has Fallen'. It was a no-brainer action flick that was, quite simply, fun to watch. Everything that made the first one entertaining was diluted and dulled down in this sequel. 85% of the dialogue was very poor, including the majority of Gerard Butler's one liners that had me cringing instead of chuckling. The 'banter' and camaraderie between Butler and Eckhart seemed forced and the jokes they shared between them seemed like only they would be able to laugh at them. The action was passable. When a film claims to 'go bigger' the action needs to encompass more than just the protagonist pointing his gun and shooting at people. One mildly impressive 'one shot' could've redeemed to film had it not made one blatantly obvious edit within it - using the smoke of a grenade explosion to mask the cut. All in all, the stakes were never that high and the odds were always going to be in Butler's favour. And yes, I'm now waiting for 'World Has Fallen' to arrive in a couple of years to round off this inevitable trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London has Fallen"London Has Fallen" has obvious problems. The First "Fallen" was better. The Prolog feels like an episode of "The Dictator". Next we switch to tree-lined Washington DC street where President Asher and Agent Benning were on a daily jog. The following husband and expectant mother wife scene shows good chemistry and was the high point of the movie - an oxymoron in an action movie. An attempt at character development was made at least, and return of familiar character Angela Bassett builds a continuance of comradeship that must have grown since "White House Has Fallen". All that assurances fell to pieces when the terrorists strike, as multiple assassins appeared at will and where was the ring of British Secret Service ? In fact where was American Secret Service ? Incredibly agent Benning seems to be only one defending and tried to shield the president. Angela Bassett offered no protection. Most of the time she was fearing for herself. With most of the world's leaders congregate in London for funneral of the PM, you would think MI6, Scotland yard and much of the British Army be there. They were near non-existing. No perimeter, no plan. The guy who was supposed to be in charge of security on the Brit side was a big joke as were his assistants. Once the terrorists strike, the whole of London became a ghost town ? You would expect swarms of police and military. None. The only time the military shows up was *SPOILER* after the president was abducted and the fire fight into the terrorist holdup. Strangely after that they cleared out so the Gerrard Butler show can recommence. Agent Benning is once again left to take on all of the terrorists by himself while the British forces retreated - how stupid ! There were no screen writers, just the director dictating he needs this scene and that scene, never mind it makes no sense for the Brits to be absent during the culminating fire-fight. The final payback sequences were somewhat satisfying but not enough to redeem the poor script.Lastly I understand the need to make London looks like a war zone, but what about some gratuitous tourist shots before terror? Rather the beautiful city of London was simply filmed as unattractive as possible. The same dirt brown sepia gritty tone of Pakistan dominates the entire movie. Even in early post at home, Gerrard Butler's complexion look old and wrinkled, thanks to the clueless cinematography. Even brain- dead action thrillers like "Bourne Conpiracy" there is much to admire about the magnificent cinematography, not so here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well - to say this film was a disappointment is an understatement.There are good actors, effects, action, car chases, exploding buildings, and so on - but no decent story.We are forced to endure the same old American feel good script that has been done many times before over the decades, and which has been done much better.Surely whoever financed this film must have read the script - or maybe not. Perhaps they were doing other things at the time - like being drunk or off their heads on some noxious substance.Without spoiling the 'action' for those who haven't seen it, I would say wait until it appears on some obscure cable channel at some point in the future, and only then when you have nothing better to do with your life - or are perhaps in your twilight years yearning for 'the good old days' when some young filly didn't change your incontinence nappy once a day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long time reader, first time reviewer. I joined up just to comment on this awful sack of excrement. Seriously, what was Gerard/Morgan thinking? Although I've clicked the spoiler button I did so to refer to Olympus has Fallen since, well, there is no plot; or at least nothing not given away in the trailer (which by the way, watch that and save yourself 90 minutes of pain).* Olympus Spoiler* With Olympus has Fallen, at least there was a level of plausibility in the attack. A full scale invasion only made possible by a B52 clearing a path. Protocol was followed by challenging the aircraft, it just didn't end well. In this no such luck. Label a guy "baddy" and he can avoid all detection, shoot wildly and freely at goodies and only die by our protagonist's mighty hand.And then there's the dialogue, if you can call it that. This movie is made up of seriously bad one liners throughout and nothing more. I hope everyone got paid serious $ to take this on because if anyone read this and expected an Oscar... *shudder* So why you ask do I give it 2 stars? Well I made it through to the end for one. I've watched several movies before and caved before long, that earns it an extra star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Olympus Has Fallen. I thought it was brutal (in a good way) and unflinching in its depiction of terrorism and violence. This new one... where do I start? Firstly, there's no suspense because Gerard Butler has become The Terminator. He plows through everything, somehow impervious to bullets. It's not until the end when he gets grazed... once. Naturally, every single bullet he shoots finds its target. Then there are the terrorists. Somehow they have infiltrated every level of the British defense force. I mean... even the Royal Guard, fer crying out loud. As Butler and Eckhart flee the terrorist attack, every... single... person... they encounter is a bad-guy. Where are the good guys? Nowhere to be seen. (Later a single army unit appear, too little too late). What about the British public? In the days of instant social media, half of London blows up yet people still wander around, oblivious to what's going on. A weak plot point about air raid sirens manages to clear everyone off the streets when it's necessary. What's more, because Eckhart and Butler solved their differences in the first film, there's nowhere for them to go as characters. Eckhart traipses around behind Butler the whole film like a sad puppy. Anyway, I could nitpick all day. The only way this film could have been saved is if it had ended with Queen Elizabeth brandishing a machine gun at Buckingham Palace, saying: "Get off my lawn!!" Sadly, it did not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the usual American patriotic stuff, the story line, and the action is so unbelievable that it's laughable. There are parts where our "hero" is facing dozens of guys with machine guns, and nothing happens to him; the dozens simply die. Sometimes they shoot each other, at other times, they take turns waiting for each other to die so the next one can attack.I mean, how often can you shoot at a helicopter with a rocket and not have it blow up? Yes, it happens in this movie. The whole thing is that unbelievable.This movie is OK if you are ten, but if your intellectual age is above that, I suggest you stay away from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this based on the cast. One of the worst films I have seem for a long time. As a Brit travelling for 6 months was keen to see some London scenes, shame to see half of it blown up. Never mind the yanks were there to save the day. No sign of our fairly capable SAS and armed forces of the UK, but spending some time in Vietnam now it's clear they know best. Films like this are not going to help towards world peace Struggling for something Good to say about it. Basis of plot reasonable but needed to go somewhere different , lots of explosions and action if you like that kind of thing.surely Morgan Freemans retirement fund must be reasonable by now. Rubbish, give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Olympus Has Fallen, and thought it was just a waste. But, they came out with this one, and I thought OK, maybe there was something I missed, and the second one would be better. I was wrong!! So, very wrong. This movie was even worse, and the it was incredibly sanctimonious! The point is that for the amount of money and the actors in this film, it should be better. But, it's not. This movie was just badly written, and the lines were horrible. I wanted to give this movie a chance. Mostly because it seemed like it deserved it. The actors, Eckhart, Butler, Haley, Salmon etc, are all good actors, and I have enjoyed watching them in the past. But, wow, I hope they were well paid for this movie. At this point, simply because of the idiotic 10 line requirement I'm just filling space. This movie could be reviewed in 1 line. The subject line!</fullReview>

Everybody at MI6, is stupid and they need a field agent come and reconnect the system. 2. For f***sake, the president of the united state is under attack and there is no field agent (CIA) in entire London or nearby to help him! What about Germany, or the Netherlands, how about NATO! 3. There is a thing called marshal Law which is used for this kinda situations! " Oh we should do nothing and wait till our hero to kill everybody then we can take back London!" 4. In one of the absolute sh** part in the safe house, two MI6 field agents leave our hero and the president of the united states alone to fight, to go where? what could be more important than protecting the president? I could go forever with this list! every part of the movie had these types of garbage</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a shockingly bad film. I'm not going to waste much more of my time by picking it apart. There is so much wrong with this film, it is hard to know where to start; so its probably best just to summarise - its far fetched to the extent of being ridiculous, the plot is terrible, the script makes you cringe and the effects aren't up to much. $60 million to make this! Really? I'm sure some of the action shots would have been costly to produce but many of the special effects were just not convincing, giving the feeling of a low budget TV programme, rather than a quality cinema film. If you like films with plenty of action and no substance, this may be your thing; if not, I hope this review might help you save 99 minutes of your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An attack in London ... which the film claims has "decimated" the city. Do the writers even know what that word means? It's been incorrectly overuse a lot lately..... That gives Butler's character another opportunity to wave the American flag with one hand, while beating villains' asses with the other, pausing occasionally to belch a few seemingly contractually obligated catchphrases and one-liners.This is the kind of movie Chuck Norris would have done back in the early 1980s, but he might have been able to make this fun, by not taking it so seriously. As it is now, it is an insultingly stupid, American propaganda flick, which, like its predecessor, is offensive if taken seriously.</fullReview>

But every now and then I watch blockbusters like this one, just to kill some time. A movie where you don't have to think too much, where you know before it begins how it will end. But with London Has Fallen I think we reach a point of complete ridicule. I think I was speaking out loud every minute of the movie. And not in a good way. The amount of time things happen that are completely impossible are too much to count. I'm not even going to spend some words about all the clichés you get in London Has Fallen. It is probably one of the worst action movies with well known actors I ever saw. I could not wait for this movie to end.

		<shortDescription>Lackluster sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Olympus Has Fallen was an entertaining Die Hard ripoff with good action, a solid hero turn from Gerard Butler, and it was simply fun. The sequel goes a step further and goes for the city of London as the "enclosed space" for Butler and President Eckhart. However, the movie lacks any fun from the first film and lacks tension which makes it a mediocre ride.Good: The action overall was decent with enough car chases and gun battles to fill in the running time. There is one action sequence that is done in one shot that was well done.Bad: The whole movie had no stakes seeing how Butler is a superhuman. There is no tension whether he makes it out of the situation which hurts the film. The plot is nonsense as the terrorist's plan is so far fetched regardless of how many years he had to plan it because these prime ministers would not be so vulnerable. Butler also is rather unlikable which again hurts the enjoyment of the movie. The rest of the supporting cast have nothing to do but look worried and say "Oh My God!" when something bad happens. Additionally, the special effects are simply terrible. I'm talking sub par The Asylum effects.Overall, the movie had some decent action, but lacks a likable hero, suffers from nonsense logic, a misused supporting cast, and horrible special effects.</fullReview>

U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) lands right in the middle of a well planned terrorist attack upon arrival in London for the funeral of Britain's prime minister. A world event being attended by nearly every Western head of state.Special Agent Michael Banning (Gerard Butler) is again in charge of guarding the president in this hunt, hide and fight back thriller. Tremendous special effects with disturbing sequences of most of London's major landmarks being destroyed. High-powered rifles and guns of all kinds provide fire power as cars and buildings explode. An extreme body count builds as the innocent are slain with the guilty. London security has been breached and it is not easy to recognize the terrorists led by Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul), who claims to have good reason for vengeance.An apt cast also features: Morgan Freeman, Waleed Zauiter, Angela Bassett, Radha Mitchell, Jackie Earle Haley, Robert Forster, Penny Downie, Patrick Kennedy, Kemi-Bo Jacobs and Melissa Galloway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much of the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my review of "Olympus" I mentioned another movie about the kidnapping of the U.S. president: an adaptation of Canadian self-taught literary man (and one-time Evangelist) Charles Templeton's "The kidnapping of the president" (1980). I said "That movie is at least intelligent enough to base its plot on the fact that a U.S. president is entirely expendable. This is precisely how, and why, the system works. "Olympus", an absolute no-brainer, bases its plot on the laughable supposition that preserving the life of the U.S. president is top priority on everybody's mind." Despite the numerous plot problems, I did compliment the movie on its action scenes. Much the same can be said about "London". The best commentary, made by a friend, is that despite everything happening in London, the Americans saved the world again! "Next stop: Beijing has fallen?" I ventured. "They won't dare", my friend responded.The plot line: state funeral in London attended by all the prominent national leaders around the world (with PRC and Russia missing, for whatever reason), they all get killed almost simultaneously, except for President Asher (Arron Eckhart) and his guardian angel agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) running all over London, the former eventually got kidnapped, the ultimate rescue, end of story.For the horrendously wasted cast, please see my review on "Olympus has fallen": http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2302755/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? I didn't expect much going into this movie, but I ended up enjoying it very much. Realistic? Not even in the least bit. But what action movie is??While I would normally have just rated this movie and moved on, I feel compelled to write a review after running through the ridiculous comments on this post. "Ridiculous American Propaganda" "Once again, a super American saves the day!" Give me a break. It was a MOVIE people, and an action one at that. They are meant to be entertaining, not realistic. The majority of the reviewers on here, presumably upset British, (when aren't the British upset about something?) seem to have taken every bit of this movie overly seriously. Again.. It's a MOVIE!! Regardless of what they might think, both British and Americans are identical in far too many ways, and this movie is just about as much propaganda as James Bond. (aka a super Brit saving the world in a completely unrealistic fashion.)To close here, if you are looking for a good action movie with thrills, explosions, and good shootouts, than you will enjoy this movie. The real kicker here is that it features Brits and Americans working well together for a greater common good. (a bit far fetched I know) Maybe instead of this childish infighting and finger- pointing etc, we can just start getting along. The world would certainly be a better place.. But maybe that's about as realistic as this movie..</fullReview>

The only positive I can see is ...... nope no positives. If you want real reviews of movies now days you have to see how many negative reviews there are. If there are just a few, the movie might be a good watch. When there are a lot then beware. For Hollywood to complain about internet movie ripoffs and then rip people off in the theater with this piece of crap is really rich. Don't even pay $1 for this dog.

		<fullReview>except that it had a different title and sometimes it was better written and acted! Given that we are seeing fiction being imitated by life more and more. I expected something that kept my attention, I expected at least an average movie, not necessarily noteworthy. I liked some of the top names so I rented it.Unfortunately, I was correct. There was nothing in this movie that makes it noteworthy. The script was very flimsy and rambled. I felt the actors were even bored! The movie jumped around especially after around 35 minutes mark, after all the key players were introduced. At one point, I was wondering if they cut some important scenes that fell on the cutting room floor, because one minute it seemed like people were working at a unified purpose (keep the President safe) to watching a demolition derby. So, if you like watching things blown up you will probably enjoy this part of the movie but I found myself thinking, we get it! Can we return to the movie, please? Disappointingly, they did and thank goodness Aaron Eckhart was able to call in some favors from buddies working at M16, otherwise, our President, Gerard Butler would have been murdered. Frankly, there were no surprises and I've read better stories by a 12 year old. Another disappointed reviewer said it should have gone straight to DVD and then the bin. I suggest, skipping the DVD and just saying it was crap. Undoubtedly, if it hadn't had big names, it wouldn't have gone to DVD, yes, it is that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood makes its money by asking audiences to suspend their disbelief. This film, however, asks us not only to suspend our disbelief, but to forget everything we may know about reality. The premise is a gathering of world leaders for a state funeral. That much is believable. But once that simple premise has been established, we are asked to believe that a non-Western arms dealer is capable of mobilizing a private army of literally thousands to infiltrate the British military and law enforcement on an absurd scale, and to then use a massive amount of arms, ammunition, and explosives (and apparently 50 or so motorcycles) to blow up multiple bridges and buildings. Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish. Gerard Butler's acting is limited to loud and angry grunts, growls, and barks, Aaron Eckhart's to tight-lipped seething.Each of the lead actors is given at least one, and sometimes several, propagandist patriotic and kumbaya speeches, so that the entire film has an intensely artificial "can't we all just live together in peace under American domination" tone. Very melodramatic and about as subtle as a train wreck. From a purely technical standpoint, the "Goofs" are too many and too absurd. The most irritating to me were the small civilian helicopters used to stand in for Marine One, which are like kid's toys in comparison to the Sea Kings actually used; and the obviously disused rural airstrip that stands in for suburban Stansted Airport; and the consistent use of tracer rounds in each of the firefights. If you want lots of explosions and gunfire and do not care about plot or narrative, this is a decent film. If you want an action film that is even marginally believable, this is NOT it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The British Prime Minister dies and world leaders come to pay respects, but it's really a plot to assassinate these world leaders. Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) the US president is kidnapped and it's up to Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) to rescue him. Once you view the destruction of London with CGI in full force, then leave and go on to something else because the rest of the movie is all shootings, shootings, shooting and it gets to be quite boring. Someone may wonder what Gerard Butler is doing in this boring shooting-fest. Well, it's because he is one of the producers. See? Trivia: yes, this is the same Mike Banning who was disgraced for a time in Olympus has Fallen. To be fair we do see some very good vehicle stunts when the President and Banning are on the run and being chased by the bad guys and we believe these stunts are real and not CGI, and they are truly spectacular. Kudos.Still a movie that gives us 95% shootings is not good entertainment and comes off as quite boring. Not good. Notables: Morgan Freeman as VP Alan Trumbull; Robert Forster as General Clegg; Alon Aboutboul as Aamir Barkawi the main bad guy; and Radha Mitchell as Mike's wife Leah. (3/10)Violence: Yes.

I use to like USA but my eyes have been opened and i now realise that the country is nothing more than Hollywood and 50% people are overweight, sit infront of their screens judging the world. American has become a intolerant arrogant country and do not earn my respect anymore. I know not all Americans are like that, but just that people actually write good replies to this movie scared me. Good Day everyone! :) (Sorry for bad grammar, just wrote this fast)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irrespectively of how much unprejudiced you want to be when you watch such crap, you cannot find yourself an excuse why you have wasted precious time to watch nonsense. Better treat it as a comedy rather than as an action movie...seriously, not even worth commenting. The already exhausted scenario of the "immortal" Americans, one for all and all for one notion, the world is ending but the altruism against the other American prevails, the fair treatment and the good purposes towards the children of the world, the bad Russian President not coming to a global event etc. really makes you angry rather than trying to swallow the viewing crap and at least enjoy some - silly - action scenes. Better overpass it and those watched it try to digest it..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a mistake to see that movie. I cannot believe that there is anybody who thinks that something like that makes sense. Yeah, the only world leader not to be killed in a massive terrorist attack is the American president and that because he has a bullet-proof security agent and he himself is some kind of a mixture of superhero and combat fighter.The rest is all blow ups and car or helicopter chases. There is not one original scene or thought in that movie. The whole story is unbelievable and the characters unconvincing and even ridiculous. Shame on Hollywood to produce such drivel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>one of the worst movies i have watched, weak scenario, explosions like that application on the iPhone, RAMBO was back, add for that the childish imaging for the us president as the one who loves all the world. Olympus was far more powerful than this, at least there were suspense, in this movie you expect every move, you expect everything, and how the story will end. surprised how Morgan Freeman accepted this scenario or this movie, anyway, sometimes you watched a bad scenario because there is some good work on action scenes , but this one neither a good story nor good scenes. Finally to summarize, this was done for political reasons and to send a message to Europe for criticizing Muslims and enhance racism against others.</fullReview>

If our security and intelligence services are really that bad then we are all truly screwed. Character development? How do you develop something that doesn't exist? Script? It would have been better as pantomime. Action sequences? Pllllleeeaaaase. Maybe compared to a 50s science fiction movie? Then, to add insult to injury, the gratuitous and completely non sequitur addition of the corrupt "insider" at the end to explain how it was possible to infiltrate the country with hundreds of well- trained and highly armed fighters, wire the entire city with explosives, take down the entire computer grid, all without anyone noticing. If our security and intelligence services are really that bad then we are all well and truly screwed. There is absolutely nothing at all redeeming about this waste of time and....(I would have said effort, but there obviously wasn't any.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this film is utterly ridiculous as my review title would suggest. Admittedly, you would have to be a little ridiculous yourself if you went to the cinema expecting anything else. The whole concept of the Queens Guardsman being infiltrated and shooting tourists outside Buckingham Palace, along with most of the Met Police and MI5, takes ridicularity to a whole new plane. Ridicularity may not even be a real word but it deserves inventing specifically for this film. Gerard Butler eventually orders the SAS to do his bidding, and as he is about twice the size of each of them, they agree without hindrance. Most of the elite special forces get killed by the English-looking terrorists, who assumedly were not made to look like real terrorists for fear of offending the real terrorists that currently inhabit London in real life. The SFX in this film appear to have been created in 1997, by the same brigade who produced that seminal sequel 'Escape from LA' with Kurt Russell.My only surprise in watching this film was that Samuel L Jackson wasn't in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terror Strikes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2013 action film fans flocked to witness the fall of the White House in OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN. With President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) and his cabinet taken hostage by North Korean terrorists intent of getting the codes for a nuclear launch. The only thing preventing them was former Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) who was there and hidden during the initial melee. The body count was high, the plot filled with holes and the concept of the security unheard of at the time but no one cared. It was a rock 'em sock 'em action flick in the mold of DIE HARD. So the idea that a sequel would be in order was a no brainer.And yet it didn't do near as well at the box office. Which is surprising because all of the things that made the first film a success are back and as over the top as the original. If you enjoyed the first film my guess is you'll enjoy this one as well.A drone attack okayed by President Asher meant to take out heavy duty arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) also takes out most of his family as they were together for his daughter's wedding. Fast forward to the death of the British Prime Minister. The heads of state are gathering for his funeral in London, including President Asher. Agent Banning is back on the President's detail (he was removed as the last film began) as preparations are made for the trip.Once they arrive and head for the church things change as multiple attacks throughout the city on all of these government leaders take place. With a skilled eye and a bit of luck Banning is able to save the President once again and the pair are on the run through the streets if London. The terrorists having dressed as police mean they have no idea just who they can trust. Communicating with MI-6 they head for safety.It turns out the terrorist in question behind this attack is Barkawi who survived with two of his sons. Having suffered the loss of his daughter he now plans to take his revenge on the rest of the world and in particular President Asher. His demands are simple: hand over the President for public execution.Of course those members of the President's cabinet left alive don't agree and the hunt is on. With each turn they take though Asher and Banning find more and more that those who they have trusted with their lives should not have been as each location they make it to seem to have more terrorists. On their own they continue on with the intent of remaining alive and ending the attack.Once more there is a lot of plot holes that need filling, some incredibly hard to believe moments and items that fact checker made issue of on blogs all over the internet when the film came out. But you know what? It doesn't matter. Those who loved the first film did so because they wanted to go to the movies for 2 hours and find some mindless film that provided plenty of action and a chance to root for the good guys. Those people won't be disappointed with this film just as they weren't with the first.Butler continues to shine in an action role offering acting chops combined with enough stunt skill to pull off his character. This time around Eckhart gets the opportunity to get involved in some of the action as well while providing a patriotic character we can root for. Working together you have no doubt that the pair will survive and that heads will roll.The special effects team on this movie are astounding. To watch as numerous tourists locations in London fall is heart stopping, just as the fall of the White House in the first film was. In a world where we see an increase in the number of bombings taking place by groups like ISIS thoughts that something like this could happen have shifted from it can't happen to when will it happen. This group gives you the opportunity to see what it would be like.On the whole the movie isn't quite as good as the first one but then again that sense of surprise you get when viewing a first film in a series of two or more is gone. The idea carries on with attacks on well-known sites being hit by terrorists. As I said this has gained more traction as a possible reality in recent years than it would have say pre-9/11. What makes these movies nice though is that they portray the President and the Secret Service in a positive light that any and everyone can get behind. It would be nice to see more movies with that tone.</fullReview>

When a truck hits a car (the car's direction looked like it was going to hit the corner of a building before the truck hit...), the car flips over without continuing forward momentum? A bunch of SAS guys get killed in a gunfight but not the Secret Service agent? And when the building begins to explode, the gunfire in the hallway just stops and they magically find an empty elevator shaft that they can /safely/ jump a couple stories down without getting hurt???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just about a good enough sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gerald Butler returns as super macho and humourless John McClane clone, Mike Banning in a film that is more at a level of Undersiege 2 (enjoyable but cheap thrills) rather than Die-hard 2 (a sequel with familiarity that rises above its plot faults to become an action film nearly as good as the first outing).Despite its silly premise of all major world leaders being assassinated in London, accept the U.S Pres' of course, the film has a decent amount of action, but has a flaw not rectified from the first outing.Many other reviews elsewhere have commented on the bad special effects in both this and it's predecessor Olympus has fallen, and it's a fair criticism, they are bad. It's not even a fair argument to say this is a B movie, it has a budget in the region of 60 million dollars, granted that's not huge, but its higher end B movie. The worst CGI scene (though others may find fault in most of them) is a bridge collapse with a close up of a car going into the water, it looked like one of the CGI vehicle effects from Twister 1996 ( cutting edge 20 years ago) and had no place in a cinematic release in 2016. Another complaint is the fact that London looks a little under populated at times, but at least the wide camera shots (not close ups) of the landmarks being destroyed hold up pretty well. It's also worth noting visually the film has a drab grey pallet throughout the daytime scenes, one could suspect that is easier to pull off CGI against grey skies, rather than glorious unforgiving sunshine.The practical action scenes of car chases and gun-shoot outs on the other hand are well staged, well filmed and as ruthlessly efficient as an action movie can be.The plot is not really worth mentioning, it's Butler kicking ass, lots of chases and very forgettable bad guys, oh and Morgan Freeman Sat in a room with officials looking worried, basically any terrorist take over movie ever made.It's fun, if lacking humour, apart from a couple of quips, takes itself seriously (not in a good way) and delivers on the stunts, you'll just have to forgive the CGI and go along for the ride to enjoy this.Decent action, short run time and a destructive level of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, It is always lovely to see a movie shot in London. Familiar places, making it relatable and keeping me more engaged. Secondly, if you have ever seen someone play counter or similar video games (as I have seen my brother do million times) then you will see that some scenes of this movie look a lot like that. Real-life lessons: well there is no real life lesson here with the exception maybe that everyone has a reason why they do something. Plausibility: this is an action movie so it is not expected to be plausible meaning that most of those fights that Mike Banning so easily won alone (taking down tens of heavily armed men with sometimes just a knife) is very unbelievable. It is also unbelievable that the enemy so easily took control of London and that so perfectly had planned all the killing of worlds most important leaders. I mean how come these men (with the exception of the US president) has such rubbish security? It just doesn't seem plausible to me but as I said being an action movie a bit of implausibility is expected. Character analysis: Mike Banning came across as arrogant rather than a hero. He also did a lot of unnecessary killings which I would not approve even if it means protecting the president. It is also implausible that someone expecting a baby and having a family they know is waiting from him to go back would go to such lengths to protect his boss. He would definitely not go inside that building all by himself or ask for the building to be blown.</fullReview>

The hate comments have no logic. Go see it and get entertained.Spoiler Starts: Plot is superb. UK PM is dead, every western world leader will attend funeral and bam, the terrorists strike. The thrill in these movies is to see how the response teams react and retaliate in situations which they don't see coming at all. Gerald Butler stole the show. Witty in serious situations. Smart fighting thinking ahead of enemy and taking multiple down in one shot. There was another superb scene during the power cut sequence, when the back generator kicks in, power restores, enemies see Gerald who is standing between them, all he does is move out of the way when the enemies start firing, and end up firing each other. Spoiler Ends.Great movie, I enjoyed it. Don't go for stupid negative comments. Looks like they are from some but-thurt loonies.</fullReview>

Where did the common ground go? even if it was the British Military the Police saving the president it would have been a different story. I found Gerard Butler was too mediocre and big headed, and every other terrorists probably didn't have the brains to look before they shot, or to even take precaution in so many parts of the movie.As usual The United States portrays itself as a super nation and only there president could be saved, this is in fact not the first movie who depicted the same scenario.Lets take another's perspective, apparently a white collar gentlemen who was criticized to be an dictator, to be holding weapons of nuclear, had the same fate with an all fascist US backed resolution. I found it repulsive that the land of the freedom, would constitute to such human rights would result to state that the United States is always right, and everybody else is wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right, I'll get this out of the way right off the bat; as a pure action film, this isn't bad; there's more explosions, car chases and gun fights than you can shake a Kalashnikov at. So if you like that kind of thing and aren't too worried about the wider story, then go for it!I was initially drawn to the film as I live 40 miles north of London and am there on a regular basis enjoying a drink or two along the Thames, so the thought of seeing my beloved city get decimated on screen was interesting, if not terrifying, to me.Plot wise, the Prime Minister dies of a heart attack, which necessitates the attendance of a variety of world leaders in London, at short notice, for the funeral. We see, if I may say, very stereotypical versions of the various world leaders gathering at different locations, from a female German Chancellor to an old lecherous Italian Prime Minister and his 30 year old mistress, etc.As the attack gets underway, the German Chancellor, the Italian Prime Minister, the French President, the Canadian Prime Minister and the Japanese Prime Minister are all killed in quick succession, whilst simultaneously the city if brought to its knees as Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster are blow up... and why? Well why else; the sole purpose for the atrocity is so that the terrorists can capture the American President!As you can imagine, the US Commander in Chief survives and the file ends on a positive note that the city is beginning to rebuild, and everyone is all laughs and jokes etc, but what kind of resolution is that?! The backbone of the European Union has been assassinated whilst a load of other sovereign nations have had their leaders brutally murdered!! This is not a victory, the terrorists have won, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada aren't laughing and joking!!It's films like these that leave the rest of us in the west scratching our heads over what planet the American actually live on! It reminded me of the opening scenes of Team America where Paris is raised to the ground and the American's responsible for it don't see why everyone's so upset! Please America, pull your head out of your backside and come join the rest of us in the real world!</fullReview>

Second, I really didn't like how they portrayed people from Middle East. Full of stereotypes and racism. I am sure we could've expected more professionalism and higher quality. Another thing that didn't really sound good is so much swearing. The word f*ck was used about 10 times, too much maybe? 2-3 times would probably be enough. (And seriously who says "Fuckistan"!?) What sounds really strange is that the first scenes where the real action occurred were just too much, unrealistic, but when you got further into the movie - action scenes got really... mild, or something. Which sound really strange.And here are some positive things about the movies and why it gets four stars and not less : Morgan Freeman - always on point, makes this movie a whole lot better.And this is probably why they get four stars as well because first 25-30 minutes of the movie deserved a 6-7. If they continued that way, the rating would probably be 6-7. In short; I've would not recommend it, I definitely won't watch it twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First lets discuss CGI and graphics.. Too heavy for my taste and too unrealistic except some good fight scenes. Secondly, the story.. Well there is none. So let's move on. Third, the flaws in fight sequences.. Too unrealistic. While every good guy is killing every bad guy (I don't know how as they all looked alike, in same uniforms) somehow all population of London has decided to take a vacation to some other city. I mean, explosions, long street battles, buildings falling, people standing at roofs firing stingers(which was an idiotic scene I must say; how did they hit 3 helicopters standing on two low roofs? Were helis kept on moving in a circle for target practice?), all hell breaking loose and no civilians anywhere?? Seemed more like some futuristic sci-fi apocalyptic London where either everyone is already dead or living underground somewhere. Next, Actors.. Well that was perhaps the only positive in this movie.. some good actors. And don't even get me started on the same generic overused "Plz America save the world" propaganda throughout the movie. While every other world leader and security was being slaughtered like cattle, of course only US guys, being the superhumans they are, could think and act straight. Too disgusting for anyone neutral. My recommendation, no need to watch this movie.. Just watch Olympus has fallen one more time. Was a far better movie anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you wandered into the room and this movie was already playing, you'd never know it was a film at all. It looks like a feeble imitation of something like Spooks,which is itself, a feeble imitation of 24.Except it's not even that good! Most films are shot on video these days but with the right lenses and post production video can be very cinematic. The look of 'London has Fallen' though, is sub t.v. drama. The effects look like they were done on an Iphone app. Maybe they were going for a documentary feel? No. You do that in order to achieve realism, and realism is no part of the philosophy of this tosh.The script for instance is mind blowingly dumb. . Characters are constantly doing things that they simply wouldn't do, given their motivation: If you were driving a bullet proof car containing the president, being chased by 20 armed motorcyclists, would you hang out of the door and open fire with a 9mm? No, you'd be throwing away your only advantage. You'd probably not hit anyone, except maybe an innocent bystander, and most likely get shot yourself. Far better to slam on the brakes and cause the bikes to crash into you. Shouldn't be too hard, given that each rider has an Uzi in their right hand thus preventing them braking effectively. Or, , if you were a senior member of the secret service, and you identified a double agent feeding information to terrorists FOR MONEY, would you confront them alone in a car park with no backup and shoot them dead for being a bad egg (assuming your gun doesn't jam)? No, they're your only lead to the organisation that has murdered half of the world's leaders. You'd interrogate them,and possibly offer them a deal and a bribe.Likewise, if you were a terrorist and you had the U.S. President in your clutches and the S.A.S battering at your door, would you risk waiting until the power comes back on before executing him so you can stream it live? Or would you video it on your phone and upload it to YouTube? It's tempting to speculate, that 59 million of the 60 million dollars it took to make this movie was spent on a huge 48 hour cocaine fuelled, binge, that appears in the accounts as a 'script development meeting', and during which, all of the production team competed to produce the most clunky and meaningless piece of dialogue, or the most demented plot device, so they could giggle about it later.To say that the plot doesn't matter in an action film is a cop out. Action films can be intelligent and involving, if you do them right (The Bourne Films) or they can be, as in this case, a load of corny, macho drivel.</fullReview>

The scene that made me roll my eyes the most was of him meeting up with an SAS Team to progress onto attacking terrorists in the street with no plan of attack just a head on battle where most of the SAS men ended up getting shot while Mike Banning kept fighting on without a scratch and giving the leader of the most highly trained British forces instructions on what to do.

After a few bites of rancid meat I don't need to finish off the rest of the meal before complaining to the chef. This movie was done for one reason and one reason only - to grab whatever money was left in the XXXXX Has Fallen franchise. Avoid at all costs, or better still, avoid for free!! Pure garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe Gerard Butler signed up for this movie and "Gods of Egypt" and kicked his career to the bottom in a year.Horrible plot. Terrible execution. Poor story line. Above all, one of the most populous cities in the world, London, is devoid of people all of a sudden. The UK police and intelligence agencies have been shown inept and callow. Just Mike Benning is the guy who is running the entire show. Where I am glad I didn't waste money on this film watching it in cinema, I still regret wasting my time watching it and wasting my bandwidth and money on it. Very poor attempt.Walk your dog, learn to cook something new, or just sleep -- just don't watch this film unless you really want to feel bad in your gut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing special to note there. I just saw it out of curiosity. Not even worth this much. It was an awful movie, filled with clichés and pure propaganda. It had the potential of being a great movie, especially the way that it started with the terrorists making that swift and bold move.It put the audience in a nice position and then all propaganda broke loose. It's a shame for the actors casted, as I actually have lots of respect for some of them. A bad movie. A really bad movie. Not even worth the time to watch the trailer. I tried so hard to find something worthy, but propaganda came and took away any positive aspect I may have been able to come up with otherwise. It's a waste of time, a waste of money and even a waste of the actual words I am typing right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and i've wasted 40 minutes trying to get into this film. It's still playing.This film is your stereotypical American wins all film. In London.I couldn't tell you anything I remember regarding a plot in the last 40 minutes, except it's been a god awful cheese fest. It's reminiscent of Independence Day, where the President is the hero and somehow everyone protecting him is borderline indestructible, can defeat armies of terrorists with just a knife and then deliver dialogue that makes your skin crawl.London is barren in a lot of scenes. One of the most crowded cities in Europe and terrorists can walk freely with guns. There's also no explanation for where the ACTUAL police are unless every single one has defected. We are luckily saved in the scene that's just come on where there are some loyal Brits ready to fight. Praise the lord.Some really awful lines too - my favourite was when one actress said 'it was a trap' - right after the President has been cornered outside St Paul's Cathedral with only her and a Gerard Butlers character to depend on, terrorists/police have fired at them and bombs have gone off in the city. I'm glad she can piece it all together! This is a really disappointing movie. There isn't much else I can say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot was kinda good, interesting, the beginning of the assault, okay it plossable for something like that to happen, but still, there is no way that come organization can infiltrate global security force just like that. Anyway the main goal with the movie was to spread propaganda about how much is US of f* A and GB that strong and powerful, and everyone else is the enemy .. I mean ... complete bs... they are the strongest, the best, RAMBOS.Dialogues are awful, very poorly done. Like they were made by some retarded 40 year old "patriots" and 12 year old youtube screamers. Story might be good, but in the wrong hands and wrong crew.At the end, one star from me, and move shouldn't get overall no more then 4.

		<fullReview>Its just terrible, by far one of the worst movies I've seen so far. I just felt the cringe creep up on me at the end of every action scene and when I thought things could not get any more stupid, they proved me wrong. Maybe I'm just exaggerating but those are my thoughts about the movie. The quality over all was just really bad and when an explosion occurred in the movie it just felt so fake and everything was just really badly made. Acting wasn't that bad but somehow I found everything about it just terrible. The movie is very predictable and it didn't have anything in it that surprised me. I don't recommend anyone watching it, it made me so depressed. I thought to myself what had let me to this moment, where I was so desperate for something to watch that I watched this so called movie. Well I wont make that mistake again. After watching it I went straight to IMDb.com just to check what ratings it got, it got a 6/10..... just wow. I just felt the need to write something about this movie, I created an account and started writing, this is my first review about anything so I hope you liked it. And if there will be another movie I'll probably go drink bleach and die somewhere in a ditch. I rate 1/8 would totally watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This piece of work is as close as you can get to a propaganda movie. The story has been told many times over in conservative media: If you mess with the west, you will be beaten and beaten up. Just to ensure that the message has come through, this thesis is spoon-fed explicitly, over and over again. If you were to replace the main characters with Nazis, you'd get exactly the kind of film that Hitler produced--with a higher budget. Whatever your view of this genre of film, keep this in mind as you watch. You will surely see the similarities.In sum, this film insults our intelligence but has some great action scenes.</fullReview>

Forty years ago I saw China Syndrome in a small Pennsylvania town and the following day the Three Mile Island Nuclear Facility had an accident. So unlike reality, our "Prez" is a tough dude, remember Harrison Ford in Air Force One? The movie has too many "F" bombs but the explosions, chases and fights are great. Lots of action. The baddies are a Pakistani Muslim arms dealer, his sons and the usual collection of perpetually and piously offended malcontents who hate the West. A bonus is that this movie now has the PC Police is quite a stir. The action takes place following the Prime Minister's unexpected death when world leader travel to London for the funeral. The hero is a U.S. Secret Service Agent played by Gerald Butler who is backed up in battle by the commandos of the British Special Air Services. Cool flick!

		<shortDescription>Just fine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>London Has Fallen is directed by Babak Najafi and include the main cast of Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, and Morgan Freeman. I enjoyed the movie throughout, even though it started off really boring it definitely had some interesting parts here and there. The ending is also quite fun, in a turn-your-brain-off kind of way. What bothered me the most was the editing, which was terrible up until that one-shot sequence at the end, where it finally got a bit better. Gerard Butler is really great on the role, a total badass, even though he was so in a very unrealistic way. The overall character fits with the theme of the movie. Aaron Eckhart is also fine here, as he is in any movie ever. I think this actor is terribly underrated and overlooked no matter what role he is playing. The CGI is pretty underwhelming, they should have increased the budget from the first movie, which was also better in almost every aspect than this sequel. London Has Fallen is not made to be over analyzed, it is just a fun action meaningless, suspenseful and to a point unnecessary movie that's made for 90's action movie fans to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most important thing for me in a movie is that it's entertaining. Now, true entertainment can come in many shapes and forms. A well written story and good script, nice effects, awesome action, humor, terror, horror, it all depends.London Has Fallen mostly has the action going for it. It's a simple story, it's written so that Gerard Butler can kick some ass and shoot people in the head. And I'm OK with that!This movie doesn't waste your time, which I highly appreciate. It looks crisp, expensive and nice. It also has some familiar faces. A weird thing is that some of the big destruction effects, explosions and stuff doesn't look all that good. Kind of strange, because it really stands out. You can clearly see that most of the explosions are CG. But I saw that already in the trailer, so I was prepared.With that being said, the movie is just really entertaining. Tons of people are shot, it's rather brutal at times, Butler is an unstoppable bad ass, I just liked it, okay?The story has some, well, not a lot is explained, you could say. I hate the word "unrealistic" when it comes to movies, because ALL movies are unrealistic, but this one is very unrealistic, haha.Anyway, don't listen to the haters. If you've come for some explosions, headshot and stabs, you will be entertained. Also some one-liners, 80's/90's style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London Has Fallen (2016): Dir: Babak Najafi / Cast: Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Alon Moni Aboutboul, Angela Bassett: First Olympus fell, and now London has fallen. They are stuck within a screenplay that is even less sturdy. A terrorist group loses their minds again and decide to target everything in sight so to gain some nitwit media threat. Gerard Butler returns as top secret agent whose wife is expecting a baby. She is also expecting her husband to run off to London with the president to kick ass. The character is a xerox of every other secret agent this side of 007. The one difference being that this particular one is on the boring end. Aaron Eckhart totally phones it in as the president. He talks big and pretends to care in hopes that viewers will relate but it is all horse crap. Morgan Freeman is another waste as vice president. His job is to chat in meetings, chat to a screen featuring the terrorist, and make lame speeches that uphold America while positioning every other country as pretty much nothing. Alon Moni Aboutboul plays the typical terrorist thug that talks sh*t before time arrives for his ass to get handed to him. Angela Bassett is also wasted as an agent contact. The production values are top notch with explosive action throughout but the screenplay is nothing more than one beat down after another. Director Babak Najafi handles the action well but above that this film is a pointless piece of crap. Instead of London falling, why not place this film some place where a large rock can fall on it and mash it into the pathetic nothing that it is. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The British Prime Minister dies, and all the world leaders come to his funeral. Muslim terrorists plant huge, incredibly powerful bombs in all the obvious locations but the vaunted British security people, whom we are repeatedly told are super duper, don't find them, not a one. The bad guys infiltrate the police and the military in such numbers as to equal or exceed the security forces. Suddenly the bad guys detonate the bombs. Cars go up in smoke. Tops of large buildings are blown off. Huge bridges come tumbling down. The bad guys use magical powers to shut down electricity in the whole city. They also shut down both civilian and military communications, even satellites. Their rampage knocks out almost all world leaders, even though those are all over the city, including on a bridge (blown out from under them), in a boat on the river (a barge pulls up alongside and explodes), and so on. Allahu akbar! But the President of the United States gets away in a nail-biting high speed chase through London and then on helicopters. Unfortunately bad guys are on untold numbers of unsecured rooftops with stinger missiles. They blow away one of the three getaway copters. They blow away the second. Then they blow away President's copter, which crashes into a tower and breaks into pieces in mid air. Nonetheless, the President and his Secret Service chief live! Bad guys, though, are swarming all over London, in complete control and knowing just where to look. But our guys are GOOD, and they take 'em down and get away. Actually, just our guy is good. The President is a helpless ninny who doesn't pick up a gun. The bad guys keep coming, but Secret Service Superman (hereafter SSS) keeps blowing them away. Meanwhile our Vice President, I mean, what a guy. From his office in Washington he takes over the minute-by-minute tactics of finding the President. Back in London, no matter how many bad guys appear, our helpless President doesn't pick up a weapon. It turns out the dead British MP was murdered by poison and his doctor murdered. Damn those terrorists are good. More to the point, our guys are terrible, except for SSS. Somehow our guys get to the residence (office?) of a gorgeous British security agent. SSS informs the President that she's a bad ass, so much so that he tells the President "not to f*** with her." The President isn't Bill Clinton, so he takes the advice. Geez, this is realistic. The next thing you know, our guys are driving in a car. They run into a heavily armed roadblock of bad guys, who still have complete control of the city, but the bad guys do such a bad job of it that they don't actually block the road. Our guys swerve through through a gauntlet of incompetently placed cars and obstacles and a hail bullets and bombs, and get through in their ordinary old car! But then they are rammed by the bad guys, who drag away the President. They plan to execute him publicly in a few hours. Wow, the suspense just keeps building. Can I get through this without peeing in my pants? Well, actually, yes, without any problem, but...back to the action! A bunch of good guys show up, and SSS says he's going after the bad guys, and if the good guys don't like it, they can stuff it. The good guys go with him. They find the hideout and kill dozens, scores, hundreds, thousands, millions, well, lots and lots of terrorists. Of course the terrorists abet them by being unable to hit the broadside of a barn from the inside with machine guns, rifles, RPGs. The good guys mow 'em down like wheat. SSS goes into the building alone. He mows 'em down like wheat. These bad guys really suck. The lead bad guy on the scene (the real leader is back in Yemen) beats up the President on worldwide TV and then pulls out a huge saber with which to decapitate the President. He swings. The President ducks. The bad guy misses. Just then, SSS bursts in and blows away more bad guys. He beats the holy crap out of the head bad guy on the scene. Another bad guy rolls in a bomb. It kills everyone in the room...except SSS and the President. Gripping! Our guys start to leave. The President *still* does not pick up a weapon. No matter. SSS blows the bad guys away with ease and style. Finally the President takes a gun. He blows away the bad guys with abandon. God, our guys are INCREDIBLY GOOD. Makes me proud to be an American. More bombs. One creates a gigantic fireball that rolls through the entire building, but our guys escape down a shaft even though the building is gutted. I can't stand this! I can't stand it, I tell you! A bunch of good guys come in patrolling the wreckage looking for the President. No sign amidst the rubble. Looks bad, boys and girls, but then ... YES, YES, they find our heroes in a pit. SSS cracks a joke, as anyone in such a situation would do. Meanwhile, the gorgeous British agent finds the bad guys' inside man and blows him away in a garage. Somehow, our guys found where the head bad guy was hiding in Yemen. The Vice President calls him on the phone, tells him to look out his window, and just then our military blows the bad guy to bits. The show ends with an impassioned plea about the need to meddle, er, engage in the world.Man, what a movie.No routine nudity or gratuitous sex, though. I guess it's tough to get everything right.Avoid it at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but meets modest expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have modest expectations, London has Fallen will not disappoint. Gerard Butler reprises the role of Mike Banning, Secret Service for the President. Aaron Eckert returns as the President. Old buddy buddy chums who just happen to be in this powerful office.The title tells you all. The President has to go to London on short notice, not enough advance prep time. Then suddenly, it all goes to hell in a hand basket. The plot is simple - terrorist leader strikes back against the evil west. Ho hum. The bad guys are from the middle east, which might be popular targets for hatred in summer of 2016. This film is super predictable. But it is also somewhat tedious. If you remember Commando where Schwarzenegger killed like a thousand bad guys and only got wounded once, that is what you get here. Mike Banning kills like I don't know how many bad guys. He kills them here, he kills them there, he kills them everywhere. There are also Bourne elements, especially these long, drawn out, tedious motorcycle chases that go on and on and on like the Energizer bunny. Stop it.The whole plot is unbelievable. Out of the middle of no where, there are like hundreds of bad guys in the middle of London with guns, bombs, RPGs, grenades, and no one to stop them? Stupid.Despite the tedious plot, stupid banter, and foregone conclusion of an ending, I was still rooting for Banning. He's kind of a down and outer. You learn he has a pregnant wife and is expecting his first child, so he has a lot to live for. Plus Gerard Butler as Banning really tries very hard to achieve his goal - protect the President. If everyone gave our all and were as dedicated as this guy to our mission in life, we could achieve much more.In the end, this film has enough inspirational moments to give it a modest 6/10 score. After the dust settles, strong clues are left that we have not seen the end of the "Fill in a City/place" Has Fallen movies series. What they could do to top this, I don't know. Set expectations appropriately, and you should be satisfied with London Has Fallen. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel to the 2013 "Olympus Has Fallen" where the White House was attacked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched this at home on DVD from our public library.Exactly 3 years earlier I saw "Olympus Has Fallen". Part of my impression then was, "I would imagine any person of any nationality would find it repulsive to see his or her country's capital and president under attack." This time it is London, and not just a targeted attack but great destruction of many architectural treasures of London. As is explained in the DVD extras, the 2013 movie was so successful, with a worldwide box office of over $160 Million, they decided to make this sequel and had to think of a novel premise. But the core story is the same, terrorists want to capture the US President and assassinate him live for the world to see, as a comment on what the terrorists see as unholy USA intervention in world affairs. This time the terrorists are located in Pakistan, an Osama Bin Laden type directing the attack.Gerard Butler is back in his role as Mike Banning, personal protector of the POTUS. And Aaron Eckhart is back as President Benjamin Asher. The event that sets this all up is the sudden death of the British Prime Minister after surgery and heads of state from all over the world are coming to London to attend the funeral. But the terrorists and their vast cache of weapons are waiting.It is for the most part an interesting movie but in truth I get tired of seeing so much violence depicted, we have too much of it in the real world.SPOILERS: Even though five world leaders are killed in the initial mayhem the target really is the POTUS. As I guessed early on the death of the Prime Minister was actually a murder, to get everyone to London. With London electrical power off and a mole inside helping the terrorists, Banning and Asher make it to a secret MI6 office, only to be joined by a band of terrorists. As in the first movie Banning manages to kill all the terrorists in sequences that would make Leon the Professional proud, and as the POTUS is about to be killed on live broadcast Banning gets there to save the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was okay, I suppose.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think a one star is a little biased as it wasn't a terrible film, but it wasn't great either. The main cast, despite them being the heroes, actually had an element to them that made me want them to die in this. Normally it doesn't bother me with how people are treated and races or anything within that spectrum like race or sex, but it strikes me that every president/Prime Minister is killed except America's, it is quite an evil aspect. And it makes England look incredibly dumb as our entire Police Force was infiltrated. I just don't understand why that was. However, the action in this was quite a spectacle. I very much enjoyed scenes as the action begun where buildings were blown up, however, it does leave me in fear of what so called terrorists are capable of. This film can tell them what they need to do. Also, I tried to avoid being biased, but I can't. When these massive explosions are happening in the heart of London, you'd expect everyone to be racing away, hiding, but no. When Gerard Butler is being shot at, it just shows normal people walking the streets, as if not phased by the massive terror attack. It's rather peculiar! Also, they killed the only character I liked. Do films enjoy doing that to characters that seem to have a heart and some development?Overall, it was a nice action film to watch once and never again. It had some good wife shots of London and showed how the world can win. There are a lot of problems with this film though, that could have been eradicated if more time was taken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."London Has Fallen" (2015) is a very poor sequel to a much superior action thriller "Olympus Has Fallen" (2013). It has nothing that made first movie at least fun "Die Hard" in a White House clone. Although action sequences were OK, script is beyond predictable and one note. There isn't anything that would resemble any character development, and at running time 1 h 20 min it is a shamefully short on running time, but being this poor, i kinda enjoyed that it ended. Overall, you can safely skip "London Has Fallen" because it is a straight to DVD kinda flick with many good names in acting department attached, but it is very poor written movie. You think writing doesn't matter for a brain-dead action shoot-em-up flick? Watch "London Has Fallen" - you will see what happens when any effort in writing department is being made to create a descent and involving action thriller. Poor flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second worst movie I have seen this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that Independence Day (the new one) was bad, but London Has Fallen is right up there with the worst film of the year. The script writer(s) for this film would appear to have been coached by White House officials or the Pentagon, to make sure that this film could be officially categorized as pure propaganda for the US military and the general message of terrorism in the world. It didn't matter to anyone that at the very beginning of the film a wedding party of hundreds of people in some "Islamic nation" was wiped out by an American droid. That was no big deal. Then when the US President goes to London with his Secret Service agent (Gerard Butler) and they take on and nearly defeat by themselves, an army of terrorists who have attacked London - I mean wow, this is incredible and toots the big horn for "America to the rescue." Look, I love America, but films like this are just an insult. It made the British police and their military look stupid, as if they couldn't chew gum and negotiate an attack in their own city at the same time. And it certainly delivered a big punch to the message that "the world is a dangerous place and terrorists are everywhere... blah blah." I expected better from Morgan Freeman - who was mouthpiece for the same message. Generally, these are good actors - but this was a very disappointing and poorly done production. Don't waste your time watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seen a movie where the president is in danger?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Then you have basically seen this one. Picture a movie that fits this criteria, man works for the government protecting the president, of course he is extremely good at his job, the president is on a near first name basis, he is wanting to quit because he has a new born child. You can probably think of quite a few movies like this, can't you? The clichés and cringey moments in this film make it nearly unwatchable. I'll give the film this, the visuals are pretty damn good; but with what I have already stated, I wish I could take back my time this movie took from me. I will not be recommending this film to anyone who enjoys movies, maybe to a high school student that only wants to see fiery explosions and helicopters and doesn't care about the story that they are watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London Has FallenTo get the upper hand on terrorism we need to employ the use of suicide bomber-hostages.However, the high-level hostage in this action movie isn't likely to be allowed to wear an explosive vest.In London for the Prime Minister's funeral, US President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) and his bodyguard Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) are caught in a terrorist plot to wipeout all world leaders in attendance and kidnap Asher for online execution.Across the pond, the US vice-president (Morgan Freeman) works with White House staff to solve the mystery behind the mastermind's (Alon Moni Aboutboul) motives and the possibility of a mole.Overstuffed with straightforward shootouts, commonplace car chases and patriotic orations, this unwarranted sequel to Olympus Has Fallen is even more bombastic and nationalistic. With Butler's brutish performance and xenophobic one-liners as its highest and lowest points.Besides, you'd get more online traffic executing that hunky Canadian Prime Minister.

		<fullReview>Okay, so 'London has Fallen.' Nobody was looking forward to it, nobody had high hopes for it. And to be honest, nobody should.The movie has a story-line predictable and not very unique. It's just a guy dieharding his way through an A-team amount of bullets rescuing the American president. 'White House Down' is exactly like it, but even worse. The acting isn't special, but not bad.That said, if you're just looking for a simple movie with a beer and crisps after a hard day of working, this isn't a poor choice. But just don't watch it with too high hopes, because a deadly simple movie is what you will get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why has such a low rating. This movie is entertaining from the beginning to the end. Good actors, few jokes, of course had unrealistic moments but it's an action movie and you cannot add that much action to it without getting unrealistic. The CGI was also great! Was the quickest 1 hour and a half and I definitely recommend it. I've watched the previous one Olympus has fallen and this one is far better. I also enjoyed how it ended giving to the telespectator a hope that might have another one. People that got offended as i read in some reviews, don't be, is not a 'based in true facts' movie, is a thriller. Worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escape from London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how Olympus has Fallen warranted a sequel... but London has Fallen is crazy. The storyline is simple... a powerful world leader/terrorist is being hunted and during a wedding his family and everyone gets drone striked. Years later they pull off an elaborate scheme to kill off all the world leaders during a funeral in London.This movie might be the most ridiculous film I've seen in a while. It's plot is similar to Escape from New York or the Purge 2 except it doesn't take place in an apocalyptic future but it does deal in an apocalyptic London. It's hard to grasp the concept of if it's suppose to be serious or just full out insane as some scenes where people die, the viewer is like "Oh wow that's deep" and some scenes make us really question who the real villain is.The dialogue is also questionable as there are some (questionably) "witty" one-liners and one-liners that are way too patriotic. Overall the film is if you mix all of the die hards, some 007, toss in some escape from new york, purge and loosely tie it with Olympus has Fallen are you get London has Fallen.This will probably be a cult classic as the pure destruction of London is one to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The British Prime Minister is submitted to a surgery and passes away of heart attack during the recovery. The leaders of the great nations must attend his funeral without a preparation of a security scheme by their secret services. The American President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) travels under the protection of Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), who is responsible for his security. On the arrival at the St Paul's Cathedral, the leaders and the public in general have a massive attack from terrorists disguised as guards and police officers. Mike and the president succeed to flee, but soon they realize that there is no one is trustworthy. The terrorist leader promises to execute the president live for the whole world. Meanwhile the New Scotland Yard leadership comes up to the same conclusion and they activate the alarm system in the city to remove the real police officers from the streets to know who the terrorists are. Further, there is a high-level traitor in the Secret Service. Who might be the traitor? What will happen to the president and Mike? "London Has Fallen" is a non-stop action film with great cast, impressive special effects and scenes of destruction. The plot is well- constructed and uses the state-of-art theme of terrorist attack in Europe. The exaggeration is what viewers of action movies expect to see with a hero capable to supersede the most incredible situations. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Invas?o a Londres" ("London Invasion")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst &amp; Offensive Movie Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never added a review for any movies that I have watched before in IMDb but here it is now.London Has fallen is top rated worst and offensive movie.First America Attacked At Pakistan. Showed involvement of a Secret Agent - (Pakistan/India) I don't care even if it was a mistake by them to attack with a missile. And I wonder how they made that kind of dumbest mistake???? When they could zoom in too deep with their satellite camera and didn't notice but we all viewers did. So a big lol here.Next, They felt no sorry after attacking at all. Obviously Mr. Big O President. And killed so many innocent people to kill one single person. Good joke.Later When London has been attacked. Most of all other nation president came by a different route where French &amp; Japanese President have only one Body Guard here. Another big lol here.At the end when Main hero character was saying "WHY THEY ARE BEST AND WHY Muslim WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO KILL THEM BLA BLA BLA. HE DIDN'T MENTIONED - SORRY WE ***** YOU FIRST." What it meant is Even after we do kill innocent we are the best guys in the world.And in Final Cutscene when a main terrorist leader will die. It showed the USA attacked him by spy drone and made him a call. From background radio, it's telling that No Civilian Found Around That Area. And they are ready to launch it. And Boom!. But Guess what?. There was a Women in Salwar Kameez in the scene who seems unharmed and only bought Teas for enforcers. Great JOB!.You Director Failed Big With Bad Script. Better Luck Next Time!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mix of Cluster F-Bombs, Offensive Comparisons to Real Life Events, Unlikable Characters and A Depressing Tone. It's Really Bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen Olympus Has Fallen. So I went in blind to London Has Fallen knowing nothing about the first film at all. I was actually excited to see this movie because the premise is actually quite good. World leaders getting attacked all in one place by a terrorist organization? That sounded awesome!But then it started.The First thing we see is a family getting killed by air strike. It cuts to two years later where our main hero (I forgot his name, it was something like Mike) is on his way with the President to go to the British Prime Minister's funeral where all the world leaders will be. Unfortunately, this leads to thousands getting hurt and killed including world leaders and huge damages to landmarks. It's up to Mike? I think that was his name? To get the president out of London.Where do I even begin? First off, lets talk about the use of the F word. Now excessive uses of it can lead to either two things. One, It can lead to some powerful dialog and credibility, or Two, it can be used just because. They picked the second option. I really hated the use of the cluster F Bombs in this film. I think they must have said the F word like 100 times in this movie, in fact, this could be a good drinking game. Yeah, get some bourbon and drink every time someone says the F Word.The problem with having the F word used so frequently is that it is annoying, it makes the majority of the characters unlikable, it is unsuitable for the horrible writing and it makes everything boring. The main hero swears so much that I really wanted to grab his gun and shoot him in the face for being annoying.Lets get to our main hero anyway, this guy barely gets hurt. Why do we still have to have movies where the main hero/heroine never gets hurt or is barely scratched? It loses all credibility for the character and it becomes boring to see him never get hit and kill all the bad guys in one shot. Also, he is a racist, he makes unfunny one liners that are cringe worthy and he swears like a freaking sailor.The movie is actually offensive. Why? Because given the fact that the Paris France attacks happened 5 months ago, making a movie about terrorists killing innocent people and politicians is actually maddening. I know I said I liked the premise, but I thought it was going to be more fictional instead of real. The movie is extremely depressing having no sort of fun or humor in it, it just reminds me of 9/11 and the Paris Terror Attacks even more. Also, the cinematography is horrendous. When it goes into night time shots, you can barely see anything. I didn't know what was going on three quarters of the time because the camera didn't have night vision or any brightness to it. Having action scenes take place in the dark without any sort of lighting is a big no no in action movies.The writing is horrible, the dialog cringe worthy and stupefying. It feels like they wrote the whole script on a whole roll of paper towel.The acting is bad also. Gerard Butler and any of the other cast members make you loath them. There was no one likable. The performances have no flare. There is one scene where you have to believe Butler wasn't trying at all where he insults a terrorist and tells him to go back wherever he came from. The line delivery is horrendous.The only thing I liked in the movie was Morgan Freeman's character. When he talks about his vacation to the main hero, I can actually feel like there is some sort of connection and realism to the scene unlike the rest of the movie.When London Has Fallen was over, I wondered if Director Babak Najafi wanted to point something out. Was it that you can't trust anyone but yourself? Keep your friends close and your enemies closer? No. It was to point out the world sucks. How we are in such deep crap that the world needs huge repairing. It was to re imagine real life terrorist events that bring fear and misery to everyone. It's a message of destruction, war and corruption of people. In fact, it's a hate film. (To Describe A Hate Film, it is a film with a discouraging attitude towards it's viewers) London Has Fallen is like that sad, pathetic kid who has no friends and sits at the lunch table alone while everyone bullies him.45/100 D+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falling Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In London for a funeral, the American President's life comes under threat during a city-wide terrorist attack and it is again up to the Secret Service agent from 'Olympus Has Fallen' to protect him in this sequel to the 2013 film. To its credit, 'London Has Fallen' does more than just recycle the original's premise and there are some eerie shots as Aaron Eckhart and Gerard Butler are forced to travel by foot through the dimly lit underground railway system. For all the time that they spend together though (far more than in the first installment), the film does precious little to establish rapport between the stars who always come second to explosions. That said, the film works better in action than drama mode. It is more than twenty minutes in before the action truly ignites and the talk-heavy early scenes are hard to endure with routine drama involving Butler feeling uncertain over becoming a father. This angle no doubt exists to provide character depth, but it actually serves to highlight how limited the depth here is. In the first film, Butler was a semi-disgraced serviceman trying to prove his worth; here, he begins and ends the same with little learnt along the way. Of course, if all that one wants is explosive action and the novelty of seeing several London landmarks destroyed, this film will suffice. The potential for more is striking though, especially with such a talented cast. And among such big names, it is odd that relative unknown Charlotte Riley shines the brightest, but as a disillusioned MI6 agent searching for a mole in her organisation, she has more to do than everyone else here.</fullReview>

What really offended me was how they made the whole of England practically defensless . It was just mind numbingly bad . Honestly I'm angry that I even have to write a review to say how bad this film is. Please for your own sanity and back pocket do not in any way rent or buy this film.

Poor CGI sequences, some very fake looking. It is so bad that half way through I decided to write this(I'm semi watching it now). Maybe this movie is so bad because of lack of investment or maybe its all down to a low grade writer &amp; director.

		<fullReview>To be positive, since the first one was a Die Hard-wannabe, this one was at least better than A Good Day to Die Hard.Butler, not by much.I really enjoyed the first popcorn movie. Its remake a few months later, White House Down, was just plain awful. And now we have a sequel no one asked for and after the final product, no one should've seen. Good news! Barely anyone did see this travesty. For an only 99-minute movie, it felt like three hours. The opening setup was way too long, the following *insert film title sequence here* scene contained too many incredibly bad CGI attacks and the finale felt like one cheap video game you'd return to Redbox in less than a day. Additionally, this 90s throwback was so predicable with fake heart-felt "save the President" gasps, speeches and slo-mo's, it didn't even work as an homage to the 90s action movies I love so much. Hell, even the worst season of 24 was 24x better than this.Basically, London's Prime Minister easily dies and everyone but the surprisingly smart Russian President attends the funeral. Gees, nothing bad could come of this. Yada, yada, yada, Presidential Protector Banning goes through the comical motions of saving the President.If the both the CGI and bad guys weren't so generic and underwhelming, it might be a so-bad-it's-fun flick. I never felt I was watching an action movie or a film where anyone really gave a damn. Skip it. ***Final thoughts: I really had a ton of fun with the first movie. Just see that one. Especially for fans of 90s Action Films, 24 and Die Hard. There is absolutely zero trace of any of that here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the British Prime Minister has passed away under mysterious circumstances, all leaders of the Western world must attend his funeral. But what starts out as the most protected event on earth, turns into a deadly plot to kill the world's most powerful leaders and unleash a terrifying vision of the future. The President of the United States, his formidable secret service head and a British MI-6 agent who trusts no one are the only people that have any hope of stopping it. London has Fallen has 2 huge problems first of all the cgi is awful probably the worst use of it in a long time and 2nd there's way too much destruction but it's an action movie what the hell did you except? If you enjoyed the first movie you might enjoy this one also although the first one is still more serious and more action packed or you can see it with low expectations and enjoyed for what it is personally i had fun with it and Gerard Butler alongside Aaron Eckhart own the film once more i give it a 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

American vice-president and military brass sit around watching on monitors and wringing their hands.We've seen this lame presentation time and again and this movie brings no new aspects to the story line. It is mindless drivel suitable only for the Faux News believers.The only positive is the never-ending action but then most Bugs Bunny cartoons also have that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hail the U.S!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not be talking about the clichés and stupidity of the movie scenes.Others have done this in the vast majority of the reviews.I will just mention that "London Has Fallen" is an utterly evil propaganda movie. It does injustice to Americans, portraying them as heartless, cynical and arrogant bastards who think that only they count.As most propaganda movies, it shows the truth, which it then tries to clumsily ignore or subvert.The truth is that the current type of world terrorism, while it is in large part a business project of the ousted Saddam-Iraqi security forces, still relies heavily on the anger and despair of those civilians, whose friends and beloved ones are "collateral", which means being murdered in the process of war on the terror.It is incredibly easy to recruit somebody whose father, wife or children -- sometimes all of them -- have been slaughtered as bystanders in the process of "eliminating a terrorist cell". Yes, the film portrays the main evil guy as an unscrupulous arms dealer, who sells to about anybody. However, the fact that during a failed attempt to kill him, his daughter as well as numerous others are casually killed during her wedding instead, -- not to speak of his relatives, but also the serving personnel: cooks, butlers, waiters, plus as far as I noticed, some children, -- that fact is downplayed as something trivial, and indeed is mentioned just once as "collateral", as if it made it any better.To add insult to injury, the new way of killing: by people employing a drone, while themselves sitting comfortably thousands of miles away is not either of any risk to the killers, nor it allows for precise assassination, such as a bullet from a sniper rifle.We can see this message reinforced at the end of movie, when the vice-president is gleefully informing the main evil guy that he is going to die, and another drone blows the building up... along with the evil guy's guards as well as innocent passers-by who happened to be on that part of the street at that moment.Witness the truth -- the collateral of this drone strike in reality would have probably created a dozen new terrorists out of the relatives of those blown-up, especially vulnerable being the innocent, as they can easily see the injustice of what happened, and can feel nothing but rage against those who slay so indiscriminately.Too bad this truth was not used in the movie, instead creating yet another smash-them-all shoot-for-the-win idiocy.Unless the makers were smarter and this is to be viewed as a parody. A tempting thought.For that, as for showing the truth -- 2/10 instead of 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but surely lesser than the Olympus has Fallen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the fact that there's a follow up to the first one "Olympus Has Fallen". Hearing the "London has Fallen" seems like wish come true if you come to like the first one. Well the opening seems rights and good makes you curious how it all happened but as the things happened after opening crisis where the London has fallen seems flowing slow to everything fell short and rush to the end too. Seems it went down all too fast, too short, less interesting than the plot of the first one.Though it wasn't as good as the first one you can never deny the action packed movie but it just went well too plain and simple. You better watch "Olympus has Fallen" and "White House Down" and compare it to this one.Anyhow, movie is a movie so I give this one a just right enough to keep me watching this franchise. But the 3rd one should live up to the first one.</fullReview>

It seemed somewhat less anticipating than Olympus Has Fallen (many events predictable, everyone but main characters die in the beginning, leaving very few and minimal things to deal with, which is this movie's downfall).

		<shortDescription>Good old fashioned Shoot em up - fun to watch (Guilty Pleasure)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is the plot stupid and unbelievable? Yes Is the acting predictably shallow? Yes But was it fun to watch? You bet it was.I'm sorry all the moral apologists want to tag this movie with some underlying meaning or propaganda message but this is not journalism or a dissertation... IT IS AN ACTION MOVIE! I came in with no filters expecting to see a good shoot em up movie and I got exactly what I expected. I knew the characters from the first one and didn't need the time wasted on re-establishing their characters. The movie was almost constant (even implausible) action in a haphazard script that requires you suspend common sense at times.Were there stereotypes? Oh yeah.Were there cliche's for dialogue? throughout But the bottom line is that I was entertained enough to have watched it more than once and that is all I care about when I see this type of movie. Understand what it is and what it is not and if it draws your interest, I'll bet you like it like a guilty pleasure. So I give this film a thumbs up, despite of all those reviews before me that ripped it apart piece by piece while missing the whole point of seeing a movie like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Vengeance must always be profound and absolute." After the death of the Prime Minister of England President Asher (Eckhart) and secret service agent Mike Banning (Butler) travel to London for the funeral. While there a precisely coordinated terrorist attack is carried out and many other world leaders are killed. Banning must once again protect the President, but this time the stakes are higher than they have ever been, and losing him would result in global chaos. I wasn't all that excited about this one. I liked White House Down more than Olympus Has Fallen. It may have been because I saw White House Down first but I liked the comedy aspect of it more than the Die Hard like Olympus Has Fallen. That being said I sat down to watch this with low expectations. That said?this movie blew all my expectations away. The movie is action packed, entertaining, edge of your seat inducing and extremely fast paced. So fast that when it ended I had to double check the time. On its own this is just a great action movie this is fun and exciting to watch. Compared to the other movies this is easily the best of the three. This is a movie that I highly recommend and is one you could watch over and over. Overall, one of the best action movies of the year. Thrilling and intense. I loved it. I give this an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall good action, but interrupted by too much stupid "storyline"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a simple movie. There is some good action, and in some scenes even awesome action. Especially towards the end are some quite long shootouts without cuts delivering a very intense entertainment.And of course the movie is filled with cheese one-liners and US propaganda. Thats OK, nobody expected anything else. However the movie takes itself too serious. Of course the story is stupid, of course the acting isn't the best. That is OK, its mindless, popcorn action cinema. But the creators of this movie actually seem to think they have the duty to deliver a message. They seem to actually believe this movie needs to tell a story...they couldn't be further away from the truth.The story this movie tells is simple: The US kill hundreds of innocent people, barkeepers, waiters, cooks, women and children. They are the good guys.The bad guys survive and kill hundreds of innocent people as revenge. They are purely evil.The bad guys escape, and the US kills hundreds of innocent people as revenge. They are still the good guys.Who believes that s***? Why even bother telling a story? The bad guys don't need a backstory. Delete all scenes before and after London and you have an awesome popcorn action movie. The scenes before and after London are a punch into the face of every human with an intelligence level of a brick or higher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to get an IMDb account just to comment after seeing this movie.In my opinion, the underlying message is more harmful than many a porn or gory stuff out there.A teenager can easily get misled into thinking that there is some truth in the "not-too-science-fiction" scenery portrayed. This breeds the opposite of empathy.Working in Machine Learning, it actually makes me think about what would happen when singularity arrives and a computer brain could study this movie and "reflect" on its implications for the future of humanity.Of course it is too far fetched for a B-movie, but i had to relieve myself of the sad feeling after seeing the film. I thought Karl Manhaiem said that the tragedy of humanity is that technological advances are not going on pair with spiritual/moral advances, and this movie is , in my view, a perfect example of this discrepancy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riddled with action! Very unrealistic and not for everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I reviewed "Olympus Has Fallen" recently and I also gave it an 8 out of 10. I understand why these movies are heavily scrutinized and criticized by people because they hint off propaganda, are extremely patriotic, biased and are absolutely filled with unnecessary and over the top action; but sometimes it's good to not over-analyze things.. I'm usually one of those picky people that judge a movie by its realism, character development and predictability, but with both this movie and the first movie, I really didn't care about all that. It's not a serious watch where everything has to mirror real life perfectly; they're both the type of films where you erase any logic or common-sense you have stored up in your head, sit back and just enjoy the ride. As unrealistic and far-fetched as they are, they genuinely are captivating, and although somewhat predictable at times, parts left me hanging with anticipation. Much like the first film though, the special effects weren't stupendous. They felt cheap, rushed and could've been a lot better, but they were okay I guess. I'm no CGI expect, so I don't fully understand how difficult it is to make great special effects. The actors did a wonderful job portraying their roles. The characters were seemingly 2 dimensional, but again, it's not a serious watch. The story-line is VERY unrealistic and flooded with over-the-top moments, but it's a great movie to watch if you feel like watching a heavily action based movie because the action is enjoyable. PLENTY of action - Mild suspense - Captivation - Numerous explosions - Shoot 'em up for days - Overall, a fun-filled 100 minutes. Certainly not for everybody. 8/10</fullReview>

Before making such movies mind researching on who is the real provider of all that weaponry and who are the biggest arms-dealers in the world?Hollywood should move past making movies on Muslims or representing them as terrorists and come up with some good ideas to make a movie. Whenever Hollywood runs out of ideas they make such shitty movies to ruin other's images. And using black colored people as terrorists, whats with that?

		<fullReview>Don't be fooled by the bad reviews and low scores. These are left by Millennials, the most brainwashed and leftist generation in the history of mankind. The truth is, this film is no worse than any other post-modern CGI action film. The difference is, this one does not contain the obligatory, subversive message that "diversity" is good and that we should embrace the world's most degenerate cultures, imbibing them into our own at the expense of our own cultural existence.Since the mid-1980s, political correctness has grown to terrifying proportions throughout the Western world. What's worse is that two generations have been born into this environment and, lacking any pre-politically correct points of reference, assume all PC propaganda is legit.It isn't. In fact, countries like the US and Britain have been all but destroyed by political correctness. Take a walk through any major American city and you will likely feel you are in Pakistan. In the eastern third of the US, 80% of the faces one sees are negroes; 13% Muslims; 2% Mexicans; and 5% genuine Americans of European ancestry (remember us? the people who founded this country?)This film depicts a very real threat--what happens when England and the US continue to permit the Muslim invasion and fatal vulnerability to terrorism which results. It is not politically correct; therefore, the excessively brainwashed Millennials hate it.In truth, there are a few politically correct touches in this film; the obligatory Affirmative Action casting of Morgan Freeman, plus the obligatory, militant feminist bull dyke character. But these are relatively small concessions to the times.Again, this film is no worse than any other post-modern action film. Self-loathing crybabies who will themselves into cultural and racial extinction at the hands of Muslims and negroes may wish to sit this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tripped over itself. When Olympus fell the public was served with the o'l fashion "Good US Guy vs. Other Always Bad Guy".Where Olympus actually gave you the feeling that it could happen, the London one was what you could expect. The acting is all right. Obvious. Good actors that did the job. Unfortunately the story was, also obvious, horrible.Why is it, that from a decent US film a UK version needs to be filmed that usually result in footage only appreciated by Brits. The "British Copy" (a.k.a. the BritCop) full of top British content like the best secret service (MI5), the best special forces (SAS), the best Luther, the best James Bond, and the best of everything from the center of the universe.Films with Rambo-like heroes is an American patent. One against the whole world. America against the whole world. I know they have the feeling that the whole world is always against them. Its a psychological issue. A matter of insecurity. Britain doesn't have that kind of culture. In England they know the whole world is having a laugh about them. That's why British humour usually does fine in the cinema.The film didn't make sense because of the above. A boring subtraction, a miserable copy where the acting was OK. But that was it.

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Olympus Has Fallen' was an enjoyable actioner that surfaced 3 years ago, it did reasonably well at the box office while it earned mixed reviews from critics and did leave audiences satisfied with the action, character and scenario. With this sequel however, 'London Has Fallen' has fallen short on my expectations that doesn't reach the high quality that was established in Olympus, not too say that it's bad as last year's 'Fan4tisc' but it failed to reach the expectations and became a half-arsed sequel.Taking place years after the hostage scenario at the White House (though I feel it doesn't connect to it as much), we see that the US President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) and his friend/top Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) are living life smoothly with Banning expecting to be a father in weeks time with his pregnant wife due for their first child, and wishes to be there for both of them to be a caring and good provider. But their peace will stop when both men are summoned to a funeral in London for when a British Prime Minister dies unexpectedly, with Secret Service Director Lynne Jacobs accompanying them. Arriving in London along with other world leaders from Japan, France, Canada and Italy, the funeral breaks out to a full scale battlefield as an army of mercenaries and disguised baddies attack the British capital with shootings, bombings and destruction, all following the orders of Pakistani arms dealer and terrorist leader named Aamir Barkawi, who is taking revenge for an attack that occurred two years prior.What's good about LHF? Firstly, the acting from the cast is good and there's moments of humour that seem to fit nicely when needed and there's also a few familiar faces that I can recognise from other films they have starred in. The action this time around is a bit more but I felt that the film was rushing itself to get to the next set-piece, it felt more of a chase movie rather than a hostage scenario like Olympus did and hell even the first Die Hard but there's not much to care for since this is a popcorn flick.What's bad? Well the CGI effects look really cheap and are not taking to great lengths, even watching London's destruction sequence I could tell it wasn't near as close to realism and what gives with the CGI fire and explosions. The plot itself wasn't strong and I was hoping it would carry the elements established in Olympus, there's not much to care for the characters besides the leading character and the ending of it seemed rushed and lazy (even in its stunt work).Overall, LHF is either a film you will like, hate or even feel left out after the credits but this sequel was so-so but it was made to lazily and cheap that it should have been made as a direct to DVD movie. If a third film is in the pipeline, I hope they consider getting a better director and vision to redeem itself.2 1/2 / 5 ? Nick So here we have it! The sequel to "Olympus Has Fallen!" It's been 3 years now since the first movie, so was 3 years worth the wait? Sadly not. frown emoticon The second the movie starts it's as if nothing has ever happened. Everyone is happy as Larry and are enjoying their lives! Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) has a feeling something is wrong when the President (Aaron Eckhart) has to attend funeral in London, with all the World Leaders gathered around. Mike Banning discovers a plot to assassinate all the attending world leaders. It's now a game of protecting the President from being killed and killing all the villains who try to do so! The CGI was horrible (especially the terrorist attacks in London), the stunt work wasn't that impressive, the acting was okay, the plot is so predictable and not even enjoyable or interesting or even thrilling! The first one was about the Terrorists holding hostages in the building, which made it more thrilling and exciting, where as this one is just a chase movie. The acting was the only decent thing about this sequel.I could go on and on about how this movie should've been, but I wont even bother. Whether you bother to see this sequel is up to all of you, but it's not painful or that bad, it just wasn't that good. As somebody who liked the first one,2/5 stars. Jay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this movie supposed to be a spoof?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gerard Butler gives a performance that can be described in one word: comical. True, the movie is not intended to be a comedy, but it comes off as one. This is the case because the movie is so bad that it can only be judged in terms of being a spoof on action movies. The acting is uniformly mediocre, most likely due to the paucity of quality material in the story, which is about as thin as a sheet of paper. Aaron Eckhardt's performance as a gun-totting POTUS who let's his trigger finger do all the talking may rank among some of the more bizarre Hollywood cinematic creations. The idea of the POTUS and his chief bodyguard running around London dodging bullets and punching out the bad guys is so ludicrous as to give cause to wonder how anyone could concoct such a story. As for the bad guys, well, they're not even bad guys. They're just a bunch of gun dealers who do what entire nations do - sell weapons to whomever is willing to buy. Hollywood; you can do better than this, unless of course, you want to generate some unintended laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting? London Has Fallen is a boring, rotten plate of bangers and mash!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think anyone would have predicted a movie like Olympus Has Fallen to have been the sleeper hit it became. Some people liked to compare it to "Die Hard in the White House", though I thought of it as a spiritual sequel to Air Force One, which dealt with the president fighting terrorists on his plane. Olympus Has Fallen may not be one of the great action movies of all time, but I enjoyed it's over the top tone and Gerald Butler still makes for a good action hero. It also kept most of the story confined to the White House, which gave a tighter surrounding and even a tad more intimidating.The basic rule to make at least a passable action movie is to start off with a small bang, then let the scenes build from small to bigger before finishing off on the final large bang. Whether simply dealing with robbers in Die Hard or robot aliens in Transformers, it has to not only look good, but like a proper meal, has to be paced in a proper manner. Olympus Has Fallen knew how to follow these rules to make for something entertaining. London Has Fallen tries to do more of the same.We open with the U.S. military launching a drone into Yemen, supposedly killing a major arms dealer and terrorist. We cut to a few years later with secret service agent Mike Banning (played by Gerald Butler) still being both great security and a great friend for president Benjamin Asher (played by Aaron Eckhart). Mike is about to have his first child and is contemplating whether to resign in order to spend time with his little one. Before he can submit a resignation, he hears about the sudden death of the British Prime Minister. Despite security concerns on short notice, the president and several world leaders travel to London for the funeral.Just as all the leaders arrive, the attack happens. Several bombs set off at the landmarks, damaging Big Ben and the London Bridge, and the terrorists attack. The leaders of Japan and France are part of the first casualties as Mike immediately gets the president out of the area. After chasing off motorcyclists, they make it to the chopper to fly out, but missile strikes bring it down. Miraculously, both Mike and the president survive as they try to find a way out of the city before the terrorists strike again.Unfortunately, London Has Fallen has none of the same feeling as before. Unlike before, this felt painfully boring. It's probably because that even though the terrorists goal is different, the story is essentially the same for our main character. He still has to save the president from being executed in public and needs to stop some villains from overtaking something. That's like if Lord of the Rings made a sequel that was set in the real world, yet the goal of destroying the ring was the same.The action rarely feels fresh as Gerald Butler does the same fighting. Things get worse as many of the explosions and crashes look suspiciously un-rendered and cheap. You'd think with a $60 million dollar budget, they'd put more effort in the effects. Gerald Butler is the one element that works. He's still likable and does manage to pull off some stunts. People like Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman feel misused and are given zero chance to do something new with their characters.If the people behind London Has Fallen were given this chance to make a sequel to a sleeper hit, why did they do the same story all over again? They might as well have remade the original.I'll give this two destroyed Big Bens out of ten. The movie feels so much like a repeat that I can't even recommend this as TV cable movie. I'd say that Gerald Butler fans might be interested, but I'd still stick with 300 and Olympus Has Fallen. What could have been an interesting continuation is instead a rotten pile of bangers and mash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, this one jumps the shark at least once every five minutes...and I think that's being generous to the film. The CGI effects are uneven, some are okay while others look like they belong in a low budget movie made twenty years ago. The politics of the film are fine, if your politics line up with those of Donald Trump. The script of the film is truly laugh-inducing. The action is sub-real. The acting is okay, but the actors don't have much to work with. My favorite moment was when the back window of the SUV the President is riding in, which has taken dozens bullets without shattering is totally breached when a motorcycle-riding would-be assassin crashes into the back of the car, creating a huge hole the size of the rider's helmet.And finally, the production commits a cardinal sin by killing off Angela Bassett's character very early in the story. But then maybe she asked to be killed off after she read the first draft of the script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, what action movie isn't overly simplistic and have some unrealistic plot holes? ALL of them. This is still a good action movie with some surprisingly intense firefight scenes and hand-to-hand combat scenes. A good action movie that, with the exception of the large explosions done with sketchy CGI, actually keeps its scale small so it can deliver with a decent context for the mostly non-stop action.And in response to the political hysteria in a bunch of this film's reviews, yes, the Americans definitely do have so-called 'black' marks on the track record of their history and in the more recent war on terror. But any reasonable human being who cares about what is ultimately good and true can sense that as despicable as those are, the black marks on the American record are visibly black precisely because they stand in stark contrast to the vast majority of what they have done and even of why they do it. And compare that to so many other countries and worldviews that foam at the mouth to criticize and demonize the Americans (and the West overall) and lo and behold their black marks just don't stand out much in 'color' against the backdrop of the consistent 'darkness' of both their actions and their motivations. If their black marks do stand out it's often only because of the magnitude of their size and depravity against either human beings or against what is good and honorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can the screenwriters even watch this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is ridiculous it must be intended for 5 year olds. Besides that though, I thought the actions, music, setup, editing and acting were mostly well done. Now back to why this should be an example of bad screenplays. Have the writers got the slightest clue of how a US president's security system works? The movie was doing well until the scene where the Japanese prime minister is STUCK IN TRAFFIC on his way to the British prime minister's funeral. Seriously? Anyone who has been late to work because of some closed roads for a head of state's visit knows this is not how they travel. Many other presidents were allowed to go anywhere and do whatever they want with minimal body guards around them, in a foreign country, right before a national event. The security system is a joke in this movie.A terrorist group was able to bomb all of the London landmarks minutes apart, fill every state department with their people, cut off London's power supply, listen in every communication channel and still have an endless supply of people to fight a single Secret Service agent, who kills all of them?! And the movie did not give a remotely satisfying explanation if how they did it except there is an insider. I had to cut my brain out of power to finish this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>USA saves the world action from start to finish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that made me watch this film is Mr. Butler and he did deliver. As usual he was the center of the action from start to finish and he did what he does best. The CGI was impressive and I couldn't work out what was real and what was CGI which was a plus. That in it'self was worth watching this film. However, I found it slightly insulting. I won't go into detail about that as others have covered that topic but just to say Gerrard is Scottish and not American, which gave the whole film a tongue-in-cheek feel. The same feel as Mel Gibson playing William Wallace in Braveheart- enough said right? Morgan Freeman did just enough but didn't stand out. If you like action films (which I do), like good CGI (which I do) and love the acting abilities of the greatest acting export of Scotland since Sean Connery then this film is for you. If you are sick to death of the USA solving all the wolds problems whilst sitting in an office somewhere in Washington full of monitors surrounded by faceless people in suits then you will be wasting 99 minutes of your life.Like most of these action films there will be a few of these ".... has fallen" sequels and like the 2013 prequel "Olympus....." if GB plays the lead I will watch.Footnote. I think GB should play Bond. Move over Dan you have had your turn!</fullReview>

Morgan Freeman played the same part he did in 'The Bucket List', Gerard Butler attempted to disparage the reputation of Americans everywhere and largely succeeded despite not being one, and, most amusingly, the British were almost entirely absent from London, no Army, no RAF, everyone dutifully stayed indoors and let the baddies and .. the baddies battle it out. Oh yes, I think I rather sympathised with the villains. Certainly those Americans responsible for this nonsense deserve to suffer under a 'New World Order' for all eternity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It decided to watch this movie based mainly on the 6.5 IMDb rating (now only 6.0) and for having actors like Morgan Freeman and Gerard Butler whose acting I normally enjoy.I should have known better and read the reviews first before trusting the IMDb rating.This movie is a disappointment in several ways. Firstly it has very poor CGI in lots of scenes, mainly in crashes and explosions. Secondly the way the story unfolds is totally predictable - you can use this movie to illustrate the history of action movies by enumerating all the clichés in it. Thirdly, and without getting into any spoilers (you've seen the trailer, right?), it's a very hard to believe far fetched plot that not even 007 movies use anymore. In other words, it's an unfortunate resources spending with such a poor result.</fullReview>

Big explosions, death everywhere and a city of London where you can drive at high speed or run through the streets and find no one, because the air sirens were sounded. More like they all fled to the EU!Anyway, the film starts with a drone strike on a wedding of the family of an infamous arms dealer. Not only does he not die, but neither does his family, except women and children and such. The destruction of all of London's landmarks and the death of all the G8 leaders is his revenge. It was funny, it almost felt like the speech at the end "we are not just a building, just a flag, just a single man" was more pointed to the makers of movies like these, where the point seems to be to blow landmarks up and then play 3D shooting games.Other than what I have described there is nothing really there. The entire thing feels like a computer game: maps that seem to only care about the places where you can shoot at each other, ridiculous reasons for not advancing to the next level and, of course, walking in a hale of bullets and not getting hit once. The only parts where Banning is hurt he shrugs it off, like a game character that after the obligatory "Ugh!" loses 10% health.There is a toll paid by all of us when film makers today are the people who only played shoot'em-ups in their youth. Blood and gore disabled, of course.</fullReview>

Script could be better. Some of the US patriotic lines are almost too much. If this movie has made with smaller budget it could be great B movie. But with such big budget and with well known actors you should get much better movie. They have included all the stupidest action cliche's in to this movie and blended them together to create a 1,5 hour action rumble. Script is so stupid that it is amazing that such great actors has qualify it. Some of the chase scenes are quite clever, but most of the movie is quite mire. This movie is clearly targeted to American audience who may enjoy it's patriotism. As an action movie it works quite well, if you don't mind a bad script and terrorists who can't shoot any action heroes to death. If you want something more, it might be better to avoid this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quick review of "London Has Fallen" (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"London Has Fallen" (2016) includes two very good action sequences. The first is an establishing major action set piece in which a state funeral in London is the occasion of a major terror attack. (SPOILER!) The second is a finale that should really please action fans ? it's fun and exciting to watch; the first-person-shooter style of it actually works, rather than coming across as cheesy.That's probably about all the positive things I could say about it ? as others warned me, it was a pretty brainless movie. It's a thin, poorly scripted story that isn't nearly in the same league as 2013's outstanding "Olympus Has Fallen." The dialogue is painful to hear. And that's especially sad considering that the film's two fine lead actors (Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart) have terrific chemistry with each other.The terrorists pull off an operation that is logistically incredible in this movie. No exposition is given about how the @#%$ they accomplished what they did, and in so little time. (Two years to put those assets in place?)How does the entire population of London become invisible within minutes ? even if they were told to stay indoors? Why did this movie suddenly turn into "The Quiet Earth" (1985)?Am I mistaken, or did a Butler's Secret Service Agent actually tell the terrorists exactly where he and the president were, as part of a macho personal challenge?And if Butler and Eckhart are alone and on the run on the streets of London, doesn't it make sense to seek refuge in a random home or apartment? The odds are astronomical that they person from whom they'd seek quarter would be in league with the bad guys.I'd rate this movie a 6 out of 10. Honestly? I'd really recommend you wait until it comes out on DVD. Then watch only the opening and closing set pieces, and imagine your own coherent story and engaging dialogue in between. You'll enjoy it more.</fullReview>

Gerard Butler is good in his role, Aaron Eckhart does a great job as the president (this time with a bit of chutzpah), and all the other characters are just as they should be. Someone always has to be the bad guy - this time it's the guys from "Fuckheadistan". We had a great laugh at that one. Boohoo about it not being politically correct. If everything was politically correct we'd all have to watch some version of Sesame Street. There is something politically incorrect about everything these days. They didn't actually name a country, so there was at least that in favour of political correctness.No matter what everyone else is saying, we enjoyed it.

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Olympus has fallen because it was stupidly fun like a fart from grandma. However, sequels are often the follow through which sends people gagging and exiting the room with some poor sod left to deal with it. The storyline reality here is akin to the Pope running a drug cartel and prostituting nuns in south America and the single psychotic and deranged US agent taking it down. Possible in some universe of even by the Borgias and unfortunately there are those Trumpette types who actually think it could happen and hence here is sustenance for the morons! In the case of this film a tenuous grasp on realism would be far too generous with characters whose thinness would put condom manufacturers to shame. Furthermore, the scrip and direction seems to have been put together while possibly researching the effects of crystal meth and crack because it explains the ludicrous character paranoia and behaviour traits in the plot and perception of peoples suspension of belief.London is probably the most closely monitored city in the world and to propose that terrorist infiltration could occur to this degree is just farcical. But you can guess how the premise came about. Originally the President goes to Baghdad with a bunch of leaders for a international summit on the future of the middle east and that hundreds of armed individuals posing as police would mingle with real police unnoticed and bring in heavy arms take out all comms, electricity and be able to bring down aircraft over a major city. Massive attacks by various factions hitting multiple target simultaneously, huge death toll of VIPs, that could happen! Yeah but that's what people would expect. Then someone piped up "I know, lets make it London, they've been attacked before" From there it just went down hill like a bloated fat guy after a pie van.On top of this, it doesn't matter how many acclaimed award winning actors they threw in the mix, when they rode into this "grandma follows through" sequel the stank exudes and smothers their acting prowess and gravitas. Is this a career killer? Probably not because crap like this becomes an oddity and a to be seen because it's so bad. Plus the director would easily do well in Bollywood Action Musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is even worse than I feared it would be. A very simple plot: An American single-handedly defeats literally an entire army. The enemy are two-dimensional assorted villains and Muslims (apparently the same). The supporting characters even more stereotypical and cardboard cutout than usual for Hollywood these days.Amongst the many problems are the CGI. Probably the worst special effects that I have seen in years.The plot makes no sense. All British policemen are apparently enemy agents - or whether they are or are not they are all shot down indiscriminately by the American.An obscure MI6 agent happens to be well known to the head of London police, who is himself inexplicably junior, black and singularly inactive and useless. There is no explanation as to why Mi6 has a safe house in London, or is interested in domestic matters. Obviously the writers don't know the difference between Mi5 and Mi6.The SAS manages to deploy, on foot, only a section led by a rather plebeian lieutenant, and their only role is to be shot while providing covering fire for the American. The rest of the Army and police are absent (apart from the dozens shot dead by the said American).There is no logic to a lot of what happens, and whilst perversely fun at times, this is a stupid and illogical movie.Many have said it is racist. I don't think that general hostility to Muslim terrorists is racism. But the way the British police and army are portrayed, and the underlying message that one American is superior to anything the UK has, is arrogant and offensive.American war crimes are shown as good. An entire wedding party are murdered, and the Americans express outrage that the families of the victims want revenge. Idiotic - however this is realistic, as it is just like actual American policy, and the reason why the USA will lose the so-called war on terror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't mind Olympus Has Fallen - the plot was a bit weak but it was OK. This movie, however, has so many plot holes that it is impossible to get into the story.A terrorist attack on London during the PM's funeral. Well, OK, that could happen. However, this film expects us to accept that one person, admittedly highly placed in Scotland Yard or MI5 - it's not really clear which, is able to get terrorists into the Palace Guard and replace about half of the London police detailed to provide security for the funeral, and gain sufficient control of the CCTV network so that instead of shutting it down, control is transferred to the terrorists so that they can do what they want with it. He is also able to intercept and decode American military communications, and organise a bunch of Delta Force uniforms at a moment's notice. And he knows where the MI6 safe houses are, something I'm pretty sure that neither Scotland Yard or MI5 actually know. There are hundreds of terrorists in London during this attack, and the British security and military forces seem completely unable to respond in any timely fashion. And all of this was set up without any Western security agencies having any idea what was about to go down.And then, of course, the hero is an American Secret Service agent. I understand that they are highly trained, especially the Presidential Protection Branch, but no way are they the equal of the British SAS in counter-terrorism and hostage rescue operations. But of course this is one of those American films that shows that no one else in the rest of the world is competent except Americans. Oh, and terrorists - they are hela competent in this film and manage to kill the Canadian, German, French and Japanese heads of state - and possibly several others.Good points - lots of explosions and some fun car chase scenes, but there is no way I can accept the basic premise of the movie.</fullReview>

Anyway, this was the kind of movie where you see Mr. Testosterone blast and kill with his M-47 machine gun as if he were in this high intensity video game, where "the bad guys" (in this case, Arabs) come at him a billion at a time, for ten full minutes. BORING! Also, you see a man whose hands are tied behind his back get full-powered punched in the face about six times, then, a half hour later, he's just dandy, with perfect white shiny teeth. People survive when their car flips and rolls, when they run through fire, and when twenty "bad guys" are firing at them. Simply amazing! Our American hero tortures "a bad guy" with a knife, twisting it grotesquely between his two ribs, and later the President asks him, "Was that necessary?", to which he replies, "No." I didn't know whether to laugh or to duck in shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie. . . where to begin?First, don't expect anything you haven't already seen 10,000 times in every other "action" flick. Seriously. Hollywood has officially run out of ideas and this movie utterly proves it. All this movie did was recycle the same old played out script, plot and action scenes right down to the bad guys, the revenge, the corrupt top secret agent guy and the impossible and unrealistic escape from danger.The action scenes were okay but nothing out of the ordinary. All the usual landmarks that one would suspect were taken out in this movie which brought the yawn factor up to an 11, at least.The cast was this movie's only and I mean ONLY redeeming quality but they weren't even really used to their potential. Every one of them could do better than this movie. (I blame the script and the lack of an original plot, not the actors.) That said, I should warn you that a 4 hour documentary on reforming tax law or perhaps the formation of a snowflake would be FAR more entertaining than London has Fallen.Don't waste your money nor your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"London Has Fallen"... straight into the Thames</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a movie becomes a surprise hit, as the White-House-under-attack-and-President-in-danger actioner "Olympus Has Fallen" did in 2013, earning $160 million worldwide on a budget of $70 million, a sequel often follows. Movie Fans (especially those who liked the original), can only hope that "London Has Fallen" (R, 1:39) follows the rules of a successful sequel ? and it does? partially. Keeping the main characters and also developing them further? Check. Sticking with the basic idea that worked in the original, but changing the setting and details enough to tell a new story? Check. Upping the excitement and action? Check. Telling a better story and making a movie that's superior to the first one? Oooops.The movie opens by nicely and organically updating the lives of the main characters since the events of the last movie, about three years ago (in the story and in real life). Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) and his wife, Leah (Radha Mitchell) are expecting their first child in two weeks. Mike is back in the good graces of the U.S. Secret Service (after his fall from grace and ultimate redemption in the first film), serving as Special Agent in charge of the Presidential Protection Division, and he's as chummy with President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) as ever before. Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett) is still Director of the Secret Service, General Clegg (Robert Forster) continues to serve as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Ruth McMillan (Melissa Leo) remains the Secretary of Defense. Allan Trumbull has moved up in the world, from Speaker of the House in "Olympus Has Fallen" to Asher's Vice President in "London Has Fallen".When the British Prime Minister dies suddenly, national leaders from around the world make plans for a quick trip to London for the funeral, but with little time to coordinate logistics and arrange for proper security. It's a situation that Pakistani terrorist and international arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni Aboutboul) has been waiting for since narrowly escaping a drone strike two years earlier. Barkawi's henchmen (including a couple of his own sons) are in London to coordinate a series of incredibly well-coordinated attacks against the leaders of the world's major industrialized (mostly western) nations, carried out by a seemingly countless number of terrorist sympathizers which have infiltrated the ranks of every local and national security force in London. As successful as the attacks are, they miss President Asher. Protected by the seemingly super-human agent Banning, POTUS is on the run in a dark and decimated London, with Barkawi threatening to capture him and kill him? slowly? live on the internet."London Has Fallen" is a half-way decent action flick which makes reasonably good use of modern international threats in its plot, but also represents some of the worst pitfalls of the action genre. Trying to be bigger and badder than the original? this movie accomplishes its goals. Antoine Fuqua, the director of the first film, passed on directing the sequel because he didn't like the script ? and the next director hired dropped out after a month ? just weeks before shooting was to begin. This significantly delayed production of the film, now in the hands of a third-stringer. I generally liked "Olympus Has Fallen", but remember criticizing the gratuitous violence. The body count in "London Has Fallen" is clearly higher, but most of the deaths occur out of the camera's view, although some of those shown are unnecessarily sadistic. What bothers me more is the deaths we did not see. Asher and Banning dodge an impossibly high number of bullets with barely a scratch. It's the equivalent of falling out of an airplane on a cross-country flight and only getting a rock in your shoe when you hit the ground. Meanwhile, the script has more plot holes than bubbles in a pint of Guinness and the jingoistic one-liners are reminiscent of the "Rambo" movies from the 1980s. The actions of some of the characters are also about as realistic as in those films, and the actors playing the terrorists are about as menacing as a gang of purse snatchers. "London Has Fallen" will pump up your adrenaline and your patriotism, but a thinking-man's action movie, this is not. "C"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On a one-way mission straight to Bargainbinistan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes you get the impression that a movie has been composed entirely around the base premise of a trailer and the rest is simply an unwelcome necessary afterthought. When that trailer concerns itself with blowing London's most famous landmarks to bits and Morgan Freeman looking dreadfully concerned, you suspect that the movie is not going to bother the Oscars too heavily the following year.The Prime Minister of England has just died from a suspicious heart attack, the subsequent funeral in central London attended by rest of the world's leaders is a security conundrum of unprecedented scale. Unfortunately, the entire UK's security, police, secret service and emergency response staff have been inexplicitly compromised by incensed arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Aboutboul), seeking vengeance for the drone killing of his daughter on her wedding day two years earlier. The majority of leaders are killed in an attack on the capital apart from, surprise surprise, the US president Benjamin Asher (Eckhart), who is lucky enough to be defended by the most nauseatingly supercilious head of security in movie history, Mike Banning (Butler). What follows is a meaningless chain of silly action sequences as the endlessly irritating Banning tries to return his employer to safety.Saying there are plot-holes in London has Fallen would unfairly suggest there is a plot, but the general narrative makes very little sense. The characters are pure stock and the tale is horribly strewn with the compulsory emotional family moments which instantaneously make you side with the terrorists. Morgan Freeman's implausibly predictable wise old man role is becoming a distinct bore, a step out of his safety zone becoming more and more necessitous as each film and identical character passes by.There is a sadly unsurprising miasma of xenophobia littered throughout the film with jaw-dropping dialog moments; 'Get back to F*ckheadistan or wherever you're from', made all the gloomier and surprising under the watch of Iranian director Bebak Najafi.Considering the movie was blatantly constructed entirely around the scenes of London's destruction, a surprising amount of the visual effects are mediocre; the Thames water dispersion from the Chelsea bridge bomb blast in particular has the mis-scaled feel of the Warlords of Atlantis squid attack.There really is no excuse for this kind of garbage any more. Since Lethal Weapon and Die Hard thoroughly redeveloped and modernised the tenements of action movies almost thirty years ago, subsequent comparable films should require more than just gun-toting idiots, stupid one-liners, gore and occasional underhand xenophobia. If you like films that allow the cerebral cortex to concentrate purely on hand-to-popcorn coordination, then London has Fallen might just kill ninety minutes. If not, it's one to steer clear of. Either way, this is on a one-way mission straight to Bargainbinistan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We're barely into March, and already I think we've found Donald Trump's favourite film of the year.In "London Has Fallen" the British Prime Minister has died suddenly and world leaders are converging on St Paul's Cathedral in London for the state funeral. A quiet, solemn and dignified affair. At least, that's until international arms dealer and terrorist Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) and his murderous and vengeful family have other plans. Soon-to-be father Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) has the job of leading the protection team for the US president (Aaron Eckhart) and its fair to say he has his hands full. Barkawi has inserted an army of comrades into the city and his intent is to execute the president live on the internet. Can Banning stop him? "London Has Fallen" is the sequel to "Olympus Has Fallen"; the more entertaining of two virtually identical 2013 movies with terrorists seizing the White House (the other being "White House Down" aka 'the one with the black president'). "Olympus Has Fallen" had the same mixture of Taken-style violence, but had a more coherent and realistic plot. In the sequel, every VNALI (Vaguely Non-American Looking Individual) is assumed to be a terrorist and promptly slaughtered. VNALI's are wily creatures, dressing as police officers and promptly undoing years of ethnic diversity recruitment by the Met Police.The script sinks to similar depths. "F*** You" shouts a VNALI to Banning, half through the side window of his SUV. "No, F*** You" replies Banning as he swerves the car into a pillar. You get the idea. The action is pretty non-stop but when it does stop it stops with a bump, with some pretty banal scenes and clunky lines for 'character development'.The count of machine-gun wielding VNALI corpses vs unscathed hero reaches ludicrous proportions in the absurd finale. A big case of more is less.Whilst a lot of the film is actually filmed in Sofia in Bulgaria, many of the London shots are all over the place continuity wise. Turning left out of Somerset House to get to St Pauls? No, I don't think so! The film is not totally without merit. Morgan Freeman, as Vice President Trumbell delivers his lines like honey poured over a large blueberry muffin. And the always watchable Angela Bassett is class as Banning's friend and presidential aide.The overall feeling of the film however is one of overt xenophobia that leaves a bad taste in the mouth.(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a love it or hate it movie. After reading many of the reviews from those who loved it or hated it I realized that those who hated it had criticisms that had nothing to do with the film. They didn't like the politics. As an action film it is at the top of the heap. It is up there with Hunt for Red October, Ice Station Zebra, Independence Day, etc. These are all good yarns told well. The same is true here. This is a thoroughly entertaining action romp with enough gun fire, explosions, plot twists and special effects to satisfy anyone's appetite. What it is not is a political thriller. In the fifties this would have been a western. It is pure good guys vs. bad guys without any pretense of reality. Warning: lots of violence blood and crude language with a couple of really good lines. If you are looking to be entertained for an hour and a half -- this film is time well spent.</fullReview>

The first film was just as bad so I really don't know what these one star raters were expecting...Overall everything about this film is silly and over the top, the plot has major issues and yes it's just another Americans save the day and kill the "bad guys" story but it still manages to be entertaining.If you just want to switch off and watch a good action movie then you'll probably enjoy it. If you didn't like the first film then you probably won't like this one either. Not a film I would recommend going to the cinema for though so just wait for it to come online.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are American; nationalistic (overly or just your average Joe); love action movies with light, funny dialogue; are happy when the bad guys get what's coming to them; and don't take yourself too seriously, you will LOVE this movie!Now, I've been watching movies for a long time and enjoy a movie that is meant to simply be entertaining. Although it is hard to believe that the scope and breadth of the terrorist attack upon which the plot is based would ever come to fruition, the writers commit to it and go for broke.SPOILER ALERT! This is a story of revenge. There's a really bad dude that sells chemical weapons. The G8 authorizes his assassination, so the US sends in a drone and blows up his opulent desert palace in the middle of his daughter's wedding. The audience doesn't know this right away, but the terrorist and his sons survive. Two years later, they put their revenge plans into action when the world's leaders gather in London for a state funeral.Gerard Butler plays a presidential body guard. Aaron Eckhart is the POTUS. Gerard gets POTUS out of the fray, but has to get POTUS to safety while the terrorists hunt them down. The part that is hard to believe is that the revenge plan, which was elaborate and involved replacing the Buckingham Palace guards and the London Police Force, could ever happen, let alone happen without any intelligence agencies getting wind. But seriously, if all of the world's leaders were to be taken out in one place, you'd need that kind of elaborate plan with members disciplined in keeping secrets, right?Interestingly, you get the impression that the cast really enjoyed being around each other and that adds to the comedic relief throughout the movie.Don't watch this if you consider yourself an amateur movie critic, if you feel it important to insult people who have different movie tastes than you do, or if you just like serious movies. This is a FUN movie. If you need an escape for a while, then sit back with your popcorn and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh! crikey! Where to start? Well let's begin with the jingoistic nature of the movie. It's the sheer arrogance that America just thinks that everyone else needs a hand dealing with anything difficult. Even the SAS take orders, which everyone knows, wouldn't ever happen on UK soil. Okay, it's a movie and we have to suspend belief a little, but hey, there are limits! The plot is so fantastical that you never believe in it. It would never happen......ever! The idea alone, that the Queens guard could be infiltrated is bonkers! You really have to switch off your disbelief guard to enjoy the movie. If you do get past the incredulous plot, there are other failings; the CGI isn't anywhere near what it should be, the script, at times is just cliché after cliché and parts of the plot just don't add up. The journey of the President and his aid reminds me of the movie "The Aviator", in that, it's a bit like the scene where Leo is falling out of the sky in his aeroplane, surviving hit after hit, the plane falling apart like a clown's car and it goes on forever. The British are painted as useless and, wait for it........it's all our fault. Let's get this right..... 9/11 happened on U.S soil! It's patronising(not paytronizing); clichéd; unbelievable; jingoistic; factually incorrect, in virtually every aspect of British security procedure and simply fantastical. After all that....... I enjoyed it in a strange way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I don't really know what to say about this movie. This movie makes up the most ridiculous story without explaining any of it. We are just supposed to accept the fact that the the vast majority OF London police has been infiltrated by terrorists. We are also supposed to just accept the fact that the entire Queens Guard, a highly prestigious military unit has also been infiltrated/converted by these middle eastern terrorists. OK... So after the terrorists cut off all electricity to London the remaining loyal police have the bright idea of sounding the Air Raid Sirens so that all the real police will retreat (Not that we have seen any real police in the streets). This way only the impostors are still roaming the streets. GREAT! now they can send in the army to clean things up! Right? No. I guess they just forgot to send the Army in because that never happens. But wait, they do remember to send in an SAS squad of about 15 men to fix everything.So instead of taking the lead as you would expect of the SAS they bump into Mr Butler and decide that he is their new leader and they will take orders from him! Great Idea!. Long story short, The SAS listen to the secret service hero, a bunch of them die because of him and then in spectacular American style, Butler charges in by himself and saves the President about half a second before he gets killed. Good Timing Gerrard!Bad Movie though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IQ Has Fallen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm kind of at a loss to know where to start with this review. I haven't seen a budgeted movie of this magnitude just fail so spectacularly for a long time.So where does it fail? Well, pretty much on all fronts.Firstly, the plot is beyond ridiculous. That terrorists could manage to get a few bombs into central London is proved fact. That they could also have a heavily armed HQ in central London, and manage to infiltrate the police in huge numbers is beyond dumb. Its insulting to anyone with a brain stem.The possibility to infiltrate police at a major security event is next to zero! Maybe one or two, at best, and then only if they actually were sleeper agents placed there long before. Not bloody scores of them! Having done this, and blown up anyone of consequence EXCEPT for the POTUS, the response from the UK is to blow the air raid sirens to clear the streets. Really? You expect me to believe that? For a start, no one pays the slightest attention to the air raid sirens because they are always being tested. So everyone ignores them. Granted, the explosions may cause a lot to take heed, but not all. Every person in a capital of more than ten million people clears the streets and sits in their homes. The place is deserted. Which is convenient, because then the terrorists get to ride around on motorcycles firing submachine guns wildly as they try to catch the POTUS.And you're telling me that, having suffered a major attack AND being aware that the terrorists are impersonating the police, the frickin' army WON'T be immediately called in? Now when I say police, I mean Scotland Yard, of course, because that is the only police force that the writers seem to think inhabit London. Never mind the Metropolitan police, or (God forbid) the City of London police squad. Just Scotland Yard.Later, London is plunged into darkness by the click of a hacker's mouse and no one, not even hospitals or emergency services, seems to have backup generators.But enough of the really pitiful plot. What about the rest of the film? The action? The acting?Well, the action is typical action movie fare. The bad guys all miss and the good guys have unerring accuracy. The main characters are all wearing their Kevlar plot-armour, of course, so are never in any real danger.Where the action fails horribly is in anything vaguely militaristic. The helicopter scenes are particularly terrible. Apparently, the Mach 2.5 capable missiles in this movie are not capable of going faster than the helicopters, allowing the latter to dodge around buildings and so on. Two minutes is all the time it took me to find that information. Apparently, the writers of this dreck couldn't be bothered to do even that much.But, but, the effects? The acting?The effects are really cheap! Whether it is the terrible river explosion, the terrible helicopter crash, or the awful billowing fiery explosion effects, they are all uniformly bad. There are a lot of VFX credits at the end, by many different outfits. None of them are ILM or Weta, and it shows. I literally have seen better in Youtube videos.The acting is about as you'd expect. Aaron Eckhart is not a strong leading man. Gerard Butler growls and looks menacing and only serves to make Eckhart look worse by comparison. Morgan Freeman and Radha Mitchell are totally wasted in this film, as is Angela Basset. There are no noteworthy performances to comment on.Overall, this is possibly the stupidest, most gung-ho (not in a good sense this time) and jingoistic piece of crap I've seen for some time. I can heartily NOT recommend it.SUMMARY: Rated R for Ridiculous. You'd be better off watching someone play Call of Duty than watching this. It is about the same level of realism but you'll get more enjoyment out of the dumb game. Terrible CGI, first-take acting, and a plot so insanely dumb only someone with no knowledge of the real world could have written it. Avoid this one like it had the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what is going on with me lately. I need to break the string of negative reviews that I have been writing over the last few months, but... It is not like I haven't stumbled upon any good movies or TV-shows, it is just that they don't inspire me to write about them as much as the mediocre ones and the flat out bad ones do.And, well, 'London Has Fallen' is a truly bad one, although for only one reason - this is probably the purest piece of mindblowingly idiotic propaganda Hollywood has produced over the last couple of decades. This is not a matter of opinion, it is just a fact - just listen to Morgan Freeman's speech at the end, the speech that I brilliantly summed up in the title of my review. Because that is literally what he said. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against USA, I react similarly when Bulgarian politicians or artists try to depict Bulgaria as the greatest country ever at the expense of other countries - just as this movie does. If you are an American, you are the best. Mike Banning is so American and so Heroic that he gets away with lines like, "Go back to F-headistan!" He is so American and so Manly that he can just go in London and boss around them puny Brits as if he owns the place. He is so American and so Great that he is the only security guard who actually manages to do his job properly. And yes, he is so American that no American is American enough to play him as an American should be played, so a Scottish actor is playing the role. The same for the other Americans in the movie, by the way. The F-headistanian terrorists have planned their attack for years? No problem, we, Americans, need just a few minutes to discover all of the crucial flaws in their plan. We Americans, we great. Every single American character in this movie, without exceptions, is completely flawless. Everyone else is either incompetent, or evil, or both, or has less than 10 minutes of screen time. Hell, the hardened British special agents are so special they can't recognize a bunch of F-headistanian terrorists masquerading as a rescue team, something that Mike Banning can do, apparently, in his sleep.Well, I think that is it. There are some admittedly nice action scenes, so the movie can be tolerable, but the propaganda just ruins it.</fullReview>

There are so many places where the president would have been rescued. Is it plausible that ONE man would have so many lives? As for the action, its great on a basic level. "The President's Alive"! And cheers go up. Well what did you expect? So they survive a helicopter crash, rolling over in at least one car, shoot-outs from both sides, hand grenades, knife attacks and so much more!

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A drone strike, intended for notorious arms dealer Waleed Zuaiter (Kamran Barkawi), fails, but kills his daughter instead, setting him on a course for revenge. Three years later, Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), the hero from the first film, is still President Asher's (Aaron Eckhart) closest friend, and is expecting to become a father for the first time. But then he finds himself travelling with the president to England, after the unexpected death of the British Prime Minister, for his state funeral. Even with tight security in place, Zuaiter manages to hatch his plot for revenge, plummeting the entire city into chaos and forcing Banning and Asher to dash off and somehow save the day.I didn't happen to think the original Olympus Has Fallen was really any great shakes. In fact, I was one of the few people to prefer 2013's other White House in peril actioner White House Down to that film. Yet, when this sequel rolled by, I must have been taken by it being set in the capital city of my home country, and seeing if there was a possibility of improvement in quality with if the action was transferred to my shores. With the country on high alert, meaning the type of destruction portrayed in the film being committed by ISIS is 'highly likely', it seems a bit of a gamble to get it released.It opens with some potential, but it soon descends into the kind of stupidity that, if I remember rightly, I didn't like the original for. From a nonsensical start to the action, with a group of police officers and other personnel turning out to be bad guys (despite the security checks that must've taken place!), it has soon lost all sense of credibility. All the characters, from Banning to the president, display patronizing and unrealistic displays of selflessness in the face of personal danger that make them cartoonish, whilst the action sequences not only maintain their level of ridiculousness, but also are shot in such a blurred, frenzied way, that they hold no degree of tension or excitement whatsoever. And Butler is still unable to pull off a convincing, subtle one liner.Usually, I'd give the follow up to a film I didn't like much the widest berth imaginable, so imagine my frustration when this turned out to be even worse than the original. *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Action Movie Involving terrorists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure about these types of movies. It seems that these days a lot of the action movies involve Middle Eastern terrorists launching some huge terrorist attack that in a way is completely unbelievable. Still, the main reason that I saw this film, and I have to admit that I knew that it was going to be an action movie involving Middle Eastern terrorists, was simply that I wanted to see a bit of action after having watched a rather intense Shakespeare play. Okay, the movie was enjoyable, and you do get your fair share of action, but a part of me feels that there is something missing these days compared to the good old action movies from the 80s.Anyway the Prime Minister of London has died and there is a state funeral that all of the world leaders have to attend. Of course the secret service is really concerned with security, but then again one would expect, especially in a place like London, that there is going to be a high level of security. As it turns out this was not the case for as soon as the president arrives at St Paul's Cathedral a gunfight breaks out, and a number of places around London are blown up resulting in the deaths of at least four heads of state. Not surprisingly the President of the United States manages to escape with his trusty secret service agent.While I didn't realise this at first, London has Fallen is actually the sequel to Olympus has Fallen. As such the completely unrealistic scenario that the White House is occupied by terrorists, and it turns out that the Washington DC police force has been infiltrated is translated across to London. Mind you, while we have had some instances of highly planned and executed terrorists attacks in the past (such as the ones in Paris) I still find the idea of the police force being infiltrated somewhat unrealistic. Also the planning, and execution, of this attack would have had to have taken years, and all it required was for one person to have been caught, and questioned, for the whole plan to fall apart. Okay, maybe this film is not supposed to be high in the realism department, but I have to admit that the only reason you would see such a film would be for the action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer to this film has all the best bits. Crammed into two minutes you'll see thrills and spills, amazing special effects and the occasional wise-crack from Gerard Butler - who has as much on-screen charisma as an an old wilting lettuce.The full 1hr 30 minute version is just padding. It's badly written, badly acted, badly directed, geographically incorrect - one minute your speeding through The City of London then the next shot you're on the Embankment, what?? Moreover, great actors are being made to utter bland dialogue. But yet again, it makes Americans and the American Government appear stupid. The film's unintelligent generalised politics is laughable and their foreign policy the usual John Wayne, overzealous drivel. This is not a thinking person's film. It's utter rubbish!!When films like this are done properly, like Airforce One, or Patriot Games, The Hunt for Red October, Argo, Munich, they're thrilling. This is not an action-packed thriller it promises. Don't waste your money, go to the zoo instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off it is a fantasy action movie whose lead actor is a Scot who naturally hate the English, so the actor playing an all American hero would not give tuppence for the validity of the storyline or indeed the reality. A question needs to be asked, where the hell was the British Armed Forces whilst all this mayhem was going on? There are 28 British military barracks in and around London Coldstream Guards Cavalry Commando Welsh &amp; Scots Guards Royal Artillary Royal Logistics and so on there are 2800 armed police officers, plus 4 X 8 man SAS/SBS squads attached to MI5 MI6, so Gerard Butler takes on everyone single handed and the President turned into Bruce Willis WTF..? Really why does Hollywood like to portray themselves as world Saviour's and everyone else as inept gimps ? When in fact it is US intervention in the Mid East which has destroyed nations instead of saving them</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was just your typical boring political, everything-blowing-up movie. I was pretty disgusted with it. It pretty much glorified the cycle-of-violence. Saying, "It's OK to kill innocent people for no reason. but when they get revenge, they're bad people. So we're good people for trying to kill more of their people." The whole movie was just stuff blowing up. London is getting attacked by these terrorists who are trying to get revenge for acts of terrorism committed to to them. Like I said, cycle of violence. On the bright side, the movie was pretty level-volume, so it was easy for me to fall asleep in it, or else I would have been falling out of my seat bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>100% shameless, cliché, vulgar American propaganda.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started promising, showing the enemies at home, and I thought "OK, finally we get a more impartial, more balanced and reasonable story which considers the rights and reasons of both parts". I was wrong. Once again there are just all-bad guys and all-good guys, once again the Americans are depicted as the coolest people ever, and their enemies are demagogically showed as dirty unrighteous evil "terrorists". The movie even shamelessly justifies the use of drones on civilians, one of the most horrible and socially perverted abominations of our times. Sit, relax and enjoy, wrote some guy. "It's just a movie", he said. Nope. It is NOT just a movie. It is a movie which uses actuality facts and offers a PRECISE political and moral vision of those facts, and whoever thinks he can separate the "entertainment" from the reality has been successfully brainwashed! If this was a fantasy movie set in some other planet with some pink creatures trying to kill the leader of some green creatures for some x reason, I could enjoy. But it is planet Earth, and once again I have to tolerate the Americans playing the most righteous Country on the planet, the only one who can use all the violence you can imagine and still come out as morally just, poor innocent people having to defend themselves from terrible evil enemies who have absolutely no reason to do what they do. And whatever the enemies (the so called "terrorist") do, it is always and only bad, period. Whatever the Americans do, it is always and only good, period. And killing Arabic civilians with a drone is OK. But killing Americans with a bomb is bad. Somebody will say "well, how are we supposed to kill those bastards then, if they hide among civilians?". Cool, what about carpet-bombing the parts of your big cities which are famous for hosting a highly concentrated amount of criminal life? You would get rid of all criminals of your Country in one shot! With some collateral damage on civilians of course, exactly as when you send drones to kill those Arabs you hate so much. What did you say? Killing American Civilians is not the same as killing Arabic Civilians? WHY?If what I wrote sounds idiot to you, you have the (lack of) brain to enjoy this movie. So s(h)it, relax, and enjoy your American "dream". Hopefully one day you will wake up and realize that the dream is over since a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong while (IF it ever was true), and that reality is much different from what your Country wants you to believe. But if you are happy with some explosions and your popcorn, go on and watch this horrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Argh I wish I found Gerard Butler as fit as Channing Tatum. I don't.This film actually looks quite good. London is shot brilliantly, even the falling of it, as per the title.My critique is about the use of guns. I'm fine with the odd gun, shooting, etc. However there were gunshots after the 1st 20 minutes that last seeming forever. With a few breaks it was banging on throughout the film. I find it typical that the last film only took place in the White House, without it being shot to bits. Poor old London. Poor old Gerard, you alas will never be Tatum :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first film was a decent entertainer, I kind of liked that and a box office hit as well. So the producers saw an opportunity to bring another film and yep, this film did slightly better than the original, but the product was qualityless. The graphics were just okay, but overall very poor in those blow-up scenes which were the most essential for a theme like this.Not all, though some of the action sequences were terrible and the story was very weak. In fact, there's no story, the whole film was an action- thriller just like the previous film. But that's how this theme revolves, yet as a one, it is a bit disappointing follow-up without surprises. Anyway, I'm with the original film director who backed out of the project for giving him a bad script to direct.So the London is the latest victim of the plot for the US president's assassination. Particularly this 2nd part looked so much more alike a computer game than actors who are exhibiting their roles. Like the London is a battlefield and level after level the story making its progress till the game over, but we know who wins in the end. I don't know whose performance was much better, because I did not find anyone with par to appreciate.What this film did at the box office was a miracle, so I don't think the filmmakers go for another script anytime soon. But if they do, I'm wondering which capitol would be the next victim of a terror attack. Expecting Tokyo or Canberra, especially Mumbai would be an ideal location. This is not a bad film, you can try it once, but watching it like sitting next to who's with xbox joystick.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what you would expect - Things blowing up and propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess that while I watched the movie for fun and action, I also viewed it under the spectrum of politics and propaganda. To get a very good idea of what this movie is I thing both would be important.Firstly, Politics...The first few scenes of the movie gave me a ray of hope. It showed drone strikes on a wedding, and this scene gave me the idea that the movie might touch on the subject of collateral damage of these drone strikes and also how they affect innocents living in those areas. Well I was duly disappointed when at the end of the movie Morgan freeman can heard in the background not only justifying it, but also justifying US interference in other countries. And hence the movie has attained its place in the wide range of movies made for the sole purpose of furthering propaganda (Good guy US always saves the day, Good guy US will do everything to help others ).While the propaganda itself might be enough to turn the movie sour, there is much more. The action was not particularly gripping except the sequence of shots where they enter the command center. As expected, the president and our hero defied all logic to survive where almost everyone else died. The story was so blank that a 10 year old could decipher it all after watching the first 10 minutes, not to say it was also fool of loop holes like, where do all the police officers who go corrupt disappear at the end? Why is the president of China stuck in a traffic jam? Why can't they just make a video of them killing the president using a mobile and then upload it later? Where does all of the president's secret service disappear at the first sight of terrorists. Why doesn't literally any other president have any damn security? Oh and it ends so abruptly that the characters have to literally tell you that its finally come to an end.This movie could have been much more than blatant propaganda. So much could have been made of the opening scene. More action sequences like the one where Gerard fights alongside the SAS could be used. But in the end, the purpose was not to make a good film, but to make a 'good American' film and so it has failed terribly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has two Academy Award winners and two nominees, neither of which are our two leads. Keep that in mind while watching London Has Fallen, the sequel to one of the laziest rip-offs of the "Die Hard but in a (insert locale here)" cliché. This movie is Wrestle Mania, this movie is Donald Trump, this movie is a representation, an amalgam of everything that is coming at us that no one admits to wanting yet secretly want to watch the world burn.Since the events of Olympus Has Fallen (2013), our protagonist Mike Banning (Butler) has been added back on President Asher's (Eckhart) Secret Service detail and the two have never been closer. Banning considers retirement but puts his resignation on hold after the unexpected death of the British Prime Minister. The funeral becomes a must-attend event for the leaders of the free world thus the American President along with several other members of the well-to- do, arrive in London and inadvertently fall into a terrorist plot. Will the President and Banning be able to make it out of London alive? More importantly, will London survive them?As with all sequels, this film is bigger, louder and so much dumber; which is saying a lot since the prequel pitted North Korea, a population of 24 million against the U.S. of A (319 million). There's furious gunfire, confusing fight sequences and more CGI explosions you can shake a stick at, yet all of it signifies nothing. There were many moments during the film I thought the whole thing was a ruse; a clandestine satire on America's most jingoistic tendencies. Yet with four different writers and relatively green director Babak Najafi behind the scenes, I doubt a cogent message like that would have occurred to them. No, this is just a movie about things going boom.The irony is there were so many people watching this movie who were completely unaware it was a sequel. They were simply intrigued by the trailer which featured an entire city reduced to rubble and a vaguely Muslim villain ominously croaking "imagine every western city descending into chaos." Yes, because why worry about the complexities of international relations, globalization, illegal weapons trafficking and religious zealotry when the solution to all those ills can be shoot the faceless brown people. The xenophobia in this film was palpable even when the occasional pasty-faced traitor came out the woodwork. Our impossibly lucky hero Banning seems to take joy in dispatching bad guys going so far as to torturing one while his brother listens frantically on the radio. He honestly seems more concerned with quenching his bloodlust than keeping the president safe, saving lives and/or trying to get home to his family safe.Even if we were to ignore the film's gleeful attitude towards psychopathic violence, and it's simplistic, jingoistic, borderline racist treatment of every nationality, it's still a badly constructed movie. The impossibly complicated terrorist plot is all but ignored in the face of an overly simplistic avoid capture narrative. To help guide audiences along, there are constant tile cards that pop up to give each minor character a name and a title and each location a plot on the globe. Why is this necessary? Why repeat information to the audience to the point where it becomes annoying? Could it possibly be that the creators of this 90's retread thought we are too stupid to figure anything out? What's more likely is they knew London Has Fallen isn't the kind of movie you watch in theaters. No London Has Fallen is the kind of movie you barely pay attention to while folding laundry at home.This movie marks the second week in a row Gerard Butler has graced us with his presence on the big screen. Both times there has been a stunning lack of faith on his part in the intelligence of the movie- going population. I believe this is an inadvertent outgrowth of the man's personal brand; it's not on purpose. In an attempt to project a persona of strength, aggression and unbridled bad-a**ery Butler has become an unwitting poster child for American hubris. Ironic since he's Scottish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lower quality when it comes to the story, but better action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of critics seems like the first one compared to this sequel. I personally liked both equally. And it's because despite the first one having a better set up, build up and overall better story. This one backs it up with better action sequences that actually stands out. The problem is, despite this having a lower budget compared to the previous one. It tries to go in a more bigger scale with more explosions and special effects. Which means there is downgrades when it comes to the special effects. But it didn't go so far as to take me out of the whole experience. Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is basically the Punisher in this. He is this badass tough bodyguard that is ruthless when it comes to taking down the bad guys. He does what it takes to accomplish his mission and is willing to really get his hands dirty to do it. If I wanted a human bodyguard it would have to be this guy. But yeah the action sequences is more entertaining to watch this time around. It's not worth buying a ticket to go see it in a theater unless it's a dollar theater. But it's worth a rental or watching it on Netflix.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you saw Olympus Has Fallen you certainly think it was a pretty enjoyable action movie to watch which makes the sequel worth watching. The cast stands out when you look at the poster and delivers the right feeling to the movie even though it had to work with an almost-lazy screenplay in some parts. The story has everything to be interesting and exciting but its materialization into the screen lets the spectator demanding for more. Not like the prequel, the directing is by far the worse aspect of the movie making it seem a low-budget film sometimes - something weird given the cast. Moreover, some action and destruction scenes in the movie could be epic if it wasn't for the cheesy digital effects and lack of visual stunning camera shots. However some gunshots' scenes are pretty enjoyable. To sum up, it's certainly a lost opportunity to grab the audience but still good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>London Has Fallen is a cheesy action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the state of American politics at the moment, it is no wonder that movies like this get made with a such a nonsense message. At least, the action had some positive qualities. There is one especially cool scene when Gerard Butler's character Mike Banning storms a terrorist stronghold and the camera doesn't cut for a while. The movie doesn't rely much on the fact that it is a sequel and I don't think there was much more than a vague single reference to the preceding movie. The movie also doesn't take much time to develop a back story for the main character so I guess that's what they figure the first movie did already. They throw the president and his loyal secret service agent into the action rather quickly and it only slows down temporarily at times.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that simply cannot help but be what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a good three years and the R-rated, action-packed "Olympus Has Fallen" has faded from most minds, even the consumers who saw the film such as myself. However, that's not going to stop Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, and Morgan Freeman from returning to stop a band of heavily armed terrorists, who have blown every historic landmark in the British capital to smithereens, by instilling the insurmountable power of the red, white, and blue up their asses like they're Red Foreman after a bad Fourth of July cookout.This time, however, instead of America being under attack, London is the target for a series of numerous bombings and strategic attacks during the time a funeral for the British Prime Minister is underway. Both President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) and his top Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) are present during the time of the attack, just as they arrive to the Prime Minster's funeral. A fury of gunfire and explosions occur, including a suspension bridge exploding, leaving five world leaders dead. All of this is the work of Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul), a terrorist with intent to bring the war to the places that start the wars; destroy the homes and communities of people who passively do the same to other places around the world without thinking twice."London Has Fallen," at the very least, manages to pack some gritty entertainment into its premise because it boasts an R-rating confidently, not at all worried or phase by the possibilities of not being a marketable picture. This is the same reason that "Olympus Has Fallen" was better than it could've been; when an action film owns an R-rating instead of a PG-13, not only does it open up the possibility for more dialog that's realistic given the situations, but it also helps show a whirlwind more when it comes to the action sequences. "London Has Fallen," as a result, turns its action sequences into some of the strongest I've seen since "Final Destination 5," in terms of visual clarity and sheer intensity.During the entire terrorist attack sequence, I was thoroughly enjoying the film as fairly basic but competent entertainment. Despite a strong opening, however, the film has little to offer once the second act kicks in, and by the time the third act goes for sentiment and a hard-hitting moral about how America's involvement in near every foreign facet is the key to the country's strengths, I not only stopped caring, but I tried to stop listening. While I won't be one of the people to claim a New World Order agenda embedded within the screenplay of a new action film, I will be the one to claim that the personal politics, in addition to the lunacy between Butler and Eckhart throughout the whole film, work to take a simple, effective premise and effectively limit its potential by making it silly and overreaching."London Has Fallen" doesn't need to be a political sermon, but it sure wants to be. It doesn't need to be a story about a family man looking to turn in his badge for a safer, more comfortable life, but it sure wants to be. And, finally, it doesn't need to be a carbon copy of its predecessor, but it can't help but be. Even a slew of hard-hitting action sequences and beautifully rendered special effects cannot save the film from itself, and that is the biggest, most personal flaw of all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2013's Olympus Has Fallen was a surprisingly tense and entertaining action movie, and now three years later we have a sequel. London Has Fallen features the return of Aaron Eckhart's President, as well as his favorite secret service agent, portrayed with the right amount of grit and charm by Gerard Butler. When the Prime Minister of England dies, all of the world's greatest leaders assemble in London for the funeral, of course that is when terrorists decide to attack and take the whole city hostage. As you can expect, Gerard Butler kicks a lot of butt, and yes that makes this movie awesome. On top of that, the movie actually has a good story with lots of twists and turns. While everything is not always plausible, it's always a whole lot of fun. I give London Has Fallen an 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindless Action Film...But Not As Jingoistic As Some Contend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a money grab put forth by Hollywood which is habitually making movies to reap an easy bundle of cash from a public that races to the theaters to see average to sub-par movies. This film is not as good as its predecessor. It is over the top, it is mindless. However, this is worth the one time watch and Gerard Butler is very good in this role as the dedicate hero.Is this movie proud of the red, white, and blue? Yes. Can it seem a little much? Yes. However, it is not nearly the type of film being described by a good number of reviewers on this site. Anything patriotic is labeled as being jingoistic. A scene that shows Gerard Butler taking out foreign terrorists and the fact that they are Arab, and presumably Muslim, makes the film xenophobic or racist. While this film is different from "Olympus Has Fallen," I am surprised people did not rail against that for overt patriotism and Americans taking down a foreign foe. Last I checked, the geopolitical climate surrounding Korea is palpable, and Islamic terrorism is a real and credible threat. Both films used those real dangers and applied them to their action, albeit average, film.This is a one time watch film, if you go into it with the right mentality and know this is an average film at best that might provide some entertainment you will be fine. If you are disagree and want to rail against the "slights" made in this movie, that's fine.

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of London Has Fallen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe Gerard Butler to be a good actor. I also believe that he makes bad choices in the roles he takes. Playing for Keeps, Movie 43, Gods of Egypt, Chasing Mavericks, Gamer. King Leonidas really needs to fire his agent (if he hasn't already). Gerard's latest is 2016's London Has Fallen (my newest write-up). It's an uber-sequel to the lousily excessive Olympus Has Fallen and only exists because that vehicle became a so-so to moderate hit. Whereas "Olympus" felt like the ultimate Die Hard rip-off, "London" feels like a remake of Invasion U.S.A. (1985). Whereas "Olympus" proclaimed Butler to be the poor man's Bruce Willis, "London" now has him conveying Chuck Norris. Bodies pile up, cardboard villains bite the territorial dust, London city landmarks are blown to smithereens, and countless rounds of ammunition are discharged. Oh look kids, there's Big Ben, and there's Parliament. Ha-ha.Anyway, Olympus Has Fallen was directed by Antoine Fuqua. London Has Fallen passes the reins over to relative unknown, Babak Najafi. Najafi doesn't stray from Fuqua's previous vision. He keeps the proceedings fast and brainless, patchy and dippy. "London's" action scenes like in "Olympus", consist of gunfights promoting the look of a video game (Call of Duty comes to mind). There's nothing visceral here, just mounds of bullets and bad guys groaning briefly before they parish. As for the special effects shots, well they sort of look fake and cartoonish. It's as if a helicopter flew over the calm city of London, England (to shoot dailies) and then the CGI artists came in to add some sham, death and destruction. That sort of buffoonery worked with the Transformer movies. Here, it's obvious and kind of laughable.Containing many, unnecessary insert titles, harboring a screenplay that took four writers to complete, and owning a strong cast for such a silly actioner (Morgan Freeman, Jackie Earle Haley, Angela Basset, Melissa Leo), London Has Fallen never makes any mention towards its predecessor from 2013. You could walk into it thinking everything was its own movie. The story is as follows: Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is about to be a father. He and his wife Leah (played by Radha Mitchell) are expecting a child in two weeks. At the same time, Banning is contemplating resigning from his job via protecting President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart). In the process of drafting his resignation letter, Mike finds out that a British Prime Minister has died prompting him to accompany said President to London for a state funeral. All the world leaders show up there too but for some reason, a terrorist organization wants to kill all of them (quickly) and then capture President Asher for means of a public execution (YouTube here it comes). With "London", I've never seen automatic weapons fired so quickly and so hastily in a feature film. Again, this harks back to my video game perception stated earlier.Now as mentioned in the first paragraph, I don't think of Gerard Butler as being bad at acting. I do however, feel that registering as an action hero is not quite his forte. Despite plugging tons of bad guys and even dispatching them in the style of Michael Myers (same knife too), he lacks the wit of a 90's Bruce Willis, the accent and one-liners of an Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the overall coolness of one Liam Neeson. Yeah he looks manly but resorts to grimacing at the camera, subjugating an impractical one man army persona, and spouting plenty of F-bombs. You end up rooting for his character the way you would root for action monger Jason Statham (that can't be good). Bottom line: With a dilettante slickness and an evaporating running time (99 non-epic minutes), London Has Fallen isn't the worst action movie to date. It does though, register just above a rental. My rating: 2 stars.Of note: There's a sequence in "London" where a chopper crashes after being shot down. In that chopper is President Asher (Eckhart), Secret Service director Lynn Jacobs (Angela Basset), Butler's Mike Banning, and I guess two pilots. Who do you think survives without any internal injuries and almost no bruising? That's right, the Prez and his protective badass in Banning. Oh Hollywood, you never disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>London Has Fallen literally falls though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>London Has Fallen is a pure Hollywood sequel at it's finest. It's predecessor Olympus Has Fallen from 2013 was such a simple blockbuster that left my brain immediately after watching it. A film that just threw at a lot of action at you and it followed the same format of director Antoine Fuqua's other filmography who's known for making action films. Olympus Has Fallen so much exceeded expectations at the box office so it only makes sense a sequel follows.Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is now expecting his first child and looking to resign from his Secret Service duties protecting the president. After the British Prime Minister dies, the funeral is must- attend for world leaders and terrorists launch an attack in London. It's up to Banning to save U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) in a wild cat-and-mouse game in the streets of London.When you think of this series, you don't think of characters but as much as anything this film is all about Mike Banning and Benjamin Asher. Banning is made out to be a bad-ass and he does very well in the action scenes. Butler is very likable and you wish the character was in really a different series. The only thing the character does is basically protect Asher so don't expect a lot of secondary elements to him. Even though I've always liked actor Arron Eckhart, Asher doesn't have much to him compared to Banning and really he is a dull President. You do have big names in secondary roles like Morgan Freeman or Angela Bassett but the script is made for Butler to do the most work.The only thing the film does really well is depicting London as the setting. From set locations, culture, and the British people, it surely feels like London even with it being just a Hollywood film. If this film makes money, (I think it will) expect the next installment to be in another famous and glamorous city like Paris or Los Angeles. So far, the settings of these films are the main selling point.London Has Fallen is basically what most February blockbusters are. A mindless film with some pretty good action. London Has Fallen literally falls though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic example of a no-one-asked-for sequel trying to ride on the coattails of its descendant's box-office success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>London Has Fallen is a classic example of a no-one-asked-for sequel trying to ride on the coattails of its predecessor's box-office success. The follow-up to the 2013's Olympus Has Fallen, features a more heightened sense of gravity due to a city-scale approach and the extra presidents thrown in the plot, but essentially it falls in the same premise and further exploits itself as a mindless action film.Gerard Butler reprises his role of Mike Banning, a recommissioned Secret Service agent to the U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart). We learn from the onset that Mike is an expectant father contemplating on resigning his job but when the British Prime Minister mysteriously "dies in his sleep", Mike is forced to escort the president to the PM's funeral in the Buckingham Palace, London. They are also to be joined by the prominent world leaders from the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan and U.S.), making it the "most protected event on earth." Surely, everyone, except Mike Banning, ignores the fact that this is a glaring scheme to assassinate the presidents and soon enough, in an orchestral fashion, bombs are detonated, cars go up in smoke, the presidents are killed one-by-one (save for President Asher who manages to escape) and every known landmark in the British capital is blown to pieces (yes, London Bridge is falling down and it's a sub-par CGI). What follows is the formulaic 'action-chase-small break-repeat' as Mike Banning tries to return his employer to safety.The sequel brings back the main cast from the first film only to deny them of something new to do. Aaron Eckhart is still the president/damsel-in-distress that needs saving. The only good thing in his arc is that the dynamics between him and Gerard Butler is enjoyable as their relationship is more of a bromance rather than a boss-employee. Angela Bassett as Lynne Jacobs, the Director of the United States Secret Service, is included in the terrorist action but is underused in the film. Morgan Freeman as Allan Trumbull, has moved up the notch from House Speaker to U.S. Vice President, but is still stuck in the same control room throughout the entire film. Morgan Freeman does great given that he has little to do but I would rather listen to him dramatically reading Justin Bieber's 'Love Yourself' than watching him play the same role over and over again.Gerard Butler fuels the high-octane excitement in this film. He is disgustingly violent yet likable and really pulls-off his stunts. Butler/King Leonidas should stay on this element, keep on firing and stabbing people that comes in his way and pass on rom-coms and attempting to transform himself to an Egyptian god.The action sequences, though highly derivative from the array of 90's classic action flicks like Die Hard, are engrossing and there's no lying about it. Director Babak Najafi at some point even infuses POV shooting in narrow alleyways and corridors (Call of Duty comes to mind) in a long one-take shot. Apparently that is the cool thing nowadays.But even in a slew of hard-hitting action sequences, expectations set by the first film fall upon seeing the sequel. London Has Fallen tries to up the excitement by expanding to a larger universe but manages to lay out an inferior and predictable story in the process. Is there going to be a follow up of *insert major city* Has Fallen to the franchise? The producers can't decide, if they should give more ideas to ISIS so they resorted to a rushed final scene hinting that there could a possibility.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/London-has- fallen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's With The Left Wing Diatribe?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a fun, action packed movie, that's it. The photography was stunning, the plot laid out in a geopolitically realistic fashion and no money was spared on urban combat scenes.What astonishes me, is all the left-wing hate. The film does not break any political conventions, nor promotes a singular right wing view of the world. However, what London Has Fallen does do is reflect the dangers of the modern world in relation to terrorism. Perhaps, liberal progressives don't like being reminded of terrorism or have some strange hatred towards strong, white role models. Perhaps, their white guilt led them to view the movie through some sort of twisted ideological lens, problem is, it's just a movie, a simply laid out, action-packed film, somewhat reminiscent of the great action movies of our past.All in all, a strong 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave your brain at home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie - more or less.The terrorists chasing President Eckhart are the usual suspects, Muslim extremists (funny they never have Christian extremists in movies like this), with a sizeable army and a bottomless arsenal that goes all the way up to surface-to-air missiles. It's whiz-bang all the way, non-stop chases and shoot-outs. Not, then, a film that makes demands on the cast. Which is just as well, since most of the actors phone in routine performances in this routine show which has the production values (and death toll) of a video game or a spaghetti western. Gerard Butler clearly learned his craft at the George Lazenby School of Performing Arts, and sadly he doesn't bring the charisma of a Liam Neeson or a Jason Statham to his roles.But despite lacklustre acting and a plot that relies heavily on repetition and recycling, London HAS FALLEN has terrific pace and delivers exactly what it says on the tin. Leave your brain at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable over done genre but Gerard Butler compensates it though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"London has fallen" is an American action thriller which is the second instalment of the series after "Olympus has fallen". Wait let me think of some keywords that can best describe the movie's plot, let me shoot you those (read it with gunshots on background of your mind) here we go - Challenging the absolute Power, attacking the control white house, bringing down white house, kidnapping Mr. President, Hijacking the Air force one, Secret service, MI 6, Betraying agents, Terrorist attack, assassinations, world leaders, bomb attacks, bugging integral control systems and bringing down iconic structures or landmarks. I guess by now your minds should puzzle around movie titles "White House Down" "Vantage Point" "Air force one" "Big game" or some of the "Clint Eastwood" titles. So after all the math I thought this itself is one of the overdone genres in Hollywood that is "saving the US president" genre. So having said that coming to this movie I was wondering does it have anything new to offer? No absolutely not but the melodramatic elements in this movie along with Gerard Butler will be enough to entertain you fairly. On the downside, the plot has no logic at all and completely marred by B grade VFX which made me feel like a direct to a home movie rather pure cinema kinds. So get in for a strict one-time watch for Gerard Butler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action packed - adrenaline pumping thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for an action-packed thriller that gets you off your seat every other minute, then this is just the movie you need to see. The title to the movie raises expectations which were met to me, especially given its prequel "Olympus Had Fallen". It was straight to the point with a very clear and convincing plot. The acting, set design, special effects and directing was as expected. It reminded me of what an action movie should be. A far contrast from a couple of reviews I had seen which in my opinion didn't give enough credit to this work. This was very much the movie I had expected it to be in every sense with the constant display of state of the art technology and its relation to political events around the globe. This definitely has the makings of a good franchise. Would be looking forward to a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific action. Can't say too much about the rest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Major clichés and minor patriotism aside, London Has Fallen is a good gig. Agent Mike Banning (Butler) protects President Asher (Eckhart) during a state visit to London. All the world's leaders have come to mourn the loss of the Prime Minister. Little do they know that a plot is ripening to kill them all. Banning (present days answer to John McClane) must single-handedly take out the enemy and recuse the captured President. The British allies are made to look stupid (Arrow's Colin Salmon stares frequently at CCTV screens making horrible decisions) as Gerard waves his metaphorical starred spangled banner. Other participants are demoted to staring, gawping or dying. Butler's a one-man army, surrounded by acute action and dazzling set-pieces. Turn off that logic button in your head, LHF could be worse (the action is better, but the script is poorer).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assorted world leaders collect in London for a state funeral. Unfortunately, it transpires that an enormous group of terrorists has also collected in London and, posing as emergency services, they destroy vast quantities of London, cut off communications, and manage to kill all the heads of state and a large number of innocent civilians. All, that is, except US President Asher and his chief security operative Mike Banning, now best buddies after the events of Olympus Has Fallen a couple of years ago. And Asher is the very bloke the terrorists are after ? they want to execute him live on the internet ? so Banning starts doing his thing in a London which appears to be almost deserted.Dear me, this is tosh. So was its predecessor, but the things which seem slightly ridiculous in the relatively small context of the White House seems preposterous in the context of a city like London. I don't mean the destroying of landmarks ? 9/11 showed us that was all too easy ? I mean the apparent absence of any security protocols to deal with terrorists posing as emergency services, contingencies to deal with the failure of CCTV and telecommunications generally.And I'm not even going to address Banning killing terrorists with nearly every shot while none of the terrorists could hit a barn door, If you like action, there is truckloads of it here. The London location work is pleasing, although some of the filming is so jittercammed that you can't tell whether the geography is right or not. The token attempts at humanising the apparently indestructible Banning are pointless ? trying to construct jeopardy over whether he will survive or not is irrelevant when every frame of film shows you that these terrorists couldn't scratch him no matter how hard they tried. And that is probably the main flaw of this movie ? there's nothing at stake, really, apart from CGI destruction of landmarks.Gerard Butler flings out a few one-liners and looks hard. Aaron Eckhard is a principled POTUS, and Morgan Freeman oozes dignified gravitas to the extent that she should be President really, not Eckhard.This is a genuinely brainless popcorn movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this film is as xenophobic as people are saying and yes it's also just as clichéd as everyone has pointed out, but if you liked the first entry, Olympus Has Fallen, I can't help but think you'll at least enjoy this one. The film brings back just about the entire cast from the first installment and pits them up against a new threat, this time it's global. The Prime Minister dies under mysterious circumstances which brings plenty of the world's leaders to his funeral. While there, Mike Banning discovers the plot to kill the president and the other leaders. We then get virtually the same plot as the first film just with the backdrop of London instead of the White House.Sadly, it doesn't really take advantage of the great cast that it assembled. Unlike the first film, Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo are just faces in a group of people with little lines to work with. We do however, get the same fun dynamic between Aaron Eckhart and Gerard Butler to keep us entertained. Eckhart once again proved he's a solid choice to play the president and this type of role is where Butler thrives. He gets far more to do than he did in Gods of Egypt, and I'm grateful for that. He's once again debating quitting the secret service based on his soon to be fatherhood duties before being thrust back into the fray in London.The motivations of the villains here don't seem to be as fleshed out as the first film and thus creating weak character development. The film is also just as pro-American as the first outing which can turn off some for sure. In all, there's nothing really new here with this story or execution. Besides from a few cool long takes towards the end of the film, the action is generic and hindered by overuse of shaky-cam. The actors are stuck with a less than sub-par script that doesn't do much of anything unique. But with all that said, it's hard not to at least enjoy Butler and Eckhart having fun with their characters in this bombastic sequel.+Butler &amp; Eckhart+Some good long takes of action-Derivative-Doesn't flesh out its villains-Wastes the talent of its actors5.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excessive in vulgarity and lacking in content</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"London has Fallen" is, to myself, an attempt at squeezing more out of the pockets of viewers by riding along the coattails of the superior first movie: "Olympus has Fallen". "London" truly embraced its R rating by insisting that the movie could not have five minutes of dialog without ten vulgarities and about half of those being the f-word. Suggesting to see this movie with my family which consists of younger children was a huge mistake and I would advise all others to avoid repeating it. There was very little development of characters and the enemy was not fully fleshed out so the challenge that our protagonists faced felt trivial. However, the movie does have some redeeming qualities. Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart have wonderful chemistry with each-other and really build off of their performances to create a simultaneously humorous and friendly experience; you can truly see that their characters care for each-other. The action sequences were intense and I was rarely sitting back or bored because the movie was in a constant state of mania and hardcore fighting. That worked well for my group, but for some it may be unappealing. Overall I would recommend this movie if you are simply looking to have a good time, but do not expect anything above that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another cliché political conspiracy action thriller, but definitely a fun ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like this one often receive flack for not having a cinematic narrative to accompany the larger than life display on screen. However, I like to look at movies such as London Has Fallen or last year's Olympus Has Fallen as a way to experience great shallow spectacle and some laughs for a couple of hours. One of the chief reasons that this film is fun and exciting to watch is the cast. Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, accompanied by the phenomenal Angela Bassett, and Morgan Freeman will have your attention throughout the story. It is very important for an otherwise cliché action political thriller to contain excellent actors who can add that touch of quality that films in this sub-genre of action need. A side effect of this film could be heightened awareness to the unrest in the middle east and terrorism when you least expect it. There really isn't much to dissect or analyze in this movie, so it is one of those that you take for what it is. An action-packed couple of hours that is thrilling with some laughs here and there.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is dead, and his funeral becomes the most highly secured event on earth. Politicians and leaders from all over the world gather to mourn the loss of a beloved leader. Along with the other world leaders, the U.S. President is also in attendance. When tragedy strikes at St. Paul's Cathedral, many are left dead and injured. Just when the UK and the rest of the world thinks it can rely on its own military and palace guards, the terrorists have infiltrated the very inner workings of England's security, military, and public safety. No one can be trusted. Armed with his "bourbon and bad choices," secret service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) protects President Asher (Eckhart) and Secret Service Director Lynn Jacobs (Bassett) and tried to get them to safety when all hell breaks loose. Vice President Trumbull (Freeman) must helplessly watch the terror unfold. Just when things couldn't get any worse, Asher winds up in the hands of the terrorists and Banning must rescue him before he is publicly executed online.What a weekend for movies. You have your choices of this one, Zootopia, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (which I am seeing tonight), and more. Really looking forward to Tina Fey's movie tonight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the action sequences were strong and effective. What I thought was not effective was the way they used little bylines to 'introduce' characters in the early stages of the film as they were going to give a quiz afterward. I think the viewer decides who is important in a movie and who isn't. Other than that quality lending the film a sort of childlike atmosphere rather than a serious dramatic atmosphere-it was generally very well done. The action sequences were plentiful. I think that they wanted to cash in on the popularity of the first film, no doubt-but I think that generally viewers just want to have some fun watching stuff they would never see in real life-so on that level this film works well. A thing that I found actually annoying was the way they released two films a little while ago with the same premise-an attack on TWH. I thought that was a little bit of dumb. I watched both and I still wonder why they did two films that were so similar in terms of plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a terrorist gang who start an all encompassing terrorist attack during the Prime Minister's funeral in London.I hear from several friends that "London Has Fallen" is a film of everything mindlessly exploding, and everyone dying. After watching it, I have to say that is a fair description, but it is not a film of mindless violence.The scale of the attack is so massive that if it were to happen in real life, it would have been super devastating. The only thing is, the film is quite realistic in its portrayal of the antecedents and the aftershocks, that it really unnerves me. It also reminds me of the valiance of the security forces, that they are even prepared to sacrifice their lives to protect another person.

		<shortDescription>London Has Fallen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had found Olympus Has Fallen a mediocre extended episode of 24; and now, its sequel London Has Fallen feels like a mediocre extended episode of Homeland. The main problem from this film is the fact that the screenplay is so improbable that it needs to hide its huge holes with continuous action for the audience not to analyze the tremendous ridiculousness of the premise. London Has Fallen is another generic action film with mediocre special effects, insipid villains and infallible heroes of an unquestionable rectitude because, obviously, they are North American. Well, there are also some English ones, but only because it would be strange to set the story in England without adding some natives to support the authentic champions (Have I mentioned the fact they are North American?). On the positive side, director Babak Najafi knows how to orchestrate clear action scenes without falling into the easy trap of quick cuts, and the "R" rating means that the blood flows freely. Going back to the cons, the performances feel weak and listless, and that includes both the heroes (Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart) and the supporting cast (Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett and Radha Mitchell). And the ultra-patriotic attitudes from London Has Fallen feel inappropriate in the contemporary cultural climate. The exalted nationalist arrogance of Sylvester Stallone in Rambo III or Arnold Schwarzenegger in Commando seemed funny in the '80s; but in London Has Fallen, it takes an aggressive appearance, getting close to the desperation of the United States to seem the "leaders of the free world". Nevertheless, I have to admit that London Has Fallen managed to keep me moderately entertained despite its mediocrity, and that's why I can give it a slight recommendation, specially to those who want to watch generic explosions and urban destruction on the big screen. But this time, with a virulent patriotic varnish. Demagogy always tastes better with a seasoning of tragedy.</fullReview>

I don't know why they didn't make enough money !I think this could be a good sequel movies if they don't get too repetitive !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was OK. I mean one man takes on impossible odds and overcomes them. It is obviously an American movie because nobody else survives besides the President of America... I found it was okay, a little above average. I guess I find it a little too much like Olympus has Fallen and White House Down. It's just the same movie thrice in a short period of time. I liked the action of course and am a huge fan of Angela Basset so I was glad to see her along side Gerard Butler, an awesome action hero, &amp; Morgan Freeman, a true actor. If I am honest, I am probably slightly critical of the movie because of how preposterous it is that one man can basically take on an army by himself with very little help. I mean Deadpool doing that would be totally possible where as one human man is improbable. Of course it is a movie so just enjoy it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the title, and it's predecessor suggest, London is the victim of a massive terrorist attack aiming it's sights at President Asher of the United States. Drawn there for a state funeral after the British Prime Minister passes away, the terrorists use this opportunity to eliminate the leaders of seven of the most powerful countries; America, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and of course Britain, each one (particularly the European ones) being a representation of recent leaders (Germany's Chancellor resembles Merkel, while Italy's Prime Minister resembles Berlusconi). Cue explosions, car chases, and plenty of gunfights.While the terrorists are definitely of Arab descent, which is an action movie cliché when it comes to bad guys, it was refreshing to see a very slightly different take on them. Aamir Barkawi isn't a religious Jihadist who uses suicide bombers, he's an arms dealer. He doesn't have some nefarious scheme for world domination, he just wants revenge for the death of his daughter. As the film started, I thought it might try and make a not-so-subtle attempt at an anti-drone message. Barkawi is a victim of a drone strike, and it didn't put him down, it just made him angrier and more likely to stage an attack. Unfortunately it didn't pan out that way, as it was still a drone strike that saved the day at the end anyway.The action in London Has Fallen is pretty entertaining, but I can't proclaim it to be anything new. Olympus Has Fallen used it's restricted setting to stage some interesting stunts that couldn't be done elsewhere. Expanding the scope to an entire city meant they could just pick sequences out of other action movies. This time there's a car chase, and it's a pretty good one, but it's not really anything we haven't seen before. Mike Banning, once again, also seems almost superhuman in his skills and ability. He's not quite as human as he was before either, as he seems completely impervious to harm this time around.The peak of the movie is the initial attack on London, and the build up to it. We're introduced to each world leader, their approach to security, and where they are in the city at the time. Each one is instantly recognisable and identifiable to the others. The French president is just chilling out on his boat while his security team makes extra sure everything's in order, the Italian prime minister is doing some sightseeing with his younger mistress, and the Japanese leader is stuck in traffic. Then bang, terrorist plants in security and emergency services turn on their comrades and start bringing down bridges, towers, and shooting up crowds of people.While also the movie's most entertaining sequence, this is also the movie's worst point as well, if you can believe, and it's for one very good reason. I like my CGI. I am a CGI supporter. It can bring things to life that would otherwise not be possible, and bring a new visual edge to an otherwise ground in reality movie. That said, the CGI in London Has Fallen is truly abysmal. It's worse than the computer generated imagery you'd expect to see in a video game. The collapse of Westminster Abbey looks like falling Lego bricks, while a massive explosion in the middle of the Thames is so badly superimposed that you can almost see the grid lines used to render it. Thankfully this sequence is the only real use of bad CGI we see. There's a nice big, conveniently slow-moving ball of flame near the movie's end that's obviously computer generated, but it is nowhere near as badly rendered as the earlier scenes. I saw this somewhere else, but it's true; at least Michael Bay puts everything into his explosions.London Has Fallen was certainly very enjoyable, and slightly more plausible than Olympus. It took itself a little less seriously this time as well, with a few jokes and one-liners that made the audience I saw it with let out a chuckle a couple of times. It was also nice to actually see Banning and Asher together this time as well. The bromance that was implied in Olympus was never capitalised on by having them separated the entire time, but here they stuck them together to bounce off each other. The levels of bromance are never quite satisfied, but it was a step in the right direction. There's definitely potential for an Eckhart/Butler buddy movie in here. If I had to pick, I would say London was better than Olympus, but they're both pretty shallow, forgettable movies. I give London Has Fallen a 6/10; a good way to waste some time, if you have time to waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A logic less kickass action film, thats good while it lasts. Die Hard 2.0?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who have watched Olympus has Fallen do not need to read a review of London has Fallen, its pretty much the same film with different action set pieces. And honestly thats really not a bad thing, because one goes into a film like London has Fallen to just sit down,relax and destress for the 1hr 30 min + runtime, its logic less popcorn entertainment at its best. Its what I call leave your brains at home cinema, and for a film like London has Fallen, everyone knows what there getting into before viewing the film, so do not except anything meaningful, or some cinematic moment in the film, LHF is just kickass fun. Gerard Butler is the new, Bruce Willis, and LHF is the new Die Hard 2.0.Story wise after the British Prime Minister passes away, his funeral becomes a target of a terrorist organization to destroy some of the world's most powerful leaders, devastate the British capital, and unleash a terrifying vision of the future. The only hope of stopping it rests on the shoulders of the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) and his formidable Secret Service head (Gerard Butler), but there is one hitch the middle eastern terrorists want American Presidents head on a platter, otherwise they wont stop the blood shed.Acting wise Gerard Butler is at his action best. He totally kicks ass on screen, and one can see the hard work he puts into his stunts.He is a killing machine in the film. Watch out for his climax fight scene he goes into COD mode. He also has some comical hard hitting dialogues which are corny, and awesome at the same time. Aaron Eckhart serves more as a henchman to Gerard rather than acting like the President, but he is adequate in his role. Morgan Freeman is good as always, in his brief role as Vice President.London has Fallen really has no story to gloat about, its a rehash of any clichéd action film were they try to save the world. While the prequel talked about North Korean terrorists,here we see Muslim terrorist, so the makers try to be a little up to date to todays times I guess. Action wise the film gets full marks because this is were the film is gripping and thrilling as hell. The explosions, the car chases, the gun fights, are all first rate, and give a sense of a "bang for you buck,"type of feeling(meaning your money was well spent with this film). The CGI, and VFX that were showing, London bridges,buildings, explode were good. LHF however though made to be a completely logic less film ( the whole main premise is laughable, and extremely impossible)has some cringe worthy scenes that are too over the top its hard to unnotice them. For example, how the heck do the President and his body guard survive a helicopter crash without even one scratch.How does the President have Olympic medal aim with a gun when he says again and again its first time using a gun. Also the whole stereotypical Muslim terrorist angle is getting really old in films now, show some novelty at at least in the film somewhere.However people who relished 90s Hollywood action films like Die Hard will lap LHF. The films production values were great, and one can see that a lot of money was put into this film,there is beautiful scenery at every blink. The films highlight scene is the climax action scene when Gerard Butler goes into full Call Of Duty mode, and is killing with a SMG, and jumping into buildings.Overall watch London has Fallen if your looking to watch a complete de stressing film, that has kickass action, just remember too switch of your brain before the beginning of the film and enjoy the most over the top film of the year. Its not a great film, but its enjoyable and a bang for your buck. Its nice to see a light film after seeing such heavy films week after week.3.25/5* 66% C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>London HAS Fallen!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is too easy to pick apart 'London Has Fallen', with its obvious political agenda, cheesy one-liners and predictable plot but I am going to stop short of saying that the finished product was an all out disaster. Once again it is the Hollywood Producers that should be held accountable for believing that this sequel to 'Olympus Has Fallen' needed to be made in the first place. Could it be that the conglomerate of production companies behind this movie have little regard for the intelligence of the average film punter, that they as the viewer cannot understand the underlying narrative that is being told to them? Or could it be that these 'big boys' just don't care and have a blind faith that there is a successful market still available to them? I really couldn't confidently answer these questions but I do know of one redeeming feature that 'London Has Fallen' does have going for it - it is entirely mind numbing violence where the audience can completely escape and not have to think about a thing. With this in mind, a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon was never going to hurt.Well known action genre Director, Antoine Fuqua attached himself to the original, 'Olympus Has Fallen' and in his place is the little known Babak Najifi. Fuqua's expertise are sorely missed in this struggling sequel as Najifi tries his best to give the audience an experience that would justify the $60 million price tag that the producers forked out. Unfortunately this hefty budget could have been spent on something else. Babak has failed to connect his film with the viewer and perhaps he felt compelled to make such a production that is beyond the realms of believable (even in today's international climate) and lacks genuine purpose other than to give Gerard Butler something to do. All too rapidly 'London Has Fallen' becomes predictable, following a well travelled road that many action films of the past have followed. It is almost a throw-back to the 1980's when the audiences acceptance was far easier to obtain than it is today. People still enjoy the mindless violence as I do but there has to be substance behind it. The screenplay written by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt is basic. It provides very little challenge for the more accomplished actors attached to the film and at times the script writers seemed to of run out of ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miffed! SPOILERS: London has fallen, and does anybody seem to care? How would they? Streets are running empty! You wonder out loud, "Where is everybody?" Oh, Wait! This could be a different dimension altogether! But is it a sci-fi movie? No! So that gets ruled out too! The movie is so bad that it will make you remember the already forgotten previous installment, and make you go, "I think I liked it more when Olympus fell!" In a world, where cities keep falling and directors try to cash in their checks through big names like Butler, Freeman and Eckhart, by showing meagre action without a good plot or direction to keep the pieces together, you are compelled to wonder what the action-world is degrading into.In a planet which already reeks of terror, Babak Najafi believes you haven't had enough, and tries to feed you a mouthful of terror-jargon with ample gun shots, bombs and some third-grade CGI. There is no subtlety in his direction, and you almost see everything coming. What is worse is the way he decides to snap off a frame, and then spearhead into another one, without a proper closure. In his head, he thinks he is being cool, but really Babak, Not Cool! Not Cool! What was cheesy was the fact that every character in the movie gets a label. Najafi thought we were really that interested to notice who's who. There is one juncture where all presidents get exterminated within seconds, which was laughable rather than being poignant. So, if your country's president was insinuated there, you would go "Damn!" and might walk off the theater.The screenplay has nothing to offer. It is further exacerbated to pulp just as victims of Gerard-fury were by the flick's shoddy direction. Radha Mitchell just makes matters worse by running with a baby in her belly like she is on a football field. Gerard Butler stares at his screen with a scrappy resignation letter without emphasizing enough focusing on the words honor and privileged (wow! Writers!) just to tell you that he is thinking about it. Subtle, eh! Aaron goes live and suddenly he decides to be a man and show some real ballsy presidency. In his head he must be like, "Look at me, I am your ideal tough!" Shivani Ghai shouts at Patrick Kennedy to stay on the ground and then shoots him ensuring her order is heard. Well played! Oooh-Oooh before I forget, there was this guy who seemed constantly worried; he had a weird eyebrow that pointed up, no matter what. So even if he was happy he looked worried.Sometimes these action flicks make me wonder if adroit Presidents watch them too and say, "Hey! That's me. I am holding a gun, and going Bam! Bam! And Kaboom!" At least Family Guy's Mayor Adam West would say that.If we look at the bright side, which we generally do, the final action bits are pretty dope, when Gerard goes full Rambo on the terrorists. It almost seems like a good game you are playing, that skims the surface of Splinter Cell or Hit-man for that to matter. The camera goes with a continuous shot, and Babak seems to have been waiting the whole movie just to shoot that. It was good while it lasted. Then the clouds of pointlessness walk in again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>London Has Fallen - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>London Has Fallen is a dumb action movie with no story or any development, and that's what I was expecting going in and that's what I got. I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself watching this movie, because I did (for what it is). There were a few good actions scenes that was pretty well done and Gerard Butler makes for an enjoyable lead. I know this movie isn't suppose to be taken too seriously, because you would look like a right fool if you take any of this movie serious, but i can't pretend or act like i don't see the major flaws in this movie. I think the biggest thing that really hurt this movie is the noticeable CGI, which is absolutely awful and looks completely unfinished. Aaron Eckhart basically plays the male version of a damsel in distress and Jackie Earle Haley doesn't even do anything in this film.Overall, if you want a movie that's non-stop action and doesn't make any sense at all, but you want to have a good time, then London Has Fallen is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadistic, xenophobic in the extreme, hateful, nasty, full of horrible cgi effects (computer generated helicopters again, why!!!) and insensitive to the time it's being released in. Never the less, the "retrograde, stab the bad guys heads" attitude of the film is a gleeful hearkening back to the less politically correct times of 80's/90's ear Arnie movies, and it gets down to the often vicious violence, satisfying baddie kills and hard action with little pretense and less respect for human life or morality, and sometimes this is exactly the sort of cinematic junk food you need, not good for you at all but certainly hits the spot. So if you can gets past the murky, hard to see cinematography of the movie, the fact that it actually looks pretty cheap and tacky like it was made on half the budget of the first, and some questionable taste then you'll probably have a good time. Please let Gerard Butler continue to stab bad guys heads and keep him away from romantic comedies!Source: http://www.megashare-viooz.net/london-has-fallen-2016.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the reviews to this movie I got averted to watching it. But I had to see for myself and was positively surprised.It is your typical Action Hero movie, with the taciturn, shoot-first-ask-later protagonist against the bad, civilian murdering, terrorists.There is not much philosophical enlightenment that you can take home with you after watching it, and it won't tell you how to solve the worlds problems, but it gets you in this good old "take him down!", "Ha! you messed with the wrong guy" state, and that's what such a movie is about.The action begins after a brief introduction of the characters and the state of the world and keeps up until the end.My advice is, not to search for a deeper meaning or a subliminal message, and enjoy the movie. I have complete confidence that you're smart enough not to let a movie influence you're opinion on drone wars, global surveillance etc..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When things go down who you gonna call? Gerard Butler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that it is necessary for me to tell you all first that I did not see Olympus has fallen so I will not be comparing the two movies. Short and sweet bad guys kill many important people on the way to a funeral for the British Prime Minister, Gerard Butler is in town with the president played by Aaron Eckhart and they team up with a group to take down some terrorist. Visually appealing lots of explosions and one liners between Butler and Eckhart made this movie worth watching for me. I definitely found myself invested in the characters at least enough for me to want to go back and watch the first one. The problems are simple for me I feel like there is room to grow these stories a bit and make the terrorist a little more diabolical. The cursing became gratuitous at times and there was a part when a mole was discovered and that part was basically a tick on this movies butt. It felt rushed and it could have made things more exciting had they made it more of a focus during the film. Gerard Butler gives me hope as an action star finally in this movie because in other films of his I have not been impressed. So kudos to him! See it in the theater, watch it on red box, give it look.</fullReview>

Only the symptoms of the infections were different. They were everywhere - every human were infected, good uninfected human were hardly anywhere. Symptom of infection was different though - middle aged men with guns.So we have a superhero who can potentially take down IronMan. We have the settings of a Zombie Apocalypse, we are hardly ever bothered with logic anywhere, we have gun violence that can put "The Expendables" to shame - Whats not the like???

		<shortDescription>London Has Fallen - Falls Below Par !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whats good : Gerard Butler, Aron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman all give good performances in an action packed film. Some good one liner comedy from Butler and Eckhart.Whats not so good: The film is so 'action packed' that Butler stabbing, hacking and shooting his way through so many bad guys it almost gets monotonous. The genre does need to be watched with the understanding that it's macho fiction nonsense . However, in London Has Fallen The whole scenario is so unbelievable it's ludicrous. There's not much actual 'plot', lots of stereotype characters and clichés. So no real storyline or character development other than that which was already introduced in Olympus has Fallen. It's mostly Butler hacking/stabbing/shooting/killing. Whats bad:The CGI crashes/explosions are sub standard, i.e. very obvious. SUMMARY: It's not as good as Olympus Has Fallen e.g. I would give that 7/10. London Has Fallen I only gave 5/10Olympus Has Fallen was at least 'sort of' plausible, if you were prepared to take a pinch of salt. The characters were much more developed with a much better baddie and 'evil plot'.London Has Fallen is not terrible, the cast do a good job. But the 'story' mostly consists of just Butler violently killing almost everyone in his path.Olympus Has Fallen is the kind of action film you can enjoy watching more than once. I doubt I would bother watching London Has Fallen again.In my opinion it's not worth a costly cinema trip. I predict it will very shortly be in the ?3 DVD section.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The amplification in quality and amusement is so significant, it makes this product appear unusually superior to its predecessor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before he can submit his resignation from the Presidential Protection Division, Secret Serviceman Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is called back into action to escort President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) to London, after the British Prime Minister passes away. The funeral brings the leaders of dozens of countries together in one place, allowing international arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) to initiate a scheme of mass terror. Destroying and occupying key landmarks across the British capital, Kamran Barkawi (Waleed Zuaiter) carries out his father's orders to execute the gathered officials. With hundreds of enemy militants closing in around them, Banning and Asher must evade their pursuers and coordinate with Vice President Alan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) in the U.S. to devise a plan to defeat the terrorists.It's nearly impossible for a sequel to outdo the original, primarily because the very nature of a follow-up is not to improve upon faults, but rather to capitalize on past successes. "London Has Fallen" doesn't subscribe to that theory, however, as it has unexpectedly located and addressed every shortcoming presented in 2013's "Olympus Has Fallen." It's as if the filmmakers picked up on all the critiques and areas that underwhelmed, and targeted those points specifically for an overhaul in this proceeding chapter. The result is not a perfect picture - but the amplification in quality and amusement is so significant, it makes this product appear unusually superior to its predecessor.Korean unification fighters have been replaced by Pakistan-based extremists, and the arena for warfare is now London instead of the White House. But, ironically, the subject is still very much about a U.S. president (the unluckiest one of them all) and his top Secret Service agent, attempting to survive a hostile situation while government personnel and military advisers watch idly from massive monitors. Radha Mitchell is still the inconsiderable wife (now inhabiting a more tolerable bit part as the humanizer for the herculean bodyguard), Angela Bassett is still the leader of the protection detail, and Melissa Leo, Robert Forster, and Morgan Freeman all return as various cabinet members or interchangeable politicians. And, despite a venue shift to the Westminster Cathedral, the inevitable storming of a heavily guarded landmark still features shots of machinegun fire dancing across white pillars, stone steps, and human bodies.What has changed, spectacularly for the better, is the amount and caliber of the humor. Now that the very serious-minded Antoine Fuqua has been replaced by director Babak Najafi (and a couple of extra writers were brought on board), an appreciable wit is introduced, allowing for snappier one-liners (save for the subtle yet silly "Get to the chopper!"), better threats/insults, and far more gratifying enemy kills. Engaging in Bond or Bourne-like car chases, "Cloverfield" levels of destruction, shootouts in abandoned city streets and subways (like something out of a zombie movie), and video game-styled infiltrations, "London Has Fallen" also excels in pure action. The choreography is snazzier, the cinematography is more suspenseful, and the bloodshed is better integrated into the mayhem. It's no masterpiece, but the improvements are so surprisingly noticeable that it's difficult not to be impressed. Surely, few audiences will expect such attention to gung-ho satisfaction and explosive thrills from a sequel to an underperforming actioner originally debuting in the slow month of March.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

First of all, Gerard Butler is a great actor, and really is one of the few good parts about this movie. His character is somewhat engaging and his action scenes are nothing short of bad-ass - boy can he fight!And then there's the rest of the cast - boring, underwritten characters who have little motivation or compelling features - including Aaron Eckhart who is a terrible actor, and an equally terrible President in the film. London Has Fallen suffers from some major writing flaws which have glaring plot holes, underwritten characters, and an overabundance of shoddy action sequences.The action in the film, whilst occasionally being exciting, is mostly nauseatingly boring and just used as filler. However, there are moments scattered throughout which are genuinely exciting and are readily adrenaline fueled, but unfortunately these moments are few and far between. And then there's the special effects. By god some of the effects are horrible - it is almost a though we were watching a test screening of the incomplete movie some of them were SO bad. Ultimately, London has Fallen does have some occasional moments which are entertaining - but in the end its a very forgettable affair and really not worth its 100 minutes runtime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as good as the first instalment! London Has fallen is entertaining, but just an another action movie. What worked: The beginning drone strike grabs the viewers attention. Implausible, (unbelievable) attacks but still exciting. Buttler has some good alpha male moments. What did not work: The arms dealer storyline is unbelievable. Buttler's wife/child character development scenes drag the storyline and add nothing to it. Many of the secondary characters come across flat. The director could not create the energy and passion of the first film. Regrettably, the first instalment used up most of the good material. Took the money and ran with part two. Still watchable. Reminds me of the Die-hard series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London Has Fallen succumbs to generic conventions and a blaring American ideological agenda, but if you can suspend disbelief long enough to see the film through, entertainment can be found in an otherwise weak sequel.If you can get past the lack of invention and blatant stereotypes, and manage to suspend all belief for its runtime, London Has Fallen can prove simply entertaining and thrilling in the moment, with the problematic sequel matching the thrill of the original, if not in its conviction or political correctness. It's 'Team America!' ideology is a little harder to swallow, for it is unwaveringly conspicuous. I simply wish that the film took more risks - and the dispatching of one major player early on to get them out of the way, does count - and was more inventive than it is, instead of conforming to general stereotypes and marginalising groups of people anymore than they already are marginalised; and including a 'token character' in a relative non-speaking role, again, does not count.See my full review here; http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/london-has-fallen- 2016-review.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Popcorn Revenge Against Terrorists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"London Has Fallen" is anti-terrorist revenge porn. The words "Muslim," "Islam" and "Allah" are, I think, never once mentioned in the film. Given world events, it's entirely understandable that a studio would want to make, and viewers would enjoy seeing, such a film. Many reviewers have questioned the wisdom of releasing this film. Wise? No. Entertaining and timely? Alas, yes. Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) must protect American President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) at a state funeral in London. Many world leaders are there, including Germany's Chancellor Bruckner, who is played by Nancy Baldwin made to look as much like current German Chancellor Angela Merkel as possible. A little girl approaches Bruckner with a flower; security pushes the girl back. Bruckner urges the girl forward. We get the message. Bruckner is ignoring necessary security protocols. She is putting herself at risk. It doesn't take long for the risk to materialize. Bruckner is murdered. The white rose the girl had handed her is stained with red blood. In short order, almost all of the heads of state visiting London for the funeral have been shot to death, blown up, or crushed in a spectacular series of explosions and mass assassinations. Blood spatters on white shirts. Flames billow. Bridges collapse. Missiles fly from rooftops. Helicopters crash. Sirens sound. Men in funeral dress shoes outrun armed assassins on motorcycles. Knives and shrapnel plunge into flesh. "London Has Fallen" gives England its own 9-11. London's towers, like the WTC, are blown up on camera. Back in the US, Vice President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) watches from a situation room, jam packed with good actors no doubt wishing they were somewhere else, yet eager to cash their paychecks. Jackie Earle Haley is there, looking overwhelmed and sad. Melissa Leo is on screen for mere seconds. She may have won an Academy Award, but she is still a woman over fifty. There is also a gentleman listed in the credits as Stern-faced adviser (Stacey Shane). Eventually it comes out that the attack on London is ? surprise surprise ? a terrorist action carried out by the Pakistani Aamir Barkawi. His daughter was killed in a US drone strike that was intended for him. Barkawi has, with his ample petrodollars, bought off every other person in London. His terrorists have penetrated the Queen's Guard, those guys with the tall, black fur hats and red coats, the police, emergency response personnel, and apparently every motorcycle rider in England. Barkawi's ultimate goal: assassinate US President Asher on YouTube and stream the assassination live. Obviously this atrocity is inspired by contemporary terrorists. Banning and Asher run, run, run. Terrorists chase, chase, chase. Banning is superhuman. You get it, after a while, that for all its political and topical trappings, "London Has Fallen" is really just a video game. Banning faces off with endless supplies of armed terrorists. They fire at him directly and somehow he never gets shot, even while he manages to kill every terrorist he wants to, sometimes with only a knife. In one scene, Banning is talking to one of the chief terrorists on the telephone. Listen to this, he says. He places the phone near the mouth of another terrorist he is stabbing to death. The man groans into the phone as he dies. "Was that necessary?" President Asher asks. "No," Banning says. There are many such scenes, where the American good guy gets to beat up on the terrorist bad guy. Showing images of London's landmarks spectacularly succumbing to terrorist bombs strikes me as visual incitement. Why give these monsters ideas? Even so, I enjoyed the movie because there really was no risk involved. The movie doesn't get you to care about any of its victims. Angela Basset, one of my favorite actresses, is not treated well by the film, and her fate left me utterly uncaring. It was all so cartoonish. I liked the spectacular visuals of London's landmarks and the silly, faux serious tone of the film. I actually laughed out loud more than once. Fun and popcorn. But the heavy themes are there. "London Is Falling" tells you that Europe has been penetrated by terrorists, their bought-off allies and enablers. It tells you that Europe can't defend itself against this onslaught. It tells you that London is really Londonistan. It tells you that Germany's woman chancellor is especially guilty. It tells you that YouTube can be used to advance terror. It tells you that Americans must save the day. However you feel about these statements, even popcorn entertainment is now communicating them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>White House Down/Olympus Has Fallen Goes to London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers are definitely coming. Sorry, I had to write the title like that because I didn't see "Olympus Has Fallen", the series pilot film of this series, but I did see "White House Down" and this was how the film felt to me as I was watching this. And it all does back to "Die Hard" anyway. But this film comes nowhere as good as "Die Hard", or "Die Hard 2" were. It doesn't match up to "Air Force One". Why? Because after the initial attack happens, the story and characters stop developing and just rehashed the same old clichés. It is even obvious who the inside trader is while all the other films I had mentioned (except "White House Down") keeps developing the story and characters as the film continues and thus keeps the audience engaged and held in suspense. I just wasn't kept guessing what was going to happen next the way a good action suspense film should do in this genre. Here is the basic plot. A terrorist arms dealer wants to get revenge for a botched attempt to assassinate him but killed his daughter and family instead. Set he sets a trap by poisoning the Prime Minister of Great Britian and then plans to kill all the heads of state who attends the funeral. Once the attack happens, the US president and his trusty secret service agent must run a gauntlet in order to get the president to safety. That would have been fine enough because the action is good. The effects are spectacular. The cinematography was great. The director does compose great visuals. But the story runs through all the clichés including Shakespeare's famous one from Macbeth were a tender moment is shown for a character to raise the audience's sympathy for that character and then that character get brutally murdered. They even used the girl giving a flower to someone cliché that comes straight from the wedding scene in "The Guns Of Navarone". (Yes, I did think of that when I saw it and thought that something bad is going to happen to that lady.) But the worst part of the film is how they underutilized some strong actors that I haven't seen for while: Colin Salmon, Robert Forster, and Angela Bassett. Forster and Salmon were reduced to talking head cameos almost. They are better than that.But if you like action without too much thinking, then this film is for you.</fullReview>

Its not really deep and you don't feel a lot for the characters but thats not what I came to see. I came to see action and it delivered! Of course a movie like this will be best viewed on the big screen. A laptop or tablet just won't do it any justice. There is also some unusual camera work. Maybe it will not work for some people, but if you like games such as Call of Duty there are a few scenes that have been shot in a way that make you feel like it is one game with excellent graphics :P What is not to love?!?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm crying for my fav city but quite happy about this thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have two reasons I didn't completely enjoy London Has Fallen: 1. The POTUS-under-siege motif has been so trivialized by repetition that even when the danger is played out in my favorite city, London, it's the same old. 2. The preposterous strength and ingenuity of foreign terrorists have become so much of a reality after 9/11 that even Hollywood's excess can't blunt the ill ease I feel seeing the US vulnerable, even in a hyperbolic thriller. Maybe that's the vicarious pleasure of this fiction: It's close to reality, less fiction than ever.In London Has Fallen, major world leaders convene in London for the prime minister's funeral. Out of nowhere comes a coordinated attack that kills five, destroys major buildings such as Westminster Cathedral, while the president of the US (Aaron Eckhart) escapes solely because of the defensive skills of Secret Service hero, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler). After the rather interesting building destruction (CGI) and car chases, Banning takes the president to various "safe" places that are not so (of course, they have escaped from a downed helicopter with nary a scratch).The usual tropes are present to comfort you that all is well in cliché land: Banning's wife is suffering with his absence even more so now that the baby is due; the US powers assembled in one observation room under the sage guidance of the vice president (another sage performance by Morgan Freeman) are clueless and scared; someone on either side of the pond is a mole leading the mid-eastern bad boys to their targets. Yes, you've seen it all already.Yet the black SUV's, the earpieces, the scowls, and the swooping aerial shots are done as well as could be hoped for and exciting as ever. I never tire of the rolling martial drums, either, just so I know this is serious business protecting the US and its president. For films like the previous Olympus Has Fallen, scary action is part of their success. But the years and ISIS blades behind necks on video are too real to make this thriller comfortable. Yet, who can be comfortable reading the news of our enemies 24/7 as they plot our demise. I just hope there are enough Mile Banning's to save us.Enjoy this actioner for its own sake?entertaining American thrills. You won't be able to escape, however, the reality of our own danger. No longer do movies give us vicarious violent pleasure?the enemy is not going away as we leave the theater?they are just getting better at what we see on the screen. Here's what I wrote in 2013 about Olympus Has Fallen: "The black SUV's, the sun glasses, the drum rolls, the foreign assassins, the wife at risk?these stock elements and more suggest we've been there before. Yet considering this is the dead zone time of year for the movies, you might enjoy some old-fashioned thrills." It's still the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously LHF isn't gonna be in the same league of movies such as The Dark Night or The Revnant but having gone into this movie with 0 expectations, I was pleasantly surprised how good of a time I had. The story in this movie is fairly implausible but it makes up for this through its fast pacing and well shot action sequences. One shot in particular really impressed me because it was a very long moving shot of a fire fight with many soldiers on both sides and lots of special effects. That one shot in particular bumped my rating from 6 to a 7. It's not a great movie but if you want a good action movie with some likable characters, I definitely recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World leaders attend a funeral in London to be met by a well organized revenge attack. Many people get killed but: will the USA President escape?!What saves this film is that for about 90% of the picture it is watchable action and hence sufficient to keep the viewer's attention.The negatives are firstly below average special effects; secondly, most of the actors except for the "baddies" are unconvincing and lack charisma. Where this movie can get a high vote is the full throttled often non stop action which just about cancels out the negatives.For the above reasons I can give this 6 and a half, which I generously round up to:7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the trailer made me want to see this movie and I didn't see Olympus Has Fallen at that time. So I watched that yesterday and I liked it, fun action movie with some noticeable flaws.Today I went to see London Has Fallen and I liked it better than the first one. The action scenes were a bit better than the first and more intense, the lighting and cinematography improved quite a bit compared to Olympus and the scale was bigger.To get a little more in depth on certain matters that I liked: Gerard Butler is made for this role, he makes for a very likable action hero that gets the job done. He did that in Olympus and now in this one he did it a bit better I think.The rest of the actors also do a good job, nothing really great but I got why everyone of them had a motivation to be there.As I said the action was better than the first and with that I mean there is a good build up and when it starts I was invested in the scenes and wanted Gerard Butler to kick ass.There are some issues with it though. In Olympus Has Fallen and the trailer for this movie I already saw that the CGI was really bad. Some explosions look really fake and it's weird that they didn't put more effort into making that look better.Also this movie, like Olympus, is very patriotic. I think Americans will like the movie more than the rest of the world. I didn't mind it too much (I'm Dutch) but other people might find it somewhat annoying. What is a bit weird though is that they casted a Scot (Butler) to play an American. And the guy just doesn't have a good American accent which is just a bit weird.Also some other technical elements like editing, sound etc. were quite poor during parts of the movie but I didn't mind it that much.So all in all it's a dumb fun action movie and I'd recommend watching it, 7/10.</fullReview>

But, common guys. Couldn't we rate this kind of movies in advance ?! Like for example, this one, should be rated "TP" for "Toddler Plot". Because, obviously, a toddler wrote the plot. Which is fine. Everybody has to earn a living. No shame in that. But maybe, someone like me enjoys movies with better crafted scripts, like for example "Shoot 'Em Up". Or more character depth like "Snakes on a Plane". Or better dialogue, like ..whatever. What I'm trying to say is that I feel offended to be served this kind of mindless long load color image fest. And I didn't even pay for the ticket. Can't even imagine how someone who paid for the ticket might feel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched the trailer for this film, I expected the same thing the first had, only worse. In a way I was right, the film didn't really have anything new to offer and showed many of the same things the first did. The jokes attempted at the beginning of the film left long and awkward silences through out the cinema(jokes got a little better later). The acting as expected wasn't anything special. These talented actors/actresses put an average performance at best. The story wasn't great either, I felt like we needed to fell emotionally invested with the fact that it's meant to be a "final job", but the story didn't develop enough to allow us to do so. The action wasn't great and felt slow at times, and even predictable. The film is mostly filled with unnecessary explosions, that looked visually poor and instantly put you off. Overall, although the film had its few moments it was what I expected it to be. However I did think that the poor story it wouldi have, would be balanced out by some acceptable action. That wasn't the case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the previous title, or even this title, audience would have a clear idea of what's promised here. It's "save the president" themed action movie, sets in London. There are famous names actors to elevate the story, but it should be no surprise that the drama portion is average. They do succeed on advancing the action into full blown combat spectacle from continuous shoot-out and rapid brutal slashing.Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), the president of USA, has an obligation to attend the funeral of British Prime Minister. Along with his trusty bodyguard and soon-to-be part time dad, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) he embarks in the trip, and as we all know it, London is eventually hit with terrorist attack. The story is plain it operates on a strict linear motion with barely any twist at all even though it has actors who worked on this genre before.The main idea is the same patriotism and duty-bound motive, which is arguably worked slightly better than the predecessor, but it often becomes too flat in delivery. Some of the scenes feel too forced to create tension and it ends up too cliché in the process. Script doesn't produce any solid interaction as it relies on too much on misguided bravado and the comedy aspect only works partially. Furthermore, the intended twist is far from effective since it doesn't develop nicely, if any at all.Fortunately, this is a definite step up action-wise. Chase scenes, melee brawls and gun fights are far more intense and better choreographed. It has the luxury of great continuous shots action in no shortage of speed and impact, almost similar to video game sequences. There's also the addition of CG for large scale attack, understandable since they have to present actual London under siege, though it's inferior to the psychical combat counterpart."London Has Fallen" is miles from the predecessor in term of action, but it might not be an appealing visit for those wanting complex narrative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London has Fallen was not as good as Olympus has Fallen in my opinion. I did enjoy the movie though. The action scenes were great and I even liked the funny comments in between. I honestly don't know how critics could make the movie out as racist as all movies are generally based on how the world perceives each other. Yes, the terrorists were from a certain geographical location but unfortunately that is how real life is as well. I doubt audiences are dumb enough to generalize and believe for one second that every person living in that country is a terrorist. As for the banter between Mike Banning and the president, it's believable in my opinion. They treat each other like family and have known each other long enough to feel comfortable to do so. All in all I loved the Die Hard type theme with explosions and bullets flying everywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often Hollywood movies come in pairs, so 2013 saw two that, a decade or so after terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, felt able to represent an assault on another iconic American building: the office of the President. First out of the trap was "Olympus Has Fallen" which was followed a little later by "White House Down". The basic plot of the two movies was remarkably similar: bad guys seize the White House and capture the President before attempting to take over control of all US missile forces. "OHF" had half the budget of "WHD" but earned almost as much at the box office and was slightly more credible, so this is the one that, three years later, has a follow-up showing.The same president is in peril (Aaron Eckhart) and the same secret service agent is his saviour (the Scottish Gerard Butler), but the location shifts to the city where I have lived for 45 years, so it's fun to see so many familiar landmarks, although most of them suffer serious damage from a large group of bad guys who find it stupidly easy to infiltrate British police and security. Indeed, except for a few tough SAS guys who back up the American's attack on Terrorist HQ, the British are treated as pretty inept compared to the single-handed bravery and brilliance of agent Mike Banning. But, like the original movie, while winning no plaudits for plotting or dialogue, there's enough action and excitement to entertain and this time for a commendably brief 99 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London has fallen talks about after the death of the British prime minister, the world's most powerful leaders gather in London to pay their respects. Without warning, terrorists unleash a devastating attack that leaves the city in chaos and ruins. Secret Service agent Mike Banning springs into action to bring U.S. President Benjamin Asher to safety. When Asher falls into the hands of the sinister organization, it's up to Banning to save his commander in chief from a horrible fate. This film has to be one of the most poignant, plaintive and intense action film of the action genre. It captures the pure period of war and terrorist attacks. This is an improvement over Olympus Has Fallen and offers the same mindless thrills, and in true sequel fashion the stakes have never been higher. But what I thought was the most controversial scene was the murders of the world leaders. I mean, it's not in everyday life that killing all the world leaders in less than 3 mins can be highly possible for a terrorist and his group. However, the plan to lure the leaders in was really clever. Especially what I realised the British prime minister was murdered by them and decide to kill the other leaders in retaliation to their society. Jacobs' death was actually the most poignant for me, it really hit me the moment when she said to Butler's character "Stay alive", it made me reflect back to the last hunger games film when Katniss said to peeta "stay alive". It shows how war can actually hurt the lives of your closest ones, especially someone who you work with. The critics' point of view seemed fair though, considering most of them are old and they only like films that are based on real life. But ignore what they say most of the time, this film has it all for you. London Has Fallen, the film that provides bloody action and vigorous moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into this film expecting a brain dead action film about a terrorist attack on London, and that is primarily what I got. London has Fallen is all about a plot to assassinate all the world leaders when they attend the Prime Minister's funeral, after he dies in dodgy circumstances. The U.s president is protected by Mike Banning, played by the predictable Gerard Butler, who puts in his usual hard man performance without really trying, and the president is played by Aaron Eckhart who does a reasonable job. The US security team include Morgan Freeman who admitted he only did it for the money, which pretty much sums up the script's quality. Freeman is not challenged, but does fine with what he is given in a boring rather clichéd script.Before the action starts, we get see some of Mike's family life which is an interesting perspective for this film, and provides us with some meaningful character development, which makes a change from the 1st film. I liked the family perspective, but the script doesn't support it well enough so it drops off as the film really gets going. When the attacks first happen, and the events straight after this is when the film is at it's best, with some exhilarating sequences and some questionable dialogue from all involved. After the initial attack, the pace doesn't drop, which is good as otherwise the film would become a drab affair. Despite the fast pace, the action is very predictable, despite being enjoyable, and I also thought the ending was pretty good and well thought out. Despite the good, there is other bad, like the supporting characters rather falling by the way side, like a British agent and it feels like she's just been thrown in to include a women in the film, and I felt she should of had an expanded role. Also, the score was no where near dramatic enough for my liking, even though you can't notice it all the time because of the quick pace of the movie.To summarise, they poor script is evident throughout despite great action sequences and decent pacing. The lead stars do what they have to do, without doing anything spectacular whilst other characters fall to the wayside. Despite it's faults, London Has Fallen is nonetheless an enjoyable action flick, but is certainly won't win any awards or get amazing reviews, but brain dead films never do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London has Fallen pretty much takes Olympus has Fallen and added extra meat. I remember in Olympus has Fallen there was this bad ass fight scene between Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) and the main bad guy which was like "oh snap" Dope. It felt like London has Fallen just kept repeating that scene with every action sequence.It's not as dramatic as the original movie (though we got some cool War room moments from Morgan Freeman reprising his role as Allan Trumbull, and some emotional moments from Angela_Bassett as Lynne Jacobs), It falls into the cliché of most sequels of it's kind, going for bigger, badder, and better, but unlike most sequels of this fashion, London has Fallen hands down delivers. While Olympus has Fallen took place mostly in around The White House, this time around Mike Banning has to get President Asher (played by Aaron Eckhart) out of the entire city of London, After a criminal getting revenge for his dead family arranges to have every leader of the Western world assassinated during the funeral of the British Prime Minster, In what feels like the strangest buddy cop movie ever. Butler and Eckhart trade one-liners that would make Riggs and Murtaugh of Lethal Weapon fame, blush. It's funny, they tried that in the similar plotted film, White House Down, that came out the same year as Olympus has Fallen, but it did not work there like it does here.Maybe because when it comes down to it Butler got to get his action hero on and it was pretty stellar, thanks to some great camera direction that made the whole movie look like a video game I was playing. Everything was just so close together that we are right there on the quiet empty streets of London deep in the action that does not quit.It's a great 90mins of pure action and it works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>9 March 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - London Has Fallen. I was very much looking forward to this sequel of Olympus Has Fallen and I was not disappointed. Well not much. Apart from quite a few very badly executed superimposed explosions of most of the famous London landmarks this film was pretty darn good. Don't get me wrong, it's an action film so it's never going to win Oscars for dialogue or best actor but it pretty much kept me glued to my seat throughout. Using the funeral of the British Prime Minister as the reason to get many world leaders in one place, they are then viciously, brutally and fatally attacked leaving just the US President alive and on the run for his very life, trusty bodyguard Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) in attendance. It left a funny feeling seeing our capital being blown apart like that, but the whole film was non stop action from start to finish and I could easily watch it again. Oh and of course the most marvellous Morgan Freeman was one again playing Vice President Trumball. Definitely one for my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>London Has Fallen - Give it a Chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by Creighton Rothenberger who was also the writer of Olympus Falling and stars the same three brilliant actors. This movie is action from beginning to end and cannot be considered a spoof of a James Bond movie. I have watched all the James Bond movies and they were all good however this one and Olympus falling is in a league of its own. The story line of this movie is very good. When the British Prime Minister passed away under strange circumstances, most of the leaders of the Western world are invited to attend his funeral. However what begins as a sad event, turns into a deadly plot to kill the world's powerful leaders and unleash mayem. The President of the United States, his most trusted secret service head and a British MI-6 agent are the only individuals that can stop this act of terror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is crazy nonsensical fun. Is the dialogue award winning? No. Does it highlight deeper meanings about the world we live in? No. Does it have anything to add to the genre? Well, not really. Is it a fun time to pass 99 minutes? Yes - by Jove it is. Action, death,explosions, the occasional one liner, lots of running, a slightly crazed over the top 'baddie'and nice exterior shots of the UK capitol. What's not to like about this movie? It isn't trying to make political or social commentary - it's a nonsensical action movie, and it isn't trying to be anything else. I liked it. If you want escapism and silliness with your explosions then you might like it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Olympus Has Fallen" does London: "Things are going to get sporty"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"London Has Fallen" (2016 release); 99 min.) brings more adventure for the characters we got to know in "Olympus Has Fallen". As the movie opens, we are in "Punjab Province, 50 mi. north of Lahore, Pakistan", where we get to know Barkawi, a terrorist mastermind and weapons dealer, whose compound is attacked by a US drone (we later learn he survives but his daughter did not). We them go "Two Years Later", and we see President Asher doing his daily jog, accompanied (of course) by Secret Service agent Mike Benning, who is expecting his first child wife his wife Leah in the next 2 weeks. When the British Prime Minister unexpectedly passes away, the President and his entourage must go to London on short notice for the funeral. At this point we're perhaps 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience.Couple of comments: this sequel reunites many of the characters we got to know in "Olympus Has Fallen" several years ago: Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Melissa Leo, Robert Forster, and Radha Mitchell all reprise their roles from "Olympus Has Fallen", so immediately the movie feels familiar, like a true reunion. Newcomer director Babak Najafi (whom I had never heard of before) more than capably fills in for "Olympus" director Antoine Fuqua (unavailable due to other commitments). If you like an action movie, you are in for a great time. The attack on London is eye-popping due to outstanding CGI effects. I'm trying to recall if I've ever seen so many air shots of London that are simply eye-candy, with all those wonderful London landmarks: St. Paul's Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, The Eye, Buckingham Palace, etc., they're all there. As to the action scenes, some of them are outstanding, in particular the chase of the President's Landrover by a number of baddies on their motorcycles is hair-raising. The foreign leaders attending the funeral are simply irresistible: there is German Chancellor Agnes Bruckner (standing in for Angela Merkel), and of courser we also have Italian Prime Minister Antonio Giusti (reminding us of former PM Silvio Berlusconi), etc. Despite all the violence, humor is never far away. At some point, Benning slowly kills one of the baddies with repeated stabbing. "Was that really necessary?", asks the President. "No", answers Benning, ha! Later on, when the final assault is upon us, Benning comments "Things are going to get sporty!", and indeed they are. If you liked "Olympus Has Fallen", you will love the London outing of the gang. Now the question is: where will the gang go next? My personal vote would be for Hong Kong. How cool would that be! "London Has Fallen" opened nationwide this weekend. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay (but nowhere near a sellout). I was surprised how many women were in the audience as this movie is, let's face it, the guys' reverse version of a "chick flick". My son and I enjoyed "London Has Fallen" from start to finish, and I couldn't believe how quickly the movie flashed by. "London Has Fallen" has gotten mostly negative reviews from the so-called "critics" and "experts", but frankly what do they know? If you liked "Olympus Has Fallen", I guarantee that you will love "London Has Fallen", and hence in that sense "London Has Fallen" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "London Has Fallen", starring Gerard Butler-Gods of Egypt, The Phantom of the Opera_2004; Aaron Eckhart-I,Frankenstein, Erin Brockovich; Angela Bassett-Chi_Raq, Green Lantern; Alon Aboutboul-The Dark Knight Rises, Rambo 3 and Morgan Freeman-Ted 2, the Dolphin Tale movies.This is a sequel to the 2013 Olympus Has Fallen. In this one, Gerard is Secret Service Agent/bodyguard to Aaron, aka POTUS. Gerard is married and has a child on the way so he is thinking about retiring and becoming a stay at home dad for a while. In fact, he is in the process of typing his resignation out on his computer when he gets a call from Aaron, telling him that he is needed once again for a last minute trip to London for the funeral of the British Prime Minister. Angela comes along, as the Secretary of Defense. Morgan is the Vice President, so he has to stay and keep an eye on things at home, while the Prez is away. Unbeknownst to all the funeral attendees-and there are all kinds of World leaders attending-it is all an elaborate trap by Alon, the number 6 most wanted terrorist in the World. At least, that is how he is known by the CIA. It seems that Alon's family was killed about 2 years ago by a drone strike and now, he wants revenge by taking out as many World leaders as he possibly can. Only problem is he didn't count on Gerard. During the movie, London is torn a new one-thank goodness it's just a movie. Lots of chases, gun battles and even a few good one-liners thrown in. What more could you ask for? It's rated "R" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 39 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>London Bridge Is Falling Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As well as several other well-known London landmarks in this 'comic book' movie which is heavy on the pyrotechnics and short on coherent narrative. Gerard Butler is perfect as the President's bodyguard and expectant father. He is trying to retire but is pressed back into service for a funeral for a world leader, in this case the Prime Minister of Great Britain. All world leaders assemble in London for the funeral which turns out to be a booby trap set by a vengeful Al Qaeda leader.Do you like escapist entertainment, the kind in which things blow up and have a high body count? If not, stay home. But I find this type of fantasy cathartic - the good guys win and the bad guys lose, with buckets of blood and bad guys biting the dust in virtually every scene. And at the end, our hero Butler emerges unscathed after getting shot, falling down an elevator shaft, getting t-boned in an SUV by an assault vehicle and surviving a helicopter crash. Great stuff. Like I said, not for all tastes but it's a nice change of pace from reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And by that title i don't mean you have all flocked to see it on opening weekend, i mean as far as action movies go it is so bland and forgettable that it just feels like we have already seen it. I give London has Fallen a 5 however because i do not remember sitting in the cinema hating this film.. but i definitely don't remember liking it so much either.So Gerard Butler returns as right hand man to Aaron Eckhart's president as they go to London after the prime minister has been killed. It started quite interesting really, all the world leaders were conviniently there but i thought maybe they will go all out this time and put all the world leaders at risk.. because at least then it adds something more for the audience. Nope, they are never seen again after things start to blow up. So yeah, throw in Morgan Freeman in a control room and we have our movie. The action itself was cool i wont lie, i was engrossed into it.. but then after an action scene had ended i would think oh yeah.. that happened in every other action film ever. So in that sense London has Fallen doesn't really have much of a reason to exist at all.The friendship between Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart is very believable which i guess is a nice little bonus and Butler is pretty badass. The third act though.. it was nonsense. The CGI was just bad. For example a huge CGI flame chases the leads down a hallway. How they don't look like Anakin Skywalker from Episode 3 i don't know because i swear it went straight through them. But here's the thing.. i switched my brain off and if you quite literally do too then you won't have a terrible time probably. I don't hate the film, i don't really like the film.. i have no feeling towards it which is why i gave it the average rating of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was a little disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been waiting months for this to come out, I thought it'd be all about Britain but once again it was all about the United States of America and London just happened to be the battlefield. A car bomb went off, then the Queen's Guard went nuts and shot the German chancellor, then all hell broke loose. It is extremely unlikely there would be a rogue Queen's Guard as those guys have to train in the British Army for decades. If like me you were looking to see the houses of parliament and the Tory government getting blown up, you'll be disappointed. All we saw was a Sky news report saying parliament was heavily damaged. People say this is a Die Hard type movie, but I'd say it's more of a Call of Duty style movie. Overall I was a little disappointed, but I don't feel I'd wasted my money going to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything 'Falls' Into place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one scene, Gerard Butler says to the Aaron Eckhart, "Brace for Impact", just like how the makers have said with trailer. They have showed us what it is and there is nothing more or less to expect from that. So when you go into this movie, you sit and you 'brace for impact'. Apart from familiar characters, the movie has nothing much to do with being a sequel but who is complaining?This time the playground for director's fireworks is London, one of the most beautiful cities of the world. The visual effects involving ripping Central London apart into pieces end up in making up the 45- 50 minutes of the runtime. Initial blast and action sequences are very well choreographed and I promise you won't be looking at your smartphone! Unlike last time, the antagonist targets multiple places and people in London to seek revenge. There is a load of stereotyping throughout the movie for example, a lady German chancellor, naughty womanizing Italian president and of course the ever so perfect American president. But who cares, its Hollywood's money and they will spend it their way:-) Though the sensitive issues like Drone Attacks come into picture, the movie has made no efforts in justifying them. There are a lot of things that one can criticize upon, but the movie does manage to keep us in the edge of the seats and that's pretty good enough for the bucks spent. My only criticism would be the movie pretty much stays indoors and underground for the last 40 minutes or so which is a bit tiring.Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart are the new bromance duo and they don't have to do much apart from delivering punchlines at each other. Morgan Freeman does not seem to get up from his command chair:-) Angela Basset looks young and dynamic but has a very little role. Other characters fill in for their generic roles. My Olympus has Fallen review is my most approved in IMDb, I know I am a little late in writing this one, but once again I say, sit at the edge of your seat and enjoy the fireworks.</fullReview>

This sequel, to the $161 million Olympus Has Fallen is about a Secret Service agent, played by Gerard Butler, who discovers a scheme to assassinate the world leaders attending the Prime Minister's funeral. From the start, the film gives the viewers a feeling of suspense and intrigue. Then it takes a turn and is straight action-packed, filled with blasts of gunfire and fistfights. There was never a dull moment! Director Babak Najafi kept the pace going throughout the entire film which kept the audience engaged through its entirety. Filled with an amazing cast including Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett, this film was blessed from the start; with a box office hit from the first film and an amazing cast, what could go wrong!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has the Violent Edge You Love, but The Motif Behind It Is Lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Better late than never I always say, and therefore I'm back in the trenches again to bring you another movie review. Today's film is London Has Fallen, an unexpected sequel to ever popular action film Olympus Has Fallen. If you remember the first film, things like explosions, action, and that it was the Gerard Butler version of Die Hard should come to mind. And while adrenaline junkies (like myself) enjoyed the thrilling stunts and explosions, I certainly didn't expect enough ground to make a sequel. Nevertheless, let's get down to another review. Like its predecessor, London Has Fallen is about one thing: action. Within the first thirty minutes the excitement breaks out, flashing guns, detrimental explosions, and extras flopping violently in the streets. From there, the violence only escalates, amplifying the action and intensity with each passing minute of the film. The fights are well choreographed and somewhat diverse to keep the gunplay "fresh", and utilized different styles of warfare to bring some variety to an otherwise straightforward combat approach. In terms of the quality of these scenes, the production team did their jobs well again with very stable camera work and sound effects to bring you fully into the stunts. With all these flashy sequences though, one might wonder if there is more to this blockbuster, popcorn flick. In terms of story, London has Fallen is not bad. It is another tale of revenge brought about by the overzealous use of weapons and warfare. As a result, the multiethnic bad guys create an elaborate trap to bring our heroes to London to execute them. The simplistic motive, although unoriginal, certainly worked with the movie and gave a realistic explanation for all the violence. Only problem was the execution. Where the first movie gave a little insight into the set up, London forgoes the planning stages and jumps right into the chaos. While certainly realistic, all of the targeted deaths happen in the blink of the eye with everything going conveniently well. It made the whole introduction to all the officials rather pointless and robbed the movie of some potential suspense. At least the emotional connections of Butler's character help bring some edge to the movie?though some of these moments are a bit too convenient. Speaking of Butler, let's talk about the acting. Despite being the action thriller, London Has Fallen does a decent job with the acting. Butler again leads the cast with the same gruff, heroic demeanor we've come to know and love. His delivery of bodyguard jargon and witty one-liners (many sounding similar to Die Hard and Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes) was very humorous. Yet he had some deeper moments in this movie that smoothed the rough edges and give him a broader emotional spectrum. Eckhart reprises his role as well and his sullen, calm poise is perfect for the presidential role. Together the two make a wonderful brotherhood that is very entertaining to watch, which is good since they take 85% of the screen time. Our supporting cast deserves a shout out as well, each playing their part (no matter how short) to the fullest with only a few trudging into the cheesy side of things. In terms of weaknesses of this movie, London Has Fallen has a few limitations that need to be addressed. First is that it is a very simplistic story, devoid of twists or surprises in favor of more action. I shouldn't be surprised, but I always hope for a shocking twist to vamp the story up instead of a predictable mess. Second is that some of the characters were rather pointless to begin with when you see the theme of the movie, even some of the bad guys who were built up died quite plainly. With regards to some of the stunts, well they crossed from impressive into incredibly cheesy, the overuse of CGI alongside bending reality too much instead of realizing its limits. A final note is that some of the violence was a bit graphic for my taste, or at least was done without much point. Seeing extras suffocate or be slowly stabbed to death does not bring much satisfaction to this reviewer, but those who like edge will be elated to see what London has in store for you. Overall London Has Fallen is one of the better action movies of the year. It's exciting, its flashy, and it has great special effects that keep you engaged in the movie. The acting is decent for the movie and brings a fun friendly relationship that brings you further into the film. But you can't deny what it is and that is a simplistic, popcorn flick devoid of any real meaning or substance, outside of people are greedy and war sucks (shocker there right?) Yet the special effects itself, alongside Gerard Butler, are more than enough reason to recommend seeing it in theater. Despite all this good though, the limitations do drop this movie in the mediocre category overall. My scores are: Action/Crime Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0</fullReview>

I would say it's more of an 8 to 8.5 so I rated it a 9 since the overall 6.5 rating is stupidly low. Your prototypical movie critics are usually a little loony with a group think mentality &amp; they stick their snobbish noses in the air on movies like this &amp; help drag down the ratings. It's definitely better than that. Story is simplistic but so are most movies. 1 minor implausible tidbit but I'll not be a spoiler. Figure it out for yourself. It in no way deterred my enjoyment of the film. The acting was solid but no one is going to win an award, it's not that kind of flick.

They decided to go cheap on the cgi and look what happens. some things are and should stay expensive. The movie direction, camera angles, acting were superb; but the CGI was almost close to those you see in Chinese releases. I wouldn't be surprised if they hired a team from there. Don't get me wrong not hating on China, but the masters of CGI are here in the US. The explosions were so bad it made me cringe. And that London bridge scene... the physics were worse than what you would see in a low budget video game.

		<shortDescription>Film Review: London Has Fallen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action movies, regardless of their explicit intent or savage coincidences, always tend to be a blend of entertainment, and implicitly, a political mine-field waiting to be criticized for its portrayal of the bad guys. Bad guys, no matter how hard you try to justify them, are always the main concern and heavily scrutinized subject of many critics and talks within action movies. Now, after 2013's obsession with White House abduction movies, White House Down and the original Olympus Has Fallen, which spawned our currently reviewed London Has Fallen, its hard not to be political when the main players in the film are today's world leaders. In 2013, London's predecessor Olympus Has Fallen showed a very political situation of a North Korean terrorist trying to unify Korea by capturing the American President, and using it as leverage to remove American opposition in North Korea for a South Korean invasion. While London Has Fallen does not have as much of a very intellectual plot as its original, one thing is for sure, the action, language and kick-ass Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) are amped up to mirror signature John McClane moments, but never ever quotes passes them.London Has Fallen is a less thought-out actioner, yet, the film tries to out-do its predecessor's actions, with a smaller budget, which never boasts well for action movies. Usually, when studios give a smaller budget to sequels, their faith in the subject matter is not very convincing. Yet, London Has Fallen is a more aggressive, solid action film that Olympus on many levels, and perhaps thats because of the cast and crew's fun with the material, rather than a serious tone found in the first film.Rugged with grit and braun, London Has Fallen is easily a fun and mindless action movie for die- hard action movie fans, as well as passive fanfare for casual action fans to the genre as well. Filled with ridiculous one-liners, sometimes really animated and disgraceful action special effects and some serious contemplative moments of justification and reveal, London Has Fallen is the perfect post-Oscar action movie to cozy up to for the month of March.As mentioned above, Olympus was a much more plot-heavy and politically savvy action film, while London is nothing short of a revenge film. But who is to say revenge films are bad? Anyone remember Kill Bill or Mad Max: Fury Road? The baddie this time, Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul) is a arms-dealing terrorist, arming any nation or any one body, with deep enough pockets, with weapons that could take out some of the world largest and longest standing national landmarks. When his dealings get his directly entangled with the interests of the United States, the United States military orders a drone strike attack on Aamir and his family. Of course, to amp up the melodrama and emotions, despite all of the intelligence of the United States government, the day of the strike is the same day as Aamir's youngest daughter's wedding. barely escaping the bombing of the United States, Aamir and his son Kamran Barkawi (Waleed Zuaiter) spend two long, hard year, devising a plan that will get their revenge and debt in blood.Upon the news of the sudden death of the British Prime Minister, President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) along with his top personal Secret Service Agent Banning, make their way to the UK for a highly publicized funeral for the former Prime Minister. Gathering some of the biggest leaders in the world, Barkawi's plans being to unfold, bombing leaders, landmarks and killing off thousands of people, including innocent civilians, in an attempt to capturing the leader of the free world, and globally broadcasting his execution. Banning, whose steps ahead of every nations top security outlets, goes above and beyond his duties, not informing a single soul of the President's movements and plans. His quick decisions saves the President for as long as he can, until he in inevitably captured and planned to be publicly executed for fear propaganda.Some of the most interesting parts of London Has Fallen aren't even within the scenes of the film, but facts surrounding the film as a whole make for one interesting little pop culture entry. Olympus, which was directed by American go-to action director Antoine Fuqua (Southpaw and The Equalizer) dropped out of the sequel, and was replaced, surprisingly by Iranian born filmmaker Babak Najafi, the man behind the Easy Money sequel and Berlin Film Festival darling Sebbe. What's truly surprising with London is the studio's confidence in an International director taking the reigns of a quite heavy Pro-America action film, one that has no problem showcasing the always tacky shots of the tattered American flag victorious whisking in the wind over a sunrise or sunset. Furthermore, the film, which was pushed from an October 2015 release date, to a March 2016 release date, before the attacks on Paris in 2015, really shows the films lucky fate of avoiding a box office disaster. One has to think, are these attack still in the minds of people and will it affect its overall performance overseas?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London HAS FALLEN (2016) ** Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Radha Mitchell, Angela Bassett, Jackie Earle Haley, Robert Forster, Melissa Leo, Charlette Riley, Patrick Kennedy. Lackluster sequel to OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN retread with Secret Service Agent Butler once again tasked into protecting The President of The United States (Eckhart reprising his role) this time from Middle Eastern terrorism in the UK set at the funeral for the British Prime Minister. Wildly over-the-top to the point of cartoonery and Butler practically foaming at the mouth which each kill the attempt to cash in on its DIE HARD rip-off franchise leaves one just exhausted no thanks in part to the frenetically off-kilter direction by Babak Najafi and the committee of scribes tooling this high octane machine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Carbon Copy Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although neither as ambitious nor as surprising as Antoine Fuqua's "Olympus Has Fallen" (2013), the sequel "London Has Fallen" qualifies as a good, old-fashioned, slam-bang, action thriller that should appeal to anybody who craved "The Expendables" movies. "300" star Gerard Butler reprises his role as indestructible, straight-shooting Secret Service Agent Mike Banning, and he bais U.S. President Ben Asher's butt out of another predictable, but electrifying predicament as terrorists swarm around them like furious hornets. A quartet of scenarists, Christian Gudegast of "Beyond the City Limits" and Chad St. John of "The Punisher, Dirty Laundry" co-scripted with "Olympus" creators Creighton Rothenberger &amp; Katrin Benedikt who also came up with the story, has shifted the setting from Washington, D.C., to London, England. The chief difference here is our hero, who claims to be made out of "bourbon and bad choices," takes seemingly sadistic pleasure in torturing the trigger-happy villains. Squeamish spectators are duly warned because this occurs more than once. In Hollywood movies, the heroes are given special dispensation to torment homicidal terrorists as often as heartless Nazis and other intolerant racist dastards. Banning stabs one terrorist to death slowly and lets the terrorist's ruthless brother at the other end of a cell phone listen to his sibling die in agony. Indeed, Banning displays minimal emotion when turning terrorists into sieves with one kind of weapon or another. Some of them Banning dispatches at long range with an assault rifle and others at close range with his pistol. Iranian-born Swedish director Babak Najafi, who helmed "Easy Money 2: Hard to Kill," gives neither the heroes nor the villains the luxury to loiter in this tense, nail-biting, 100-minute melodrama that corners our good guys from the get-go and doesn't let them relax until the final quarter hour. Mind you, nothing about "London Has Fallen" is remotely believable, and the characters are all one-dimensional. Banning is the only one to change over time; he becomes a father by fade-out. Once they arrive in London, the entire story elapses in less than 24 hours. Nevertheless, Butler's gutsy performance as an audacious hero who doesn't stop shooting until he runs out of lead, a brawny as well as believable cast, and the scenic city on the River Thames are its best assets.Unlike the rogue North Koreans who manufactured the mayhem in "Olympus Has Fallen," vengeance-driven Middle Eastern terrorists plan the pandemonium in "London Has Fallen." Affluent arms merchant Aamir Barkawi (Alon Aboutboul of "Rambo 3") and his eldest son Kamran (Waleed Zuaiter of "Jihad") orchestrate payback for a Pentagon drone strike that missed them, but killed their sister at her wedding in Pakistan. Miraculously, Aamir and Kamran survived the devastation. The Pentagon bombing takes place two years before the anarchy erupts in "London." News of the death of British Prime Minister Jim Wilson brings foreign heads of state to London to attend Wilson's funeral. Banning and Secret Service Director Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett of "Innocent Blood") accompany President Asher. We are given glimpses of several other heads of state in London in route to Wilson's funeral. No sooner than the Americans arrive at St. Paul's Cathedral do the terrorists launch their strike. Fanatics masquerading as British police as well as the red-uniformed Queen's Guard open fire on the German Chancellor. One foreign dignitary is blown up in his car after a terrorist disguised as a policeman attaches a bomb with a device used to search under vehicles. Asher is standing on the steps of St. Paul conversing with a member of the Prime Minister's cabinet when the fusillade of gunfire surprises everybody. Only a moment before the debacle, Agent Mike Banning complained that something wasn't right, but he couldn't decide what bothered him. Banning hustles the President into their bulletproof SUV, and they careen toward the Presidential choppers on the ground with terrorists on bikes strafing their vehicle. Terrorists kill the SUV driver, but Banning, Asher, and Jacobs make it to the choppers. London landmarks explode during this bedlam. The Marine choppers make it aloft. Terrorists wielding surface to air missiles demolish all three helicopters. Miraculously, Banning, Asher, and Jacob survive the crash of their chopper. The action focuses on Banning and Asher as more terrorists on bikes assemble around the crash site, and they have to leave Jacobs behind. Eventually, Banning and Asher reach an MI-6 safe house, but the rescue team that Vice President Alan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman of "The Shawshank Redemption") sends in doesn't make it. Instead, a bogus bunch reach Asher and Banning and storm the safe house. Our heroes careen off in another bulletproof car. Naturally, Mike Banning leads a charmed life, and he brings down more than his share of terrorists. At times, the shoot-outs in "London" resemble a high body count Hong Kong action-thriller."Olympus Has Fallen" was released roughly twelve years after the 9/11 tragedy, and the filmmakers tapped into the terrible memory of that event. Director Babak Najafi started shooting "London Has Fallen" in October 2014, and filming concluded in February 2015 before the horrific Paris massacre made headlines in November 2015. Although it takes place in a different city under different circumstances, "London Has Fallen" derives a modicum of plausibility from the Paris massacre as "Olympus" did from 9/11. Unlike "Olympus" that exploited that anxiety, "London" foreshadowed it. Some commentators' have contended cynically that the producers could forge a franchise from this formula with Banning and Asher visiting other capitals and encountering disorder. Compared to "Olympus," "London" is far less ambitious. Several actors and actresses along with Butler have recreated their roles for "London," and one of them bites the dust. This character's demise is the only genuine surprise. The President mentions his son in this sequel, but we never get to see him. Basically, Banning and Asher stomp the ground in "London." Although it carbon copies the formula from "Olympus Has Fallen," "London Has Fallen" generates considerable suspense and ranks as an above-average urban action thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it, and the terrorists represented more realistically than many films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film. It is a nuts and bolts action film, which delivers exactly as you should expect such a film to deliver.This film is deserving of more praise because they represented the terrorists quite a bit more realistically than they do in many films that are more politically correct (i.e., propaganda serving to subvert reality).The only reason I give this film a 9 instead of 10 is because the filmmakers did indeed give in to political correctness ? they did not indicate the true motives of barbaric terrorists such as these in real life. They presented these as arms dealers - a huge complex network of people all motivated to suicidal attacks against unarmed civilians just because some arms dealer's son got killed. No. The real motivation for these terrorist's behavior in real life is because they actually believe that they are going to get a guaranteed eternal spot in heaven as a reward for dying in the process of massacring and torturing those who do not adhere to their psychopathic religious fanaticism. And the source of their wealth with which they acquire weapons is almost always ultimately originated with selling oil, not arms. But Filmmakers won't show that because as it is, they are already getting attacked by the subversive politically correct pro terror propaganda machine just for portraying the ethnicities of the terrorists according to the ethnicities of most terrorists in real life. Remember folks, reality is never allowed to be spoken of or represented in any way. If you do, the highly funded propaganda machine will come down on you. The filmmakers know this and that's why they made these antagonists arms dealers instead of fanatics of a certain religion that shall remain unnamed. Overall, it is a Great film, and I especially applaud Gerard Butler. I love that guy. It was just great entertainment. This film was way better than the films White House Down, or 13 hours: Benghazi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the fact that this movie does not provide a realistic environment, it still hands us the ability to take a good look at the marvelous story infused in this context. I have decided to take a look at other reviews from part of other members of this same website-system, and I have to say that almost every single review that has an evaluation equivalent or inferior to 5 starts is purely biased and partial (No Sirs, I am not trying to overcome your reviews) - For example, it is pure hubris and callowness to even think that a movie is expected to follow the reality seen during our quotidian; which is something that this movie does not provide - reality - If we were to evaluate every single movie according to our reality than movies like: Noah or Ratatouille would need to have negative reviews - Why, you may ask? Because they don't follow the reality, since when do you see rats cooking? And since when does Noah follows every single detail articulated in the Bible? Aspects like these should be considered when classifying a certain movie, and these one deserves this same reasoning.Ignoring the unrealistic parts, this movie is able to offer/provide an amazing environment of action and astonishment, which is positive and captivating. The story is kind of organized, however, the only negative aspect is the fact that they shouldn't have created a unique "hero" - Maybe inserting a few more characters into the story would have enhanced the realistic view of some observers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True: London has fallen's plot resembles its prequel. True: The movie doesn't differ from many other action thrillers. HOWEVER: The movie was in my opinion great! Gerard Butler was born for this role and Eckhart plays a role that he previously mastered in the dark knight as the honest leader Harvey Dent. Morgan Freeman's appearances are few so do not catch this movie with hopes of watching a Freeman performance. I watched the movie with my friends and father: our opinions did not differ much it was agreed that we had fun and felt the movie's rush and thrill. We got what we were hoping for. So If you are looking for a movie that can capture you for an hour and half with a smart dialogue and a Fun set of actions this is the movie you should see!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the British Prime Minister passes away after what appears to be complications following a routine operation, his funeral becomes a target of a terror plot.The plan is to destroy some of the world's most powerful leaders, devastate the British capital, and unleash a terrifying vision of the future. The only hope of stopping it rests on the shoulders of the President of the United States and his formidable, Die Hard loving Secret Service head, and an English MI-6 agent who rightly trusts no one..........Apart from Tom Hardy, because she married him in real life.I didn't care much for Olympus Has Fallen, it was a cardboard cut out Die Hard Wannabe which just happened to be set in the White House, and to be honest, I much preferred White House Down, because it was aware of its own stupidity.So in the year that appears to be the years of totally unnecessary sequels (see also Bad Santa 2, Kindergarten Cop 2, The Huntsman), this is one of the first, and one of the most intriguing to me, because the synopsis is so high concept, you'd think Golan and Globus were in the house.And while the film isn't good, terribly racist, patriotic on the verge of parody, it isn't the terrible disaster you'd believe considering the plethora of bad reviews.I liked it because I was brought up on a diet of macho, patriotic schtick that used to feature an all American hero, an Uzi, and usually lots and lots of denim. Basically London Has Fallen is the film that The Cannon Group never made in the eighties. And believe me, if you are a fan of films like Invasion U.S.A, Death Wish 4, and Toy Soldiers, you will find much to enjoy/laugh at in this film.Butler is at his most macho here. He's not the greatest actor in the world, so he lets his weapons do the talking. Although he does look constipated for half of the film, he does convince as an action star.........just.He rest of the cast are great, but they are all phoning in their performances. Freeman is definitely not in that scene with Butler, Bassett gives up about thirty minutes in, and I spent more time looking at Forsters comb forward than listening to him.The effects are exceptionally bad, but only add to the charm of its absurdity. But watching it, no matter how thrilling some of the set pieces are, you know that him and the President will be safe, he'll get home to see his new born, and that resignation will be deleted forever.Coming next, box office has fallen.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gerard Butler Saves London from Falling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.7/5 stars"London Has Fallen" is tailor-made for fans of the golden age of action movies (read 80s and 90s), who loved their heroes ballsy and brawny, their guns big and bad, their one-liners witty and offensive, and their fight scenes brutal and raw. Yes, the sequel is a tad sillier and clumsier in places than its predecessor ? the surprise hit (and one of the best action films of the last decade) "Olympus Has Fallen" ? but it's still great fun nevertheless.After the British Prime Minister has passed away under mysterious circumstances, all leaders of the western world must attend his funeral. But what starts out as the most protected event on earth, turns into a deadly plot to kill the world's most powerful leaders and unleash a terrifying vision of the future. The President of the United States, his formidable Secret Service Head, and a British MI6 agent, who trusts no one, are the only people that have any hope of stopping it.Think of this movie along the lines of what Schwarzenegger or Stallone or Willis used to do so well, but, only this time, the Soviets are replaced by Islamist terrorists and Gerard Butler takes over the mantle of "mean action hero". And, thankfully, this is one of those rare movies that doesn't make any excuse for the terrorists, and shows them for the scumbags they really are while also justifying the west's stance of eradicating them by any means necessary.The bullets keep flying, witty one-liners fly faster than the bullets at times, punches and kicks are regularly thrown, and Gerard Butler does a swell job at once again portraying Secret Service Head Mike Banning as one badass action hero. In short, it might not be a novel piece of entertainment, but it's still one adrenaline-pumping, testosterone-driving, entertaining action movie nevertheless, harking back to a time before heroes always had to wear suits and pander to kids (not that I'm saying those movies aren't also entertaining as hell). So grab your popcorn, fasten your seatbelts, and be ready to be thoroughly entertained. If you're looking for anything else from this, then you're in the wrong place, mate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't be fooled by the bad reviews and low scores. These are left by Millennials, the most brainwashed and leftist generation in the history of mankind and the Islamic Nazis who are destroying the world.The truth is, this film is no worse than any other post-modern CGI action film. The difference is, this one does not contain the obligatory, subversive message that "diversity" is good and that we should embrace the world's most degenerate cultures, imbibing them into our own at the expense of our own cultural existence.Since the mid-1980s, political correctness has grown to terrifying proportions throughout the Western world. What's worse is that two generations have been born into this environment and, lacking any Pr-politically correct points of reference, assume all PC propaganda is legit.It isn't. In fact, countries like the US and Britain have been all but destroyed by political correctness. Take a walk through any major American city and you will likely feel you are in Pakistan. In the eastern third of the US, 80% of the faces one sees are Negroes; 13% Muslims; 2% Mexicans; and 5% genuine Americans of European ancestry (remember us? the people who founded this country?)This film depicts a very real threat--what happens when England and the US continue to permit the Muslim invasion and fatal vulnerability to terrorism which results. It is not politically correct; therefore, the excessively brainwashed Millennials hate it.In truth, there are a few politically correct touches in this film; the obligatory Affirmative Action casting of Morgan Freeman, plus the obligatory, militant feminist bull dyke character. But these are relatively small concessions to the times.Again, this film is no worse than any other post-modern action film. Self-loathing crybabies who will themselves into cultural and racial extinction at the hands of Muslims and Negroes may wish to sit this one out.It isn't.

The characters are likable, the action well paced and the destruction massive, while the camera-work properly adapts to the changing scenarios. There isn't too much gung ho yahooery as the dialogue sticks to likable patterns, so the settings and motions are vividly tied to the kind of times we live on the global war front, with sophisticated defense technology and granular, insidious terrorist plots. While it's true that you gotta punch harder and cut deeper onto those who disseminate chaos and death, it's also true that you reap what you sow and the cycle of violence always takes the shape of a spiral.</fullReview>

The action sequences are incredible, especially in the scenes when the camera rolls continuously as it follows behind Banning and his crew. Also, the special effects are much better this time around than they were in "Olympus Has Fallen." Overall, the film lacks depth and story, but it has no shortage of excitement and intensity.

		<fullReview>Saw it last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. It took what was good about the original film and built up on that, minimizing the lower points of its predecessor. Butler's, Freeman's and Eckhart's performances were exactly as expected; good for the type of film it is, but nothing Oscar worthy. The fight scenes were well choreographed and executed as were the multiple gun-fight scenes. I saw no problems with the CGI, but I was focused on the entire production and not attempting to nit-pick as some reviewers on IMDb apparently set out to do! The dialogue was what one would expect from a action B-Movie, but not overly cheesy. Yes, as with any action flick in this genre, there were some plot holes -- but nothing so obvious as to distract from the overall quality of the movie.If you go to movies to view socially conscious, poignant cinema -- then this film isn't for you. If you go to be mindlessly entertained, then this film will not let you down, just don't expect it to stick with you afterward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy sequel that's even better than its predecessor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"London Has Fallen" is the best action film that I've had the pleasure to watch so far this year! As expected, a good majority of the cast comes back as well, which is a nice touch. Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassett, and Morgan Freeman are ALL in top form here! An interesting thing about this sequel is that you don't necessarily have to watch "Olympus Has Fallen" (which was still good) in order to understand this film...unless you just want more of a background on the relationship of the characters. In any case, I liked the fact that this film once again resembled a more grittier version of "Die Hard" too, as I am also a fan of that series as well.It should also be noted that Mike and his wife are expecting a child and have devoted a room in their home as the child's future nursery. Mike's wife originally expresses concern about him going on another mission with the President, but accepts what he is about to do anyway and wishes him luck.The central focus of this film basically has U.S. Special Forces soldier turned Secret Service agent Mike Banning protecting the President once again, as they go on an unexpected trip to London, England after it is revealed that the country's Prime Minister, James Wilson, has died. President Asher and several other world leaders have basically been called upon to join as one as they honor the Prime Minister's life and end up meeting at a large Cathedral which is located in the heart of London.However, just as Banning and the President, along with Secret Service Director Lynn Jacobs make their way to the Cathedral, pandemonium ensues as terrorists, led by Aamir Barkawi, who is #6 on the FBI's "10 Most Wanted" list, infiltrate the heavily guarded area. An impressive amount of action occurs at this point, including a well thought out car chase sequence as Banning speeds through the streets with the President and Director Jacobs at they try to outrun the terrorists. At this point in the film, we find out that former Speaker of the House Allan Trumbull (Freeman), who is now the United States Vice President, is overseeing all major U.S. operations and is working with the President's staff in the White House Situation Room, receiving updates on the situation as time goes by.Eventually, however, as the President, Director Jacobs and Banning all board the Presidential helicopter, it unfortunately gets shot down, with everyone surviving except Director Jacobs, who appears to have been wounded by a piece of shrapnel from the helicopter crash. With not much time to spare, the President and Banning say their final goodbyes to Director Jacobs and depart from the wreckage before the terrorists catch up to them.Not long after, Banning and the President find an MI6 approved bulletproof government vehicle (it looks like a BMW) and use it to try and make their escape. Unfortunately, they are ran off the road by one of the terrorist's trucks and the President is kidnapped. Knowing this, Banning then teams up with government officials (presumably the U.S. Delta team) to track down the President, who is being held hostage by Kamran Barkawi, Aamir's son and one of his henchmen. Just as Kamran is about to decapitate the President, Banning bursts through the doors and gets into a brief fistfight with Kamran, only for him to flee. Not letting him get away, Banning orders the Delta team to blow the building's gas lines as he successfully escapes, with not a moment to spare, with the President of the United States. Kamran is then killed along with his thugs in the process.An interesting plot twist with this film, however, revolves around Jacqueline "Jax" Marshall, a British MI6 agent, who has been working in tandem with Banning and U.S. officials during this whole situation. She discovers that MI5 Intelligence Chief John Lancaster (Patrick Kennedy) is the traitor who helped Barkawi and the terrorists and then ends up killing him in self-defense. Once Barkawi's compound in Yemen is discovered by U.S. officials, Trumbull calls Barkawi and lets him know that he has lost. Barkawi is ultimately killed by a U.S. airstrike (or drone strike) on his compound.Before the film ends, Vice President Trumbull is seen on T.V. addressing the nation on the crisis while Banning is typing up a resignation letter to the U.S. government. Once Trumbull assures the American public that the U.S. will prevail, Banning deletes the letter of resignation and the film ends.In summary, even if you weren't a fan of the first film or didn't get the chance to see the first film, I'd highly recommend seeing this one. Moreover, if you're a fan of action films with a sensible story plot, then this film is for you. With that being said, I will definitely be picking this one up once it is available for purchase!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous but I liked it ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think with these things you have to judge and rate a movie according to its genre. This film lacks any kind of intelligent thought, dialogue or plot, it's a whole heap of silliness but "London has Fallen" is a good action movie. It does what it says on the tin. Fast-paced, violent, cliché-ridden, completely unrealistic - its everything you want and expect from this type of film. Butler is made for this type of role - not only does he look the part he provides a bit of eye candy as well. He's Bond without the class, and that actually makes him more entertaining in some ways. He's the Bruce Willis of our time. I like him as an action hero.There are no surprises in this film, Freeman is Vice-President, the Americans (of course) save London by identifying the location of the terrorists, Butler takes charge of the SAS and saves the President... I told you, it's a whole heap of silliness but enjoyable silliness nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'LONDON HAS FALLEN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the surprise 2013 B-action flick hit 'OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN'; which (like 'WHITE HOUSE DOWN', of that same year), is basically 'DIE HARD' in the White House. This one is set on the streets of London; where Secret Service 'super agent' Mike Banning is once again defending President Benjamin Asher, from vicious terrorists. Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Melissa Leo, Robert Forster, Radha Mitchell and Sean O'Bryan all reprise their roles (from the original film); they're joined by newcomers Alon Moni Aboutboul, Waleed Zuaiter, Mehdi Dehbi, Charlotte Riley (Tom Hardy's wife) and Jackie Earle Haley. Screenwriters Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt once again co-wrote the movie (they also co-scripted 'THE EXPENDABLES 3'), along with Christian Gudegast and Chad St. John. Iranian- Swedish filmmaker Babak Najafi made his American film debut, directing the movie (replacing Antoine Fuqua, from the original). I really enjoyed this film!The British Prime Minister has passed away, and all the western world leaders are invited to his funeral (in London). Mike Banning (Butler), the toughest secret service agent that ever lived, is once again escorting President Asher (Eckhart). Hundreds of armed mercenaries, under the command of a ruthless terrorist (Aboutboul), attack everyone in attendance; killing several world leaders, slaughtering hundreds of civilians and destroying multiple London landmarks. Banning will stop at nothing, to get the President out of there alive.The movie is such a great throwback to the B-action flicks of yesteryear (especially the 80s and early 90s); back when almost everything was a 'DIE HARD' ripoff! I was so surprised at how brutally violent it is. Butler seems like he stepped out of a time machine, to play his 'badass' role! The movie is filled with cheesy dialogue, weak special effects and completely unbelievable action scenarios; but it's also relentlessly entertaining in the process. I enjoyed it a lot more than the original (and 'WHITE HOUSE DOWN' as well). It's just so much more fun than I was expecting (in a 'so bad it's good' nostalgic way)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/vlqkdyuq2zY</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindless Violence - Loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can usually rely on Millennium films to supply you with that needed dose of mindless action violence. Be it the expendables, Rambo or any of their DTV movies, they all usually have something in common. A sense of fun.London has Fallen, is not as good as the first movie, but crams in a great dose of action in its 99 minutes run time. Let down slightly by its sometime poor CGI, typical of a lot of Millennium films, there are some great action scenes throughout the English Capital. Thankly the producers stuck to an R rating, as some of the violence is extreme.Gerard Butler is great in the lead, and makes a great action hero. His character in this sequel is quite sadistic in places, but I felt it just added to his character. Eckhart is good, but given less to do than Butler. The supporting cast, other than Charlotte Riley, are all pretty much short changed, with a lot of them possibly filming their parts in a few days. Morgan Freeman's first appearance, meeting Butler in the White House, looks as if it was filmed separately from the rest of the movie.Director Babak Najafi does a great job with the action, especially with a one take action scene in a London Alleyway. The scene only let down slightly by poor effects work. He may not be up to the standards to Olympus has Fallen director Antoine Fuqua, but carries it off well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not bad not great, just another "AMERICAN" movie in cinema day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is expected when you saw the title of this film, ya another have fallen. As in the trailer every G8 president/leader in movie has been kill except American and Russian(with some reason not getting invited. LOL.... so Russian president not even show in the movie. ha). That's why I named it American movie, why everyone have to die in one scene shouldn't they be hunted and meet up in some place and die one by one (oh sorry that may sound like a hungry game movie :P). So skip the plot, lets review something else something good about this movie. For some reason I'm love the action scene on the rescue part, it feels like "ONE TAKE" bravo, in some moment i'm thought watch people playing video game. Not bad, Not bad at all. CG not bad but not suggest to watch 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible but a lot of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this I never clicked on to the fact it was a sequel to 'Olympus Has Fallen'. I had never seen that movie and so the similar titles never registered to me. It didn't matter though as 'London Has Fallen' works well as its own movie. It has a superb cast and even Gerard Butler who is very hit and miss for me (often love him in pure action like this, hate him in lighter, comedy based movies) was in top form and carried the movie brilliantly. Aaron Eckhart was fantastic as always and Morgan Freeman did what he does best - played it cool and let us enjoy the sound of his voice. A film like this released in today's world is always going to garner a little bit of controversy. The movie doesn't seem to be too concerned with this fact though and I highly admire it for that. It's not politically correct in any way and that's so refreshing in the modern age. The story makes for a lot of fun but you do admittedly need to turn your realistic judgment standards down a fraction (a hefty fraction), as most would probably expect going into a film like this anyway. All in all it's a non-stop action ride from start to finish that if nothing else, will never leave you bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intense action in this movie. Was fun to watch. Sure some of it is so extra and typical Hollywood movie plot, but it's just a movie in the end. Fast pace, lots of shooting, explosions, enjoyable overall. Ignore all the hate reviews that give it 1 out 10. You know that's not legit. No real critic in the world gives 1 out of 10. Complaining about bombing children at weddings and etc is irrelevant to the actual movie review. Clearly you are discussing a whole other subject. Decent movie, go watch it and enjoy. It is heart pounding action and reminds me of the old style movies of the 90's. The graphics weren't bad and some scenes were a little funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good solid movie capturing very current subjects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the first one, I was already a little impressed by, how dark and unexpected that one was. Especially, the scenes where Mike sneaks stealthily around in The White House, taking out one bad guy after the other in a cool well-choreographed style. So when I went to watch this brilliant sequel at the cinema today, I was simply amazed. Switching out the darkened scenery of The White House with the blacked out state of London and its underground, our main character, Mike, is set up in a much more hostile setting than the first one, while the underlying motive of the terrorist attack goes much deeper in London, which makes the scale of the movie a lot bigger. And that is exactly what a sequel is supposed to do. Take the story one step further, one step bigger. Last but not least, I want to end my review by highlighting some of my favorite scenes from the movie, which made a big impression on me and should strengthen us (the western civilization) in our war against terror. In one of the last scenes, we see (probably for the first time in a movie actually) the President of the United States of America about to be executed on a world wide live broadcast. Furthermore, to make the scene more intense, the President utters the words of the Oath of office whilst being beaten up hard by one of the main villains. The intensity of this scene is so patriotic that even I as a Dane feel very empowered and strengthened in my belief in our common western society. This feeling is only strengthened when Gerard Butler as Mike tries to inform the main bad guy that USA is not a building, a man or just a flag. The US is a country, and that no matter how much terrorism there will ever be all over the world, our society will stand strong against it and "we" will still be here in a thousand years. Those were big words. Very big words that got me thinking quite a lot. I can definitely recommend this movie to both action enthusiasts and politically interested folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why all the bad reviews?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shocked to read all the bad reviews of this film! From start to finish it was action packed, i couldn't keep my eyes off the screen! Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart both play their characters so well it was better than Olympus has Fallen...although i loved that film also. I was surprised that so many of these reviews say there is not much action. The action starts within minutes of the film beginning. It is a must see movie for those action lovers. My brother and i read the reviews prior to watching the film and were reluctant but so glad we kept an open mind. You wont regret watching this film! Gerard Butler you continue to impress me!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally would give this an 8/10 but after seeing all the idiots on here giving it a 1/10, I gave it a 10/10 to try and even out the score. I mean seriously, complaining this is politically motivated and that this would never happen and the plot holes blah blah blah.. IT'S A FICTIONAL ACTION MOVIE! PERIOD! And the action was amazing, non-stop and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Sure there were clichés and we've seen these type of action movies before but that's just what they are supposed to be... action = entertainment. Story was excellent and well directed. Clearly all you 1-5 stars have your agendas, but based on dollars, this movie was a box office hit, and I can't wait for the next one! Well done boys!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Before seeing this film, I wasn't sure weather this movie would be good or not, and it was class.The film starts off with the assassination of the British Prime minister, the film then follows two years later to the funeral of the Prime Minister.Mike Banning played by Gerrard Butler discovers an organization planning to assassinate every single World Leader. He has to protect the President of the USA.This movie really grabbed me by surprise. The plot sets in about 20 minutes into the film. The CGI and explosions are presented beautifully. Each actor including Gerrard Butler, Morgan Freeman who plays the vice president of America were great as their characters.The only flaw in my opinion is some camera angles where a little shaky and some scenes including slow motion wasn't smooth and flowing consistent. Also, some background audio was overlapping the actors voice and you couldn't hear them as much at times.Overall, this is a fantastic thriller of a film and the film was well written and directed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing. It had everything you could have dreamed for in an action movie. This movie is bold, daring and the fact that events like this could happen in real life makes it all the more intense. I don't want to ruin anything but the story is just as good as the action. It's a lot like what's going on right now which gives the movie a lot of realism. It's a really face paced movie and is highly political as well. There's so much going on that some people might not be able to understand the plot. I prefer it that way and I think it gives the movie a lot of replay value. I already watched it twice. Watch this movie. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, not just for Americans but all fans of classic action movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, a young British male, and a German (also ~30 and male) friend went to watch the film tonight. Both of us really enjoyed it, the only slight criticism is that some of the action was a little unbelievable/unrealistic, but that can be forgiven considering the great non-stop action, great stunts and good CGI etc. - having seen part 1, we weren't expecting an intellectual drama, but an enjoyable, simple action flick after all. The other visitors in the International Cinema of Vienna (a European capital, not in the "evil" USA) where we went to watch it also seemed to enjoy it, so unless you hate America and can't stand American patriotism, don't be put off by all the whiny, politically motivated reviews, go watch the film and enjoy.Warning: if you're an America-hating, whiny leftist who gets angry/offended at the mere suggestion of some Muslims being possibly connected to terrorism, this film isn't for you. Go watch a film that portraits Osama Bin Laden as a hero of the oppressed/poor, or one that portraits Americans as evil devils who should be ashamed of their great country, and you'll be much happier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great non-PC action flick, ignore political reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like to check reviews before I go see a movie and London is Falling was no different. What WAS different was the level of vituperation and animosity directed at this movie. Looking at a large number of reviews I noticed common threads - many foreign based reviews with a remarkable level of antipathy towards the US and or Americans plus lots of crazy political comments (check it out). What got me were the comments about cowboys or patriots, etc. I started thinking I might like LIF, after all the trailer does show an action flick. With lowered expectations I went and was pleasantly surprised by an over the top action film in the Die Hard tradition. Yes, it is rated R but all of that is for violence and there is no more of that than in a Bay film. Pay no attention to the BS about unrealistic CGI or poor plot or all the pathetic excuses people find to criticize this film. If you want an art film - go see an art film. If you want a rousing shoot-em up, this is it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London has fallen is a highly enjoyable, action packed, fast-paced and exciting movie that will keep you engrossed right through to the credits. The British Prime Minister's funeral is being attended by all the world leaders who walk into a trap, laid by a vengeful arms dealer who wants them all dead. An intricate terrorist attack focusing upon the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) who has Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) to keep him from capture and they don't plan on going down without a fight as they weave themselves across the heart of London. Ignore the critical reviews, load up with popcorn and take a punt on this movie and you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

The plot is highly believable as are the character's. The computer graphics are brilliant a pity that it was not made in 3d. Sheer entertainment from start to finish. I would pay to see this again and that does not happen very often. The actor's are very good. Morgan played the vice president very well. I particularly liked the way the character names were introduced on the bottom of the screen like a documentary, which added to the realism.

		<fullReview>Fair enough if you're looking for something highly intelligent, or realistic, you won't enjoy this. But that's not the kind of movie this is! You wouldn't go to watch a comedy then complain that it's not scary enough, so why complain an action film isn't realistic? As the saying goes "don't judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree" As far as this film goes within its own genre, I would say it was excellent. Switch your brain off for a couple of hours, it's fun, it's full of action, it's visual impact is impressive and there's even a few of the obligatory cheeky one liners to raise a smile. If you want highbrow, arty, sci-fi, romcom, fact based or any other genre, then watch a title to fit one of those descriptions. When you're in the mood for stunning effects and disaster, I highly recommend this or its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A perfect sequel to Olympus Has Fallen. Full of action with the adrenaline rising every minute. Even though we know the characters, the plot is different and very interesting and up to the times. After all this is the era of terrorism unfortunately (let's not forget it) and for those of us who are against all forms of terrorism this is the perfect movie. Very enjoyable and well played by all actors. I do not categorize this movie in the intellectual category however. It is what it is and perfect as such. As for those people who trash it, why do they go see such movies if they don't like them??? I wonder. I enjoyed this movie and this does not make me stupid; I also liked Trumbo and gave it a 10 because I found what I was looking for in it. I enjoy animated movies as well as comedies and drama. So, don't be so melodramatic and trash this movie. Just keep away from it and let those of us who enjoy a variety enjoy London Has Fallen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the movie and here is my opinion ... People this movie its (so far) the best of the year!!! I enjoyed every second. You must see it! The interpretation of Gerard Butler to the role of Mike Bannign was great as always. For twenty minutes the things going normal with the characters enjoy the life in the Olymbus, but after those twenty minutes everything start falling apart. Mike Banning "strangling" minute by minute, in a one way road to save the president of USA (and his friend) Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart). Gun shots and boom (explosions) taking place everywhere in the movie, with the action scenes be better than the first and more intense. I know that i am saying only good comments, and may the movie not deserved a full 10/10 because the music it wasn't so great, but i enjoy the movie and i believe that the 10/10 is the perfect rating. So if you are a viewer that love an pure action movie then, this is the one my friend.Go to the cinema sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hands down the most exciting thriller in years. The pace is just right and the story is well laid out by establishing the reason for the attack by taking out the the arms dealer in the beginning. Things move quickly from DC to London where rather tongue in cheek humor shows the different heads of state including a woman for Germany and an older man with a young lady/ mistress for Italy. The action is very well done. Nothing deja vu here. You've get everything here. Firstly the disaster sequences are well done - not fake looking because they aren't over the top, from car bombs to bridges and Westminster Abbey blown up to boats exploding. The helicopter sequence is outstanding and quite scary. Then there are some pretty impressive fight scenes that are brisk and fresh. The street fighting scenes are almost video game like but entertaining. Finally even though you know the outcome, the threat of online beheading is quite scary.Gerard Butler is surprisingly right for the role - believable in his action and convincing in his determination. He acts like someone who could pull it off and delivers some snappy one liners. Aaron Eckhart plays the President who can handle a weapon. Good support from Angela Bassett and of course Morgan Freeman is the Vice President. Charlotte Riley handles things on the British side and she is not too glamorous to be unrealistic.There may be a bit of political incorrectness in the way there the "terrorists" are dispatched rapidly and in large quantities. But that's the nature of this type of movie and there are white villains too. The director is of Iranian descent and does a terrific job.Well done - much better than "Olympus Has Fallen".</fullReview>
