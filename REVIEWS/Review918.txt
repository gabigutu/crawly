		<shortDescription>Underrated storybook of a movie that embraces its cliches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you pay too much attention to the cliches and unlikely situations the characters are placed, you really miss the charm of this movie. I can see how people would be put off if they were expecting a serious historical reenactment. Still, I believe that Ron Howard fully meant for this to be a fully romanticized account of the time. This movie works in many of the ways Titanic does, and I think it does it more effectively. Still, with Titanic, most people seemed more than willing to overlook the absurdities. With Far and Away, I don't think Ron Howard was trying to trick us or dumb us down. I don't think he was ever trying to underestimate the intelligence of his viewers. I think he was asking us to follow him and trust him as he told a story. I enjoyed it. Kidman and Cruise were both fun to watch. The supporting cast, although they did seem like they came from a comic book, were entertaining. I hope this movie has life on cable and DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Involving, Old-Fashioned Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fairly long movie but one that keeps your interest - at least it did mine - all the way with an epic-type adventure tale of Irish immigrants back in the 1880s in the U.S.This movie is broken down into three distinct parts: 1 - Ireland (40 minutes, featuring some stunning scenery and good Irish music); 2 - Boston (one hour, featuring many brutal scenes of tough Irish immigrants and bare-knuckle fights); 3 - Oklahoma (the days on mining and the famous "land rush.")The story is very intense and involving. One well-known critic called it "old-fashioned" and meant it as an insult. Well, I think the opposite. I agree that it's old-fashioned, in that it's epic storytelling and that's a good thing. It features solid acting by Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and all the others, and Kidman isn't the only attractive thing in there. The photography is magnificent. I only wish the sound was better as there is almost nothing from the rear speakers.Cruise is very convincing as a good man, so much so I hated to see some of those beatings he took in the Boston segment. Then again, I'm old-fashioned: I don't like to see the bad guys win over the good guys.Overall, a memorable movie and one that you truly will care about the characters and the final outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irish immigrants caught in a cross-class romance set amidst late 19th century Boston and the Oklahoma Land Rush.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly brilliant film, this is Ron Howard's masterpiece. I never tire of viewing Far and Away, and enjoy every moment each time I see it. This film is admirable in several respects: 1)it shows how a romance can develop over time, without the typical Hollywood touches of "whirlwind" happenings and people hopping in the sack after only a couple of days (a la "Titanic"), 2)Ron Howard captured the beauty of Ireland, the filth of a large city, and the expanse of the open prairie by resurrecting 70mm film - the colors in this film are absolutely incredible, 3)a simple, character-driven story is enhanced by the historical backdrop. In fact, there are many similarities between the romance in "Titanic" and in "Far and Away." I feel that the depiction in this film works much better than the other, mainly because of the plausibility factor (how many times would you run into the same person on a huge ship?). We understand why Shannon would want to take Joseph along with her. This is the opportunity she's been waiting for. Along the way, and through helping each other through tough circumstances, they fall for each other. This is not some momentary crush that will pass when the next good looking person walks by, we know that these two truly care for each other, and admire each other. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are perfect - one would think that they're both Irish natives. If their marriage is anything like their relationship here, it is bound to last for some time. This is, hands down, Tom Cruise's best movie ever. Here we don't see the typical cocky young man, but instead, a man driven by passion and destiny to do what needs to be done. This is probably much closer to the real Tom Cruise: Proud, without being arrogant. This film remains on my list of all-time favorites, and I look forward to seeing it on the large screen one day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Underrated Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was very well done. It is an overlooked treasure. Ron Howard is a great film maker and he deserves more credit for this film. I'm a huge Ron Howard fan and I felt that this film was no better than any of his work done thus far. The dialog was a bit hard to understand, but the plot, acting and directing are what make the movie so great. Nicole Kidman is so beautiful in the movie and she really carries the movie with her charisma. Tom Cruise plays his part very well. The scenery in the movie is some of the best I've ever seen. It is easy to lose yourself in this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone I know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too original, but Tom and Nicole heat up the scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the whole rich girl falls in love with the poor boy routine is a little over done, Far and Away is actually a very romantic and wonderful movie starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. I think because they had such great chemistry, they made this movie into a tear jerker. Not to mention how great the story was, a part of our history that has always been ignored, the Irish immigrants coming over to America to have land and settle down. At a time when America was the new world and very exciting, where anyone could be free, Joesph and Shannon were two very lovable characters and you just keep hoping that their dreams come true.Shannon is a very upper class lady in Ireland with her controlling mother who wishes her to marry a snobbish land owner, Stephen. Joesph is a farm boy who has just lost his father and his home has been burned by Stephen, Shannon's father owns the land, so Joesph goes to kill him, but fails. His punishment is a duel, but he and Shannon see each other and have an instant connection but won't admit it of course, but Shannon offers for him to come with her to America to claim some land with her. He accepts her offer and goes with her. They claim to be brother and sister to survive, but soon they can no longer resist each other's love, but their family may be too strong to let them be together when Shannon's family comes to get her in America.Far and Away is a very charming film that I'm sure you will be impressed with. It's just a very romantic film, has fun comedy to it, good drama, and has terrific pictures and sights. Ron Howard is just a fine director, he got the whole feel of the old days and that race for land at the end was just shot so beautifully. Tom and Nicole did a great job, they were so beautiful to watch and made this into a great film. I highly recommend this movie, I think you'll love it.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who will deny Ron Howard his due?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Cruise may have the "worst-looking" Irish accent on the face of the planet, but it is undeniable that he and Nicole Kidman are sizzling on the silver screen together. Their intensity shines as well as their artistic ability to envelop a character and relate their thoughts to a viewer. Besides their very well done performance, the film is absolutely beautiful. Kudos to the set and costume designers that spent long hours on Far and Away. But he real story in this film is Ron Howard. It is simply a asthetic masterpiece. I spent most of my time wishing that he had just set his camera up on the prairie and filmed the grass growing. It was truly beautiful. Incidentally, sometimes one scene just makes a film. Brings it up from a good film into near 'masterpiece' status. This is one of those films. The music (the best soundtrack of the year thanks to Horner) combined with Ron Howard's vision made the "land race" scene of Far and Away and classic within itself. Put this scene up there with the chariot race in Ben Hur and the parting of the Red Sea in The Ten Commmandments, it is just that good. This is, far and away, one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film, a treat for the eyes and ears!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a wonderful tale of hope, failure and fulfillment. Unpopular with critics and snobs, it captures history in a rare and rewarding way, that recognizes the trials and travails of the Irish. The Gaels like so many other displaced ethnicities realized their full potential in America.Most films never develop an audience, and even fewer develop one that transcends generations. `Far and Away' appeals to adults and young people, so much so, that it has recently been re-released in DVD format. It has also established a niche in television rebroadcasts. These annuals rebroadcasts put the lie to the "wisdom" of the critics, and prove the films natural popularity with movie-lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is beautiful. It's wonderful to see Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in a good film. The movie has a pretty good historical point of view so the plot is kind of self telling. The scenery in this is great. And, it's fun to see Tom fight, and Nicole wash clothes. Oh, for the fight scenes nothing gory. For parents: this movie shouldn't be shown to really little kids. For teens it's cute. And, adults well take a crack at it. Oh by the way, a little bit of nudity, but nothing bad. Just trust me. It's a very well done and beautiful film. 9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Frontier Thesis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in Gone With the Wind Gerald O'Hara tried to tell Katie Scarlett the importance of the land, a lesson she took the entire film to learn. For Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman it's the land, their own bit of land to work as they please and answer to no one.The story of Far and Away takes place in a very specific time period in the history of both Ireland and America. In Ireland the home rule movement had been dealt a stunning blow with the fall of Charles Stuart Parnell in scandal. Independence had been set back and the landlords were riding high, though not without opposition. Opposition in this case comes in the form of Tom Cruise and his family who are Irish tenant farmers about to be tossed off their land because they can't pay the exorbitant rents. Turns out the landlord's got a most fetching daughter in Nicole Kidman who's got her eye on the peasant lad. Far and Away is first and foremost a romance, the rich girl and the poor boy, two beautiful young people we all wish we were. Of course the real affair of Tom and Nicole and their eventual marriage is fairy tale storybook stuff on its own. It sure didn't hurt the film.They've got a rough road ahead though. In Boston they get exploited by their own people as badly as the English are doing in the old country. Of course their eventual salvation is the Oklahoma land rush where Tom can get his own land to work.Frederick Jackson Turner was a famous American historian who put forth the thesis that the reason America escaped the class struggles and revolutions of Europe was our frontier. It didn't work out so well for those Indians already there, but the proletarian masses instead of becoming a mob that agitators could stir to revolution just went west and made opportunities. Turner's thesis is still a widely respected paradigm in the study of American history and I think if he could have seen Far and Away, he'd say Ron Howard proved his point.Speaking of Ron Howard, it's pretty obvious he was influenced by both versions of the Oklahoma land rush previously made in the two films of Edna Ferber's classic Cimarron. He doesn't do badly in recreating Boston of the Gay Nineties and Ireland of the same period.And Tom and Nicole certainly look beautiful even when she's working in a factory and Tom's getting clobbered in a bare knuckle prize fight. Look for nice performances by Robert Prosky as Nicole's father, Thomas Gibson as Tom's rival for Nicole and Colm Meaney as the Irish political boss in Boston.Maybe the world needs a frontier to solve its problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far and Away is definitely one of my favourite films. The acting and the scenery were both superb and I absolutely loved the story. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise were both brilliant in their roles and the romance between Shannon and Joseph was very believable (most likely due to the fact that they were married anyway!). Nicole gave a superb performance as Shannon, the scenes in which she is acting the innocent, but rebellious and naive young girl were brilliant. And Tom was superb as the poor but ambitious Joseph. A truly brilliant film which deserves to be on the big screen, I hope to be able to see it at the cinemas one day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Tis All About Tom And Nicole, 'Tis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Possible Spoilers** In 1892 Ireland, the son of a poor farmer forms an unlikely alliance with the daughter of a wealthy landowner, in `Far and Away,' a romantic adventure directed by Ron Howard, and starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. When his father dies, and an agent of the landlord to whom back rent is owed burns their modest home to the ground, Joseph Donnelly (Cruise) vows revenge. Armed with an ancient, rusty rifle, he travels to the estate of the landowner, Daniel Christie (Robert Prosky), intending to shoot him. But his plans to settle the score quickly go awry; as he draws a bead on Christie and pulls the trigger, the rifle explodes in his face. Christie takes him into his home to treat his wounds, and there Joseph catches the eye of Christie's daughter, Shannon (Kidman). The lad, she notes, has pluck, and he's obviously a scrapper; and she immediately sees him as the means by which she can effect her dream of running away to America, where they are giving land away for free (or so says the ad she has ripped from a newspaper). She realizes that such an undertaking would be impossible for a woman traveling alone, but with a man such as Joseph along to tend to her needs and offer protection, it could be done. Circumstances prevail in her favor, and soon the two of them are off, covertly, with the plan being to land in Boston, then head west to the Oklahoma Territory, where Shannon will be able to claim her land. Of course, Joseph sees land in it for himself, as well. They hit a snag, however, upon landing in Boston; Shannon's silver spoons, stolen from her mother, and with which the trek west was to be financed, are stolen from her, leaving them without means. With some help, they manage to find affordable accommodations (a room at a local bordello), and Shannon finds work in a factory. Meanwhile, Joseph finds he can make some money by prizefighting at one of the local pubs, under sponsorship of a man named Kelly (Colm Meaney), the `connected' Irishman of the town. It's enough to keep them going, temporarily, but the question is, can they make it to Oklahoma in time for the `land rush' of 1893? Cruise gives a credible performance here as Joseph, complete with a passable Irish accent, and he has a natural, charismatic persona that comes across so well on film. Kidman, too, fares well with her portrayal of Shannon; her accent is good, and the camera likes her. And, of course, there's a real chemistry between them. Howard has crafted a visually handsome movie, with a good story told in a predominately straight forward manner. There's not a lot of surprises, and much of it is predictable, beyond mere foreshadowing, but the pace is brisk and the characters are alive, which keeps it all interesting. Also, there's a touch of humor thrown in at appropriate junctures, which helps to offset the dramatics, maintain a positive atmosphere, and keep it all from becoming too sullen. The cinematography is especially notable, particularly early on, when capturing some of the lush vistas of Ireland, and later during the `land rush' sequence. The performances are good all around, and the excellent supporting cast includes Thomas Gibson (Steven), Barbara Babcock (Nora Christie), Cyril Cusack (Danty Duff) and Michelle Johnson (Grace). `Far and Away' is well made and delivered, and, most importantly, it's an entertaining movie; perhaps not one of the most memorable Howard has made, but it's an enjoyable film, and well worth seeing. All in all, it makes for a pleasant night at the movies. I rate this one 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but the accents.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am from Ireland and I can PROMISE those who have watched it that we do not speak like that. Secondly the names 'Joseph' and 'Shannon' are only recent names and were not the names of near 100 years ago! The film really is about when the British owned most of the land and the Irish had to pay high tax's so most went off the America. The plot was good only the boxing dragged on a bit and they were earning money but still never left to go and get land or to even get better accommodation other then staying in a brothel. It is a good movie to watch if there is nothing else but please do not judge the Irish by the accents of Tom and Nicole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved this film for as long as i can remember. It is one of the most romantic films that i have seen. Perhpas because the romance in it is far more believable than the, "They meet, fall in love instantly and hop into bed" No this is a movie of love built up yet hidden over time, a film filled with sexual tension between Kidman and Cruise.It really is a wonderful film, a hidden treasure and one that should not be missed, regardless of what the critics say its an amazing film and so romantic. Never in my life will i forget these two lines said by Cruise to Kidman. "All the land in the world means nothing to me without you" and "Joseph loves Shannon" I defy any women (or man) in this world to tell me that their heart doesn't melt at these points.Women will fall in love with Cruise, Men will fall in love with Kidman, watch it together and you will fall in love with each other all over again!!</fullReview>

The chemistry was wonderful and the development of the characters is something I wish they would do more of in movies nowadays.This is truly a classic and one of Cruise's and Kidman's best performances.

It also lets you experience the hardships one would face during the 1800's in a new country. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are wonderful in this movie.

		<fullReview>Overall, Far and Away was a good film made beautiful by a stunning soundtrack and gorgeous scenery. Concerning the plot (the most important part of ANY movie), you'll really appreciate the drastic character developments and grande-scale, almost fate-like essence to the story itself. I've found that some say the movie was lesser due to the sub-par Irish accents, but that is such a petty thing to get upset about. It's not completely convincing, but yes, it resembles an Irish accent just fine, and that is enough for me. Would you rather have some cut-rate actors that can't conjure a fraction of the on-screen chemistry shared by Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, just for the sake of a 'good' Irish accent? I didn't think so. Let it go and enjoy the beauty of this movie. This is one of those films that isn't the best thing you've ever seen, but will still leave a lump in your throat and have you wanting to watch it over-and-over to relive this empathetic romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Far and Away" (1992) is beautifully looking, nice acted good directed and very poorly written adventure flick (that pretends to be an epic). Set in historical surrounding, shoot beautifully it has the scope, the heart, but unfortunately it falls short in writing - dialogs are poor, forced, not realistic at all and full of coincidences. It has a story, but it doesn't have guts to show it seriously - "Far and Away" is simply an eye candy.Stil, if you want to look at gorgeous N.Kidman, some beautiful shoots,good directing by a great R.Howard and a really interesting (not without a lots of clichés of course)ending, this adventure (and some romance, largely because of the chemistry between the leads) flick is for you - just don't take it to seriously, it's pure fun. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes I know it was rubbish, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I almost stopped watching when our young Oirish Omadan Tom Cruise was battling with his Poteen drunk brothers, but once his father returned from his death to give him a final blessing, I was hooked. I wondered at this point if it was a screenplay written by a good Irish playwright. Nicole Kidman had a surprisingly good West of Ireland accent I thought, but Tom's was pure Kerrygold. Possibly the clichés were deliberate, and the whole thing was a satire on the American view of the Irish, but probably not. Scenery lovely, Nicole and Tom physically lovely. If you don't like it within a quarter of an hour, give it up. It doesn't change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people are comparing this film to Titanic, I'd rather compare it to Gone with the Wind and Downton Abbey. This film supposedly took place one century before it was filmed. Yet the topics and things that it grapples with are still with us to this day. Immigrants came from all over the world to start a new life in America, which was still largely unexplored frontier territory; only to be sucked into the same situations, caste system and society order that they had just left. Much less the clash of too many people and cultures in too close of quarters. Case in Point: Joseph and Shannon from Ireland. I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. Many had commented that they didn't care for it. I found the actors and actresses to be very believable in their parts and accents. I must agree that this is one of Tom Cruise's best roles. I was very moved by the various positions the leading man and lady were placed in. I felt every blow that Joseph received, I wanted to slap Shannon for her sharp tongue. I wanted to cry at scenes, I laughed at many. I found the music to speak volumes and was pleasantly surprised that John Williams was the composer. There were a few Schindler's List notes, but not enough to subtract or distract in the least from the film. The sweeping shots of both Ireland and Oklahoma with their openness contrasted by the closed closeness of the city made you feel closed in and dead-ended. You can even nearly smell the rank stench of men, the filth of the streets and the sweat of the oppressed. Very seldom do I find a movie that actually 'speaks' to each of my senses as this film does. Go ahead, pop it in and step back in time. Perhaps, you would also care to bring some modern tissues with you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far and Away is a beautiful film that was executed perfectly by Ron Howard who co-wrote a brilliant screenplay about Irish immigrants searching for a better life in America due to the oppression they had to endure at the hands of greedy landlords in the late 1890's. Joseph Donnelly - played by Tom Cruise in one of his unforgettable roles - is a poor farmer with ambitions of having his own land, he seeks revenge after his father dies as result of a riot initiated by the tenants against the rich land owners. He flees Ireland with the help of a spoiled rich girl who has dreams of owning her own land in the Oklahoma territory. Both Joseph and Shannon experience the hardships of achieving their dreams in a distant country as they rely on each other for survival while living in Boston where Joseph earns his living as a boxing champion. The love story and the grand race are perfect elements in this epic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story about Irish immigrants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very entertaining movie about Joseph and Shannon who you see go from rural Ireland to Boston and eventually to Oklahoma for the great land rush. Cruise and Kidman as the two leads had great chemistry together in this movie. When they first come to America Joseph was just a poor potato farmer while Kidman was from a rich family and Joseph had to serve as her servant while on the ship over the Atlantic. But once they come to America Shannon gets robbed and they're forced to stay in the same living quarters. Shannon is stuck working in a bad job in a chicken factory while Joseph attains a small bit of success as a scrappy bare knuckle boxer. But after a few bad things happen to them and they're homeless living in the street they get separated. They eventually meet up again in Oklahoma for the great land rush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>land is a man's soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"land is a man's soul." this is a sentence from JOE's father. And in my opinion, it's the main idea of this movie.This movie started with a provocative scene, JOE wanted to avenge for his farther's death. Unfortunately, he failed and he met Nicole inadvertently. They went to Boston and chased their land dream.During their live in Boston, there were much bitterness. They had to earn money by themselves, also prepared for the race on their own fund. It is really tough time and trip.I really love this movie. It seems like a historical movie, but there were lots of good thought, idea and beautiful scenery in it. I think it is a kind of old-fashioned movie, but it is also a classic movie.In this movie, I saw beautiful plain, stream, and mountains. And I can feel American west life indirectly.It is totally different from modern city life. I also saw American spirit in this movie, American's independence, self-reliance and can-do spirit. When they were suffering misery, they were sad but they will be optimistic and bounce back soon.Nicole's and Tom's acting in this movie is great. Nicole was adorable in this movie. Tom was very handsome.They accurately expressed an upset emotion when they arrived Boston. In addition, they also brought audience a very romantic love. Overall, it is a great movie. good actors, good scenery, and good story. And it is tightly related with American history. Also good for study!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch the film of Far and Away, this film is explanation a youngster, born in Ireland, named Cruise. The people of the land were exploiting by the landlord. One day, his father was killed indirect by his landlord, approaching his father's end, his father told him: A man is count for nothing if he doesn't have land, land is one's spirit. He remembers and prepares to avenge, when he gone to kill the landlord, he was coincident to cognition a girl, named Kidman was landlord's daughter. Then because of his action, he was put in chains, and then Kidman don't want to married with a man, so Cruise and Kidman were run, and arrived to Boston. In order to make living, they worked in a chicken factory, but Cruise want to make more money to buy a land, so he begin to boxing, he was good at it, and make some money, after competition with a Italy boxing coach, he failed and out of his house and separate with Kidman. Cruise started to be a worker in a stone pit, and work hard. Then he went to the Oklahoma territory, and meets Kidman. Follow on, the people plan to have a competitive, who riding the first quickly and put the flag in the land, the land is his. At the end, Cruise won the competitive and got love with Kidman. Firstly, in the film, the young man Cruise was a American frontier, although he suffer many challenge, but he never give up, he have a kind of brave that others don't have, in the beginning we can see, he was brave to revenge, brave struggle, and he have a goal and never give up that even suffer many challenges, it is a America self-reliance, he trust he can do anything and sure he can do well for it. Second, I find Americans were individualism, when Cruise help his boss to boxing and make money, his boss was friendly to him, but when Cruise lose the competitive, his boss was let he out of the house, however Cruise was hurt serious. They don't care another; themselves were the first of all. Third, Americans have an equality opportunity, in the end of the film, I see they use competitive to decision the land pertain to whose. Before the beginning, a man want to forestall run, he was killing by the judgments people. Fair is important for Americans, however you are poor or rich, if you hard work and win in the end, people will praise you. In my opinion, the film obvious is an American Frontier film, in the film, it is accurate the individualism, self-reliance and equality of opportunity to me. I can easily understand what the film want to told me, Cruise have a firm goal, and straight to go forward it, finally achieved. It is encourage to me, I know, if I want succeed, I need insist and never give up, opportunity is grasp in my hand, I need catch it activity, waiting will make me lose. A strong inward is a necessary factor of succeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all cheesiness, a lot of psychologically weird acting characters and some odd conversations, I had a lot of fun watching. The movie had a quite nice story, great actors, amazing atmosphere, good music and a great set. I really hate psychologically unconvincing acting characters and corniness in movies ? the same goes for unfitting endings. If all this wouldn't have been part of the movie, I might have rated the movie with 9 points. As it is, I am not sure if I want to give this film 6 or 7 points. If I could, I'd give it 6.5 points... - I decided 7 points because of my love for Nicole Kidman and all the great fun I had watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Cruise Does Romantic Dramas Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw "Far and Away" the first time and it blew me away. I don't know that it was the best story line, or the best movie I ever saw but I as astounded by Cruises performance. I fell in love with his character, Joseph. I'm disappointed that he hasn't done more films that are period pieces or romantic. Maybe it is being presumptuous to say that Cruise is best and romantic dramas, but with the exception of "Top Gun" and "Rain-Man," in my opinion, the rest of his movies are okay. I would love to see him do more dramatic films that aren't overly twisted or contrived. Though he's probably best known for his action movies, like "Mission Impossible," and he does well in them, I find that they limit him as an actor and don't show him as the talent that he is. But I do understand that he might just be in a different place in his life and career. I wish him the best. If you love drama, romance, and Tom Cruise, I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"His best friend is a talking pie!" "Sold! Howard, you've done it again!" (cue Happy Days theme) from The SimpsonsI didn't have such terrible memories of Far and Away, last seen when I was little more than a kid - probably for a number of factors, including John Williams' slick soundtrack, Enya's memorable Book of Days, my schoolboy crush for the young and radiant redhead Nicole Kidman... and mostly for the premise of the Oklahoma Land Rush, a fascinating topic.Watching it as an adult, Far and Away is bad. Being a Ron Howard movie, emotions register with the subtlety of a stampede of buffaloes; the camera swoops around emphatically, rotates, takes flight; character moments are corny, comedic scenes juvenile. People complain about, say, Spielberg's populism and lack of sophistication... but, compared to Howard, good ol' Steven is as thematically dense and thought-provoking as Stanley Kubrick.Kidman and Cruise, who later became competent (in Kidman's case even great) performers, here are just coasting on their looks. Cruise in particular attempts an Irish accent which sounds like he has a moribund but petulant leprechaun stuck in his larynx.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has put out a lot of crap since the seventies and I am disgusted with so much of the low brow crap that people think is entertaining these days. I bet Shirley Temple and most of the Acadamy award winning movies of yesteryear would be rejected today by most vulgar minded audiences; how sad. However, Hollywood has produced some of the finest films since the 70s also, Patton, Forest Gump, Titanic, Mrs. Pettygrew Lives for a Day, Saving Privet Rayan and many others to numerous to list and including Far and Away. Beautifully done in a classic and family quality Golden tradition of Hollywoods best. Unfortunately todays audiences need full frontal Porn and the F-word used as the main dialog to get a rise out of younger folks. I'm no prude. I served in the Navy on submarines and can use language that would make a Marine squirm with disgust. There is a place for everything, but for me great films are not that place. I think Far and Away is one of those rare films that didn't get it's just due from the public but it will always have a place on my Top 25 list of the best films ever made, just like Forest Gump; also a Ron Howard film. God help us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Cruise gets stabbed with a pitchfork and covers testicles with soup bowl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kitsch is the absolute denial of sh-t." - Milan Kundera "Far and Away" was dismissed when it was initially released. The problem audiences and critics had at the time was recognising the film as a comedy, mistaking its lush visuals and epic story for some kind of self-important David Lean imitation.These perceptions are largely the fault of Steven Spielberg. Spielberg invented a kind of kitschy David Lean style with "The Colour Purple" and "Empire of the Sun", which infected a bevy of Hollywood films in the late 80s and early 90s (just watch Oliver Stone's "Heaven and Earth"). When Ron Howard ? whose career oscillates between solid thrillers and hack art - released "Far and Away", everyone viewed it through the prism of some kitschy Spielbergian epic, John Williams score and all. In short: the film looked and felt like an idiotic movie, yet was marketed as a serious, beautifully shot and hugely expensive epic. How could anyone take it seriously? Viewed decades later, though, and its clear that the film relishes its own stupidity. With the benefit of hindsight, and with audiences now familiar with mega-stars Tom Cruise (Tropic Thunder, Magnolia) and Nicole Kidman (Australia) as comedians, we can now recognise "Far and Away" as the funny and unpretentious version of "Titanic", "Australia" and "Gangs of New York".And so this zippy film darts back and forth, indulging in all kinds of caricatures (Irish as drunks, boxers, red heads etc), clichés and shenanigans, but embracing them wholeheartedly and never taking itself too seriously. How can it, when it features Tom Cruise riding a donkey?7.5/10 ? Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play a funny odd couple, both lending charisma and humour to a familiar tale (The film also stars Thomas Gibson. Cruise, Gibson and Kidman would be similarly cast in Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut"). The film fails when it tries to be serious and dramatic but its pace, comedy and style more than make up for this, Ron Howard's elaborate sets, costumes and carnivals of colourful citizens complementing Cruise's Celtic character and conjuring up the cavalcades of con-men, crooks and charlatans common in the countless chronicles of Charles Dickens. Capiche? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Adventures of Joseph and Shannon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a fairy tale. Not like "The Quiet Man" anyway. It's the straightforward tale of two Irish folks -- Joseph Donnelly (Tom Cruise) and Shannon Christie (Nicole Kidman). There are three dramatic episodes: the miseries in the Ireland of 1898 where everyone is subject to the English landlord's whim, a spell in the poor Irish ghetto of Boston where Tom and Nicole share a sex-free room and Tom makes some money fist fighting for the ward boss, and finally the excitement of the Oklahoma land rush when Tom and Nicole, having earlier gone their separate ways, are united and in possession of "the land".The Irish, they are a funny race. No, really. They have a quaint, almost fey, way with words and language in general. It's not elegant, but sometimes it amounts almost to folk poetry. A couple of examples that come to mind: (1) If a stranger enters a saloon and asks if Michael Murphy comes here, the barkeep is liable to respond, "That name has a lot of usage in Ireland." ("Shake Hands With the Devil.") (2) Of a departed friend, "He was a grand man entirely." ("The Last Hurrah.") (3) Of a poor little boy, "He hasn't a shoe to his foot." ("Angela's Ashes.") (4) If an angry crowd waits outside for a man, he's liable to say, "I'll leave later by the back, pendin' the coolin' of their ardor." ("Up the Rebels".) (5) Of a drunken failure, "He has a great future behind him." (Joyce's "Ulysses".) No wonder that underpopulated little island has produced so many poets and novelists of note.Let me get back on track, though, this comment not being a doctoral dissertation. Where was I? Yes, Cruise and Kidman on the prowl. They're okay. And the dramatic episodes aren't too disturbing because we know that the lovers will wind up together and still living. This is a Ron Howard movie after all, and he's as dependable in this regard as Rob Reiner.Even the fist fights that Cruise is so well paid for in Boston are almost reassuring in their own quiet way. Cruise gets to show off his definition. Many of the punches land in slow motion so we can see the blood dripping like heavy oil from Cruise's lips, just as in "Raging Bull." And Cruise walks away from all these bare-knuckled fights with his nose intact and nary a scratch, whereas in real life he'd be toothless and his features would resemble a relief map of Waziristan.Nobody gets seriously hurt for that matter. The three Donnelly brothers have a hell of a good time punching each other full force in the kisser and engaging in unbuttoned laughter at the same time. I don't think Ron Howard or his writer could ever have been in a fist fight in the schoolyard or they'd know one blow can start a cascade of gore.The movie begins with a score led by a pennywhistle that is sentimental and nostalgic for the Auld Sod. During the climactic land rush, it switches to generic "epic adventure." Under the end credits we hear an up-beat tune by somebody like Enya, full of echoing chorus and percussion. That last bit is emblematic of the entire movie, both hauntingly pretty and mood stirring -- easy listening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those not so well made movies, you just love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not a classic film, "Far and Away" still has a definite allure. The story is romanticized to the fullest extent and is a relatively poor depiction of the era, but it is fun to watch and has a little bit of something for everyone. If one is objective of the quality of this epic film, then it must be recognized that while it falls far short of other epic movies like "Braveheart", "Lawrence of Arabia", and "Giant", it nevertheless is more appealing than other epics like "Cleopatra" and "Spartacus". For my money the best part of the movie is the beginning, when Kidman and Cruise are in Ireland. After the two leave the island, a good deal of the plot gives way to action. Still, the movie is enjoyable throughout. The film depicts the normative view of the era rather than a dusty historical, descriptive view. So, if you want a history of immigration and western settlement, then try another film. If, however, you want a fun movie that paints a gild-edged portrait, then you should definitely check out this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watching the movie (08-04-06) and i still love it. This movie contains a lot of different aspects. The one that is obvious - is of course love. So passionate.. the path is full of obstacles like pride, principals. We all know how hard is to break them, but for the one you love... :) On the other hand - this movie shows that it wasn't easy to live your own life on that period of time. Discrimination, cruelty etc. I found one more line: that it is important to have a dream in your life. If a person does have it, it's so much easier to bear all those down low periods that we all have every now and then. Both actors (Cruise, Kidman) are 100 % belonging to this movie. It leaves the small hope that perhaps there actually IS love like this in the world. just have to look harder :p</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the movie up to the very end. It's full of romance and suspense but the end really let me down. It was so stupid and cheesy. I mean, come on, let the man die or don't have him die at all, but to bring him back to life. And then after he comes back to life (after this fatal wound) he jumps right up, kisses Nicole, and together they plant their little flag in the ground. ARG It was so upsetting that I could not sleep. Could they not make up their mind on how to end it? Where they arguing about it and then decided to put them both in? I would really love to know the logic behind the ending. Everything other than that was just wonderful about the movie, but they totally ruined it in the last minutes...and those are the most important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set In Rural Ireland in the 19th Century, Young Irishman Joseph Donelly (Cruise) is facing eviction from his land after the death of his father. While seeking revenge on their rich protestant landlord, he meets the spoilt and rebellious daughter Shannon Christy (Kidman) and ends up tagging along when she runs away to 'modern' America. Misfortune leads them both to a poor part of Boston and they both dream of someday owning their own land, separately of course as each denies their obvious attraction to the other.Blatantly obvious continuity errors make this 'film' look like a home movie shot by children and edited by a monkey. As someone who is Irish, the accents by both the leads were unbearable and over the top, as well as several occasions when Tom's American accent emerges. The acting was overly bad, the characters completely uninteresting, the storyline long-winded and predictable, and the script thoroughly stupid. Stupid is the word I would use to describe this movie, as everything from the plot, to the editing was utterly stupid. I'd hate to see what a historian of this time period would think of this film, as it doesn't seem to be researched at all. According to the goofs on IMDb, American flags used in the movie had 50 stars, when at the time the official flag had only 44. But, because movies are essentially to entertain, not to be analysed, I gave this movie two stars more than it deserves because it does to a certain point, entertain. But more so from parts like when Kidman falls into the mud and comes out sparkling clean a moment later, than the parts of the movie that are meant to be entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it much better as an adult (shh, don't tell anyone)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1992 and directed by Ron Howard, "Far and Away" stars Tom Cruise as a young, grieving Irishman, full of spit and vinegar, who leaves for the new world with his landlord's daughter (Nicole Kidman). After arriving in Boston they acquire jobs with Joseph (Cruise) moonlighting as a bare-hands boxer. Eventually, the girl's parents and Joseph's nemesis arrive from Ireland looking for her (Robert Prosky, Barbara Babcock &amp; Thomas Gibson). The story ends with the Oklahoma land rush of 1893. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie when it was released in '92 and I found myself somewhat disappointed by it at the theater. Seeing it again almost 25 years later, I like it a lot better, probably because I'm mature and this is a movie that appeals more to adults because it's not a conventional Western, but rather a historical drama/adventure/western/romance. The opening is still weak, but once Joseph leaves his Irish homestead (around the 12-15 minute mark) the movie captured my interest and never let up till the end.I appreciate that the romance is a slow-build and there's no premature sex sequence. In lesser hands they would've been copulating at the half-hour mark. Instead, we observe Joseph tastefully fantasizing about Shannon (Nicole) in the third act. Michelle Johnson as one of the dancing girls is a highlight and IMHO significantly more beautiful than the overrated Kidman. I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie is. The film runs 140 minutes and was shot in Ireland; Billings, Montana (the land rush); and Oklahoma.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this years ago and really enjoying it, this time around not so much. Its okay, entertaining. The accents (with just about everyone concerned) are terrible and the plot does get a bit overblown and silly at times, actually the whole tone of this movie was a bit silly which I don't remember from before.Despite it all though, still an enjoyable enough movie. Episodic in its western frontier telling, with many adventures, decent period details and some grand scenes i.e. the land rush which is shot on a huge scale with hundreds of extras, horses and wagons and stunts galore.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman do a decent enough job with their roles, not much chemistry though for an (at the time) real life couple. I enjoyed Tom in some of the boxing scenes and Robert Prosky was lovely as Shannon's Da.The story follows an impoverished 1893 Irish tenant farmer who has recently lost his home and his father. Through a series of somewhat witty events he runs off to America with his spirited landlords daughter. They arrive in Boston with barely more than the shirts on their backs, pose as brother and sister (while falling in love) and struggle for the American dream, which in this case also includes joining the Oklahoma land rush. 9/23/15</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like comedies. I like dramas. I like comedies that have a bit of drama in them. I like dramas that have a little comedy in them. But what I don't like are films that can't make up their mind about whether they are basically a comedy or a drama. And that's my problem with this film.The film starts out with Joseph Donnelly, a young Irishman, whose father is killed and whose house is burned down. Okay, it's a drama. Then he decides to take revenge against the landlord, but instead of killing him gets pitchforked, his gun explodes in his face, the landlord's daughter peeks at his penis under a wash basin (yes, really), and he is forced to participate in a duel in dense fog. Okay, it's a comedy. Meanwhile, the landlord's daughter wants to be free, and decides to go to America for the free land, persuades the young Irishman to go with her...in the middle of that duel...they end up on a ship and are cheated by a thief. Hmmmm, is this a drama or a comedy? In America, Cruise becomes a barehands boxer, while Shannon works in a chicken processing plant. I loved watching Cruise get beat to a pulp, even if it only was a movie. Joseph and Shannon are banished in the middle of winter. Okay, it's a drama. Eventually, Shannon, her parents, her old Irish fiancé and Cruise all end up at the Oklahoma Territory just in time for the big land race, and this is clearly the best segment of the film...quite impressive.I've never really enjoyed Tom Cruise as an actor, and even less so after his meltdown period. Nevertheless, I admit he has acting ability. Unfortunately, I didn't find him very convincing here, although he appeared to be riding his own horse, and impressively, if not smoothly, and in the death scene he was quite impressive. Nicole Kidman is so young here that she's almost unrecognizable. She does fairly well. I had only been familiar with Colm Meaney in the AMC series "Hell On Wheels", so it was interesting to see him here as a rather unsavory Irishman...and he's good if not agreeable. I enjoyed Robert Prosky as Kidman's father.Ron Howard is a pretty impressive director, but personally I don't see this as one of his best. But it's a decent film and worth watching...once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Irish Immigrants In The 1890's America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far and Away is an adventure-drama-romance epic film. It stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as Irish immigrants' early life while seeking fortune in America during the 1890's.The film is directed by Ron Howard.The story starts when Joseph Donnelly (Tom Cruise),a hot-headed young Irishman whose home was burned after his father's death, decides to take revenge on the landlord, Daniel Christie (Robert Prosky).In his attempt to kill him however,he is discovered by Daniel's daughter,Shannon Christie (Nicole Kidman) and is injured by her when he tries to escape. While injured he continues his plans to kill his landlord, but his weapon malfunctions.Held captive while they treat his wounds, Joseph tries to escape the house and is caught by Stephen Chase (Thomas Gibson),the landlord's manager, who had earlier burned the Donnelly house.Joseph spits on Stephen in anger and, disgraced, Stephen challenges Joseph to a duel of pistols at dawn. Meanwhile, Shannon, also Stephen's love interest, is growing dissatisfied with the traditional views of her parents' generation and longs to be modern, even going as far as to intentionally disgust her mother and their friends by playing American music on the piano. She makes plans to leave for America to claim land that's being given away for free.She makes her plans to leave for America, and with her help, Joseph is able to escape.Overall,the film was more about coincidences.That provided less excitement and entertainment despite of presenting itself as a historical epic film.At the same time,the characters of Tom Cruise namely Joseph Donnelly and Nicole Kidman namely Shannon Cristie lacked on-screen chemistry despite of being spouses during that time the film was made.That made the romance part of the film less convincing.Aside from that,the movie was simply a film shot to entertain fans of both Cruise and Kidman after they have exchanged their wedding vows. Added to that,the script of Ron Howard and Bob Dolman was predictable from beginning to end.It definitely wasn't the best work of Cruise,Kidman and Howard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Far and Away" is a pretty decent love story between two people who have seemingly nothing in common. All the way through this movie I thought it was good, but not once during this movie did I feel it was anything above that. When I read the description on Netflix, it said that it was "Ron Howard's epic drama." That usually leads me to believe that it is universally thought of as a great film. This is not the case.Tom Cruise is solid in this role, as is Nicole Kidman. I have seen both in better performances, but they were both good here. The story went along, and it was fine the whole way through, but again, it never really seemed to step out of second gear.I suppose I would recommend this if someone wanted to see a love story involving Irish born immigrants coming to America, but there are better movies out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, its All About Tom And Nickole,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Possible Spoilers** In 1892 Ireland, the son of a poor farmer forms an unlikely alliance with the daughter of a wealthy landowner, in `Far and Away,' a romantic adventure directed by Ron Howard, and starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. When his father dies, and an agent of the landlord to whom back rent is owed burns their modest home to the ground, Joseph Donnelly (Cruise) vows revenge. Armed with an ancient, rusty rifle, he travels to the estate of the landowner, Daniel Christie (Robert Prosky), intending to shoot him. But his plans to settle the score quickly go awry; as he draws a bead on Christie and pulls the trigger, the rifle explodes in his face. Christie takes him into his home to treat his wounds, and there Joseph catches the eye of Christie's daughter, Shannon (Kidman). The lad, she notes, has pluck, and he's obviously a scrapper; and she immediately sees him as the means by which she can effect her dream of running away to America, where they are giving land away for free (or so says the ad she has ripped from a newspaper). She realizes that such an undertaking would be impossible for a woman traveling alone, but with a man such as Joseph along to tend to her needs and offer protection, it could be done. Circumstances prevail in her favor, and soon the two of them are off, covertly, with the plan being to land in Boston, then head west to the Oklahoma Territory, where Shannon will be able to claim her land. Of course, Joseph sees land in it for himself, as well. They hit a snag, however, upon landing in Boston; Shannon's silver spoons, stolen from her mother, and with which the trek west was to be financed, are stolen from her, leaving them without means. With some help, they manage to find affordable accommodations (a room at a local bordello), and Shannon finds work in a factory. Meanwhile, Joseph finds he can make some money by prizefighting at one of the local pubs, under sponsorship of a man named Kelly (Colm Meaney), the `connected' Irishman of the town. It's enough to keep them going, temporarily, but the question is, can they make it to Oklahoma in time for the `land rush' of 1893?Cruise gives a credible performance here as Joseph, complete with a passable Irish accent, and he has a natural, charismatic persona that comes across so well on film. Kidman, too, fares well with her portrayal of Shannon; her accent is good, and the camera likes her. And, of course, there's a real chemistry between them. Howard has crafted a visually handsome movie, with a good story told in a predominately straight forward manner. There's not a lot of surprises, and much of it is predictable, beyond mere foreshadowing, but the pace is brisk and the characters are alive, which keeps it all interesting. Also, there's a touch of humor thrown in at appropriate junctures, which helps to offset the dramatics, maintain a positive atmosphere, and keep it all from becoming too sullen.The cinematography is especially notable, particularly early on, when capturing some of the lush vistas of Ireland, and later during the `land rush' sequence. The performances are good all around, and the excellent supporting cast includes Thomas Gibson (Steven), Barbara Babcock (Nora Christie), Cyril Cusack (Danty Duff) and Michelle Johnson (Grace). `Far and Away' is well made and delivered, and, most importantly, it's an entertaining movie; perhaps not one of the most memorable Howard has made, but it's an enjoyable film, and well worth seeing. All in all, it makes for a pleasant night at the movies. I rate this one 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "Far and Away"(1992) gives audiences the opportunity to watch a well constructed, entertaining romance. It offers content suitable for everyone in the family. Although a few scenes do depict violence, the movie flows well based upon strong characterizations, and the confrontations which do occur move the story forward at a rapid pace. Probably even young children will enjoy this wonderful movie."Far and Away" offers some very beautiful, scenic backgrounds. These panoramas lend an element of interest also to events. The historical drama unfolds during an era of turbulent growth in many parts of the United States. The interactions among the central characters resonate with this influence. The beginning and ending scenes provide a unifying theme running through the entire production. If you are seeking an enjoyable family film-- this may be the right choice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far and Away was okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Far and Away last year, for the first time in years. The first half of the film follows the angles of "poor boy falls in love with the rich girl", and the "forbidden relationship" that causes the "poor boy and rich girl" to flee the "old country." The second half is the story of the struggles of the young couple trying to settle in a new land. Yes, it's a little bit dramatic at times, and it has the foundations of a good, well-told story, but only when played right without being over the top. Nicole Kidman did a lovely job, and she made the role of Shannon her own; she was really believable. Thomas Gibson's portrayal of Stephen, the main antagonist, was just brilliant. He excellently played that kind of "bad guy" viewers really just love to hate! The cinematography was beautiful, as was the sweeping views of the Land Rush. Ron Howard did a great job in showing the audience an epic drama.On the downside, I could not get over the film's end conflict: Joseph (Tom Cruise) was supposed to die, right? He fights Stephen in a big showdown, falls and gets trampled by horses, and he hits his head hard on a rock, which looked like it should have been fatal. Joseph fades out, and Shannon weeps. Yet, he miraculously springs back to life because Shannon tells Joseph that she loves him? What? That ending is over the top, and a little too absurdly overdone for my tastes. Another thing, although it's minor: the name of Nicole Kidman's character. The name "Shannon" just sounds a little too modern for the 1890's, sort of like having a girl being named "Courtney" in a movie set in the Civil War. Finally, I tried very hard, but still could not get past Joseph's accent. That was a huge minus for me; to me, Joseph sounded more like Forrest Gump than a poor Irish lad. Sorry Tom, you were much more believable as Maverick on Top Gun! Nonetheless, it was still a good film that's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME MAJOR SPOILERS - DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE FILMThe first time I saw Far and Away I caught it about half-way through, and couldn't stop laughing at the brilliantly fake Irish "accents". Cruise in particular is a real leprechaun, so he is, begorrah, and the OTT "floating death scene" is risible.I tuned in a second time for a laughterfest of colossal proportions, only to find I actually quite enjoyed it. It's not subtle, of course. Shannon (the very pretty Kidman) and Joseph (Cruise) are runaways from the horrors of Ireland, intent on making a new life in America. Opposites, their inevitable attraction begins when Shannon looks at Joseph's genitals from underneath a mixing bowl. This level of gentle symbolism continues with a scene where they secretly admire each other's arse, and concludes with Kidman asking "Joseph, am I beautiful at all?" In fact, their romance never seems to be based against anything other than their libidos, Kidman's character being a spoilt rich brat who merely likes a bit of rough.The turn of the 19th century setting (1892-93 to be exact) is nicely evoked, though perhaps in all honestly the sets and clothes always carry an artificial air. There's some scenes of truly sickening violence as the film tackles the unusual subject ? for Hollywood particularly ? of bare knuckle fist-fighting. Colm Meaney plays a real meanie (sorry) who acts as Joseph's boxing manager. When Joseph loses a bout, Meaney takes the only option available to him ? gets Joseph beaten up, slaps Shannon around and steals all their money before throwing them out onto the street. The major villain though, is, predictably, English, with Nicole's estranged fiance (Thomas Gibson) following them to the US in hot pursuit.Direction, while not bad for Richie Cunningham, is never revolutionary, but then the constraints of the story temper it with difficulties. Wherever the two go they always seem to be robbed, beaten or shot ? even Tom's horse drops dead the day he buys it. These two are so unlucky they'd get run over fifty times just on a trip to the chemist's. Why, maybe they shoulda tried kissing the wee Blarney stone for o' bit o' Irish luck, to be sure. Sorry, Tom Cruiseitis came over me there."All the land in the world means nothing to me without you", he says in one of the more nauseating lines. And when you see Tom die and yet miraculously come back to life because Nicole tells him she loves him, you'll realise that this film is a complete load of rubbish. Yet somehow, inexplicably, it's a very entertaining complete load of rubbish. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tha land iz moine!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, I couldn't resist.But really, that somewhat egregious quote (splattered over all of the trailers to boot) is part of what was wrong with the movie. That Cruise's outrageously exaggerated Irish accent is claimed to be authentic may be the case -- however much I'm an Irish-Catholic Bostonian, I don't pretend to having heard many 19th century Irishmen speak. But as one exasperated science fiction author stated, defending his use of metres and feet as measurements, he knows full well that a thousand years in the future people will have whacky units of measurement, but he's writing stories for 21st century English-speaking readers.In like fashion, Ron Howard was making a movie for 20th century viewers, and a bit less of a laughable accent would have made for a better movie. Then again, this reasonably nice flick would have been a lot better if it hadn't borne quite the weight of expectation: Cruise! Kidman! Howard! Done with less of a notion of creating a blockbuster with A-list actors, I would have been happier with it.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some would make out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been almost universally panned, and it certainly has major flaws.For one, it's too long without being 'epic' enough to sustain the length. Also Tom Cruise's occasional attempts at being funny and Irish just don't come off. And cliche is piled upon cliche and coincidence upon coincidence, just to make the story work. But some of the criticisms seem unfounded to me. OK, Cruise and Kidman don't really control their destinies - but who does? Yes, they're pushed from one situation to another - but who isn't? And they do, on certain occasions, make significant decisions which change their future.One fault of the DVD and video is not the film's: it does really need to be seen on a huge screen to help it work, particularly the final land-race sequences. And Nicole Kidman is as always excellent, with just the right amount of feistiness and yet also vulnerability.All in all, a good piece of entertainment, but some tweaking of the storyline would have helped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people say that Tom Cruises Irish accent is a main draw back to the film but i don't think it is bad at all. The film has a good love story throughout and there are a few funny lines and happenings along the way too. What makes the film is the superb locations and scenery chosen for the film. Shot in 70mm, the action and scenery in the screen is life like is you are lucky enough to catch a genuine 70mm screening of the film. But if you see it in 35mm you will be impressed as the detail form the 70mm film when transfered to 35mm is far greater than any 35mm photographed film. Hence the DVD looks better than most too.Overall i can recommend this film as great entertainment and its worth seeing for the end Land Race sequence, with the thousands of extras used for the one scene alone.Darren</fullReview>

As an Irish person, I cringe every time either Cruise or Kidman opens their mouths and that DREADFUL attempt at an Irish accent comes out. I also find it laughable that this film gives the notion that in Ireland at the end of the 19th century, a member of the aristocracy could quite easily run away with a peasant boy and head of to the good 'ole US of A to start their lives again. Avoid unless you subscribe to the fairytale vision of Ireland that Holywood likes to pump out every few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this first came out I knew I had to see it, bad film or not, (I think it's good) because I'm half Irish and my ancestors basically did the same thing as Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. They immigrated from Ireland over to New York during the potato famine. I think this is a truly beautiful film. When you have love stories such as this one, I think it works so much better when the two "lovers" slowly build up their relationship throughout the film, so you're constantly thinking will they or won't they? I don't really like Tom Cruise as a rule but I do think he plays his character well. I do think Nicole Kidman is a superb actress and she shines in this movie, I think much more then her husband. I love the way Ron Howard shows the different locations in such a beautful way. From the misty cliffs of Ireland, (God that sounds tacky!!) to the dirty glamour of New York, to the lush outdoor wilderness of Oklahoma. All in all this is a great film with John Williams genius score making it all bthe much better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Land Makes The Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The historic Oklahoma land rush of the 1890s serves as the focal point for director Ron Howard's "Far and Away," an ambitious, sprawling, romantic adventure epic co-starring Tom Cruise &amp; Nicole Kidman. Cruise plays Joseph Donnelly, son of a poor, debt-ridden, illiterate Irish tenant farmer who dies at the outset of the movie. During the 1890s, the landowners burdened these unfortunate tenant farmers with staggering taxes. Cruise's father is fatally injured when he protests. Before he dies, he convinces Cruise that land makes the man. Cruise sets out to kill the landowner responsible for his father's death. Meanwhile, Kidman is cast as Shannon Christie, the feisty, rebellious daughter of the landowner that Cruise is determined to kill. Her mother has already mapped out her daughter's life and wants to make a fine, proper lady of her. Kidman has other ideas. She dreams of escaping to America where she can be modern, get free land and raise horses.Donnelly shows up at her estate and tries to kill Shannon's poppa Daniel Christie played by "Hill Street Blues" scene stealer Robert Prosky. Donnelly's rifle blows up in his face, and he winds up under house arrest. Later, he insults Stephen Chase (Thomas Gibson of "Eyes Wide Shut"), the stuck-up gent Shannon is supposed to wed and is challenged to a duel. Stephen is the mustached villain that torched Donnelly's farm, so there's already bad blood between them. Shannon begs Donnelly to flee with her to America. Reluctantly, Donnelly follows Shannon instead of shooting it out with the dastardly Stephen."Backdraft" director Ron Howard spends nearly two and a half hours in this synthetic saga getting them out of Ireland, across the Atlantic to Boston, and then eventually out to Oklahoma. "Far And Away" celebrates the resilient pioneering spirit of our Irish immigrants and the racial obstacles that they encounter in America. Audiences, however, do not go to the movies to get history lessons; they go to be entertained. What Howard does best here is situate their shiny clean scrubbed faces amid the visual splendors of the Emerald Isle and the rugged American frontier. The most interesting scenes occur on an ersatz back lot Boston set. When Donnelly and Shannon arrive in America, thieves pinch the heirlooms she planned to hock to pay for her passage west. Circumstances force them to masquerade as brother and sister while they remain in Boston. Donnelly resorts to bare knuckles brawling to earn money, while Shannon suffers in a sweat shop plucking chickens. Our pretty lead runs afoul of the powers-that-be and winds up in the wintry streets without either food or shelter. Adversity cements their love for each other. Suddenly, Stephen shows up in America, twirling his evil mustache and searching for Shannon.Director Ron Howard and "Willow" scenarist Bob Dolman provide neither depth nor substance to their characters. Cruise and Kidman are about as mismatched a couple as you can imagine. The cliché that opposites attract must account for their courtship. "Far And Away" amounts to nothing more than a hare-brained Harlequin romance. The problem is that Cruise and Kidman are as bland as Ken and Barbie dolls. There is nothing distinctive, much less interesting about their misadventures. When they have to shack up in a cathouse in Boston as brother and sister, the movie sticks to his prudish PG-13 guidelines. So don't look for any sparks to fly.Cruise accents his performance with a credible Irish brogue. Nevertheless, like Kidman, he looks ill-suited to the demands of a historical drama. Cruise should stick to contemporary dramas where his streamlined 20th century matinée looks and hunk physique make him look at home behind a race car or a navy jet. Director Ron Howard engulfs them in a sea of interesting faces which makes them look even more out-of-place! Of course, nobody goes to a Tom Cruise movie to watch him act, much less evolve as a character. The same is true for the statuesque Nicole Kidman. The idea that either one might let something as ungainly as a wrinkle crinkle their magazine cover faces is unlikely. The measure of Thomas Gibson's villainy is that Cruise dunks him in a river rather than doing him in. This is even after the rascal pulled a pistol on him!Howard deserves an A for ambition. He has spared no expense in staging the great land rush scene. "Backdraft" lenser Mikael Salomon's aerial camera-work captures the breath-taking scope of this historic episode. The production values look authentic enough to please an antique dealer. Audiences that thrive on sweeping, weeping melodrama as shallow as a bedpan should get their fill with "Far And Away."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't Quite Add Up to the Sum of It's Parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far and Away (dir. Ron Howard) is an unusual beast. For all it's fantastic element, it remains a confoundedly unsatisfying film experience. Special mention must go to a young Nicole Kidman for basically carrying the film on her pail waif like shoulders. Her Irish accent is impeccable and she really projects the wide eyed polished woman lost in a rugged, dirty new land. Tom Cruise however is smarmy, sleazy and all to pleased with himself as he manages to grip a slight hold on his excruciating accent. The greater elements of the film (it's cinematography, production design and music) are not enough to cover the awful script which has Cruise uttering the words "Your a corker Shannon". Such lines make some moments of the film almost unbearable. One thing i must mention, however is this: If any film came close to being completely saved by one scene, it is this one. The climactic Oklahoma land race is a testament to Howard and is one of the reasons why movies are made. John Williams vibrant and exhilarating score (one of the best and most underrated of his career) brings out the excitement and discovery of the race and is the film's crowning achievement. It's too bad the score and the race scene couldn't be surrounded by a better film because for most of it's running time and despite the efforts of Kidman, the film remains a disappointing failure.As I mentioned above, one thing that doesn't disappoint is the soundtrack. I urge you to buy it if you can. It also features music by The Chieftains and the fantastic "Book of Days" performed by Enya.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The year is 1892 and Irish immigrants Joseph Donnelly (Tom Cruise) and Shannon (Nicole Kidman) have arrived at a shipping port in Boston, greeted by enticing faces who offer them jobs and safety...for a price.Joseph has used Shannon to help cross the Atlantic; there's a long prologue in which their characters are set up. Essentially they become a romantic couple as time progresses, even though they're very different from each other - Joseph being from a poor upbringing and Shannon from a prosperous one.Joseph gets a job as a boxer for the local Irish ghetto warden boss, while Shannon becomes a dancer/stripper at one of the warden's bars.The movie was directed by Ron Howard and was one of those post-marriage Cruise/Kidman movies. It got some hype when it came out, and then it died.Props must be given - direction is good and the sets are realistic. It really evokes the late 19th century and most of the stuff seems genuine (reminded me a bit of "Gangs of New York" to be honest).However, the acting is atrocious. Cruise can't sport a consistent Irish accent for the life of him. Kidman is okay but I've seen her give far more convincing performances.Overall this love story set in immigration America had potential and is pretty to look at, but the tale is a bit alienating due to the poor performances from the lead actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few political questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently a historical romance, there are a few rather delicatepolitical issues in this movie. First, the "Irish Question" seems asfar from a solution today as it was in the 1890's. Second, landownership still leads to passionate debates over much of the world.And I suppose the native North Americans would have an alternativeviewpoint about the Oklahoma land grants. Art criticism aside, "Farand Away" should encourage some lively political debate.From the viewer's point of sight, the film is rather good. Not beingborn in Ireland, I cannot comment on the characters' accents, whichseems to be a major objection from the Irish people. But it's a goodstory, well directed with a good storyline. A nice romance, betweentwo socially unmatched people, whose cultural incompatibilities endbeing smoothed over by an intrinsical soul matching. The finalOklahoma scenes are really good, they seem to capture the spirit ofthe old American west, when the land seemed to be there just waitingfor anyone to come and take possession.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far And Away: Both Far-Reaching (Ron Howard) and Far-Retching (Me)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, the whole time I was being forced to watch this, I wished I was far and away. Like at a screening of "Babe" or something. Bob Dolman (who was later to write such classics as "How To Eat Fried Worms") and Ron Howard need some writing 411.The first thing one I learned in screen writing class is as follows: Don't let your actors blab expository information. One of the first thing Joseph (Tom Cruise) says is: "I don't want to fight you." What he really wants to do it talk your ear off. When he feels his land has been stolen he promptly says: "I think I'll go kill the bloke who took my land." (or something to that effect) That's it. No internal conflict necessary here, folks. Of course, we already have been force-fed Joseph's personality due to a two-minute monologue concerning him being his dying Da. Later, Kidman does the same thing. "You wonder why I'm running away?" she asks Joe. "Well, I'll tell you." Do people do that in real life? Sure. It's called processing. But in the movies, it's false empathy.Let's move on. Is there love in this movie? Oh I was definitely feeling the lust. Dolman/ Howard made that quite clear in various sequences of partial/hidden nudity. Ah the joy of a censored director. But love? Nah. Too little chemistry, driven by the usual emotional triggers (another man, another woman, a lusty old dude, a gunshot wound, charged bickering, drunkenness and a bathtub). Cruise's accent? Not for me. Kidman looks beautiful and acts splendidly. Some great work from Colm Meany in the mid-section (probably the better slice of the story).The whole thing falls apart gloriously in the last thirty minutes, where we understand nothing (why is Kidman's family vying for territory?), huge themes are destroyed (Joseph's prudishness? The value of honest work? The desperation of the times?) in order to create a huge slam-bash finish in a race for land. As if this entire thing had been about land vs. love... Or has it been? In the midst of convoluted plot lines, was that really IT?The #1 worst excuse for a bad movie is "Great photography/costumes/action." Far and Away doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before, and sure Ireland's great but you can always rent a helicopter video. The first third is basically Braveheart, the second Gangs of New York and the last Titanic, all three of which were (somewhat) better. Do yourself a favor. Watch them in succession. Stay far and away from this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Far and Away" is an American attempt to combine British-style "heritage cinema" with a traditional Western. The film opens in 1890s Ireland. On the day of his father's funeral, young farmer Joseph Donnelly is evicted from his land because of unpaid rent and home is burned down by his landlord's men. Joseph vows revenge, and makes an attempt to kill his landlord Daniel Christie. He fails, but his attempt sets in motion a chain of events which lead to Joseph running off to America with Christie's daughter Shannon. On arrival, he works for a time as a prize- fighter in Boston, and eventually they take part in the Oklahoma Land Run of 1893 (an event which has also featured in other films such as the two versions of "Cimarron").The film's main problem is that the story is full of plot-holes and most of these derive from two incidents, the burning of Joseph's house and his attempt to kill Christie. It is never explained why Christie's men would have wanted to burn the house, which after Joseph's eviction could have been let to another tenant. Christie later protests that the burning was done, without his knowledge or consent, by his land agent Stephen Chase, but does not explain why he has not only kept in his employment a man guilty of arson against his employer's property but also continues to regard that man as a desirable suitor for his daughter's hand in marriage. (Chase, possibly based upon the notorious Captain Charles Boycott, is the real villain of the film).Joseph's attempt to kill Christie is not in itself improbable as Joseph had plenty of reason to hate him. It does, however, raise the difficult questions of why Christie should seemingly bear Joseph no animosity during their subsequent meetings and of why Shannon should first have run off with, and later have fallen in love with, a man who had tried to murder her father. Why did Chase challenge Joseph to a duel? By the 1890s duelling was going out of favour in the British Isles, but even when it was in favour no gentleman would have challenged a social inferior to a duel. (Chase would undoubtedly have regarded an illiterate peasant-farmer like Joseph as his inferior). Why would an obviously wealthy man like Christie, who after emigrating to America has enough money to live in luxury as a rich Boston gentleman, have wanted to abandon that life in favour of becoming an Oklahoma farmer? And why would an intelligent and well-educated woman like Shannon have been unaware that the Land Run was being held in Oklahoma? (She seems to imagine that she only has to step off the ship in Boston to be offered free land).The stars are Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the cinema's official Golden Couple of the nineties, in their second film together. It would be true to say that in neither case is this their best film, but then in neither case is it their worst either. If Cruise does not quite reach the heights he scaled in some of his films from this period, such as "Rain Man", "Born on the First of July" or "A Few Good Men", at least he does not slip back into the brattish, cocky screen persona which had been his stock-in-trade for much of the eighties, and Joseph comes across as surprisingly sympathetic for a would-be assassin. I will leave comment on his accent and Kidman's to those more familiar with Irish dialects than I am. I was not, however, impressed with some of the supporting cast, especially Robert Prosky who seemed unable to decide if he should play Christie as a lovable old rogue or an outright villain. Visually, the film is an attractive one with some striking shots of the Irish landscape, and Ron Howard does a good job as director; the scenes of the Land Run itself are particularly well put together to make a stirring climax. A favourite trick of his is to film the action from above, as if seen by Joseph's father looking down from Heaven. (Joseph often refers to his belief that his father is watching over him). Little expense seems to have been spared in recreating the Ireland and the America of the 1890s and, unlike many period dramas, this one is not littered with historical inaccuracies; about the only goof I spotted was that old chestnut, too many stars on the American flag for the date at which the action takes place.Roger Ebert said of "Far and Away" that it is "a movie that joins astonishing visual splendour with a story so simple-minded it seems intended for adolescents", a sentiment with which I would concur. When so much attention has been paid to other aspects of the film, it is a shame that so little was apparently paid to the script. The plot has more holes than a colander. With a better storyline my mark would have been considerably higher. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far and Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Ron Howard (Splash, Apollo 13, Ransom, A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code), I knew this film had mixed or negative reviews, it was rated two out of five stars, but I was willing to give it a chance. Basically set in 1893 Ireland, following the death of his father, young Irish man Joseph Donnelly (Tom Cruise) is facing property eviction, and he wants to get revenge on his landlord Daniel Christie (Mrs. Doubtfire's Robert Prosky). However in his attempt to kill Christie, Joseph is injured and sentenced to a duel against Christie's arrogant manager Stephen Chase (Thomas Gibson), meanwhile Christie's daughter Shannon (Nicole Kidman) is growing dissatisfied with her parents' generation of traditional views and longs to be modern. Shannon makes her plans to leave for the United States of America, and Joseph escapes with her, they arrive together in Boston, find jobs and begin saving money. Joseph makes money becoming a local bare-knuckle fighter, while Shannon works in a chicken processing plant and as a social club dancer, all is well until all their money is taken away after Joseph loses a boxing match. Joseph and Shannon are left starving in the cold of winter, Shannon's parents meanwhile leave Ireland to join her, they are facing a devastating loss, Chase joins them, he was leading a search to find Shannon, but Joseph brings her to them following an accident. To make money Joseph works on a railroad after heading west, but in a dream sequence he sees his father reminding and confronting him of his desire to own land, so he joins the wagon trains and arrives in Oklahoma Territory. Joseph is just in time for the Land Run of 1893, aka the Cherokee Strip Land Run, a chance for more than 10,000 to claim land, his fate lie in his participation, Shannon is also joining the ride and willing to help Joseph plant the flag that will ultimately claim the land he finds. Also starring Barbara Babcock as Nora Christie, Cyril Cusack as Danty Duff, Colm Meaney as Kelly, Bread's Eileen Pollock as Molly Kay, Michelle Johnson as Grace, Wayne Grace as Bourke, Douglas Gillison as Dermody, Niall Toibin as Joe, Barry McGovern as McGuire, Gary Lee Davis as Gordon, Jared Harris as Paddy, So What Now's Steven O'Donnell as Colm, Clint Howard, Ron's brother as Flynn, Brendan Gleeson as Social Club Policeman, Rance Howard, Ron's father as Tomlin and Father Ted's Pauline McLynn as Prostitute. Cruise and Kidman do their best to put on Irish accents, but only make it sound cartoonish, at least their performances are reasonable, and being married at the time their relationship is convincing, the love story between them is fine, but the memorable moments are the fights, the horse and cart rides, and of course the big sweeping riding across the Irish plains, the ending where Cruise looks dead for a moment and waking again is ridiculous, but once the credits role the great song "Book of Days" by Irish singer Enya rescues it, it is a slightly naff and stereotypical film, but as a whole it's not a bad romantic period adventure drama. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1892 western Ireland, tenant farmers are rebelling. Joseph Donnelly (Tom Cruise) loses his father during an incident with the landlord. Their home is burnt for overdue rent. He seeks revenge on landlord Daniel Christie (Robert Prosky) but his gun explodes. The landlord's daughter Shannon Christie (Nicole Kidman) wants to be Modern and get 160 acres of free land in America. She grabs Joseph from a pistol duel with the cruel henchman Stephen Chase (Thomas Gibson). She takes him on as her man servant on the journey. They find out the land is in Oklahoma, but she loses all her valuable spoons in Boston. They are penniless as they meet the ward boss Mike Kelly (Colm Meaney). He gains some worth as a bare knuckle boxer. Meanwhile a mob burns down the Christies mansion and they travel to America to follow Shannon. Eventually it ends in the great race to claim land in the Oklahoma Territories.The movie is beautifully shot by director Ron Howard. However the story is convenient and simplistic. It's as if Ron Howard wanted to check all the boxes of the era for the Irish. Everything feels manufactured. There isn't a real moment in the movie especially the pairing of Kidman and Cruise. There is no subtlety in their performance or the romance. It's not as problematic the first time around but it really annoys me with more viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Far and Away" is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. It's a love story that follows the lives of two Irish immigrants during the industrial revolution.The Irish people immigrated to America in search of a better life. But in America the Irish people were discriminated and forced to take the worst jobs. They struggle every day just to survive, but still they never gave up.And that's one of the movie strongest messages. Never to give up. There are also other messages in this movie about hope, dreams, love and freedom.I recommend everyone to watch "Far and Away", because it's a great classic movie.</fullReview>

After all, the dominant force of the landlords in the maintenance of long-term , tenants have to pay a heavy price of resistance.Joseph's father died because of this revolution . After his father's funeral , the house which his father left to him, burned down by the landlord retaliation.For revenge to the landlord , Joseph tracking the landlord, and met his daughter,Shannon.Then they go to the united states.In United States,they experienced a lot of misery.But at last, Joseph use all of his money buy a horse,In the form of enclosure, went to the west to achieve a better long-cherished wish, and finally have a real fertile ground of their own, begin a happy life with Shannon.An Irish peasant, in order to escape the oppression of the landlord came to the U.S., he wants nothing more than a piece of their own land, a beloved woman, by working to earn money to eat, even though he had a handsome face like Tom Cruise, although he is love a girl like Nicole Kidman as , but what are the differences between them and ordinary people around the world Away from their homes, because no longer want to endure poverty, hunger, in order to no longer tolerate tyranny and cruel officials, in order to restore the dignity as a human being at least, the pursuit of human happiness and good. Only lived under the tyranny of people came to understand the true meaning of freedom, if your diligence, wisdom, dedication, kindness, the result was just deception, exploitation, violence, if you refuse to sink and fall will be marginalized and trampled --- If you only wish - to eat on their own labor can not be guaranteed work, but wanton driving was the same as cattle, left the home in addition to what you choose!Green fields, wide pastures, with a quietly flowing river, where it can be living, working by your own wills, is that not everyone's fantasy land?Perhaps, there are also have evil, there is dark, and perhaps the world's most ugly things out there, but I think there is not a paradise, after all, someone must have sin, but where most people must be good, otherwise I do not understand Why do people around the world, good and bad, are desperately wanted to be a member there. Is the world not a person to commit suicide go to hell, those who criticize it are often the most powerful people cursing its residents or to their own children there.When Tom's horse in the western grasslands for their own, as the beloved girl, to win their own piece of land, I suddenly understood the answer.This movie tell me more like Mel Gibson's independence and the United States the meaning of American heroism - that is, - in pursuit of the most basic right to fight.And there can give you the right to pursue this equality.In this movie, I like the episode that in Oklahoma on the vast grassland, full steam ahead for land scenes.I like the big-flavor of the wind, blowing white curtains just washed white sheets flapping in the wind to ring, two people across the clothesline, blowing across the face of the white curtain, to meet, exchange of courtesies:"So, even if we end up?" "We should count it ..."I like the girl bent over the boy who cried:"I love you, I always love you, from the first meeting to love you, you can not die."Zoom lens, pull away, until her figure and her crying under his shadow, have become rich grass between the small black dots.Heaven and earth so great, their dreams are so small that they love so sad.Suddenly the boy opened his eyes, said: "I know ..." Shannon Christie: "This was our dream together. I don't want this without you!"This is my favorite line, it perfect present the meaning of the dream of them</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starring Tom Flynn and Nicole O'Hara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this film had been made in the 40s (and it probably was in one guise or another) it would have probably featured Errol Flynn and Maureen O'Hara in the roles taken by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, his wife at the time, and contained the same storyline without the blood dripping from Cruise's mouth and Nicole ogling his bum when he isn't looking. The film really is that old-fashioned that you know, by the time Kidman buries a pitch fork in poor Tom's leg, exactly how it will turn out.Poor Tom takes a lot of punishment in this movie: he's beaten up by his brothers, has a shotgun backfire into his face, is beaten to a pulp by an Italian when he's momentarily distracted, then beaten to a pulp by his ward boss for being beaten to a pulp by an Italian when he's momentarily distracted, falls through the side of a tent, falls from his horse, bangs his head on a rock and gets that pitchfork through his leg. Despite it all, his movie idol looks remain intact. Nicole just gets shot in the shoulder.She and Tom are the only decent people in the film. The other man after her heart looks like a bad guy who's stepped right out of a Mills and Boon romance. He looks like it's all he can do to stop himself from rubbing the end of his moustache between thumb and finger and cackling quietly to himself. Nicole's father is a slum landlord who heartlessly evicts his tenants by burning their houses, and yet is portrayed in quite a sympathetic light even when he and his wife ? who let's face it, wouldn't go within two thousand miles of a place like Oklahoma ? secure a plot of land in the land rush by means of skulduggery.Far and Away is something of a mess that is probably more entertaining than it deserves to be, even though it undoubtedly falls far short of the expectations of all involved. Despite the violent fist fights, it resolutely refuses to look like a modern film, and constantly harks back to the days of Ford and Walsh in its efforts to capture the spirit of both poverty-stricken Ireland and the pioneering West. Of course, it fails in its efforts, which is perhaps why it all seems a little empty and by the numbers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stereotypes, Clichés and Smaltz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood usually loves the Irish and usually loves Westerns. This is a movie that could cause a viewer to hate the Irish, hate Westerns, and hate Hollywood.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidmann affect the all-time worst Irish accents ever. Mr. Cruise was at the height of his career when this was made, and the audience is treated to virtual tour de force of Tom Cruise Movie Clichés, his rippling muscles, his abilities to outfight any physical superior and instantly master any required skill, and the volatile-but-misunderstood protagonist. In short, he is a living cartoon character. Particularly egregious is the sequence wherein our hero, never having ridden a horse prior, is able to suddenly master the meanest, most buckingest bronco EVER, within the context of an unfolding Land Rush and to overtake thousands of other more competent riders with trained steeds.This cloying and sophomoric script is overladen with schmaltz and sentimentality. Cruise and Kidmann are unlikable from the start and grow more so throughout the film. There are no characters anywhere of sufficient plausibility upon which the viewer may anchor his suspension of belief.This film contains every type of flaw characteristic of the early Ron Howard films, amplified and exaggerated, with none of the redeeming traits. (In fairness to Opie, I must say that later films such as Apollo 13 and Cinderella Man I found to be very well made and recommend them to my friends.) This film is almost a perfect parody of bad 1990's film. It would probably be a good double feature with 'Mr. Holland's Opus.' I saw this film in the theater back in 1992 when it was new and for many years it held the title as the all-time worst film I had ever seen (that title is now held by 'Hancock'; see that review for details). This is not the fun kind of bad film, such as an Ed Wood film. Rather, this film is unpleasant in the way that an evangelist sitting next to you on a transatlantic flight is unpleasant. The only sane reason to see this film would be if one needed to re-stoke the fires of one's dislike for Tom Cruise, and for that purpose, it would work well.</fullReview>

The scenery in the film is beautiful and the cinematography is great. The direction from Ron Howard is good as usual.When I watched this movie in my history class, I thought it was a good movie. I was so surprised when I found out it was only a 2 1/2 star movie, and that it was conceived so badly from people everywhere.Despite being really good, there are some flaws in this movie. Some of the acting was rather wooden, the phony accents were rather lame, and there are a few moments that didn't seem like they were fully thought out.Despite those few flaws, this movie very good. It shows what it was like being an immigrant from Ireland and traveling to the United States. Despite having freedom in the U.S. during the time this movie takes place, there were some bad conditions that people had to live in. This movie shows those conditions very well.This is worth watching, but you probably won't enjoy it if you don't like Tom Cruise.</fullReview>

Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for epics, but I really felt that it was one of the best movies of the past decade I was not expecting to like it a great deal when my wife and I went to the theater. I thought it was going to be one of those "women's romance films" that tend to bore me. It certainly proved to be much more than that! The fight scenes in Boston, and the land-claiming footage in Oklahoma were absolutely captivating! I was also impressed by Howard's use of filmography, particularly with the surprise ending (one of the best-timed "The End" graphics ever immediately follows). Excellent work by Cruise and Kidman (talk about sexual tension in the air!) and Robert Prosky once again shows what a brilliant character actor he is by nearly stealing the film as Shannon's father.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright so if it were not for how this movie ended, it has the potential to be great. The portrayal of New York in it's "prime" (the late 19th century) was a good down and dirty way to show the corruption of most business individuals in that time period. When Kidman and Cruise are kicked out of their hotel room (brothel...? don't remember), they are forced to live on the streets in the middle of harsh winter. That reality is quite powerful when one takes into account the many many poor, homeless workers or unemployed people that either died or in some crude way coped with the climate. No one would open their doors; the well-off were above that. Then the pair are off to Oklahoma after Kidman is shot because she can't run fast. Eventually all the movie is ruined at the end when Cruise hits his head on a rock, and Kidman runs up and is petitioning him to somehow stop the bleeding in his brain, but Cruise just can't. So he dies. The camera backs away into the sky with him on the ground, her crying over him "I loved you..." Their relationship in the past was awkward, so this statement is a surprise unto the late Cruise. As the camera (his soul) is backing away into heaven and hears this, he decides to go back to his body, so the camera shoots back down to earth into the body and suddenly cruise wakes up with bright eyes and a smile. And less hemorrhaging. They claim land together as prospective newly revived husband and wife. And.........It's as corny as heck for such a movie. Darn.

		<fullReview>Obviously, and almost unashamedly, a Cruise/Kidman vehicle, Ron Howard's film does have all the right ingredients, including a poor boy, a rich girl, forbidden love, and a country that promises to fulfill all their dreams.Unfortunately that's all it does have. The script is largely uninspired, quite slow in the middle, and finishes with a predictable 'happy ending'. None of the cast really help proceedings, nor does John Williams' score, which surprisingly disappoints.Director Howard mostly fails to generate real audience interest in his lead players, and humour is sadly lacking. "Far and Away" is romantic, but it seriously lacks depth.Friday, June 5, 1992 - Knox District CentreSeeing "Far and Away" a second time is not highly recommended. The story is boring, the comedy just is not effective and the film is far too long. Those prize-fights are a terrible rip-off of "Rocky".A very painful second viewing.

		<shortDescription>How Tom Cruise Won the West...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1892 Ireland, a penniless farmer(with an axe to grind--naturally, as it makes the character more..."complex"?)becomes reluctant allies with the rich, spoiled daughter of his hated landlord; together, they travel to America, landing in Boston where he becomes a bare-knuckle fighter. Long and tiring "search for better lives" movie has become something of a 'chick flick'(which I'm sure was not director Ron Howard's intent). Is 'chick flick' a criticism? In this context, yes. The film is soft and wan, glossy and condescending--not a knock-off of the classic 'chick flicks' but a regression of one. Filled with peaks and valleys, it exposes all of Howard's saccharin weaknesses as a director(he shows expansive style but very little inquistiveness, and not one little bit of throwaway cleverness; nothing escapes him and yet EVERYTHING escapes him). It plays like "The Quiet Man" on Quaaludes, arms-flailing and yet lethargic. Tom Cruise(God help us)is full of the kind of robust "Irish-ness" that immigrates only from good old Hollywood, U.S.A. As for then-wife Nicole Kidman, I found her surprisingly right in her role, and right at home(she was born to wear these period costumes). But--"Saints preserve us!"--it's a heavy screenplay(co-written by Howard), with many howlers in the mix, and the slick sheen of plastic covering the entire enterprise almost renders the on-location filming in Ireland and Montana fake. The whole flimsy "Far and Away" facade wilts completely at the end, but I'm sure Cruise was comfortable with his close-ups. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those epic colossal movies that had potential that wasn't fulfilled.The film begins in late 19th century Ireland with a conflict between the impoverished Catholics and the ruling Protestants. The film's young protagonists, Joseph Donnelly (Tom Cruise) and Shannon Christie (Nicole Kidman) have their first confrontation there. (Cruise and Kidman were married when the film was made.) Shannon is a spoiled daughter of the family that owns the land that tenant farmers (such as the Donnellys) worked. She is unhappy living in her parent's home and wants to go to America and get free land she saw advertised in a flyer. (The Oklahoma Territory was scheduled to be opened to homesteading.) She gets Donnelly to come with her as her valet, so the setting switches to a ship. It then moves to the seedy sides of New York City where the two have a hard life. Next the scene is building the transcontinental railroad. Finally it gets to the land rush.The problem is that the audience is asked to accept improbable events in each of these settings. For example, in Ireland we are to believe that a gentleman would defend his honor by challenging a manual laborer to a duel. In New York City the bare knuckle fight scenes between heavyweights and the flyweight Donnelly are too poorly choreographed to be believable. In the New York to Oklahoma transit section Joseph has no problem joining a wagon train without any supplies or transportation. Again, Joseph takes no supplies with him on his horseback race for the Oklahoma land and has no one to bring him supplies needed for homesteading (as a minimum he would need a shovel and food.) Tom Cruise on horseback looked foolish moving the reins up and down as if he was operating a pump. Cruise's Irish accent was bad and inconsistent. So was the quality of the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no great performances here, no great scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had checked my own review of this movie, I would have spared myself the agony of sitting through it twice. At two hours, 20 minutes, this is a waste of time. Cruise is a poor choice to play an Irish immigrant. He struggles with the accent, and has almost no chemistry with co-star Kidman. He's supposed to be a boxer who's knocking out men who outweigh him by 100 pounds; not likely. As for the idiot plot, Joseph (Cruise) is motivated to fight because he's horny, sharing a room with Shannon (Kidman). She's right there, but he doesn't put the moves on her. He's living in a whorehouse, but he doesn't flirt with any of the very attractive tenants. I don't get it. There are no great performances here, no great scenes. As for romance, when Joseph says affectionately to Shannon (several times), "You're a corker," that just doesn't move me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long and clichéd adventure, old-fashioned but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe this film came out in 1992. It feels so old-fashioned, it could almost have been a product of 1940s Hollywood, apart from the brutal fight scenes, of course. It's a long immigrant tale in late nineteenth century America. Nicole Kidman is good and Tom Cruise's personality remains magnetic despite his dodgy accent. The characterization is simplistic, but the film is well photographed and (MINOR SPOILERS) the climactic land rush remains thrilling. Some of the dialog should have been more polished as it is too corny. Watchable at home.Overall 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far and Away is about Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman playing 2 Irish Immigrants who went to America to find a better living style. Taken place in the late 1800s back when hundreds of immigrants went by boat to live in America.Also back when New York was yet to be the Big Apple as it is today, and back when New York was starting to be populated with foreign immigrants from Europe and Asia.Anyways our main characters find that living in the land of the free doesn't mean they're able to do what they want. Since not many Americans back then find immigrants as people.The story to this movie is decent. A good history lesson but not a classic in my opinion. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise have starred in far better titles than this one here.Those who admire Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman might like it. Other people should rent it first before buying it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully boring and unoriginal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen this movie as a requirement for a course I am taking. My history teacher pulled this one out of the closet when she became sick and was unable to come up with lesson plans. That should give you an idea of where I am going with this review. The plot is so incredibly predictable that, at any given point in the film, you can immediately tell the outcome of the current conflict, whether it be a boxing match or a fight with death. The connection between Cruise and Kidman is there, but it doesn't mean much. They both just.. stand there and act their parts pretty well. However, that doesn't save the horrific screenplay that follows every single basic guideline of a period romance-drama, with nothing extra and exciting which sets a dull movie apart from an above-average one. Simply put, nothing happens. The only remotely cool part in the movie is the wagon race, which comes very close to the end of the film. If you've already seen "Far and Away", you know what I'm talking about. Also, I want to point out that Ron Howard seems to be extremely unskilled in directing when this film was made. The camera shots are boring and uneventful and the way that the film flows almost gives you the impression that the film is apathetic to itself and allows itself to wander and falter from one plot marker to the next. There are some decent camera shots of the sky at sunset and a pretty decent wagon race. The acting isn't terrible, either. Other than that, the movie is a dud. I give it 4/10 and I'm being nice. (*1/2)SPOILER If you have seen the movie, you'll know exactly what I mean. Tom Cruise is smashed by a horse and fades away in a death-like sequence, and then miraculously comes back to life nearly 30 seconds later. This is a fundamental of any movie: if you're going to perform a resurrection on a principal character, you allow the viewer time to let the death sink in, before slowly and gradually building up to the resuscitation. However, Cruise dies, Kidman mourns for nearly 30 seconds while some sad music plays, and then BOOM Cruise is back alive and better as ever with cheery music. It's not even touching, rather just plain confusing. I will not go any further into the rest of the movie, but rest assured that Howard failed miserably in achieving the result he was going for. At least he redeemed himself with "Apollo 13".</fullReview>

This shows the triumph that can be done if you work hard at your goals and believe you will get it done. Such as Shannon does in this movie. She brings new life to herself and to Joseph!

		<shortDescription>Simply annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so you have a movie that begins in western Ireland, with Tom Cruise looking as polish as ever (although, you gotta give him props for pulling off a faux Irish accent) and the villagers are rebelling because of the fact that their oppressive landlords are taking their property away from them for not paying their outrageous mortgages. Fair enough. But you throw that in with not only a terrible script, but also terrible acting and annoying characters, and you have the worst movie of the year. But it's not all bad. If it were a comedic movie, it would probably be one of the funniest movies out there. But the fact that it happens to take it self seriously simply drives one into madness as one is sitting in his seat wondering what they were smoking to convince them to watch this movie. Even before he went off the deep end, Tom Cruise could not act to save his life. Nicole Kidman is brilliant at portraying an annoying, spoiled rich girl. All the other characters are barely much more than superficial and irritating. The reasons I give this movie two stars: 1) For comedic value, it's great. 2) Even though he's a crazy psychopath who can't act worth a hill of beans, Tom Cruise is still sexy with an Irish accent... even if the writers did feel it necessary to have him laying on a bed with nothing but a strategically-placed bowl (trying to erase from memory by thinking thoughts of Johnny Depp...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly awful Irish accents. So bad I am humiliated for them! There were stories abound, when the filming was taking place, how they employed Irish scholars to give voice coaching lessons so that the accent was true to the Country! I nearly died when I saw this movie. I actually never saw the end as I could not - well not without cringing behind the couch - watch the rest of this film.I have been in the remotest part of Ireland and never heard anything this bad.Please Hollywood treat the Irish accent with respect and stop all this nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, awful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the big names attached to this movie, I have to admit it's quite cheesy. Although the historical aspect of the film is impressive--the sets, costumes and supporting characters were well-planned--the story is slow, cliché and hideously boring. The leads drag the story down with their juvenile arguments and resentments, then consequential attraction to one another. The film only worsens once the leads fully realize their attraction and can think of nothing but reuniting, even as Cruise's character rides a mining company train and Kidman's character travels with a band of covered wagons. The worst is saved for last, when Cruise's character is laying on the ground after a fight, appearing to be dead (Kidman is sobbing, for goodness' sake), only to open his eyes and wake up. Cue the cheesy music and the disastrous ending is complete. If you are forced to watch this movie, then appreciate it for the historical aspect--not for the acting, script or plot.bitesizemoviereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Load Of Blarney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can guess this is a Hollywood movie made for an entirely Irish American market because the story opens in a lovely Irish village populated by the little people - Leprechauns . Oh hold on they're not Leprechauns they're Irishmen . I do apologise , my mistake , it's just that despite being set in Ireland in 1893 everything looks medieval and no one is over five foot and they all dress in a parody of Irish traditional garb . Strange too that many of them speak in a strange accent that is not entirely Celtic , it takes more than clichéd idioms like " oh away wi' ya now , I'll no' fight ya today " to convince me someone is Irish . Likewise because someone moans " Dis is our country " doesn't necessarily mean they've got a licence to commit murder . I'm sure a movie featuring a Sunni Arab nationalist in Mesipotamia in 1920 fighting against British occupation wouldn't be doing very good box office in America today Apart from the objectionable point of Tom Cruise being a Fenian FAR AND AWAY is a rather amusing film , note that I'm not saying it's a good film but an amusing one . You'll split your sides laughing as Tom and Nicole attempt " Oirish " accents and dialogue like " Der's a goat over there , go and improve yer love loife " . You'll wet yourself laughing as Tom Cruise plays a bare knuckle fighter . It's like watching GANGS OF NEW YORK without the serious bits . It's one of those cheesy , corny movies that only an American will love and fortunately not everyone in the world is an American</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong.. I like most movies Ron Howard has directed. I am also not a Tom Cruise hater and I think EYES WIDE SHUT is a great movie and he and Kidman are marvelous in it.But FAR AND AWAY is the kind of movie that brings out the film snob in me. I know this is a personal reaction, but I really hate this film. I find it guilty of committing the worst possible sin: it's mediocre.Not just mediocre, though.. Mediocre on a grand scale! Big 70mm, 50 foot wide screen mediocre!This is the kid of film where the two leads have been starving on the streets for weeks and they have strategically placed theatrical smudges on their faces.. and Tom is still clean shaven.I know.. It's a sweeping romantic tale and one should simply surrender to its artifice.. Well, I can't.I keep seeing the strings of manipulation being pulled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILER There are few words that would do justice to how bad this movie really is - badly written, badly acted, badly directed over sentimental, misleading and far too long is a start. As someone with an Irish background, and who has spent a good deal of time in exactly the places that Howard tried to portray in the movie, it was sad to see how little he made of it, and how much he simplified and sentimentalised the truth of the place, the time and the history. It was cliche piled on cliche, and the accents - particularly Tom Cruise's - were risible.From a bad start, it just got worse - I had no sympathy for either character for a moment, and the ridiculous 'near-death' scene was as predictable as it was stupid. The scenery was beautiful, that was all...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a previous commenter said: Far and Away "plays like "The Quiet Man" on Quaaludes." What a great turn of phrase! And so true! This movie has a painfully asinine storyline, pitiful dialogue, hokey acting, the subtly of a comic book, and manages to insult the intelligence of the audience (and the Irish) in almost every scene.The photography is beautiful, though, including the opening sequence, filmed on the Dingle Peninsula."The Quiet Man," hokey as it is, is more satisfying than this tripe, and has the benefit of moving through its storyline at a quick clip. The love scene in the Cong churchyard amid the thunderstorm is one of the great romantic moments in romance movies. Far and Away never reaches the level of true emotion seen in most "made for TV" movies.</fullReview>
