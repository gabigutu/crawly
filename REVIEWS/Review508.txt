		<shortDescription>The Friedmans Weren't Captured, They Submitted Entirely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentaries that focus on the lives of their subjects are intrinsically voyeuristic. The documentarian must be objective while often prone to being seductively enmeshed in his/her subjects' views of their lives."Capturing the Friedmans" takes this reality to a much deeper and excruciatingly raw level. Long before Arnold Friedman, a deeply respected and retired high school teacher who moved on to teaching computer skills when PCs were rare, and one of his son's, Jesse, became defendants in a widely reported and still remembered pedophile case, filming and taping each other was a family staple. What starts as a not uncommon family avocation turns infinitely darker as several of the family members seem compelled to record disturbing intra-family encounters that both enthrall and repel.Based on a U.S. Post Office investigation leading to a search of the Friedman's Great Neck, N.Y. home it is immediately clear that the pater familias at the least was a dedicated, devoted collector of sickening homosexual kiddie porn. On that charge at the least he was fully eligible for and deserved a long prison sentence.But the initial investigation yielded verbal complaints by boys that they were sexually abused during the computer training sessions in the Friedman home by both Arnold and his son, Jesse. Also living in the house were his wife, Elaine, and two other boys, David and Seth.The police investigation led to myriad charges lodged against both Arnold and Jesse and the legal proceedings drew national media attention (which I well remember).No forensic evidence existed to link either Friedman to the crimes let alone establish that they had occurred. All the evidence, which was never tested in court, came from kids questioned by police and, apparently in many instances, the kids were seriously encouraged by outraged parents who, themselves, had no factual basis on which to proceed.Both Friedmans eventually and separately pleaded guilty to reduced charges. Arnold went to prison and subsequently committed suicide, leaving Jesse $250,000 in insurance proceeds. Jesse, who maintains his innocence to this day, served thirteen years of a six to eighteen year sentence.One son, Seth, refused to participate in this project. The other son, David, is a high society children's birthday party clown in New York City known as "Silly Billy." He worries in the film if his career will be affected. How could it not be, especially as he is the angriest speaker on the screen. And not the most rational either.On many levels this is a deeply disturbing film. First, the family members who cooperated by giving film to the director and allowing very free-wheeling interviews reflect the reality of a hopelessly dysfunctional family, people who had deep troubles long before the postal police showed up with a search warrant. Elaine is alternately revealing and guarded but it's clear that her union with the popular Arnold was disturbed, emotionally, sexually and even in terms of practical matters like childrearing.The family films show the deterioration of the sons' relationship with their mother whom they hotly blame for supposedly not standing behind their father. She is savagely abused verbally in scene after scene. Arnold remains a very passive, almost detached witness of his family's self-immolation as he and Jesse await possible trials and almost certain imprisonment. At one point Arnold appears to be nothing more than an onlooker as his sons tear into his wife who gives back a spirited defense.The most sympathetic character is Arnold's brother who can not recall Arnold's admitted and hardly self-serving statement that he engaged in sex with him when they were little kids. The brother's anguish about the dissolution of the family is heartfelt and affecting. He truly is a victim.Beyond all the family sturm und drang is the legal story and it's troubling. This case took place while accustations of child abuse in daycare facilities flew through the headlines. An expert debunker of many such cases is on screen to offer her views. She resolves nothing but plants a kernel of doubt as to the state's case. It is clear, however, that there were more than a few instances when the rule of law succumbed to a miasmic hysteria.A greater injection of skepticism comes from the back-to-back explanations by two involved detectives as to how to question juveniles who might have been victimized by sexual predators. One has the right answer, the other a technique proven to lead to false accusations.What followed the investigation was the loding of so many charges against each defendant as to constitute an extraordinary episode of overcharging. Overcharging - hitting a defendant with every conceivable charge and instance of its commission - is common. It gives police much credit for clearing cases and prosecutors leverage in getting a plea deal. In the case of the Friedmans the plethora of charges, as opposed to whether each or both committed heinous offenses, is simply unbelievable. As even the prosecutor admits, not one child was injured or crying when picked up by parents at the home/computer school yet some claimed to have been anally sodomized dozens of times. That's just not possible.What "Capturing the Friedmans" shows is that when a defendant like Jesse recants after pleading to so many counts it's impossible to ever be sure whether the allocution required at the guilty plea hearing was genuine or, as Jesse later claims, the inevitable needed confession for the best deal he could get to avoid life in prison.My view as an experienced lawyer is that both were guilty of SOME offenses against young boys. Jesse's protestations of innocence have the scent of the eternally unrepentant malefactor. But I can't prove it and neither could the documentarian. Arnold's starting point as a fervid consumer of kiddie porn magazines makes it easier to believe he graduated to the next step. But, again, whether a jury could have so concluded beyond a reasonable doubt is something we can never know. David's defense of his dad and brother is so emotional and projected with the weight of many repetitions over the years as to be worthless.We will never know what actually happened. This glimpse into the lives of an affluent family whose home life was rocky before the accusations is haunting, troubling. It demands that we think about what we do in the vital and right but sometimes off-kilter attempts to protect the young and punish their violators.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An assault on our expectations of truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1987, Great Neck, Long Island, a comfortable upper middle class town, was rocked when Arnold Friedman, a respected high school teacher and his 18-year old son, Jessie were arrested on charges of molestation, rape, and sodomy against young boys to whom they taught computer classes in their basement. The documentary Capturing the Friedmans is a dark and disturbing look at the Friedman family (Arnold, sons David, Jessie, Seth and their mother Elaine) that compels us to sift through the ambiguous evidence and determine for ourselves the question of their guilt or innocence. "It's a combination of different versions of different stories", says first-time director Andrew Jarecki, who assembled video footage filmed by eldest son David, news accounts, still photos, and his own original material, and turned it into one of the most powerful films of the year. The documentary was conceived by Mr. Jarecki after working on a piece about "Silly Billy" (David Friedman), the number one birthday clown in New York City. He found David to be a sad clown underneath the happy face and began to probe deeper, ultimately discovering the arrest, court case, and David's obsessive home videos documenting the family's deterioration. The first glimpse we get is a video of the happy family having fun at the beach. We are soon jolted by the revelation that Arnold collects child pornography magazines. After being alerted by the postal authorities, the police search his house and find a printout of a list of students he taught computer literacy. Former students are tracked down and interviewed, and Arnold and his son Jessie are accused of committing hundreds of acts of sex with their students. Listening to the Police Department, one might conclude that they are guilty, but as the film progresses doubts are raised about the validity of this conclusion. We are told that there was a complete lack of physical evidence, that witnesses may have been hypnotized, possibly coerced to give information and that some students denied anything ever took place. I began to question. If there was all of this going on, why didn't any child speak up or complain of a stomachache and refuse to go back? Why did they re-enroll for the advanced course? Everyone is convincing on camera but we are left scratching our heads wondering what is fantasy and what is truth. Both Arnold and Jessie maintain their innocence, although Arnold admits to being a pedophile and molesting two boys at the family's summer home as well as his younger brother Howard. Though Arnold received a life sentence and Jessie was released after serving 13 of his 18-year sentence, it is equally plausible that they were completely innocent, somewhat innocent, or completely guilty.While dissecting the inner workings of the family, Jarecki looks into the nature of memory to such an extent that Capturing the Friedmans is an assault on our expectation of truth. We expect the case to unfold with a clear identification of the perpetrators and victims, that some revelation of intimacy will arise from home videos of the family's unguarded moments, but our desires are never fulfilled. We are tantalized, still seeking the missing piece to the puzzle. Though we may never know about Arnold's or Jessie's guilt or innocence, to me the family was a disaster waiting to happen, having bottled up inside of them years of anguish and guilt. At the end, I felt tremendous sadness that we do not always have the emotional strength to act in our own best interests, to admit our vulnerability to each other, or operate in a way that nurtures our capacity to love. For the Friedmans, the legacy of this failure is a stigmatized life and painful memories that will remain forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>gripping but frustrating documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just one of the many outstanding documentaries of 2003, `Capturing the Friedmans' is a riveting, depressing and ultimately quite frustrating account of a pedophile and the effect he has on his community and family.In 1984, Arnold Friedman, a highly respected husband, parent and teacher living with his wife and three sons in an affluent suburb of northern Long Island, was arrested on more than a hundred charges of child molestation, purportedly committed while he and his youngest son, Jesse, were running a computer class (for boys only apparently) out of the family's home. Jesse, 18 at the time, was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sodomy as well. `Capturing the Friedmans' looks back not only at the trial and the circumstances surrounding it, but attempts to come to grips with how all of this affected each of the family members and the community at large. By combining present day interviews featuring several of the family members as well as some of the law enforcement officials involved in the case with glimpses of the family's life caught on film and videotape both before and after the arrest, director Andrew Jarecki creates a fascinating view of a family and a community torn asunder by crisis. We witness how each member of the family reacts to the situation. The older sons close ranks and remain faithful to their father while the mother attempts to distance herself from the crisis at hand. We see the denial and the enabling that are common in situations such as this one, as well as the way in which deep-seated and hitherto hidden feelings of anger and resentment can suddenly break forth and rise to the surface. Because the Friedmans' sons were obsessed with videotaping the events of their lives, the filmmakers had a plethora of highly revealing clips to choose from in weaving their grim but insightful tapestry.Perhaps the most controversial aspect of `Capturing the Friedmans' is that, even though the filmmakers acknowledge Arnold to be a pedophile, they obviously have grave doubts that the crimes for which he and his son were ultimately convicted ever really occurred. And, indeed, the scope, elaborateness and longevity of the alleged sexual abuse and the lack of prior reporting by any of the children who were the alleged victims do raise some troubling questions of credibility and plausibility in the viewer's mind. In fact, this whole case has eerie and disturbing echoes of the highly publicized McMartin Preschool trial, which was happening at roughly the same time. Even the people the filmmakers interview often contradict one another, leaving the audience not knowing who is telling the truth and who is lying ? either deliberately or, perhaps, subconsciously. It is this air of inconclusiveness that accounts for the viewer's feeling of frustration at the end. Although the moviemakers' sympathies seem to lie more with the family than with the court, we can't help thinking that maybe no one is really telling the whole truth and that perhaps the reality, as is so often the case in life, lies somewhere in between.If nothing else, `Capturing the Friedmans' serves as a reminder of just how messy and complicated an issue child molestation can be. With emotions running so high on both sides of the issue and the consequences so devastating for all the parties involved, the film at least shows that convictions in such cases must be pursued with the utmost rationality, rigor and care. Whatever the truth in this case may be, the fact remains, though, that Arnold Friedman's actions led to the disintegration of a family and an undeniable human tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Andrew Jarecki's `Capturing the Friedmans' is as real as hidden family dysfunction could be on film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget TV reality shows: Andrew Jarecki's `Capturing the Friedmans' is as real as hidden family dysfunction could be on film. Out of a seemingly-normal Great Neck, N.Y., middle-class family comes a tale too unique to be discounted: Honored teacher father and boyish son are charged with molesting young boys who attended dad's after-school computer class. It's known that dad reads child pornography, but the questionable molesting becomes a crisis fulcrum for the entire film.`Friedman's' is unique for 2 reasons: 1. Better than almost all other documentaries, even `Paradise Lost,' it reveals the ambiguity and uncertainty in most litigation. 2. It uses copious home movies to reveal the major characters at play and rest without helping to determine guilt or innocence.Jarecki, a co-founder of the Internet site, Moviefone, has admitted that after all the hours of interviews and miles of footage, he is not certain about the guilt of the father and son. Even the homemade family film, filled with slapstick and confession, is either so disingenuously crafted by another son to create the uncertainty or so naive as to be believable.With that ambiguity, ironies abound: Award-winning teacher Arnold has a sleazy secret life centering around the very students he is guiding; Arnold's ex-wife is so remote from this male-dominated family that she may not have had a clue, yet her reunion with Jesse after his prison term is amazingly joyful and honest; son Jesse disclaims helping dad with the molestations yet confesses in the end, he says, because the law and the town are stacked against him.Most fascinating to me, an amateur chronicler of my own family, is the Friedman's (and by inference, America's) obsession with documentation. The night before dad goes to prison is videotaped; the night before Jesse's incarceration, brother David records him in various poses, most of them loose and sometimes laced with self-deprecation.Jesse is videotaped outside the courthouse the day of his confession dancing a jig and generally goofing. Is this nervous energy, an act to neutralize a fear of imprisonment or an egregious act meant to outrage the judge and jury? Ambiguity rules here.David, the narrator brother, leads his life as Silly Billy, the most sought after birthday clown in new York. The irony is rich.I don't know if I can ever believe what I see again. I do know I will more carefully watch every documentary from this day forward. This one unambiguously deserved the 2003 Sundance grand jury prize.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really have to be open-minded watching this, because it deals with subject matter that's so easy for us to condemn without the will to examine. We have a man, Arnold, who is accused of child molestation after porn magazines are found in his possession. We have his son, Jesse, who is accused of being his accessory in the molestations. Jesse says that he was abused by his father at a young age and that he enjoyed the attention. Then Jesse says his lawyer made that up. A man slouched on a couch, inarticulate and seemingly placing himself in a sexual position while being interviewed for the film, gives testimony against the Friedmans that led to 35 criminal counts. Jesse claims he is innocent. Someone is lying.This is rich, complex stuff, and the filmmaker doesn't put his own views into the film. He doesn't question the interviewees outright -- although he does "catch" one guy, and contrast different remembrances, some of which indict the Friedmans, others that wave away all accusations. The story gets told to us largely through Arnold's home videos, and so we're witness to the family's self-destruction. This is Shakespeare, and there's a shattering moment when Arnold's wife, Elaine, asks, "Where did this come from?"The film is craftily put-together -- there's a shock left until the end, the kind of thing that calls into question what we've just seen -- and the filmmaker looks at the situation as a family drama, with the backdrop of the trial, where understandably furious parents try and attack Arnold ("You raped my son!"). But the film also has this sense of sleaze -- or, at least, the sense of something iffy: the sex is inherently "dirty" -- Arnold bought gay-related magazines, and the film has mentions of incest. There's a kind of public hysteria that exists, where people throw their hands up into the air when anything deviating from the sexual norm is mentioned, and refuse to even listen to an argument that suggests there might not actually be anything wrong. But I think it's important to stand back and analyze the situation before we make our decision about Arnold. He does, in fact, eventually admit to abusing one child, a son of a friend, so he is a molester; whether or not he abused the children that he taught and that is the subject of the documentary is another matter; my own feeling is that the evidence is pretty sketchy, and that he was made an example out of for possessing magazines. (And he does openly admit to having experimented sexually with his brother -- whose admission at the end of the film is revelatory -- and his lawyer says that Arnold expressed arousal at one young boy bouncing on his father's lap when the lawyer visited Arnold in jail.) It's my belief that there's nothing wrong with Arnold's pedophiliac desire and owning of child pornography. (Although obviously the purchasing of pornography fuels the industry which in turn exploits and abuses more children, but I'm talking specifically about his mental state.) If he didn't act on his desires, then he does not deserve to have his life and his family's life torn to shreds. As the film goes on, it becomes clear that Arnold, this somewhat meek, nebbish figure, probably isn't the monster he's made out to be. One student made claims against him, we learn, to "get them off my back," meaning the investigators. That claim led to 16 criminal counts. Some of the charges against Arnold sound horrific, but are pretty unbelievable, like the idea he lined the children up naked in a leap frog position, and then proceeded to penetrate them one by one. (The simple mechanics of male-male intercourse don't make it that easy.) The police claimed that Arnold had stacks upon stacks of child (or, really, adolescent teen) pornography; yet his wife never managed to see them, and the photos of the house taken during the investigation show nothing. These are the reasons that prove Arnold's innocence, not the comments made, like the one by Jesse's friend, who says that he couldn't be a violent molester because he was so quiet in everyday life. (We all know how wrong-headed that idea is.) This is a terrific documentary; the investigation and the children's memories all swirling together, but what makes it so crushing is how it affects the family. The looks and the words and the shadows of doubt they cast on one another is far worse than any jail sentence. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented Capturing the Friedmans out of curiosity. I have read about these child molestation cases made during the eighties in which many innocent people were sent to jail because of the incompetency and lack of experience the cops had in dealing with these cases. The documentary centers around the destruction of a family after Arnold Friedman (patriarch) and the youngest son, Jesse, are accused of committing horrible acts against children. Arnold Friedman as it turned out was into kiddie porn and he got busted and then led to a series of accusations made against him by his students. The documentary uses footages filmed by the Friedmans that captured all the events and reactions during the trial. It was like the film Happiness, but only real. Watching the film I saw glimpses under the surfaces of these seemingly "normal and happy" people. The eldest son, David, is angry and in denial of his father's homosexuality and pedophilia. Elaine Friedman is a woman who had lost all identity of herself and eventually begins to turn on David (who still resents his mother to this day), Seth (the middle son) refused to be interviewed for the documentary but he is shown in the features. What is fascinating and even laughable is how the cops who were handling the case were incompetent and they coerced the "victims" with the exception of one "victim" whose face and name are anonymous. I for one analyzed and found that while Arnold Friedman may have been the one that was guilty I felt sorry for him and yet angry. He knew that his own guilt and his own perversions were not only convicting him, but they were putting his family in danger and they were the ones in trial. I don't think that Jesse Friedman did anything nor was he abused by his father. I am sure that Arnold may have played out his fantasies in his head and possibly with one or two children, but I do not think he made any advances against or even harmed his sons. I felt that the real bad guys were the lawyers and the cops who investigated and coerced the testimonies of the children interviewed and the majority of the children who accused Arnold and Jesse Friedman later on recanted their testimonies and said that nothing happened and that they only said what they said to make the interviews stop. Hell, a parent even said that a police officer threatened his son into testifying against the Friedmans. If you are a psychology or criminology major than this is a great film to study.It is also sad because we see a family being ripped apart by secrets that are convicting them and putting them before the public. Capturing The Friedmans is a fascinating character study and a devastating one to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few years ago, Andrew Jarecki set out making a documentary about children's party entertainers in New York. After spending a couple of weeks interviewing the city's number one birthday party clown, David Friedman, he realized that there was a more interesting story to tell, and pitched his original idea.That story is Jarecki's painful and compelling documentary `Capturing the Friedmans', the story of a family that is torn apart by the family patriarch's (Arnold Friedman) penchant for child pornography who is caught receiving pornographic material in the mail. The ensuing investigation (or witch hunt, depending on your perspective) by the Nassau County police leads to two arrests (Arnold Friedman and his youngest son Jesse) for pedophilia, among many other things. The question posed is, based on the evidence presented, and the integrity of the investigation, are the subjects guilty?The Friedman family are a fascinating study of the American family, and it is painful to watch them fall apart. Due to Arnold Friedman's fascination with film and video, there are an abundance of home movies shot by the family members themselves to assist Jarecki in showing us the `real' family; and what we see is not always pretty ? especially once David, in an almost prophetic way, decides to document the family almost continuously after the arrests. In the footage other than the home videos, Jarecki provides us with thorough interviews with members of the investigative team, the judge who oversaw the charges, the family members and some of the alleged victims themselves. The further the investigation digs, the more precarious the evidence becomes, and the result is both frustrating and amazing; a documentary that doesn't give us all of the answers ? mainly because the true answers may never be uncovered.`Capturing the Friedmans' was an Oscar nominated documentary in a year that brought us several strong documentaries such as `Balseros' and `The Fog of War'. Andrew Jarecki provides us with enough food for thought to serve a seven course meal, and while the subject matter isn't pleasant, and is often depressing, it is a very compelling story and well presented film that makes the viewer look beyond the surface to achieve their own conclusion.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The outline of Hysteria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outstanding documentary, which demonstrates how quickly life can fall apart for anyone. The center of attention, of course, is Arnold Friedman, a pedophile whose personal issues create a firestorm that destroys his own life, but more tragically, the lives of his children. There are so many facets to this documentary that it amazes me that they could all be captured in the film's running time. Several important issues are highlighted; front and center is the hysteria surrounding pedophilia that emerged in the late eighties. Amidst the background of the McMartin and "Little Rascals" trials and the culture of quack psychology (repressed memories, hypnotic suggestion) emerged the case of Arnold Friedman.The most interesting aspect of this case was that Friedman was a pedophile - there is no doubt about that. The question is whether he was guilty of the crimes charged, more than 300 charges of child abuse. Furthermore, could his son and assistant, Jesse, also be guilty? The filmmaker does not force out any answers to that question, but the testimonies of his accusers and the incompetent buffoonery of the police involved in the case lead one to conclude that the answer is a resounding "No." The crimes are only part of the story. The true story lies in the destruction of the Friedman family. Arnold, the eccentric intellectual and apparently loving father turns out to be feeble and a pedohpile, a man crippled by guilt. Elaine, the "loving wife and mother" who is frozen out by her family turns out to be a weaker human being than her husband, bowing under pressure to administer horrifying "advice" to her youngest son. The brothers, lead by the eldest, fight a losing battle to save their family. One of the most tragic and moving pictures I have seen in ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pro or Con: A brilliant look at a family imploding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing some of the parties involved in the actual case I was curious to see the film to see how they came across on the big screen. I was however reluctant to see it since the furor over who did what or who didn't or who's lying or not was clouding my perception of the film from the get go.I let time pass and finally sat down to watch the film once I thought things had calmed down.As a document of a family on the path to destruction I am floored by the film. This is a heart breaking exploration of how things are not what we think they are and how character flaws can and will wipe out the ones we love.(Although I think Character flaws is the wrong term)A great deal of the later half of the film dances around whether Jesse, the son who pleaded guilty to the charges, was really guilty. Its here I found the film to be slightly flawed because to me the film wants to have it both ways, him guilty and innocent. I think the film makers should have picked aside, since what they have done here seems less than subjective and fair (to either side) This is a tough film. If you can't handle frank sexual talk about child molestation then stay away. However, if you want to see an excellent film about a family in crisis then see this film.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on double DVD. Sort of a SPOILER, although there is no plot or ending to be "spoiled." Of interest here is the journey, not the destination. A "you decide" type of film.In advance, it is helpful to know that this documentary originally was intended to be a light-hearted piece about professional birthday-party clowns in Manhattan, but the familial heavy baggage of one of its primary subjects, oldest son David Friedman, led to this darker and more compelling story of a family destroyed by human flaws and fate. The viewer can opine whether the cost to these individuals was appropriate and justified. And the viewer also can become emotionally invested in whether any redemption or restitution is still in the future for members of this family.`Capturing the Friedmans' is a short synthesis of many hours of available documentation from multiple sources, reflecting snowballing events that occurred over months and years during the mid to late 1980s in Long Island, New York. In the shadow of the California `McMartin pre-school' alleged sexual abuse scandal, the somewhat unassuming and admired schoolteacher/musician Arnold Friedman was caught by postal examiners receiving and sending pedophilia pornography.This aberration evolved during Arnie's childhood, was acted on to at least a limited degree twice in adulthood, and was a source of guilt and worry to him with respect to his own three sons. A subsequent zealous investigation resulted in Arnie and youngest son Jesse, 18, being accused of sexually abusing many young boys during home computer classes. Under conditions interpreted as nearly hopeless for the defense, both ultimately felt forced to plead guilty to hundreds of counts of abuse. Jesse was recently freed after serving 13 years of a 6-18 year sentence. After an insurance provision was satisfied wherein Jesse would be the beneficiary, Arnold committed suicide in 1995 during his 10-30 year prison term.The film addresses perceptions of reality as related to association, persuasion, selective memory, exaggeration, groupthink, and mass hysteria. It is unforgettable* and provokes strong and contradictory opinions, an indication of the film's strength and balance and of its construction and editing. People will even argue passionately about the `true' meaning of the title without coming to agreement on which is `right.'(* but what each person focuses on and remembers from the film is as variable as the memories of those involved in the original events!)Apparently the first cut of the film was more than 5 hours in length, and presumably just a portion of such edited material is included on the companion DVD. Understandably, a limited number of principle parties were interested in participating in this documentary - whether anonymously or identified - with personal and professional credibility at stake and with the cushion of time upon which to reflect and reevaluate. Middle son Seth Friedman declined involvement.Watching the film is a bit like sitting through an abbreviated version of trials that never occurred, with a few needed short breaks thrown in. But less like a courtroom, the film alternately weaves plaintiff and defendant evidence and testimony in a manner that keeps the viewer `jury' both alert and interested. We certainly are influenced by the filmmakers' decisions of what to include in the final edit and the order in which the material is presented, just as we would be with courtroom decisions over what evidence and testimony could even be introduced. We also see background material that we likely would never see in a courtroom setting.I believe that the director pursued this documentary, a tangent of his original intended subject matter, without prejudice and that he did a good job of presenting a succinct and balanced perspective (a `Cliff's Notes' version of the story). Some of the evidence speaks for itself, and other things are more ambiguous. The demeanor and interview presentation of one anonymous alleged victim, from whom a significant number of the charges originated after his post-hypnotic `recollections,' was not staged to influence the viewer. One alleged victim's testimony would require that he had been molested approximately once every thirty minutes during all the time he spent in the Friedman home.In an included Charlie Rose interview, the director admits that he felt as though all parties he interviewed had a personal `agenda' except perhaps for Jesse himself. We, the viewers, don't really know the significance or importance of material not included in the film and extra disk. Although the director does not admit a personal stand on the total `truth' in this story, he does express affection for the very imperfect family whom he got to know quite well over the 3-year project life. Auxiliary film footage after a Tribeca (NYC) premier showing of the film captures questions and discussion from an audience that included many of the principles interviewed in the documentary. Emotions still run high. Yours probably will, too. I hope the film wins an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpleasant Theme, Great Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 80's, in the upper-middle-class district of Great Neck, the awarded Professor Arnold Friedman is arrested for possession of some magazines of child pornography. A further investigation of the police discloses that apparently Arnold and his eighteen years old son Jesse molested his young students during their private computer class. Their Jewish family tears apart with the situation and the sentences of Arnold and Jesse."Capturing the Friedmans" deals with two very unpleasant themes, pedophilia and destruction of a family, and is a great documentary. The director Andrew Jarecki presents both sides of the contradictory story with a total exemption and neutrality. Arnold had filmed or photographed the major events of his family since he had been dating Elaine. In the 80's, camcorders were very popular and the Friedman's sons followed the costume of their father, recording their meetings and discussions. Andrew Jarecki discloses the privacy of the Friedmans and shows many ambiguous situations through the footages of their homemade videos and interviews. The viewers can witness the process of an apparently normal family being completely shattered. In the end, we see manipulation, ambiguity, contradiction in the case, but never the truth. Therefore it is impossible to judge and have opinion if Arnold and Jesse Friedman were guilty or not. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Na Captura dos Friedmans" ("Capturing the Friedmans")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but I did wonder WHY I was watching it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1984 a seemingly normal, middleclass Jewish family is ripped apart by allegations of child abuse. Arnold Friedman comes to the attention of the authorities when child pornography is found in his post, however this soon opens up to dozens of charges that state Arnold and his 18 year old son systematically abused the children in their computer club. This documentary follows the story using interviews and home movie footage from the time.I came to this film as a fan of documentary features, despite not really knowing anything about it; the trailers had been careful to be very coy about the nature of the event that ripped the family apart - a coyness that was not carried into the film. As such I found it very difficult viewing, and many others may wish to avoid this as it is not a fun way to spend 90 or so minutes as descriptions are a bit too graphic at times and some may find the allegations upsetting. The film follows the allegations though to the very end and it is almost consistently engaging - only near the end did I start to feel fatigue; given the subject matter this film is heavy going and could have lost some running time. The film is difficult to describe and, after seeing it, I'm not sure why anyone would really want to see it.It is not as simple as exposing the truth. If anything the film seems to be pointing out how truth is actually a very easy thing to control - it highlights bad practice by the authorities, weaknesses in the testimonies and areas where mistakes (or lies) had been made. This makes it more difficult - it basically requires us to care about the injustice done to Arnold but at the same time telling us he is a paedophile. To many of us this is an abhoration and it is easy to confuse a paedophile with a child abuser, however many of the things he confesses to in his past are horrid and it made him very hard to get behind. This is a big problem as the film is complex both subject wise and morally, again making it very hard work.However unpleasant the subject matter, the film is worth seeing to see how one family is destroyed by a witch-hunt that would happen just the same today as it did then. As one of the police officers comments - even being accused of this crime basically means that the accused's life is over. The home movie footage is well used and puts us in a situation where we don't have to rely on the interviews to tell us how things went.Overall this is a gripping film but one that deals with a morally complex subject that makes it very hard work to watch and is certainly not going to fill a cinema on a Saturday night! Several times I thought about leaving the film as I was simply bewildered by it, not knowing what it was saying, what I was mean to be feeling or even why I had come to see a film about a paedophile who had been accused of multiple counts of child abuse. For that reason I wondered why this film had proved so popular - who, upon hearing the subject matter, thinks that this is the film for them? Certainly the handful of people in the cinema with me (on the opening weekend) seemed to contest to the limited `appeal' of this feature. It is a gripping and interesting film, but I have no intention of seeing it again and doubt I could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capturing the Friedmans is an extraordinary documentary about a family collapsing, when the otherwise respectable Arnold Friedman is discovered in possession of child-pornography. Subsequently he and his son Jesse are charged with hundreds and hundreds of counts of child-molestation. This is a fascinating, tragic, and complex subject for a documentary, and this film is brilliantly made.It contains no narrative voice, nor does is seek to come to any firm conclusions. The story is developed through interviews with the people involved (members of the family, lawyers, police, the judge, former victims and their families, relevant experts,...) and these various characters often give sharply conflicting versions of events, so much so that the viewer is left seriously wondering how much truth there ever was in the charges against Arnold and Jesse. At the very least the police investigation seems to have been conducted with disastrous ineptitude. But if this is a miscarriage of justice, it's not a clear-cut one: Arnold really was a paedophile, albeit a very likable one, and he may, or he may not have abused Jesse as a child, (subject to whether you believe Jesse or his lawyer). It's the desire to know the truth (which we never can), and to separate out these tortuous issues, which really sucks the viewer in.However what makes Capturing the Friedmans so remarkable and unique is that long before director Andrew Jarecki took an interest in the case, David Friedman (another of Arnold's sons) was already there in the thick of it, filming everything. Through his camcorder we intrude on the privacy of a family in crisis: for instance we really see the unbearable strain it has to endure as Arnold prepares for his trial. Later we see him bravely enjoying his last night of freedom. The family is blown apart in front of our eyes, you won't have seen anything like it.Throughout the film I had the feeling that even without the child-abuse charges, a film about the Friedmans would still have been worth watching. Certainly they were a interestingly dysfunctional group anyway: take the unsatisfactory relationship Elaine (Arnold's wife) had towards her husband and sons. All the characters are lively and charismatic individuals, and in happier circumstances you feel this could have been a funny and charming film: this adds to the sense of loss though, because this film is neither funny nor charming. Whatever the truth about the allegations of abuse, this film is the uncompromising and riveting human story of a family being dragged through a living hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Does a firm persuasion that a thing is so, make it so?" - William Blake.Documentaries differ from films in that they engage with the world as the world exists in reality. Bill Nichols, an American historian and theoretician of documentary film, says that they do this in three ways. Firstly, they offer a depiction of the world as it actually exists or existed in real life. Secondly, they stand for or represent the interests of others. Thirdly, documentaries represent the world in the same way that a lawyer represents a client. They put forth a case based on facts, details and evidence.That, according to Jean-Luc Godard, is all crap. According to Godard, when making a documentary you inevitably always end up making fiction. It is impossible for the director to avoid colouring the film with his or her own ideas and impressions. Likewise, when you work with fiction, it is inevitable that the film becomes part documentary, as events and actions from the world find their way into the film. Thus spake Godard."Capturing the Friedmans" is a documentary comprised of home video footage taken during a famous child abuse case in the 1980s. It records events dryly, but has been edited as a work of fiction would, omitting facts and revealing key details at specific points, all with the intent of manipulating its audience.The plot: Arnold Friedman is a retired Professor who lives in the suburban town of Great Neck with his wife (Elaine) and 3 boys (Seth, David, Jessie). Arnold orders child pornography from a supplier in Denmark. The FBI intercept his mail and raid his home. They find stacks of child pornography hidden in his basement. Arnold's wife comes home and is shocked to find the police everywhere. "It's okay," Arnold tells his wife, "it's just a misunderstanding." A police investigation begins, and pretty soon the town is in a state of hysteria. It turns out Arnold teaches an after-school computer class in his basement. Over 40 children are members, including Arnold's youngest son, Jesse. The FBI begin to question the student's in Arnold's class. They force testimonies out of the kids and untruthfully paint Arnold as a child molester who sodomised each and every one of them. Arnold is convicted of abusing these children, though to this day there is no evidence to suggest that he did.Looking through the extras on the DVD, it is clear that the filmmakers had enough material to make a stronger case for Arnold's innocence. The guy was railroaded. He didn't sodomise any of the kids. In the final film, however, the director chooses to maintain an air of ambiguity.When people get together in large groups, facts are always stretched thin between them. Too many minds trying to figure out a common picture results in a distortion. Vague ideas get taken for granted as truth. A kind of herd instinct kicks in, where everyone follows everyone else. In Great Neck, this occurred. Arnold was a paedophile, so suddenly he just HAD to have abused all the children in his class. Pretty soon he was being tried for over 250 cases of abuse, and every family in the town was pushing their sons or daughters to confess to being molested. It was insane.But the films works better as an intimate character piece than as a broad portrait of a community. We see, up close, Arnold's guilt ridden face. We watch as his sons, completely in denial, protectively stand by his side. And we observe his wife, bullied by her boys for siding against their father. It's all very sad.What's even more sad are the details about Arnold's past. As a child Arnold lived with his mother and his brother in a small one room apartment. The family shared a bed and were very intimate. Arnold's mother would bring men over and have sex in front of her sons. When Arnold reached sexual maturity he was apparently confused and dysfunctional. He claims to have experimented sexually on his brother, but his brother denies this. There are also rumours that Arnold himself was molested by his father before the divorce of his parents. Without a father figure, and with this tortured past, both brothers seem to have grown up with a warped sense of sexuality. Arnold is sexually attracted to children, while his brother, as the documentary reveals at the end, is a homosexual.These dysfunctions have now been passed on for a third generation. Arnold admits to molesting Jesse, though Jesse, like Arnold's brother, denies this. Arnold's son David is unmarried and is now a clown working in New York. He performs for children.Nobody knows the causes of paedophilia. It's either due to genetic or psychosocial factors. Some think it's a kind of arrested emotional development. The paedophile is attracted to children because he has never matured psychologically. Others see it as a natural, genetic glitch, while some regard paedophilia as the result of a need to dominate a sexual partner. Since children are smaller and usually weaker than adults, they may be regarded as nonthreatening potential partners. This drive for domination is sometimes thought to explain why most paedophiles are males. But nobody knows. Yet.9/10- Worth one viewing. Seeing Arnold's children in denial, and his wife struggling to cope with truths we sense she always knew, is all very heartbreaking.

		<shortDescription>Going in diverging directions, Capturing the Friedmans captures an odd family but little else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Capturing the Friedmans' is an exercise in patience. What we discover quickly is not very informative, and that which we discover late leaves us little to go on.The Friedmans are a strange lot, this is clear from the beginning. What is not so clear is whether they are guilty. Father and son are accused of sex crimes involving minors and, in the father's case, a rather compelling charge of obtaining child pornography.With charges as severe as this, you would expect a documentary of inquisition and thoughtfulness. You would expect the type of damning charges seen in The Thin Blue Line. Instead, we receive a collage of Friedman home videos that show the family as a disjointed collection of believers and non-believers.We are shown, as expected, the police investigation and then the lawyers analysis, and naturally the family's reaction. However, instead of bonding together in a time of strife, the family explodes and is filmed by one of the sons who has recently purchased a video camera.This must have been a strange time and Andrew Jarecki, director of the film, goes to great lengths to explore this oddness. But it is at this point in the film that Jarecki's narrative falls apart. Going in diverging directions, 'Capturing the Friedmans' captures an odd family but little else.A documentary can exist as an investigative device. It can explore new leads to these pedophile charges. It can also serve as a fly on the wall, especially with the footage the filmmakers were given from the family. But about a third of the way through I felt like I had been had. I felt as if Jarecki was blatantly wanting me to question the charges, and then in turn, question my own doubts.Instead of letting the film unfold on its own terms, Capturing the Friedmans forces an issue that leaves the audience pondering the truth, even if it has created the mystery for them. ** / ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame on Jarecki</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining story, and even good film making. However, Andrew Jarecki should be ashamed of the biased point of view he MANIPULATED in this film. Is this a case of one Jewish person (Jarecki) defending a Jewish family (Friedmans)? As a new yorker myself who is not Jewish, I understand how Jewish folks stick together...But this is crossing the line and is an absolute disgrace! Jarecki left out ABSOLUTELY INCRIMINATING evidence, footage, and persons involved in this. Jesse and Arnold are without a shadow of a doubt GUILTY, and this film makes an unethical attempt to raise that doubt and draw sympathy for these predators and monsters.How dare you defend these two individuals!!! Jarecki is a FRAUD for this. There was a 3rd predator who was to testify against Jesse &amp; Arnold about the abuse, there was an overwhelming amount of child pornography that was found (NOT A STACK OF MAGAZINES THAT JARECKI DOWNPLAYED THIS INTO). Jarecki talked to 3-5 victims out of 17 (admitted by Jesse Friedman). Jarecki left out Jesse Friedmans total admission to everything in an interview from jail with Geraldo Rivera as well. You can check it out for yourself, but don't for a minute let Jarecki fool you that these monsters are anything but sick, sick individuals who destroyed dozens of lives.

		<shortDescription>More of a fiction rather than documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nassau County district attorney, Kathleen M. Rice, re-investigated the case of Jesse Friedman in 2013 to determine whether his conviction should be upheld or overturned. Their report, prepared by an independent review panel, demonstrate Capturing the Friedman's is, in the mildest terms 'incomplete, and in some points, even incorrect, either case misleading.Here are some of the key points taken from the report (which can be found online in District Attorney's web site). With respect to the Jesse Friedman case, the report says: " None of the five individuals who Friedman advocates suggest "recanted" have, in fact, recanted to any degree of legal certainty. Three have not recanted at all. Reviews of transcripts concerning these individuals reveal that abuse occurred. Another who spoke to the Review Team stood by his account, in contrast to the statement he gave to filmmakers. The subject of the most recent purported recantation has refused to speak to the Review Team or even confirm he wrote the letter outlining the claim, which was provided to the Review Team by Jesse Friedman's lawyer." "Unedited film transcripts of Judge Abbey Boklan and Detective Anthony Squeglia show that each was the subject of selectively edited and misleading film portrayals in Capturing the Friedmans." "The "Meyers Tape" ? one of only two pieces of direct evidence of heavy-handed police interviewing techniques cited by Friedman, his advocates and the Court ? is, in fact, no tape at all. All that remains of a tape that hasn't existed for more than two decades are notes taken during its screening by a Jesse Friedman attorney. Those notes, presumably limited to information the attorney found helpful to his client's case, were then reduced and curated by filmmakers, and read dramatically by Friedman's attorney in Capturing the Friedmans." "A sworn affidavit from the therapist who treated former student "Computer Student One," stated that she never performed hypnosis on the child. A portion of an unedited transcript of the film's interview with "Computer Student One" contradicted his claim of pre-outcry hypnosis and had been edited out. "Computer Student One" claimed in a 2004 media report that Capturing the Friedmans "twisted" his account. The filmed allegations of "Computer Student One" remain the only direct evidence offered by Friedman or his advocates suggesting that hypnosis was used to induce victims to make accusations in this case."I also find it difficult to understand how these basic facts are totally omitted in the documentary, such as: "While maintaining his innocence prior to his eventual guilty plea, Friedman commissioned and failed at least two lie-detector tests."Overall I found the film, especially the narcissism still preserved in Friedmans' character interesting enough to google the case. In this sense, I guess that makes it good fiction movie, but still not a documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, but not what you would expect. Watch this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well if you want to start a fight with your girlfriend. Watch this movie.This is actually a brilliantly told story,and really well don for featuring both sides of the story. The rest of this review could probably be int he philosophy section. Anyhoo.How can a documentary about a crime syndicate be two sided? Well the problem is, that is how we approach most documentaries about crime. Usually we already know that Ted Bundy and Charles Manson committed the crimes, and we are watching to find out how. So that is how this movie starts. An affluent US suburb on a peninsula of Long Island is rocked when customs officials, following the trail of some child pornography magazines, find the owner also teaches computer classes to young boys from his home. The officials go door knocking and all of a sudden the suburb is racked when a bunch of little kids start coming forth about the terrible abuse they suffered there. There are some interviews with people, family of the abuser, and victims too, but its hard to like any of them. Somethings not right. But you follow the scenes like any normal documentary. Then there are some inconsistencies. The police say there were piles of pornographic magazines everywhere - but photos THEY took don't show any. The only witnesses who testified about the abuse are pretty screwed up characters, but this is a situation that you would expect to leave any one screwed up. But it all starts to unravel as you get further into the case. The son of the abusing computer teacher is now brought into the case, some victims claim he is much worse.If this was happening in your neighborhood - wouldn't you do anything to make sure they both spent the rest of their lives in jail. But slowly, and cleverly,director Andrew Jarecki draws your attention to the gaps in the case. And its a tough sell. Child molesters need to go to jail, for protection of more kids, and to stop others from doing it. But what if the cops were so intent on the idea of child molestation rings, that they made sure they found it? What if there one hole in the case was that the son had been there, and would bear witness that the father had NOT done any of those things. So they made sure the son was implicated? Is that possible?The real crux of the matter is how the students were repeatedly and forcefully coerced into testifying. They started off not knowing anything about abuse, but the cops were intent on getting the information they expected from the kids, until some kids just broke down. Did little kids tell the cops what they wanted to hear to get respite? One witness admitted that he didn't remember anything until he was hypnotized, and to this day it is still so clear. But hypnotism has been shown to implant suggested memories as easily as uncover real ones. The real bone of contention here is now about how you feel about a potential child molester walking free, but about the perversion of the US justice system. And that's why this is so difficult to talk about. If you shout for the side of justice to be served, others see you (indeed the whole community at the time would view you) as a pervert protector... So you can imagine, naysayers keep their mouths shut, while angry parents and community members rally their hate, anger and coerce and bully and ensure the Friedmans go away for a long time.But is it right to punish anyone like that with falsified evidence just in case? If thats' true, couldn't it happen to you?The toughest part of this case was the fact that Friedman himself, confessed to like young boys, and having crossed the line with two young boys in another incident many years ago - but this does not mean that him or his son did these terrible things to those children - but its such a sensitive issue - no one will talk about it. Until this movie. I challenge you to watch this with loved ones, and come out agreeing on what actually happened and what should happen....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A loveless marriage between a paedophile and a woman who, having had three sons, loses her identity was bound to end in trouble. But the more we learn about this sorry family, the less we're sure what to feel about them. One minute they are the victims of a vindictive world, the next they are so utterly reprehensible that they deserve everything that befalls them.Though he outwardly presents his story in a matter-of-fact manner, Jarecki manipulates emotions by repeatedly pulling the rug from beneath the viewer, revelation by contradictory revelation. His compelling film raises more questions than it answers and is less concerned with the mechanics of the case and the American legal system than what it says about the Friedmans and the society they inhabit. With physical evidence being non-existent, Arnold and Jesse Friedman provide more convincing testimony against themselves than any of their accusers ? victims, neighbours or lawfolk. But however trumped-up the charges against them, they are clearly guilty of something. Eldest brother David is simply too angry to offer any objectivity, so to make the extent of their transgressions clear, we need the accounts of many more believable witnesses and ? ideally - middle brother Seth, who declined to be interviewed.What we do learn is that suburbia is a strange and scary place... and there is nothing scarier than knowing nothing about the people next door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the view of a historian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the comments here on IMDB, I was really intrigued about seeing Capturing the Friedmans. However, shortly into the film my training as a historian kicked in. Now, I am no film critic, nevertheless, I have studied documentary film making, and as a historian I must warn those that view this film that the documentarian's methodology is a bit sketchy. If you saw the film in the theater, then you missed the discussion sessions included in the special features of the DVD. Here it is revealed, by those involved in the investigation (judge, detectives, lawyers) that many important details were left out of the movie: the three other adults accused of sexual misconduct associated with the case, that Arnold confessed and gave police the names of the children he had abused so they could interview them, that Jesse went on Geraldo (against the advise of his lawyer - and a signed affidavit declaring as such) and confessed to the American public that he has been abused by Arnold, that the private investigator never contacted the Great Neck police and never reviewed first hand the evidence of the case - and much more stuff that when left out of the documentary skews the viewers perception of the case and creates a false context. This is irresponsible on the part of the documentarian - and altogether bad history.Here is the big question: What was it about the case that made Jesse confess, and why was his mother pushing it so hard? The documentarian should have grappled with this. It would seem to me that a trail would have been in the best favor for Jesse - since a great deal of what he was accused of seems so unrealistic - given the lack of physical evidence. However, there must have been something else, something that the prosecution had that would have damaged the defense's case. This must have motivated Jesse's mother to push for the plea bargain - it must have saved time, money, and years on Jesse's sentence. But the documentarian gives us no glimpse into that, and take away aspects of the case, and is completely irresponsible as a documentarian.Do I believe Jesse is guilty? Yes. In the footage of the Judge addressing a crowd during the Q&amp;A at the Great Neck premiere of the video, she makes a pretty convincing case that Jesse's new claim to innocence is retrospective back peddling - and don't even get me started about David.So, this is just a bit of what I think about Capturing the Friedmans. Let me know what you all think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Narcissistic Media Mirror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started out as a documentary about New York City kiddie-party clowns and ended up about a Great Neck, Long Island father and son convicted of serial child molestations. This is PBS's "An American Family" gone sour, but "An American Family" nonetheless, in other words, still another round of the narcissistic preoccupation of Americans with themselves, that constant media mirror we keep peering into. In fact, this film would never have been made had the family in question, the Friedmans, not accumulated copious records of themselves on 8 mm film and videotape. But just as "reality TV" isn't real because the presence of the camera alters the thing observed, this film isn't entirely real because it only goes as deep as home movies and headlines.By now we've all heard about how false testimony can be enticed out of young impressionable children by cops asking loaded questions like "He molested you, didn't he?" We all know children, eager to please, tend to answer "Yes, officer, he did," when it's not true. We all remember the St. Martin preschool scandal; people connected with it even appear in this film. The titillation is old. The "Peyton-Place" scandal-amid-the-respectable has been done to death. The skeletons that come out of the closet (pun) here are no big deal. Haven't we all heard about some Uncle Ernie or other who likes to fiddle with little boys, or "I saw something nasty in the woodshed!"?Errol Morris does this sort of thing much better ("The Thin Blue Line"). Where he captures the timeless lurking just beneath the surface of the ordinary, Jarecki swamps us with just the ordinary. His movie is as soggy as the pun in its title. And, I must confess, I didn't like or find interesting the people involved. Frankly, they got on my nerves. They go on and on and on, blathering away, as if stars of their own home movie. Beware, the reviewers are waxing poetic about this film's expert handling of "maddening ambiguity," the elusive nature of truth, and a great crime mystery, but the sordid tale told here isn't that much different from the run-of-the-mill gutter dregs served up nightly by such TV shows as "48 Hours." What really happened isn't all that hard to figure out; it's just that the film deals with it in such a round-about way, teasing us instead of boldly confronting the truth. The only thing intriguing to me is the pivotal role played surreptitiously by the mothers, Arnold Friedman's and his son's mother, his wife. These were both absent parents, women who in their different ways abdicated motherhood, cheated their sons. They are the unspoken source springs for all the moral mischief and unhappiness, each quietly evil in her own way. (Errol Morris wouldn't have missed this, e.g.,"Mr. Death.") But both the traditional American exaltation of Mom and the more recent feminism will make it highly unlikely that anyone will dare think this unthinkable, utter this unutterable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there anything scarier than a children's clown?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capturing the Friedmans: 4/10: Child Molestation, family dysfunction, mass hysteria, homosexuality, and clowns: Where do I sign up. Filmmaker Andrew Jarecki was making a documentary on the high priced children's clown Silly Billy (David Friedman). A very angry and irrational clown that will play into every clown stereotype you will ever have (Think serial killer). Well it turns out David is the older brother and son of the two men convicted in a famous child molestation case. during the witch hunt style child molestation hysteria, of the late eighties.Could the Friedmans also be victims of same said hysteria? Innocent men railroaded to prison? Well it turns out no. If you're looking for a documentary on the abuse of the justice system, especially in such cases, keep looking. If you want a voyeuristic look inside a upper middle class Jewish family one southern twang away from Jerry Springer welcome home. Without the child molestation charges this would be a hilarious romp. Each family member from the angry clown to the screeching mother is a gift that keeps on giving. Using home footage that manages to capture moments that reality television can only dream of. Capturing the Friedmans gives you a ringside seat next to a family imploding upon itself. Unfortunately much of the movie concentrates on the child molestation case at hand. Trying to create suspense and play with the idea that the two men are innocent, the movie sets itself up for a fall. While some of the charges are clearly trumped up (naked group leapfrog?), the father is also clearly guilty (and pleads accordingly). The son Jesse, whose case is on shakier ground, doesn't help his own cause by pleading guilty himself and having zero defense witnesses. (I.E. none of the boys supposedly there come forward and say he didn't do these things.)Jarecki clearly was playing with the hand he was dealt. And while he had an incredible collection of home movies fall into his lap, his attempts at turning it into a documentary about the American judicial system fall flat. On the other hand if I were looking at spending six months filming Silly Billy the clown I would grasp for straws too.</fullReview>

But as a big fan of documentaries that deal with the human psyche, I re- watched it a couple of days ago, I probably paid more attention to it this time and by the end of the documentary I felt SO frustrated because I had NO idea who was telling the truth and who wasn't, my opinion changed completely, I did consider the possibility that maybe public hysteria had sent two innocent men to prison, although I absolutely despise paedophiles and abusers, I wasn't certain after my second viewing if these men had indeed committed those heinous crimes. I went to bed that night and was unable to sleep, I was THAT engrossed in the story and THAT curious, I wanted to make my mind up, reach my own verdict, so I did a bit more research the next day and some more reading on the matter and I finally reached my own conclusion. My personal view is now that the film maker was definitely biased, the comments he makes in the documentary and the interviews he presents were carefully selected, he tries to show Jesse as an innocent person trapped in this scandal, paying for his father's ('minor') sins and omits loads of details about the evidence used to incarcerate him AND Arnold. But after reading on the case I think he is as guilty as sin, his personality as described by the psychologist who analysed him trying to work on his defence fits perfectly with the way a person who was abused as a child by a parent and with a distorted view of the world, of what's right or wrong, would be like, once grown up. Obviously, he is a victim too, because his actions as a young man were only the result of his twisted upbringing. For those of you interested in the full picture, Jesse's case was recently reviewed (June 2013) and you can read the full transcript with all the details of this case, evidence and statements provided here: http://www.nassaucountyny.gov/agencies/DA/NewsReleases /2013/documents/Conviction-Integrity-Review-People-v- Jesse-Friedman-FINAL.pdfAll in all, I found this documentary thrilling, the only people I felt for were Arnold's wife, Elaine who had to endure the bullying behaviour from her husband and sons most of her life and Arnold's brother, Howard, who seemed sincere and well meaning and who was a victim too. David, the older brother was extremely irritating in his blind loyalty towards his father and brother, I kept shaking my head at how intense and stubborn he was in denying anything inappropriate at all ever happened, even when Arnold himself had already confessed, putting full blame on to his long suffering mother. I guess you can understand his upset, but I wonder if anyone at all, after watching this documentary, would really hire him as a clown for their children's parties. Who would want him around their kids?! Even if HE himself didn't commit a crime, with his family history who would want to take the risk? Why did he choose that specific profession? It is unfortunate that he would choose to work around little kids. Another thing that I was left wondering was... Why did Arnold apparently only abuse the youngest son? Did he ever try it with Seth or David? If so, could they have blocked it out of their minds too like Howard did? This documentary definitely makes you think and for that I give it 7 stars, I would have given it more if the maker had not been SO biased in favour of Jesse, and Arnold to some extent. A must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still not entirely sure whom to believe. This is a testament as to how good this documentary is on denial, family, lies, love, and horror. I would certainly recommend it to whomever wishes to feel real badly about human nature and the evil ways that it manifests itself. Belief in WHATEVER is so powerful and it never ceases to amaze me how we are able to convince ourselves of ANYTHING. I say this only because this family is in absolute denial and they have genuinely convinced themselves that there father is innocent of all charges. With so much damning evidence, it is hard to believe that anyone, with any sense, would not prematurely convict this man of the horrors he committed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remarkably well crafted documentary takes us straight to Creepytown USA, and we can't wait to ask the tour guide questions.Capturing the Friedmans is not so much a search for truth, as it is a portrait of illness itself, and how it transmits through individual to family and on to the community at Large. The family's ordeal was recorded by both the lenses of the media and their own movie cameras. Building with this footage, director Andrew Jarecki shows us the Friedmans.Arnold, uses his home video as a document of his progress beyond dysfunction. At times, the home video footage almost seems like amateur propaganda. Almost as if the Friedmans were trying to manufacture their own evidence. Creating the facade of a whole family.Most of the people interviewed seem to have their own agendas as well. Especially the police.Evidence and opinion layers, it fascinates and frustrates. frustratingly ? inconclusive ways. The only clear answer in "Friedmans" was that they collapsed under decades of secrets and dysfunction.This film also glimpses the effects social pressure, mob mentality and stigma have on truth. We must also question the reliability of the human memory as evidence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of the Friedmans is one that requires an understanding of the people involved. They are the ones who drive the story till the end. The way in which their confusion and deception of the situation, seeming to belong to the eye view only, is in any case a he said she said tale. The facts on both sides pulls you back and forth unaware of where you stand. When the Friedman family, with their crazy antics, believes what they think is to be right and to hold no other truth to the facts of the case, it makes you wonder who are these people? Where did they come from? It is a surprise until the end. A moderate and frustrating tale, Capturing the Friedmans requires much attention with little thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good documentary that captures the mind state of a pedophile and the the stress that is put on the pedophiles family. The documentary provides viewers with an inside look by showing, actual, home videos of a family that is put through a stressful trial and we are able to see tempers flare. And we get to see this family unravel on home video footage. By watching the home videos people are able to dissect the characters and the family seems to show their true feelings on camera, because I do not think they knew that there would be a documentary about their life. The father is the one that is accused of being a pedophile and his sons are dragged through the mud with him and the mother has to make the best decisions for her self and family. There are a lot of witnesses and there is so many different stories of what happens and different stories of who the father really is, but this documentary keeps you watching because you know someone is lying. The subject is a hard one to bare, but the documentary sheds the light on the psychology of a society on a touchy subject such as this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seemingly ordinary family in the Great Neck suburb of Long Island, New York are torn apart by child molestation allegations, which may or may not have been fabricated by underage witnesses coerced by the authorities. A retired teacher-turned-computer instructor is put in the legal hot-spot after a underage pornographic magazine is delivered to him undercover; his students are then interviewed for any possible misconduct, and soon the married father of three and his youngest son are arrested on sex abuse charges. Quietly devastating documentary from Andrew Jarecki weaves both vintage and recent home movie footage of the family with revealing interviews of the former Friedman matriarch (who had fallen out of love with her accused husband and failed to stand by him) and two of her sons. Jarecki is very careful not to paint the 'victims' as villains but, in trying to be somewhat non-subjective, he clouds some of the legal ramifications in mystery (why is the son's attorney completely contradicting his client's statements? Is the attorney lying--and if so, what did he have to gain?). Eldest son David tries so hard to be the voice of reason--while feeling victimized himself--that he inadvertently becomes the star of the movie, the glue which is barely holding the family together. It's a portrait of lives destroyed by contagious hysteria...and by personal demons and repressed sexuality. The film is by turns tragic, unfair, rueful, frustrating, incredibly human, and incredibly moving. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Friedmans are your typical middle-class Jewish family. But when Arnold Friedman and his 18 year old son Jesse Friedman got arrested by the police for abusing and molesting young children's in the Friedman home. They got arrested at Thanksgiving in 1987 for hundreds shocking crimes. The oldest son David Friedman doesn't believe it as first, including his mother Elaine and his brother Seth. Documentary filmmaker Andrew Jarecki (All Good Things) interviews David, Jesse, Elaine including the reporters, victims, the prosecutors, sex crime unit, the judge, formers students of Arnold's computer class, Jesse's former friend and Arnold's brother. All the interviewers with the filmmaker are searching the truth of what did happen with Arnold and his son Jesse along with the students were sexually abused and some students claimed that nothing sexual happened in class. So, who is telling the truth?Director Jarecki makes an fascinating documentary with the now infamous "The Friedman" family. David Friedman, now he's an entertainer for children. Who seems to be still in denial of what happened to his family, although he's an intelligent person, who loves to entertained and being an magician to please young children. "Capturing the Friedmans" does have some darkly comic moments including some truly disturbing moments during the interview and the vintage news footage. The documentary is at its best during the amazing home video footage of the family to witness an better understanding of the family falling apart.Disc One has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Stereo 2.0 Surround Sound. Disc One also includes an running commentary track by the director and producer/editor:Richard Hankin. An interesting commentary track if you truly liked the documentary. Disc Two includes unseen home movies from inside the Friedmans house, Great Neck Outraged, New witnesses and evidence and more. "Capturing the Friedmans" is certainly an difficult documentary to watch. But it is extremely admittedly powerful and unforgettable. Director Jacrecki and Producer:Marc Smerling received an Oscar nominated for their solid work. Since the documentary is not for all tastes. But this documentary shouldn't be missed and also is what to make of all this is wisely left to the viewer, what he or she thinks of the damaged family. (**** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will we ever stop the witch-hunts? Let's say I'm a shoplifter. Will that fact make you convict me of embezzlement if I'm brought up on dubious charges because someone made me the scapegoat and the two crimes are similar, if different in degree? We watch this sad, sad story of the devolution of a family. We see the family photos, so familiar to all of us, with everyone so happy and smiling. But the audio behind the figures is of a woman shrieking her rage, a man making animal noises of despair.Did the guilt of having child pornography weigh so heavily upon this highly respected teacher of Great Neck, N.Y. that he plead Guilty to trumped-up charges? Trumped up by aggressive amoral cops, feeding on the attention of the media and the hysteria of the mob, the same in Great Neck, as at the Bastille in France.This documentarian loves this family, but he deliberately keeps the whole film carefully ambiguous, so you don't know what to believe. He is now trying to get up funds to pay a lawyer to do what his did not: cleanse the record. His lawyer was not given clearly exculpatory evidence of the many students who had no memory or recollection of being abused.Now we know how Inquisition like were the tactics of the police toward the 9 year old kids. They didn't even allow the parents to be in the same room with the police inquisitors. Why the parents didn't sue the Police Dept. for harassment and infringement upon their 1st and 4th Amendment rights, I'll never know. These folks weren't ignorant peasants, but citizens of an up-scale neighborhood on Long Island.I don't think the Friedmans were wealthy but they certainly were resourceful. Instead of breaking their spirit and sanity (don't know about Elaine), they now have wonderful careers: Seth with his Corrupt Media activities, easily understood why and Jessie, seeking to cleanse his record and also to rescue others falsely accused.Oh, yes, you can buy books from him for his legal appeals on Amazon. Go to FreeJesse.net or CapturingtheFriedmans.com to get more information. Great movie on the intolerance of the mob.but where is poor Elaine? Does anyone in that community of Redneck, I mean Great Neck, have any remorse?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thought-provoking film that remains surprisingly neutral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an intriguing documentary because it starts from the incontrovertible fact that one of the two main protagonists (Arnie) is a paedophile. As it continues, this man reveals that in addition to viewing child porn, he also molested his younger brother and two other boys. Arnie is a man who clearly only reveals as much information as he thinks will help his current position.In spite of this damning information, the film-maker manages to put together an array of facts that manage to cast significant doubt upon the convictions of this man and his son, Jesse.The central question posed by the movie seems to be, "In spite of Arnie's known predilections, was he responsible for an implausibly large-scale child abuse operation, in which his youngest son was an accomplice, or was he railroaded by a police-force on a vendetta mission after failing to prove that he was manufacturing and distributing child porn?" To be honest, although Arnie appears to have been a very loving dad to his three sons, he appears to have ultimately been an incredibly selfish person, who allowed his personal drives to destroy his family.Reading other people's comments, it's clear that people all see this film in different ways. Some see it as supporting the case for the victims, others see it as supporting the case for the Friedmans. In fact, I think that the director does an excellent job in presenting damning evidence from both sides. The police and judge come across at times as deceitful, biased and with agendas that have nothing to do with the truth, but then Arnie shows himself time and again to be a manipulative paedophile. If it weren't so disturbing, it would be funny when he reveals that he "only" molested two boys years ago, (oh, and my brother), but I'm innocent of this. The irony is that he never got caught for the earlier offences, so maybe this is a case of cosmic karma, if he genuinely is innocent of the crimes on which this documentary is based.Whether Arnie and his son Jesse were guilty or not, the film is a stinging indictment of the law officers and Judge involved in the case, who, it appears were vindictive, pre-judgemental, and dangerously manipulative. A "Just get the conviction" Dirty Harry approach to justice may work in the movies, but in real-life, the law needs to be impartial if it is to be credible. It only goes to show the absolute need for the behaviour of these people to be utterly professional and above reproach at all times. If they had been more professional in their handling of the case, most of the issues in support of the Friedman's could never have arisen, particularly the primary one; false (implanted) memory syndrome. I wonder if the interviewing officers themselves could be considered to be guilty of child abuse. One child reveals (on the DVD extras - buy the two disk special edition!) that he was not a victim, but that the police showed him pornographic computer games (which he'd never previously seen) to see if he recognised them. Doesn't that make them guilty of the very thing they were accusing Jesse of?The director's documentary style, in which the footage tells the story, without him having to get in front of the camera in a self-publicising Moore-esquire fashion, enables the story to tell itself far more potently.Advocates from both sides complain that the director omitted to include much evidence that would have supported their perspectives, and the fact that both can make this claim I think only serves to show that the documentary did not waver too far from its impartial telling.Having said that, given the fact that the director allegedly started funding Jesse's defence fund, maybe he should have stated the boy's case more strongly...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Capturing the Friedmans, 2003 Very good documentary studying something as simple and complex as an average American family. Of chorse this particular American family has 2 men accused of raping dozens of boys over a period of several years. This movie does a great job of jerking you back and forth. At first you'll be positive they're guilty, than positive they're innocent, than positive that the dad is guilty but the son is innocent, than you'll think they're both guilty but the charges are exaggerated. And in the end you have no more of an idea of the truth than you did when you started. This is a very interesting way to do a documentary, but it leaves you feeling stragely unsatisfied. Documentaries usually have an assertion about something, and try to prove that assurtion. I don't think the film makers have any more of an idea about the truth in this case than I do. And while I hate to say that I like to be told what to think, when I'm watching a documentary, I kind of like to be told what to think... and than decide later if I want to think that way or not. This was just barrels full of contradicting information from many different sources. Thus the movie was innovative, fascinating, but slightly less enjoyable than it could have been. 6/10, 32nd out of 71 movies for 2003, 461st overall</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who knows if they're guilty?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a terrific documentary. The facts of the case are slightly obscured by the filmmakers' willingness to exonerate the defendants in the trial, but the viewer is still able to make their own decision (or indecision) about the case.Whether or not you believe that Arnold and Jesse Friedman are indeed guilty of the crimes they went to prison (and, in the case of Arnold, subsequently DIED for), it is very clear who the victims are. You have children who were either actually molested or railroaded by a corrupt justice system--as well as parents who refused to believe anything other than the beliefs of their children. The fact that some of the accusers came forward years later to recant anything they said about molestation leads one to believe there were false accusations made. You have the defendants as well as the other Friedman children, who--if they indeed were not guilty--have spent their entire lives trying to end their own personal victimization from their father's twisted idea of sexuality.Above all, you have the mother. This was a woman caught in between the world and her family, of which NEITHER had sympathy or love for her. The manner in which her children ruthlessly attack her--while Arnold sits at the dinner table passively--is shameful and despicable. Throughout the entire film, she is pummeled for not being a proper matriarch as well as being associated with a pedophile she had to make an effort to love and care for, even when she didn't know he was a sick bastard. The behavior of the Friedman children amounts to the actions of spoiled brats who didn't get the toys they wanted for Christmas. It's easy to understand their frustration; they are also caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to the (possible) actions of their father. But for them to continually berate their mother for having any doubt is childish and cruel.The final scene, with the kids at the courthouse with video camera in tow, made me rethink my entire summation of the case and the film. I believe that Arnold and Jesse COULD have done this. The lack of respect they showed anyone but themselves--through self-pity and outright meanness--is the same behavior that serial rapists and murderers show their victims' families. So yes, they COULD have.But DID they? Who knows?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because there is no evidence to prove either way. The fact that 2 long prison sentences were still the result of all this is shocking. If I were innocent of a crime I did not commit (especially one as horrible as this), I would NEVER give in and plead guilty just to bargain with the judge. I have no respect for Jesse Friedman in this regard.Let me make it clearer. Andrew Jarecki was just making a documentary about New York Clowns when he met David Friedman, the best party clown in New York. David told him of his past and provided Jarecki with hundreds of reels of family home-movie footage. The Friedmans captured every moment of their lives on film it would seem. The story that unfolded in these films was something Jarecki could never even dream of.Arnold Friedman was a troubled man. After the death of his 9-year-old big sister his father left and the family was torn apart. His mother moved into a tiny apartment with him and his brother and all three of them shared a room. The mother would bring back male partners and shag them in full view/earshot of her sons. Wouldn't that disturb you? But it gets even worse. He was a merry man, slightly camp and married a woman who was as about as sexually responsive to him as a blow-up doll. They may have had three sons and lived a 'happy' existence as an upper-middle class Jewish family in a well-to-do part of the state, but underneath it all Arnold was hiding a secret. He was a huge paedophile and he liked really young boys.He would order kiddie fiddling mags from Europe, but one of them was seized by customs and he was investigated. Arnold also taught computer class and the cops made a list of all the names of the kids he taught and made a point of interviewing them with some truly dodgy, unclear, unprofessional techniques.Many of the kids said that Arnold and his oldest son Jesse had been sexually abusing them. And not a simple one-at-a-time deal either. Apparently they had made them all strip naked in class and play a horrible game called 'leap frog' in which each and everyone of them would quickly and systematically be anally raped. Is this disgusting? Of course it is? Do I believe it? No! There is no way that this could have continued for as long as it did without someone noticing. Other kids in the same class said nothing like it ever occurred. And if it did then where is the evidence? Without meaning to sound crude, anal sex is a pretty difficult thing to get right as an adult. For terrified, unwilling children who are being mass-raped where was the tissue damage, the blood, the tears, the agony and the reluctance to ever go back to Mr Friedman's class? Even for adults it's not simply like sticking a hot dog through a donut. This whole allegation that they did anal-rape as a game of leap frog is absurd and totally far-fetched.Did Arnold Friedman have wicked thoughts about his students? Probably. Did he involve his then 18-year-old son? Hmmm, I'm not sure about that one. Let me just say that the Friedman household is one I am glad I am not part of. There always seems to be an atmosphere of unnaturalness or 'something ain't quite right here' about it. Jesse Friedman says that his dad never hurt him. Jesse Friedman's Defence Attoney says otherwise.This is a particular trick Jarecki uses to show the conflicting sides of the story. One person says black and immediately another person says white. The documentary is nothing but contradicting stories and polar opposites. While I do not believe the entire innocence of Arnold Friedman (the man clearly WAS a paedophile), I do NOT believe the word of the Cops, the FBI or any other authority interviewed.The Judge, one Abbey Boklan, said she was sure of Arnold Friedman's guilt the second she saw him. In my view, she's openly admitting to Gross Professional Misconuct. How dare she, a judge, a stern, responsible authority figure, make such an outrageous, unfounded remark without hearing ANY kind of evidence first.And like I said, there IS no evidence. Only the claims of the children. Nothing in this case was based on evidence because evidence didn't exist. Doesn't that strike you as being really, really odd? The Cops claimed that hypnosis was used to get answers out of the kids. As well as pressure from the parents (oblivious to the fact that their kids are undamaged physically) to tell the proverbial awful truth and encouraging embellishment of perhaps slight truths and instances to the point where this whole ridiculous leap frog game is created.The trial is not the only focus of the film. The complete and utter breakdown of the family is also caught on camera. The sons hate their mother with a passion at her refusal to stand by her man. I can understand their anger, but what woman would? She had no evidence to persuade her either way, but she always found an unnaturalness to Arnold and the allegations probably confirmed her fears I guess.Arnold killed himself in prison in 1995 so Jesse, also imprisoned for 13 years despite no evidence, could benefit from the $250, 000 insurance policy. Mrs Friedman re-married but the family name is stained forever in my opinion. So too should be the word of all the unprofessional authorities and lawyers involved.No one in this documentary comes away without tarnish. It's a sick, sad and sorry story that will confuse as much as it enlightens. Make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a provocative, disturbing and sympathetic documentary that is as interesting as watching two speed-trains collide. A typical upper-class family in Great Neck on Long Island is steadily destroyed as Arnold Friedman and his youngest teen-aged son are accused and convicted of sex crimes involving young children. Mr. Friedman, an award-winning and beloved teacher, held a computer class for neighborhood children in his basement several days a week. Upon police investigation, kiddie porn was found in the Friedman home on Picadilly Road. The family obsessively documented their lives by way of home movies. These movies, broadcast news video and interviews with victims, law enforcement and the Friedman family members themselves make this documentary possible. A seemingly reputable family is disgraced with the shocking secrets being made public. You will probably ask yourself why you even watched this film. And like many people, you may even flirt with the idea the whole horrid affair never happened. Watching the extra two hours of extra footage with the DVD really conjures questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine and Sad Documentary of Family Dysfunction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This compelling documentary about the Friedman family and a child sexual abuse court case that turned their lives upside down is a heartbreaking peek into the lives of one very dysfunctional family. Like most families who have painful secrets they want to suppress, the Friedmans (except for the mother), act as if absolutely nothing is wrong, that the charges are silly and that everything will be cleared up as quickly as a parking ticket. On the evening before the family patriarch, Arnold Friedman, is to begin serving his prison sentence, the family is partying like it's New Year's Eve. And the same holds true for the day on which the son charged as an accomplice, Jesse Friedman, plans to plead guilty in court. The brothers are goofing off on the courthouse lawn!! Of course we, as objective viewers, realize that all of this behavior is a desperate attempt to avoid dealing with some serious tears in the family fabric. Arnold pleads innocent to molesting boys to whom he had been providing computer classes in his basement, but is it a coincidence that he seems to go to prison with a substantial sense of relief? The boys paint their mother as a demon intent on destroying the family, but it's the mother who comes across as being the most grounded in reality and the only one (besides Arnold himself) who understands the gravity of the family's circumstances. No, these certainly are not the Waltons.The documentary does a very compelling job of casting doubt on the fact that Arnold and his son were guilty of molesting boys in that computer class. Our sympathies definitely lie with them, until we find out late in the film that they were probably lying to the authorities and, because we as viewers have become so vested in their story, to us. We probably will never know exactly what happened during those classes. Arnold asserts to his dying day that he never molested any of those students, but he does admit to molesting other boys. So how are we supposed to feel? Glad that he receives punishment for past crimes, or angry at the judicial system for fabricating a crime where one didn't exist? It's a complicated set of emotions the film maker leads his audience through, and it makes for a superb documentary.Grade: A</fullReview>

You never forget, even though the events are so sensational, that the Friedmans are real, in pain and unheroic. The film is a must see for documentary fans. Child abuse and molestation is a terrifying subject, particularly in the hands of the media.The film manages to make the family and the conflict and relationships the central theme. One of the interesting aspects of the film is that because of the 'home movies' the story unravels in past tense. An extraordinary moment for me was to see Elaine remarried and happy towards the end of the movie.</fullReview>

How could the Friedmans allow its most painful moments to be recorded? And what kind of child would record such events? That's how I realized how deeply dysfunctional the whole family is. This family is guilty, and it's not of pedophilia, but of an extreme form of alienation from one's own humanity. And the worst part of it is they are not even aware of it. In a way, I found the family's obsession with home movies frightening. It made them vulgar and I felt cheap and dirty, as if I were a peeping Tom. What a frightening film.

		<shortDescription>Should have dug a little deeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The common trend amongst modern documentary-makers seems to be to step back from the subject matter and let it speak for itself ? no voiceovers or preaching ? simply fly-on-the-wall stuff. Perhaps the perception is that investigative journalism is too intrusive a medium for the movies and better served on hard-hitting TV shows. But a story such as the Friedmans' needs some further digging despite the impressive raw materials. We have interviews with the major protagonists and oodles of camcorder footage but no incisive questioning or comment from the filmmakers and as compelling and interesting as this film is, the ultimate feeling is one of frustration.The story of the Friedmans is murky and disturbing and needs poking around with a big stick before the truth can begin to emerge. The family is superficially ordinary: Jewish, middle-class and pillar-of-the-community. Patriarch Arnold is a well- respected and award-winning teacher; wife Elaine is typically supportive and subordinate and their three boys have a touching and incredibly close bond neatly recorded for posterity in hours of home-video footage. But all is not well in sunny suburbia. The police intercept a package intended for Arnold that contains a magazine of child pornography and dirty secrets and wild accusations are soon sullying the family name.Former pupils come out of the woodwork and accuse Friedman of abusing them in the computer classes he ran out of his own home. His youngest son Jesse is also implicated. In all, over 200 separate charges of rape and child molestation are brought against the two despite no complaints being made by pupils at the time of the alleged assaults and not a shred of physical evidence. An intriguing tale, undoubtedly, but what makes this film unique among all the other tepid yarns about serious crime is that the Friedmans kept the camera rolling. After Arnold and Jesse are bailed, the family closes ranks and plots their defence. It is fascinating stuff. Arnold retreats into a mumbling, guilt-ridden shell while the rest of the family is split asunder by Elaine's scepticism and despair and the boys' fierce defence of their father. Eldest son David is the most bitter. He is incredulous that such absurd charges have been brought against his father and brother and is determined to clear their names. His video diaries and monologues are insightful as are the family arguments he faithfully films. He emerges as the least stable of the lot of them: A confused, angry, indignant voice petulantly and blindly mitigating his father's flaws; devastated and helpless as his cherished family idyll crashes down around him.I will not detail events of the trial suffice it to say that the outcome asks more questions than this film can answer. Arnold's history of sexually abusing his own children is hinted at but never fully broached despite long and otherwise candid interviews with both David and Jesse and Arnold's younger brother. All are steadfast and confident in Arnold and Jesse's innocence. It is difficult to say whether the film sides with the Friedmans or not. Certainly it does not hold back in detailing the hideous crimes that are alleged: Prosecutors, frustrated defence lawyers and victims are all wheeled out but are not truly convincing in their condemnation of Arnold. He actually emerges as a meek, dignified martyr who, at his death, leaves a string of embittered, broken people still adamant that the whole affair was one hideous misunderstanding. This is not your standard paedophile. The true extent of his crimes may never be known and the footage of his loving family make the allegations against him all the more unpalatable and grisly.As an interesting footnote, eldest Friedman son David (the wrathful, resentful brother) is also the premier children's entertainer in New York. While there is no suggestion he has any history of sexual crime himself, one would have thought his family name may be something of a hindrance in his line of work. But he is still clowning away merrily and the mud doesn't seem to have stuck ? America is a strange place.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! This movie was nothing short of absolutely fascinating!!!!!! It really leaves you with more questions than answers. Just when you think you've got a little shred of truth, your theory gets blown out of the water.I watched this movie alone, and I've been wanting to dissect it with somebody ever since. To me, the most sympathetic people in the movie were Jesse and the Mother. Yes, the mother was weak and she dealt with a lot of the issues by not dealing with them, but she was at least honest, and honesty was a very rare commodity in this family.Also,I really tended to believe Jesse. I don't think that his father molested him, but I think that the father might have molested David (the clown). David was sooooo deep and heavy into denial - he completely villainized his mother and held his father accountable for as little as possible.This movie leaves A lot of fertile ground for amateur psychologists...It is probably the most fascinating "case study" of a dysfunctional family that has ever been documented.It kind of makes me wonder how must families would end up looking under such close scrutiny....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capturing a moment (or: Going back in time)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Although this movie is a documentary, showing real events, some people may treat the details of the "plot" as spoilers, or just wish to know as little as possible as to not influence their judgment. For those I used the *** Spoiler *** warning).Let me begin with the only flaw this movie has: Wrong aspect ratio. For a movie that is largely based on home-made clips, the choice of presenting it in wide-screen is awful. Instead of making it full-screen or leaving black bars on the sides, the maker decided to crop the top/bottom areas of the image, causing such phenomena as people's heads getting out of the frame frequently.Capturing the Friedmans (2003) is a chilling experience and one of the best documentaries I've seen in recent time. While watching it for the first time, it didn't strike me as one, until the middle of it. After it was over I had trouble sleeping and I kept thinking about it.Subconsciously, this movie works on many levels and it raises a huge amount of issues and questions. I'll try to list some of them.The movie actually takes you back in time. The amazing opportunity of seeing all the events as they actually happened - by video, not by stories or actors recreating scenes - literally makes you feel you're watching the events as they happen in real time. While the family members' decision - to film all the events as they happen - may have been seen strange at the time, it gives us an opportunity to see something you can only imagine. Something horrible that you never expect to reach you. It shows you how a family is dealing with a series of events that seem surreal. You see how each member deals with the events, some of them standing helpless in front of them.Director Andrew Jarecki's way of presenting the events is very intelligent. His technique is first to show an event and the obvious reactions. That way you can "clean" your mind of the thoughts that run through it and you're ready to absorb another point of view. He shows you that the initial reaction affects your judgment and might cause you to make wrong decisions. And this is what the movie is about.Jarecki always shows both sides of the argument. He doesn't make judgments like many documentaries do, but instead presents you with different views and opinions, raising the questions you want to ask, and letting you judge for yourself.Taking into consideration the huge amount of stock the director had to deal with and the limited time he had to present it, in the form of a film, one should give credit to the director for being able to cover such a wide range of events and never getting boring.From a family-unit aspect (and with no connection to the crimes discussed), this movie raises many relations, situations and questions that any viewer would find familiar. A dysfunctional family that seems to be ideal on the outside, but the more you get familiar with it, the more you learn about the secrets and weights that each member carries: *** Spoilers begin *** A mother that admits she didn't think she'd been suitable to raise kids; Brothers that are very close to each other and to their father, who seem to almost think and act as one person at times, while the mother feels an outcast in her own family; Brothers (Arnold and Howard) who grew up in a very unhealthy environment (a promiscuous mother, death of a young sister, unnatural sexual experiences); Watching something horrible happening to a member of your family without being able to help him (the segments of Howard, Arnold's brother, are heartbreaking as he's helplessly watching his brother "drown" in the abyss of events); David, working as a clown to make children laugh while his family is quickly falling apart. *** Spoilers end ***The family's videotapes are unbelievably personal (David's recorded speech to his future-self is easily the best example, and it shows a huge courage on his behalf, in allowing the director to show it to the world in this documentary). You follow the family as the events are happening. You see how the people actually deal with events that are too hard to bare, and how surreal everything becomes. At one point, people are calling the family on the phone, leaving death threats and extreme hatred on the answering machines. Anyone who has ever been boycotted can easily understand how it feels. "Chaos", as Elaine says, when asked to describe it in one word.Another issue that rises is the loyalty to the family. Are you willing to stand by your loved one if you're not sure he's innocent? Are you willing to lie in order to help him? Will you do all that even if you don't believe his innocence yourself?From the law respective, I think this movie is a must-see for any student who wants to work in the law field in the future. Is the truth always that simple? Can you stay unbiased while everyone is claiming to know what the truth is and how obvious it is? Can you judge without getting a revenge for previous cases? Can you actually accept new ideas and consider new facts after you've already formed your decision?The movie also shows how a bad decision can change your life. Like a snowball rolling down a hill, *** spoilers begin *** The lawyer starts with a bad decision, making the father admit crimes he claims he haven't done, sacrificing himself to save his child, while actually causing, at the end, a bigger damage *** spoilers end ***At the end of the movie, it's still unclear what really happened. You can't tell who lies (and that includes the family members, the policemen, the different witnesses, and the lawyers), who's telling the truth, and who's got a distorted grasp of reality - what really happened in the computer room? have uncareful police/doctors interviews affect a young kid's memory (studies have proved that it's extremely easy, even without intending it to happen, to plant false memories about events that never happened)?And of course, the obvious and major question this movie carries: Can you blame someone for certain events, only because you know his personality and way he thinking and because you hate him?This movie is simply a must. For law students, for members of a family, for any person.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was captured</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good documentary. I've the postings on the various message boards about it and am a little suprised that so many people have a concrete view as the innocence or guilt of Arnold and Jessie. The main thing I was left with was a sense of doubt - I doubt they did all the things they were convicted of and I doubt they were totally innocent.The interviews with the police,prosecutors and victims clearly show major flaws in the way evidence was gathered and presented whilst Arnold's stash of child porn and Jessie's statement when he is on his way to the court house for sentencing that nothing happened "only that one person, and they did not complain anyway" is telling. The best thing about this doco is the way that is suspenseful like a good piece of fiction and all the more horrible because it is true (No matter what the guilt or innocence of Arnold and Jessie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God for DNA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great documentary about another 80's "sex ring" case, in which an overzealous community basically performs a witchhunt, destroying lives in the process. I also recently viewed Indictment: The McMartin Trial, and have come to the conclusion that we are all much better off since DNA evidence was introduced. When children were coached into damaging statements, knee-jerk reactions from protective parents seemed to overtake rational thought. Not to say everyone is innocent here, however. If Arnold Friedman wasn't guilty of molesting a child in his computer class, I'm pretty sure he was guilty at some point in his past of the crime. He deserved to do whatever time he had left. Jesse, on the other hand, seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and paid for it with 13 years of his life. As former detectives talk about "they knew" things had happened before they would speak to any potential victims, child after child comes forward and says they were coerced or bullied into admissions. One detective outright admits that when interviewing a child, you make the statement and get them to agree to it. One victim (while lying on a couch in a manner that indicates the director may have been trying to undermine him) says he didn't discover he had been raped until after a few hypnosis sessions! The case notwithstanding, the Friedmans are entertaining to watch all on their own. Big brother David would drive any family apart all on his own in any situation, and mother Elaine's icy ditziness is like a cross between Edith Bunker &amp; Beth Jarrett from Ordinary People. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold &amp; Jesse Friedman: Victimizers or Victims?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gripping documentary about the child pornography case against Arnold and his youngest son Jesse Friedman that took place in Great Neck Long Island. The movie covers the time of them being arrested and then later sentenced, between 1987-89, and eventually ending up with the suicide of Arnold Friedman, while he was still incarcerated, in 1995. The film ends with Jesse being released from jail in late 2001. Both Arnold and his son Jesse admitted to those crimes that they were charged with in open court back in 1988. The movie "Capturing the Friedmans" seems to give those viewing it the impression that they were forced to plead guilty in order to avoid even more lengthy sentences and thus were railroaded by the police and local prosecutors. We know for sure that Arnold Friedman received pornographic photos and magazines of underage boys through the US mail, that he ordered from Holland, which is a federal crime which no one in the film denies. This is even accepted by those supportive of both Arnold and Jesse Friedman. It's in the accusations that they forced boys between the ages of 7 to 12 years old who were at their home being trained for computer skills to preform sex acts with them that the movie puts into question. We see the story unfold from film and video taken by the Friedman family over the years, and through the stressful and turbulent times of Arnold and Jesse's arrest and sentence. There's also the many interviews with friends and family members of the accused including their oldest son David and Arnold's wife Elaine. Were also enlightened about the Friedmans by the US Postal Inspectors and Great Neck police as well as the Local DA and presiding judge on the case. This gives us a unique and revealing insight of the case that you never get in the news or in the movies.You do get the impression that Arnold did have a problem with his sexual urges when he was around young boys. At one point in the movie the attorney of his son Jesse, Peter Panaro, tells a story about a conversation that he had with Arnold in jail about his feelings in regard to under aged boys and his sexual involvement with them. At the same time Arnold told Panaro that he didn't have any relations with the boys that he taught at his home in Great Neck with his son Jesse. the only reason that he plead guilty was for Jesse to get a lighter sentence. In the end even that scheme on Arnold's part didn't work with the judge handling he case, Abby Boklan, throwing the book at Jesse as he received the longest sentence that she could hand down: 8 to 15 years which Jesse served 13 years behind bars. Arnold also took out a life insurance policy with Jesse being the main recipient for $250,000.00 which Jesse got when Arnold killed himself in prison with a drug overdose in 1995. You did get the impression from the movie that Jesse was innocent by reason that there was no evidence of him ever being involved in anything like the things that his father was engaged in; by the interviews of people who knew Jesse and as Jesse's lawyer Peter Panaro. How could it have been possible for Jesse as well as his father to have done these crimes for months on end without the boys parents knowing about them? The parents of those boys, who later claimed that they were raped and sodomized by the Friedman's, picked their sons up from Arnold's house and said that they never once cried or showed any signs of being molested? The young boys even kept coming back week after week for more computer lessons! In the movie we saw that after Arnold Friedman was arrested until his death he acted as if he was almost accepting what was happening to him. Even though he claimed to be innocent during the entire movie even after his guilty plea? Did Arnold really feel guilty because of his past criminal actions with young boys that he admitted to his son Jesse's attorney? Did Arnold feel even more guilty about having his youngest son being charged for a crime that he, Arnold, committed years before by being involved with him in the computer classes that he taught in his Great Neck home? Or was this in some way Arnold taking responsibility for crimes that he committed in the past for crimes that he was accused and convicted of later on that he didn't commit?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Shocking Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really the type of person to jump to one conclusion based on one piece of information. Therefore, I am not going to say whether or not I think Arnold &amp; Jesse Friedman were really guilty of the crimes they were convicted of. However, I will say that this movie raises some reasonable doubt of the allegations and gives a more fair shake to the Friedmans than their case ever did.Overall, I felt Andrew Jarecki's documentary was pretty balanced, but maybe tilting more towards the Friedmans' innocence. This isn't necessarily bad, because if there wasn't any question about the crime, there simply wouldn't be any documentary. That tilt towards the Friedmans becomes more apparent in Disc 2 of the DVD as you see the support the Friedmans give to this "balanced" documentary. But like I said, this is a more fair assessment than what was achieved during the actual trial; so I think the Friedmans welcomed that.As for the content of this documentary, it's just striking. To say that this family is a little odd would be an understatement. The home movies they shot during this ordeal is absolutely astonishing. I simply don't know how they could videotape all that was going on during such a tumultuous and devastating time in their lives. And Arnold &amp; Jesse's tapes of their last nights before going to prison are almost confounding. I can't imagine being in that position and smiling for the camera. This is just something that you can't see anywhere else. It's truly mind-boggling.While this documentary is truly groundbreaking, it definitely should not be viewed on a recreational basis. Be prepared for some heavy material that will shock you and make you think long after you watched it.My IMDb Rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and thought provoking documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unable to view this highly regarded film on the big screen, I recently rented the DVD. This was a plus because one comes away from experiencing the movie with a litany of unanswered questions and the bonus disk really clarified many, but not all concerns.The film tells the tale of the Friedman family and allegations of hundreds of child molestation charges committed by the father and the youngest son. The film makers did a masterful job by interweaving home 8mm and video footage with their own film. For the most part, the story allows the viewer to make up his own mind on guilt or innocence. There are what appear to be some strategic absences of facts and data by the film makers (as pointed out in the bonus DVD by the local police). But this seems to be understandable because the director, by his own admission, ended up caring so much about the family. This viewer certainly felt some empathy after this utterly dysfunctional family displayed levels of pain and despair never captured by the news media.The bonus DVD is almost as interesting as the movie itself. Don't miss the post-premiere question and answer sessions which were attended by the family, their attorneys, prosecutors, police, social workers and the film makers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still on the fence (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched the documentary, read the messages on the board, read the other user comments. Many have already sided one way or another; I, on the other hand, through my own experience, prefer to take a more moderate course. I want to say that I am giving both sides the benefit of the doubt, and here's why:I don't believe there was enough evidence (at least of what they presented to us in the movie) to determine one way or another whether Arnold Friedman and/or his son Jesse sexually molested young boys. There is evidence suggesting the possibility: sodomy porn magazines collected by Arnold and his own past of early sexual experimentation and admitted pedophilia, and Jesse's admission in court (I'll touch on this later, also). And there was at least one interviewee standing by his accusations. However, there is also evidence that neither committed any said acts (at the very least, during the time/place that was being focused on in the trial): several interviewees and one accused victim's parent all denied allegations- some now-grown "victims" claimed to have been badgered or coerced into testifying for the prosecution.Jesse contradicts himself in the movie. His lawyer (who I will admit came off as self-important and not so believable) said that Jesse had admitted being molested by his father and also molesting/manhandling some of the boys in question. Later, in his interview after his release from jail, he has recanted entirely. He claims the lawyer made up the story, and his guilty plea was only to bring him a lighter sentence.Neither man acts scared to go to jail. The mother, who does not stand by her husband or son by any stretch of the imagination, does have some credence to her position (though she does also come across as very uncaring and angry at times). The charges against both men are so horrific and extensive that they are beyond the realm of feasibility, and Jesse makes a good point: take one boy, who claims to have been molested 31 times during the course, then [i]re-enrolls[/i] and is molested 41 more times...and never tells his anyone?My final decision is that it may have happened. But definitely not in the way and to the extent most claimed. There may have been one or two boys that Arnold may have been attracted to and flirted with- and he either went a little too far (though not necessarily sodomized them) or the boy(s) may have just perceived it. And then when police came questioning, they told. And it snowballed to ridiculous proportions, and more and more boys were drawn in. But ultimately, it may have not happened. I do not know; no one knows but Arnold, Jesse, and those who accused them. In any case, their trial was wholly unfair and during the "witch-hunt" against child molesters in the mid-80's.I also recommend the Lifetime movie "Just Ask My Children" which, admittedly, shows a much more biased and thoroughly dramatized version of another true story, but keeps to factual events and testimonies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Are Family ... well sort of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. I was lucky enough to attend the Dallas premiere of this remarkable documentary and to have the talented director, Andrew Jarecki, in attendance. I am not sure if there is a more heinous crime than child abuse/child pornography/pedophilia. It is so difficult to understand for most of us, especially when it is instigated by a well-respected teacher from a seemingly "normal" family. This film offers an added level of creepiness thanks to the real home movies of this not-really-so-normal family, the Friedmans of Great Neck. Who films family quarrels? Who verbally abuses their mother with the cameras rolling? Who films their final evening together prior to jail sentences for the father and youngest son? The Friedmans, that's who. Director Jarecki does a masterful job of weaving these chilling home movies into a story by combining them with interviews of the family, the detectives from the case, alleged victims of the crimes, a reporter, and even the judge. Truly remarkable moments abound - so many that I had to remind myself to blink on more than one occasion. Interviews with the mother/wife, Elaine, are alternately heart-breaking and irritating. Oldest brother David, a successful NYC birthday clown, provides his one-sided observations and spews venom towards his mother and the judicial system. Jesse, the youngest brother, discusses the discrepancies between his story and his attorney's. Fascinating visuals provide some doubt between the memories of the lead detective and the facts. Jesse's attorney seems to be a master of CYA and delivers his schtick with a not-to-be-trusted smile. So many great moments that make us question law enforcement and the process of filing these most damaging of charges. The interviews of the alleged victims shed no real light on the case, but do provide even more doubt about how the human memory works. Interviews with Mr. Friedman's brother show the power of blind brotherly love and never-ending hope. So many victims and no clear answers show there really is no justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freak Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie deals with the sadly familiar topics of dysfunctional families, pedophilia, incest, child abuse, and incompetent psychologists and prosecutors. As the media spotlight has turned from the molesters and rapists to social workers, investigators and prosecutors who obviously have some embarrassing issues of their own, we now find ourselves in a situation in which even an admitted pedophile like Arnold Friedman can find sympathizers. I'm not one of those people that cries "Believe the victims!" without bothering to find out whether the "victim" is a victim of a pedophile predator, or of a disgustingly sick social worker or prosecutor. But it's the unfortunate truth that public reaction to the latter has now placed us in a position where a real pedophile predator can hide behind accusations of "false memory." Nice job, Freudians.Capturing the Friedmans show us all sides of this story. Obviously, if any of the interviewees was lying when the case went to trial, they can't possibly admit it now, not even to themselves. The truth is unknowable and the damage is irreparable. The only person who seems to have moved on to a semblance of a normal life, at least as far as we are shown, is Elaine Friedman. She has remarried -- quite well, apparently -- and is living out her remaining days in pastoral serenity in the Berkshires. (She looks rather medicated in her interviews, but that might just be her style.)But the movie is basically a freak show. This bizarre family made lots of home movies and videos of themselves being bizarre, and once we start looking we can't stop. Shame on us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing we shouldn't already know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a sociological case study, Capturing the Friedmans is a competent and disturbing film. Andrew Jarecki has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of here. But I do not think it deserves the high honors it has received because, in the end, the film doesn't tell us anything we shouldn't already know. More than anything else, it is 109 minutes of voyeurism that appeals to a Reality TV culture which is no less perverse than the Friedman family.Unfortunately, the typical American, at least, does not already know the most important and relevant themes in this film, and that is why it is considered so "thought provoking" on matters we should already be thinking about daily: the slippery nature of "truth", the unreliability of witness testimony, the lunacy and injustice of our law enforcement and legal system, the phenomenon of mass hysteria, trial and conviction in the news media, the enormous tragedy of false imprisonment (if Jesse was indeed falsely accused), and the fact that there are a lot of weird--very weird--people living amongst us.There is simply no way to determine the truth of what really happened in the Friedman basement from the evidence presented here, and we are given no compelling reason to believe that court trials would have provided any more certainty. This lack of certainty is the entire basis of so much debate over the film. If this isn't reasonable doubt, I don't know what is, and for that reason alone Jesse should never have gone to prison. Only the emotions stirred by the heinous nature of the alleged crimes drove law enforcement, the courts, the news media, and the community to rob a young man of the best years of his life. If Jessie had been charged with murder of a "nobody" on such flimsy evidence, I find it hard to believe it would ever even come to trial. If he were charged with murdering someone popular on the same evidence, however, he might well be on death row today. As it happens, he was charged with molesting children, the moral equivalent of murdering somebody who "matters". Emotions. Such is the absurdity of American Justice.In fact, there is no definitive answer on ANYTHING in this film, except for the undeniable proof of human degeneracy provided by community cretins who left violent, stupid messages on the Friedmans' answering machine immediately after Arnold and Jesse were arrested. The only "evidence" these fools had to go on was brief television news reports, and this is the pool of peers from which juries would have been selected (for those who wonder why an innocent man would ever confess to child molestation even to get a reduced sentence). I fear those telephone terrorists, who probably still walk the streets, more than I fear any member of the Friedman household (with the possible exception of David--a very angry and irrational character).The DVD special features are enlightening, in the sense that they present evidence not seen in the film. This new evidence doesn't clarify the truth, but at least it makes us feel we are not missing important facts. Or are we? Again, there's no way to know.Particularly interesting on the DVD is an extended interview with the supposed victim who was responsible for the majority of charges against Arnold and Jesse. Laying casually across a sofa-chair while discussing his horrific experience, this young man doesn't seem half as traumatized by the Friedmans as he was by his own family. One gets the impression he enjoys the attention he receives as a "victim" of child molestation. In fact, he seems to enjoy it a little too much.As I said, a very disturbing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most terrifying stories I have ever read about or seen on film. No child at the Friedman home was ever molested! I am a former NYPD patrol man (8 years) and it is so obvious that these Nassau Cops were criminal. They created a case out of nothing. Well, not nothing, the elder Mr. Friedman was a pedophile. But remember the heinous part of this case was the charge of molestation. And molestation did not happen. Jesse spent 13 years in jail for nothing. Nothing. This is horrible. But then again Nassau Count,y I have always believed is a moron's paradise. This is a great film that all Americans need to see so they understand how careful they must be about watching their back in a police state gone wild. Ps. One thing I can tell you from experience is that the NYPD does not operate that way. A more hard working bunch of men and women you will never know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loving boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this magnificent documentary is ambiguous enough to suggest the director was getting to know this family, or the actual incarceration of Arnold and Jesse Friedman. Andrew Jarecki accomplishes a deeply disturbing portrait of a family in turmoil in the suburbs, where everything is supposed to be ideal and things like this never happen.Arnold Friedman was a sick man. He was a homosexual and a pedophile, who took refuge in the form of a normal father and husband in Great Neck. In almost all cases such as this, the pedophile has been a victim himself at an earlier age. The way he translated his desires was by molesting other children that might be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Arnold must have been sexually abused by the some of the men his mother took to bed, and he in turn, made his own brother Howard have improper sex with him.In abusing his own son, Jesse, Arnold proves that his appetite doesn't differentiate between his own flesh and blood from a stranger. Jesse must have loved the attention his father always showed him and went along with the sickening arrangement to keep his father happy. Jesse in turn will probably go into being a pedophile himself because deep inside of him will be a desire to do unto others what was done to him when he couldn't fight back.Elaine, the mother, is a pathetic figure in this household. She had no clue of what was going on under her roof. She turned perhaps a blind eye toward what her husband was doing under her nose because there must have been indications that Jesse's relationship with his father was not normal. Jesse, as a child, had such a tender beauty that it's not difficult to see the way he awakened a sickening desire in his own father.As far as the case is concerned, it all came about because of the Postal inquiry about the pornography that Arnold bought as a way to satisfy his cravings. Since he was heavily into taking home movies, it will surprise no one that he had access to a lot of young boys that were his children's playmates and ultimately his own students of computer science at the very beginning of the technology.All the Friedmans, with the exception of Seth, who doesn't appear in the documentary, express their opinions as commentators; they all cooperated willingly, or so it seems, with the director. We wonder to what extent Elaine keeps denying her knowledge, or David, for that matter because it's obvious that Jesse is not one to ask because all what he went through is very painful, or he would not be objective about this case.Even Howard, Arnold's own brother can't understand what was going on in his brother's house. He talks to the camera and seems absolutely normal about telling this story. Toward the end of the documentary, his male lover gives his own account and frankly, it surprises the viewer, because we had no indication at all that Howard was gay and living with in a seeming healthy relationship.The young people that were made to accuse the Friedmans fall under two categories, either they were speaking the truth, or they were made to confess things that didn't happen to them. There have been a lot of instances with smaller children, where the police and criminal investigators have put into their minds things that they think occurred, thus making these young ones to react as though it was indeed what they experienced in the hands of pedophiles. Jesse is taken to prison as well as Arnold because they are accused by the former students of having acted improperly.There is a revealing sequence in an interview with the lawyer that defended the Friedmans. It's seen toward the end of the film. In it, the lawyer speaks about the time he visited Arnold in prison and how nearby there was a man who was holding a young boy in his lap. As the child was getting restless, he kept jumping up and down and that action kept turning Arnold on sexually, that he asks the lawyer to move to another area. It is at this point that we get an insight into Arnold's perverse and uncontrollable sick mind and what aroused him.By way of atoning, or perhaps in a last effort to ask forgiveness from Jesse, Arnold takes a life insurance policy that makes his youngest son the beneficiary, but nothing else goes to the family, or at least, it's never explained in the film.This is one of the most disturbing documentaries that have come out in a long time. Thanks should go to the director Andrew Jarecki for delving into the tragic story of the Friedman family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A complicated story from the late 1980s when mass hysteria about child abuse was raging throughout the country. In this case, the hatred centered on a genuinely twisted, if kind of nice quiet guy. Arnold Friedman, a nebbish, a good teacher, a husband and father of three sons in up-trodden Great Neck, Long Island, answers an ad planted by the sex police on some web site, about trading erotic photos of young boys or something. Unknowingly he sends a child porno magazine to the plant and when it is returned to him, he accepts it. The police, prompted by the postal inspectors, obtain a search warrant and find a stash of porno magazines hidden behind the piano in the basement, and some child porno games on his computer. It turns out that Arnold not only owns illegal literature but he has been conducting computer classes in his basement for kids between 6 and 12 or something like that. The police run off a list of his students, interview all of them, and file over a hundred complaints of one or another kind of sexual abuse against him -- and against his son, Jesse, 17, who some of the students claim was involved in the various rapes and games of leapfrog and whatnot.Good-bye Arnold. He's off to prison and ODs on anti-depressants. Jesse gets off with less.This family falls apart under the stress. It wasn't exactly stable to begin with. The four males were opposed to the single female (Mom). Of course every family has arguments and unspoken alliances, but this one is beyond the pale. The kids actually seem to hate her. They're all over her, even at the Seder. She fights back well enough, but that really doesn't help matters.As far as the story goes, it doesn't help matters that everybody seems to lie, not only to the camera but to each other. Sometimes one person tells us about a lie that another person told them. I kept waiting for someone to say that someone else lied to them about what another person had said to somebody long ago. And everybody seems so terribly PLAUSIBLE too. Not just the family members, but the police and the defense counsel we see interviewed. Jesse's lawyer, Polana or something like that, tells a thoroughly believable story of how, when asked directly if he could admit to sexual abuse in court, Jesse (with tears rolling down his face) looked Palano in the eye and said, "I can admit it." Jesse, equally credible, says that the abuse business was Palano's idea entirely and that Palano urged him to admit to it because, otherwise, Palano would have been allowing his client to lie in court, which is some kind of offense against the formal norms, subornation of perjury or malfeasance in the first degree or something.It's a confusing story with no closure to it. (That's called verisimilitude.) You know what should have happened? They should have let Arnold Friedman get that magazine from Denmark, then masturbate while looking at his erotic literature or having his private fantasies, like 90 percent of the rest of the men on the planet. There is, of course, the possibility that he molested some young boys in that basement. There's no clear evidence that he did, only testimony from some of the kids who were obviously coached by the police. One of them managed to recall the memory of abuse only under hypnosis, which has been thoroughly discredited. Of course, erotic materials and the defendant's innocence aside, there is the question of whether or not Arnold might have "slipped" a little. He was a confirmed bisexual until at least in his forties, and fantasized about young boys. Might he not have bounced some boy on his lap at one time?Who knows? In an unusually candid letter to a journalist Arnold claimed not. I don't know if he did or not. That's known as reasonable doubt.I keep waiting for the next wave of hysteria to take off. We seem to need to organize our hatred and aim it somewhere on a periodic basis. We've demonized smokers, marginalizing about one quarter of the population, and we get as much pleasure as we can from that. We're beginning to work on fat people now. The signs are all over the place. But is that really enough? You can despise smokers and fat people but you can't become easily enraged, and you can't put them away for thirty years. We need something more. Something really evil. "Internet predators" will provide a suitable target in every way, although nobody knows what an internet predator is yet, or even if they exist. Well, I'll tell you what. If they don't exist, let's invent them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1987, US officials intercept a child pornographic magazine from the Netherlands destine for Arnold Friedman in Great Neck, Long Island. The police finds child porn in Arnold's possession. Their investigation leads to substantial sex abuse allegations with his student in his computer course along with oldest son Jesse. It splits the family as son David is adamant in their defense while mother Elaine is angered by Arnold's betrayal. Secrets are revealed but guilt is in question.There are so many ways this movie is so compelling. First, it's a mystery of the trial and guilt. There is the family dysfunction and disintegration. These are fascinating people. Their family dynamic is mesmerizing. Then there is the story of the prosecution of the family. It is an engrossing human tragedy full of twists and turns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While, this movie didn't really capture all of the Friedmans; it did capture the intensity of their criminal case. What a disturbing captivating watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally, director Andrew Jarecki planned the movie to be a short film titled 'Just a clown' about clowns in New York. However, when he interviewed popular Long Islander clown David Friedman for the short, Jarecki stumbled upon a darker, yet more interesting story. It was here, that 'Capturing the Friedmans' was created, using talking-head interviews, archive news footage, and a series of home-movie videos, in which the Friedman family shot in the 1970s &amp; 1980s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the documentary tells the story of what seem like a quiet peaceful American family, the Friedmans, only to find out that, under the public faade of respectability masks the ugly truth that David's father/public school teacher, Arnold was buying and distributing child pornography. What came next, is a series of public allegations of sexual abuse, brought up by former victims of Arnold, saying that, with his son, Jesse Friedman, both men raped or attempted to molest a good number of his own students. It's here, where the film delivers a somewhat open-discussion of what could had happen or what didn't happen. I just wish, they used more evidence in the film. After all, most of the interesting parts of the documentary is in the additional materials for the 2003 DVD release, entitled, "Capturing the Friedmans - Outside the Frame". It's here, we get to see, many of the home videos, unedited and raw. We learn, how these family dynamics influenced the decisions that Arthur and Jesse make while defending themselves in court. He see the self-chronicling yields a layered, complex examination of how the family dealt with a crippling crisis. I was really disappointed, by the fact, that they rarely use David's brother, Seth's views of the trial in the movie. I can understand, why he didn't want to be filmed for the 2003'ss talking head, interview sequence, but at least, showcase him, more on the archive home videos. After all, David supposedly owns, all of them. Another thing, they should had added to the film is the unseen video clip, 'Grandma Speaks'. It really could had add to the backstory of what truly happen to Arnold &amp; his brother, Howard, during their childhood. Another thing, why did they cut the footage of the prosecution's star witness, if Arnold's trial was once a public televised trial? It makes no sense. It does seem like, the film was somewhat ignoring the relevant evidence of Jesse's guilt by pulling things like that out of the film. Another example of that, is the fact, that didn't show, any of the footage of Jesse's appearance on Geraldo Rivera show in Feb 23, 1989, where he admitted his guilt on national television, while in state prison. Why wasn't it, shown in the film? In the director's defense, he says, he couldn't get the rights to it; which I know is a bit misleading, since he got film footage from other ABC news outlets. Another key evidence left out in the film is that, there was a third defendant named Ross Goldstein, who also took part in the abuse of the children at the Friedman's home. It's Goldstein that turn state's evidence about Jesse and Arnold, over to the court, while testify against them. The film also fails in their research. A good example of this, is the interviews with the victims of the Friedmans. Only 5 of the victims, were spoken to, by Jarecki and only 2 out of the 13 victims were featured in this film. That's pretty sad, as he made little attempt to reach out to those people, willing to voice their views on the subject, because of his strong belief that the citizens of Great Neck, were just living up to the mass hysteria and witch-hunt of the Friedmans. Many of those victims, later reported to news outlets, that they did not lie, exaggerate, or were manipulating by others in making those statements. They accused the filmmakers for twisting facts to make the case against the Friedman seem weakly than it's originally was. Anyways, the film somewhat work with the Friendman's favor, as there were enough renewed interest in the case that Jesse Friedman mounted an appeal. While the appeal was denied, the Nassau County District Attorney agreed to re-examine the case and appoint a special review committee to evaluate any impropriety in the original case, including coercion of Friedman's original confession of guilt. I know, a lot of people has bash Jarecki for deliberately choosing not to pursue his firm belief in the Friedmans' innocence, but as a documentary, it's better to let the audience's decide, who is telling the truth, rather than openly forcing or manipulating them into believing one side over the other. I kinda like, how he leaves it, open for the viewers to figure out, on their own, if any of the Friedman's crimes is true or fictional, despite some biased decisions. I know, some people's dislike that, because it caused some theatre patrons to remain in their seats to argue the innocence or guilt of Arnold and Jesse Friedman, but it's what makes a good documentary is the idea of making people think. You know, you made a moving film, when there were public altercations and debate on the subject matter. Overall: It's a thought-provoking film. With that, said, this is documentary filmmaking at its best -- but it's still best watched by those mature enough to handle the very serious subject matter and those with an open-minded. Like the film's tagline, leave some room in your brain to ask yourself, 'Who do you believe?'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS is one of the most thoroughly engrossing of all the documentaries I've watched. It tells the little-known - at least here in the UK - tale of an ordinary family man, working as a computer teacher at a local high school, who's exposed as a paedophile. What follows is an odyssey of despair and depravity as it turns out family members are involved in an ever-widening circle of crime and deceit.Thankfully, the makers of this documentary had access to reels and reels of 1980s-era home footage from video enthusiast Arnold Friedman, allowing the viewers to get fully drawn into his story. And it's a story full of the usual shocks and twists, one that gets more and more engrossing as time goes on. Moral quandaries are raised, along with the very real possibility of a miscarriage of justice, and the flaws in the American justice system are the most frightening thing on display.CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS has the power to shock you, to disgust you, to make you angry, and, most surprisingly of all, to make you feel sorry for a paedophile. It's one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen, and should be watched in the company of others for the debate that will surely follow a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capturing the Friedmans is, simple put, an amazing documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capturing the Friedmans is about the Friedmans; an upper-middle class Jewish family in upstate New York. One day, the police come to the home of the Friedmans and search for child pornography. The police uncover a number of magazines belonging to Arnold Friedman. A retired high school teacher, he, with the help of his son Jesse, hold computer classes and piano lessons for young children. Once the police realize this, they start investigating Arnold for child abuse. Before long, he and his son are charged with around a hundred counts of sexual assault.I have a lot of fun watching documentaries; I can spend roughly two hours watching a movie on the grounds that I am learning something. Over time I've come to realize that it isn't just what the documentary is saying but how. Sometimes documentaries are clearly biased.If you are a fan of documentaries, there is a website called Documentary Heaven which has lots of documentaries you can watch for free. I remember one that was about secret government cloud seeding experiments. Cloud seeding is, more or less, controlling rainfall and weather patterns. For that documentary, there was just the director, one person that was interviewed, and only about a dozen pictures that faded in and out of the frame. Towards the end of the hour and forty-five minute snoozefest, the director comes out from behind the camera and shouts to the camera, "If he has had so much success cloud seeding, why isn't the government spending millions doing further testing!?" It detracts from the feeling that you are learning something. Instead it feels like you are spending time hearing propaganda.The only other documentary I've seen more than once was Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man (2005) and that was because I saw it for a film class. I watched it once at home and once in the class. I don't usually watch documentaries more than once because, well, hearing it once is usually enough. It's like attending a lecture more than once. You don't unless you have to. I saw Capturing the Friedmans twice so far because, again, I saw it for a class. But I will, however, most certainly be seeing it again. Capturing the Friedmans is an example of amazing storytelling.The plot thickens at every turn. With documentaries about crimes, I read them like a detective novel. You decipher the film maker's bias and then anticipate the details of the crime to make up your mind. In this case, whenever I solved the mystery, if you will, the movie would cut to another interview that threw me off.Jarecki juxtaposes interviews to create fascinating dialogs. For example, we hear from the District Attorney about the process for conducting interviews with children. He explains that the children may be frightened so one doesn't want to put words in their mouths. Instead of saying "we know he assaulted you," one should say, "what happened next?" The movie then cuts over to one of the detectives who conducted many of the interviews for the Friedman case: "We went through the whole line of questions...'We know you were in these computer classes and we know that there was a good chance he sexually assaulted you..." the camera then fades out. It's an example of how the movie can steer us toward reaching a particular conclusion. Better still, the movie can make us realize how we could never know the truth of the Friedman case. Towards the end of the movie, Jesse and his attorney provide radically different accounts of the same event. Who can we trust?A major source of information comes from the Friedman's home movies. The family shot a lot of home movies particularly around the time of the investigations. The footage provides a great balance to the interviews. Some shots from their ordinary cameras are eerily good too which add to the experience. At one point, Arnold is playing the piano and his son moves in for a close up. We listen to upbeat music (though it is made darker given the circumstance) and watch his glasses which reflect his hands on the piano keys.I highly recommend you see Capturing the Friedmans. The subject matter is solidly depressing but it is a really well done documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this movie has such a high rating, 7.9 being IMDb is a lot. It left me feeling disgust towards the family. The mother is the only one who makes sense, and for the boys... well, they are in complete denial, you can see there is a problem with them and their weird/awkward behavior, like someone already said, we can sense that maybe they were molested too. They are rude to their mom, and take the father's side, something that is very common on these situations. I'm sorry but I am very mad at this manipulative film. Andrew Jarecki wants us to feel pity for the Friedmans and create our doubts showing only part of the case, the denial part, you can do some research and you'll see there's still much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crimes remembered and forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary opens pointedly with a montage of 80s Americana, to the tune of even more nostalgic music. The opening is representative of the mix of familiarity and the forbidden that marks the way the film delves into the private side of a very public scandal - the arrest of the pedophile Arnold Friedman and his son Jesse. As many have said, we are not presented with a clear argument as to the pair's guilt or innocence. Rather, we are shown that what lies on the other side of the unspeakable in many ways is almost shockingly banal. The Friedman's home videos seemed to me at once familiar - their house, the decor, the old computers and camcorders, the intense family dynamics - a lot of it reminded me of my own childhood in the 80s. It is the added element of crime and shame which provokes the Friedmans' spiral from dysfunctional but ordinary suburban family to societal pariahs. At the same time, that very element emerged from all this banalia. This is partly due to the nature of the crime: pedophilia usually occurs within families, in the home. It is committed by people you may know and love. It provokes horror in us because it is a perversion of the places and people with whom we are supposed to feel most safe. And because we are really only shown the Friedman's side of the story, we are forced to identify with them, and wonder if such a catastrophe could befall our own family. It is probably for this reason that I also came away wondering about the nature of memory, especially childhood memories. The only person who really knew 'the truth' about the abuse was probably Arnold. The children who claimed to be victims may or may not have been manipulated by the police, and Jesse, even if he was involved in some sort of inappropriate activity with his father, has definitely convinced himself of his own innocence. Now there seems to be no truth we can really grab ahold of, only obscure memories reflected through years of trauma and denial. At one point in the film, the eldest brother David asks of old photographs, "do you remember being there when the photo was taken, or do you remember seeing the picture hanging on the wall?" Based on the evidence presented in the film, nothing really seems to make too much sense - neither the accusations nor the denials. Whatever did happen back in the 80s is now long buried under mountains of fantastical mental creation. The Friedman's obsessive video recording seems to both anchor the memories in reality, at the same time as it suggests that at some point the images of the past, real or imagined, take on a life of their own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Capturing the Friedmans": The Perception of Truth is Mutable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Capturing the Friedmans", directed by Andrew Jarecki, connects to the human condition by first presenting us with a picture of what we've come, as a society, to believe an upper-middle class family looks like, then it turns that ideal over, to view the underbelly and inner-workings of the family unit. The fact that a large part of the footage was shot by David Friedman, eldest son of convicted pedophile Arnold Friedman, gives the footage an essence of raw truth. We see the happy family in candid clips of their birthdays, celebrations and road trips. And we watch, helpless as their family unravels. Jarecki navigates the audience through interviews, changing testimonies, and conflicting memories that inform us; the perception of truth is mutable.David Friedman filmed the drama of his family falling apart as if it were a soap opera. The facade of the ideal family crumbles as Jarecki compiles newsreels, photographs, and interviews with family, friends, student's parents and the authorities that force us to consider an awful truth. Despite education, money, respect in the community, and an overall stable appearance, Arnold Friedman and Jesse Friedman were convicted of horrendous crimes that were reportedly committed in their home. The Plot Arnold Friedman is a family man, respected in the community. He teaches computer classes to children ages 8 ? 11. His life begins a downward spiral when it's discovered that he's been purchasing kiddie porn from the Netherlands. An investigation is opened, his house is searched and his collection of magazines is confiscated. When the police find a list of his young students, they become suspicious about Friedman's intentions and begin an investigation.Witnesses start coming forward after initial questioning begins. The allegations of sexual abuse by Arnold Friedman and his youngest son Jesse Friedman seem to be endless. Father and son are ultimately convicted and sentenced. In the end, Arnold Friedman confesses that he is a pedophile and he molested his son Jesse. He kills himself with an overdose of anxiety medication while serving his sentence. After his father goes to prison, Jesse Friedman pleads guilty and is convicted of sexual molestation and sodomy. Once the judge sentences him, Jesse Friedman emphatically denies his guilt and states that he was coached by his lawyer who advised him to plead guilty. He also disputes his father's claim, that he was one of his father's victims. However, under oath he alleged that his father had, in fact, molested him. After recanting this statement, Jesse Friedman remained steadfast in his claim that he was not guilty and was released in 2001, after serving only thirteen years of his sentence. Theme: The perception of truth is mutable.Subtext: We are presented with disparaging facts and testimony throughout the film. It seems as if everyone is trying to convince us (or maybe themselves) of either the Friedman's guilt, or their innocence. According to noted author Vikki Bell, "The film itself problematizes the notion of 'reviewing' and especially the nature of 'evidence' where that evidence relies upon memory." (Theory, Culture and Society. P. 91). In the case of the Friedmans, the review is most decidedly problematic. Many of the 'players' in this drama change their testimonies. Their memories are informed by the passage of time and the events that have taken place since the incidents. Jesse Friedman admitted that he lied in his testimony at his trial, albeit because he was supposedly instructed to do so by his attorney. He stated that his father had molested him. But his testimony changed when it appeared that the confession would do nothing to aid his cause. Many of the children that came forward during the trial repudiated the charges as adults, claiming no memory of the incidents.Aesthetics: The subtext that review is problematic, and becomes more so when that review is based upon memory, illustrates that presentation informs the perception of truth, making it mutable. We see this message throughout the film. In one clip, Elaine Friedman talks about her memories of being presented with the porn her husband had been purchasing. She says ". . . you know, I didn't see it. My eyes were in the right direction but my brain saw nothing. Because when it was all over the lawyers showed me the magazine and then I saw it for the first time, I really saw it." Her statement says everything about how we perceive information and about how truly mutable the perception of truth can be, when it's based on recollection. It also speaks to the fact that the perception of truth is mutable based upon what someone desires to see or remember. The intersection of plot, theme and editing: Jarecki pulls together the plot and the theme that the perception of truth is mutable, and proves it by using editing to create dramatic impact and influence judgment. According to research done by The Leadership Council on Child Abuse and Interpersonal Violence, there was substantial evidence that was left out of the film (through editing). This "leaving out" of information creates an environment aimed at questioning the outcome of the trials.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating and shocking throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentary film-makers are required to be somewhat voyeuristic in their attempts to capture the truth, but when first time film-maker Andrew Jarecki was working on a documentary on New York's number one clown 'Silly Billy' David Friedman, he stumbled upon a shocking story, and found that most of his work had already been done for him. Not to say that Capturing the Friedmans isn't a well-structured and well-made film - it certainly is - but what Jarecki stumbled upon was something so intimate that even the very best of film-makers could not have captured footage so startling and devastating.The footage I'm referring to is the wealth of home footage captured by David Friedman, his brothers Seth and Jesse, and his father Arnold, before and during Arnold's trial for child molestation. What we witness is an apparently happy, picture-postcard middle-class Jewish family fall apart before our eyes, unravelling a history of tension, sadness and sexual frustration between Arnold and wife Elaine, and a dysfunction that inevitably rubbed off on the children. Aside from this, Capturing the Friedmans also documents the arrest, trial and incarceration of Arnold and youngest son Jesse, revealing possible police ineptitude and holes in the American Justice System.When a federal sting operation results in the arrest of Arnold Friedman following the delivery of child pornography, the respected teacher finds himself questioned further when police find out he taught computer classes at home to kids. Soon enough, children are appearing out of the woodwork making claims of sexual abuse and humiliation at the hands of Arnold and Jesse, and the story becomes a media frenzy. Jarecki unearths flaws in the investigations, even recording some of the former pupils denying that there was any abuse at all, as well as pointing at the obvious fact that there was no physical evidence or anything noticed by the parents at the time.The film doesn't offer any answers, nor does it attempt to as it's not the point of the film. It puts the viewer in the role of judge, jury and executioner, forcing you to ask yourself if this is really justice, and whether Jesse (Arnold's guilt of paedophilia is certain), as annoying as you may find him, really got what he deserved based on suspicion and child testimony alone. Capturing the Friedmans is many things - a condemnation of American justice, a devastating record of family dysfunction - but whatever you get out of it, it is an expertly pieced- together documentary, frustrating and shocking throughout, and telling a great story at the same time.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling and disturbing documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A controversial documentary about the Friedman family, a seemingly typical, upper-class Jewish family living in Long Island, New York. Their very normal and somewhat happy world was turned upside down when the father and his youngest son were arrested and charged with some very shocking and disturbing crimes.'Capturing The Friedmans' is a film of which 95% was watched with a very bemused expression on my face. It's one of those stories you'd happily accept as a work of bold and slightly twisted fiction; the fact that it's all reality is awful. It won't be a spoiler to reveal that the crimes in question were all related to the sexual abuse of children, and the description of those supposed crimes is horrific.Supposed though, because what the film does so well is point out that the actual truth still really isn't known. It's hard to doubt the evidence against Arnold Friedman, the patriarch and alleged main abuser, but it's the involvement of son Jesse that raises the most doubts. Only seventeen himself when the allegations were made, it is difficult to believe that he could be involved. However, it is very plainly shown that he was one of three sons that had a deep affection for their father, but could it really extend as far as agreeing to assist in his sordid acts? That is one of the conundrums of the movie.What really fascinates me about the documentary is the portrayal of Elaine Friedman, the victimised wife and mother. Not victimised just by the outside world, but by her own family. Unlike the rest of the family, she doesn't blindly trust her husband, which leads to some heated arguments and an eventual alienation from everyone. Her testimony is possibly the most impactful, being the woman who has known Arnold the longest and could cite moments which gave credence to his guilt.Director Andrew Jarecki is fantastic at making sure he stays as neutral as he possibly can, given the circumstances. It would have been very easy to turn it into a biased look at an evil family; but Jarecki makes sure to not go down that route. Through the use of home video footage and interviews, we are made to look at the story from every perspective. The ending of the movie is a very emotional and, somehow, happy one, giving a level of sympathy we probably didn't want.'Capturing The Friedmans' is a very good documentary, but it wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea. However, get past the fact that this is people who potentially committed heinous crimes against innocent children, and what you get is a story about family and loyalty. Excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not sure if it is worse watching this movie or watching Nancy Grace on CNN. I am not sure if I have stomach for any more contents like this. I have no interest in giving my attention to a family that craves for attention in such a degree they videotape each other on a regular basis. Its like, "hey, look at me. I am on the camera." Why the family even want to air it's dirty laundry. Just disturbing. The filmmaker tries to create suspension by presenting contradicting of memories on incidences. I wonder how many interviews the filmmakers have to do before they can get the two interviews that are actually contradicting each other. What is the point in making this movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful portrait of a family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Arnold didn't do anything, where was the rage? Why wasn't he pounding his fists on every table he could find, furiously proclaiming his innocence? Instead he'd just sit there like a lump, seemingly dissociated from his surroundings, as his sons jumped through hoops to defend him.It was painful seeing beautiful-eyed David going about his business as a clown in the face of the anguish his family was experiencing. Later some Internet research revealed that he can be a sardonic clown indeed (and he's the most successful and probably priciest birthday-party clown in New York City). The younger males in this family were always clowning and roughhousing around, probably as an unconscious defense against the leaden depression in the home, with its closeted-homosexual, pedophile father and lied-to mom who was rejected from the boys' club and stuck in a joyless marriage.So much about Arnold seemed encapsulated in the interview given by Jesse's lawyer, who revealed that Arnold admitted to having been aroused by a young boy in the jail=house interview room. Absolutely stunning material.I almost jumped out of my seat (with joy) during the epilogue when I learned about the mother's life following Jesse's imprisonment. And yet the mother-son hug at their reunion was entirely believable.This documentary leaves many striking characters in mind. How intriguing that the uncle's homosexuality was left until practically the penultimate frame. And I was left wondering about his relationship, if any, with his nephews. Was the lack of any apparent interaction a function only of his living on the West Coast? And his handling of Arnold's talk of having "messed around" seemed part of the understatement that defined his older brother. Very odd, indeed.The death of he and Arnold's sister, at only 8, by lead poisoning, was an extremely troubling and unexpected point that should definitely have been explained further. Those ghostly film clips of her ballet will haunt me...But caveats like these detract only scarcely from a fully compelling film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Capturing the Friedmans" Film Response: This is a film by Andrew Jarecki, is about a normal family, the Friedmans, who all of a sudden had their lives turned completely upside down one Thanksgiving Night when the police arrested the father, Arnold, and the youngest son Jesse, who was only 18 year old. Jarecki does a great job revealing the Friedman's side of the story as well as trying to stay neutral and let the viewer decide the truth of this terrible incident.Arnold Friedman was a computer teacher, husband, father of three sons, and they're entire family was liked by the community. His wife was Elaine, the sons are David, Seth, and Jesse. Arnold taught computer lessons in their basement to kids around the community and Jesse would sometimes help with the lessons. One Thanksgiving night, the police busted in their house to search everything. They did find some child pornography magazines in Arnold's office, and they arrested him and the youngest son Jesse. As the case went on, the police looked through the computers that they taught the lessons on and found all the names of the children that had taken lessons from them. The police went to all the children's houses to interview the kids and see if they had been sexually abused by Arnold and Jesse. A lot of children agreed that that had happened, so now Arnold and Jesse were charged with being pedophiles. Arnold and Jesse and they're family believed that the police were interrogating the children by telling them that had happened and the children just had to agree and that the police had come up with this theory on their own and that it wasn't true. They had no physical evidence that any of this had happened, it was all based on the magazines they found and the interviews of the children. Finally Arnold confessed, but he only did so to try to save his son from being in prison. Arnold received 10-30 years in prison, but died before his sentence was over. Jesse was told that it was better to confess to the crime, but to say that he was raped by his father to try to get sympathy from the judge, so that is what he did and he got 18 years in prison, but was released after 13 years.Throughout all of this chaos, the oldest son David took several home videos of their family. Jarecki used these videos throughout the film and it revealed how the family was really reacting to the things happening to them. It was interesting to see the actual news reports from the eighties when this actually happened as well as the interviews from everyone involved with this case, as well as the home videos throughout the Friedman's life. There were interviews from the police inspectors that were involved in this case as well as an interview from a child that claimed he was raped by Arnold and Jesse, and there was also an interview by a man that was in Arnold's computer classes and said that none of those things ever happened. There are so many different sides to this case it is hard to tell who is lying and who is telling the truth, but Jarecki did a great job of letting the viewer make their own decision about it.There are also a lot of bonus features on this film that shows things that couldn't be added to the documentary, and in one of those it tells that when Jarecki decided to do a full length film, he wanted to do it on clowns. He came across David, the oldest Friedman son, who is a clown, when he found out that there was a deeper story to be told for the film. This is his first full length film, and a lot of critics say it's going to be hard for him to top "Catching the Friedman's".I really enjoyed watching this film. The Friedman's story was one I had never heard of before and I found it very interesting. At first, I was disgusted by what these men had done, but as the movie went on, I ended up feeling sorry for Jesse, that he served 13 years in prison, for something I believe he didn't do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest documentary I've ever seen but still pretty engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the late 80s Arnold Friedman was a teacher from a middle class, Jewish family living in Great Neck, New York. But that all changes forever when him and his son Jessie are arrested on suspicion of committing horrific sexual assaults on young boys in computer classes. The film follows a series of video diaries in the build up to the trial, as the Friedman family disintegrate, turn on each other and find their behaviour becoming increasingly more erratic before the devastating verdict is delivered.I've said it before and I'll say it again, too many films get released nowadays. So Capturing the Friedmans is yet another film that got great reviews but unfortunately ended up averting my radar. That's not to say if a film gets great reviews I'll rush right out and see it, much like if it gets lots of bad reviews I'll necessarily avoid it (but it's more likely I'll go and see a film if it gets a good review.) I'm quite a big documentary fan, and I've certainly seen some great ones over the last few years. Sadly, while CTF is interesting and holds your attention to the end, I couldn't quite put it in the 'great' category. More the 'pretty good' one.While this is certainly a messed up and weird family you're seeing here, the film somehow just never quite develops the true emotional punch to the devastating story unfolding to fully deliver. That's as much to problems with the family at hand as anything, as they're so disjointed and eccentric it's hard to relate to them as normal people.This is still quite a hard hitting story, though, and still well worth seeing. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good documentary to learn from if you've ever wanted to make one. Great Neck resident, Arnold Friedman has a bad hobby. He likes to view child pornography. A bad habit indeed but he seems normal in every other way. He gets arrested for this and it is found out that apparently Arnold and his eighteen year old son, Jesse, molested his young students during their private computer classes. The family slowly falls apart but remains largely in denial. One of Arnolds sons is a clown and I find it interesting that this documentary was originally about people who make a living as clowns and other off-beat professions. However once the director found out more about the mans family he adjusted his focus to a more interesting subject matter. Good stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speak, memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the police caught respected teacher Arnold Friedman trading child pornography, they thought they'd better check out his pupils. The discoveries they made told an alarming story of sexual abuse. Except that it was almost too alarming to be true - some insisted the children's "memories" had to be false, so implausibly awful the tale they told (and it's telling that, among those who are interviewed without revealing their identities in this film, are those who violate the accepted judgement of their community and insist that abuse did not take place, not just those who claim to be victims). Friedman insisted this too - but later confessed to having molested other children elsewhere, although still denying these particular charges. With his son Jesse also accused, the family broke down, all Friedman's male sons siding with their father (with whom they seemed to share an uncommonly close bond) against their mother, whose loyalty they though treacherously strained. In a mood of hysteria, the prosecution process ended in a mess of plea-bargaining, where no-one now agrees on who did what and why. Amid the confusion, however, there remains an unlikely source of record: the Friedman's family videotapes, coupled with film from what was the first televised court case in the county. Assembled into a coherent (and brilliant) film with the aid of interviews with those involved (including Jesse and his mother), they provide a compulsively desperate picture of a family imploding under unbearable strain. Some things appear clear: that Arnold (now dead) had some dark stains on his history; and that both parents must have been difficult to live with (although some of the earlier family movies appear to show them genuinely happy). But whether this is a tale of the most appalling behaviour, or a notable miscarriage of justice, remains a verdict still elusively out of reach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful documentary with important themes and great psychological insight into its characters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Jarecki's CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS from 2003 asks many important questions about family ties, mental illness in form of pedophilia and the US court system: Was it fair to judge the 19-year-old Jesse? Should only the father-of-three Arnold, who did confess, have been imprisoned? Was the US court system too harsh? Was it worth further destroying the family's life, even though the father certainly caused permanent damage to the minds of a lot of young children? Personally I believe that Jesse was involved in these perverted sex-crimes, but I also believe that the court system was too harsh. Perhaps because I live in Denmark where imprisonments of criminals generally are substantially shorter...Throughout almost the entire documentary I couldn't feel sympathy for these brothers. During the four years of waiting-time they acted as brats, especially towards their mother, who was only looking for the truth, but didn't get it, even from her own husband and son. She did the right thing in avoiding just accepting and helping cover it up. In retrospect I understand how unbelievably demanding it must have been for the brothers to witness their beloved father transform from a well-respected member of the Great Neck community, who other family-fathers entrusted with their children, into a perverse child-molesting monster! They refused to accept this fact mentally - and they still do to this day. In the interviews it's obvious how especially David attempts manipulating us, the viewers, and even himself unconsciously, into believing that his father was much more innocent than he was in reality. The attempt backlashes, and is easily exposed as a primitive psychological defense-mechanism.But in the ending-shot something strange happens - I start feeling actual sympathy for the whole family. When Jesse, after a 13-year-long imprisonment, returns home to his now-remarried mother Elaine, one senses in his eyes (which are the windows to our soul) that he is a changed and ultimately better man. It finally looks like this self-destructive family is going to be okay after all. They have lost an enormous amount of time, so their main objective is to forget their bitterness and anger towards each-other, and thereby obtain a decent family-life. It's still possible! The father Arnold, who is the only "real" monster (if there indeed is a such? I personally think it's a terrible term, but the public tends to be looking for one, so for the sake of simplification...) dies with honor and at least some sympathy when he commits suicide by swallowing a large amount of benzodiazepines (pain-killers) in prison, so that Jesse gets paid 250.000$ in insurance money. A rare case of suicide not being a selfish act - you can't help thinking that it's the best solution, and as Arnold's brother Howard puts it (I'm paraphrasing): "he's finally out of his misery". In the end we feel compassionate towards the family - they've suffered more than enough: Jesse has paid his debt towards society, they've been torn apart as a family, their father Arnold is dead, and they've been widely exposed and harassed in the press. It's time to forgive - for the Friedmans and for rest of the US!Andrew Jarecki's documentary CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS is a very touching, heart-wrenching, hard-to-watch experience with great psychological insight into its characters. It shows you that the executioner (the child-molester) is almost always also a victim in some ways, and that the victims sometimes also are executioners. Cinematically it's very well put-together - actually so well you don't even notice its mechanisms, which helps you to just focus on the story being told. And that's how serious documentaries should be. An absolutely recommendable documentary that almost ranks up there with Barbara Kopple's classic "Direct Cinema" documentary HARLAN COUNTY U.S.A. from 1976, in terms of CAPTURING a realistic depiction of life. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent documentary surrounding disturbed family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Capturing the Friedmans" is an excellent documentary that deals with the disturbing topic of child molestation. A middle class Long Island family is torn apart by the accusations that the father of the family, along with one of his sons have been sodomizing and molesting young boys in their house, while offering computer lessons. The film, much of which is told from home-made family films, does not shy away from the holes in the case, and the inconsistencies in some of the stories that the accusers have made. Nor does it absolve the Friedmans of any wrong doing. It allows the audience to weigh all of the evidence and make up it's own mind.I found the film engrossing, not so much with the core issued of child molestation, but rather with the way the family comes apart. It is sickening to watch and listen to all of the arguing and bitter/angry feelings that are freely and openly on display. The film comes down hardest on Elaine Freidman, wife and mother of the accused. She clearly is manipulative with her husband, and hated by the sons. I found this part of the film very disturbing to watch.The stories surrounding the investigation, the way the police manipulated the witnesses into testifying against the Friedmans, and the way the Friedmans ultimately submit to plea bargains demonstrates what a sham the criminal justice system in this country can be.This is a very good film, and deals head on with sensitive issues. It doesn't preach or lay blame, or advocate any one position. It should be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most accurate adjective to describe this film, as far as I'm concerned, is 'disturbing'. This film shoved my face into an unpleasant and disturbing reality, and as consequence, provided me with a grim and yet important perspective on contemporary society; more specifically, American society. This film shows a complex and full picture, and reveals not one, but many shocking angles to the Friedmans' story - a middle class, respectable family whose father and youngest son were charged with sexual molestation of children. The first of these, is the frighteningly dysfunctional Friedman family itself - an unbalanced and infantile mother, a pervert father who had an abused childhood, and consequently three very confused and troubled children. The primary example of this would be how father and mother Friedman got married - insecure and inexperienced mother Friedman pressed on sexually confused and submissive father Friedman, and so a doomed marriage was born. Needless to say, then, that the central characters of this film are, in a way, the margins of society; even though they may live in an upper-middle class town. Such outcasts appear in every society, so this fact in itself is not as disturbing as the whole film is made out to be. What makes this film so powerful, is the way it portrays society's reaction to the Friedmans. Which leads me to another shocking angle this film provides. A society is defined, some might say, by its treatment of its more problematic sections. The society the Friedmans are a part of was so frightened by their strangeness, that it turned them into a scapegoat; a grotesque caricature on which hateful and ignorant feelings can be centered. Though the truth was never ultimately revealed, it is evident that the Friedmans' situation was used to fuel a sick, collective fantasy. Which leads me to the last, and most disturbing angle this film reveals - the vagueness of truth, the uncertainty surrounding our pursuit of justice. Amidst a somewhat twisted court system of guilty pleas and affected juries, 'Capturing the Friedmans' shows us that the pursuit of truth and justice, a near impossible task in itself, is made almost ridiculous in American society, where things like brainwash, hysteria, ignorance and narrow-mindedness prevail in the court-house. All in all, this is a thought provoking and powerful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and harrowing family portrait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentary film-making has taken a step up in recent years with an increasing number winning high acclaim. It's not surprising that a documentary as interesting and as personal as Capturing the Friedmans is one of the most highly rated, and director Andrew Jarecki's insight into a real-life family being torn apart fully deserves it's acclaim. Great documentaries are films that manage to tell a story while remaining objective, and even though this film handles the ever controversial theme of paedophilia; the director allows the relevant parties to tell the story as they remember it, and ultimately the viewer is left with only the facts surrounding the case, which can then be used to form an opinion. The real life case that the film handles is that of the trial of Arnold and Jessie Friedman. Arnold Friedman was arrested in 1987 on more than 400 charges against young boys aged 7 to 11, while Jessie Friedman was tried for several sexual acts against young boys that were studying in his father's computer class. The film follows their story told through relatives and people involved in the case.Perhaps the most astounding thing about this film is the fact that it was made. Most families wouldn't want documentary filmmakers (not to mention the world at large) getting in on their personal lives, but I suppose it did give them a chance to tell the story as they see it. The themes that the documentary handles are indeed harrowing, as aside from the obvious implications of being a paedophile; we've also got the destruction of a family unit, as well as statements of hated from most of the family members. Andrew Jarecki keeps things moving by splicing real-life footage with testimonies from people involved with the case and the opinions of those close to the convicted. There are several facts that are presented, and some may believe that these are attempts to sway the audience; but the director only allows the actual facts to stand as the truth, while the personal opinions of those close to the central family are kept plainly as opinions. The film never makes a big thing of its central plot, and it's obvious that the director prefers to keep his eye on the family, which ensures that the resulting film is ultimately more frightening. Overall, this is a compelling watch and comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the most fascinating documentaries to come out of HBO films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been useful to watch Capturing the Friedmans a few times since first seeing it in the theater three years ago. It's a film that, much like in daily-life, deserves more than just one glance over with such devastating events. The film depicts not so much the facts or testimonies in the case of Arnold and Jessie Friedman and the pedophile charges that sent them both to prison (though it does to a great extent), but really more so the rift in an already flawed family. But all of the joys and humor that a family tries to have even in the darkest moments is revealed as well, and its a kind of weird testament to how family should, and sometimes does not, stick together in the harshest, most nightmarish conditions. As a documentary, the viewer is given as many sides as possible, though perhaps more with the family's side (some of those who testified or gave evidence on the prosecution side don't even reveal faces, which adds to the curious nature of what may or may not be true), and a very close, nearly voyeuristic look at the Friedmans through the video footage stored up.What Jarecki then culls together in the end is part Rashomon take on what happened, with a very psychological and skeleton-closet tide to it all through Arnold Friedman's past, with another part a detailing of the specifics of the case (some of them kind of unbelievable in a couple of spots), and another part being like an all-too-true and harsh reality-TV type of area. These are people who are, warts and all, not too ashamed to put themselves on tape in order to capture (hence the title) what's going on. It's even shown how, towards the end, how destructive video-tapping can be, even as one gets the complete, subjective view as to why it was done. Also, as a kind of pure take on the dysfunctional family, the film is about as good as it gets, where the emotions and conflicts do not leave things as black and white. There are some very gray areas that are not looked over, and it all adds up to a point where the viewer is given more questions than definite answers. Did they really do what they were charged? Who to believe? This is a documentary, even through more staggering and uncomfortable parts, is really worth watching, as it stirs up conversation and talk about not just the facts in the case or about the people (family and otherwise), but about how a family can or cannot stick together in crisis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very disturbing documentary, Capturing the Friedmans deals with a middle class Jewish family where the father is accused first of child pornography and then of pedophilia (along with his youngest son). The movie is a series of interviews and home videos (it was a family hobby) which deal with the break-up and destruction of the family. It also raises questions on the guilt of father and son - certainly there was a mass hysteria and some of the witnesses lied - but there is no question that Arnold Friedman was a pedophile.The most disturbing moment for me was outside the court house on the stairs when the two brothers and laughing and joking after pleading guilty. It was also disturbing to know that Arnold had "played" with his younger brother because of his mothers inappropriate behaviour.

		<fullReview>Unless someone tells me otherwise, Capturing the Friedmans is a brilliant movie that has one major MAJOR problem, and that is it's editing. This doc showcases a pretty typical Jewish family living in Long Island. They do normal typical things, like making home movies. But when the father gets busted for child molestation of all things, one of the therapeutic ways to deal with this crisis is to continue making home movies of their ordeal while it was taking place. This is dynamite material that's for sure, and the filmmakers deftly mix in shot movies taken by the family, modern day interviews and television footage of the trials to make for highly compelling viewing. The main problem I had about this movie, and I understand other people had the exact same feelings as I do, is that this movie is edited somewhat manipulatively so that we feel a lot of compassion for Mr. Friedman for the first half (it appears that the molestation case has no weight), and we're saying "Damn right he shouldn't go to jail!" and then in the 2nd half a revelation comes forth that is well, damning, and then we're left to draw our own conclusion. It's a rather dirty and sneaky trick to make us feel a lot of compassion, without telling us a major piece of the puzzle beforehand. Now I'm left rather confused about how I feel.Oh right, 2 more things.The brother was completely railroaded.The Mother was a complete witch with a B. \</fullReview>

Not living in NY, NY, I don't remember ever hearing about this case.If it were not for the home video recordings done by the eldest son of this dysfunctional family, I doubt there would have been a movie at all.It's these movies, dating all the way back to the patriarch Arnold's family, that humanize an otherwise abhorrent human being. It's so easy to demonize an alleged pedophile, and subsequently want to destroy an otherwise unsaveable soul, until you see his suffering family.It's at this point you want to pause and at least listen to the rest of the story, to see if you can try to understand the path this disturbed man took to get to such a dark place.You watch how a trio of boys grew up with an apparently loving father. You watch how they behave as any other affluent, middle class family. You watch how a dark secret gets out, and how the boys circle the wagons to defend the family against the outside invaders.No matter how numerous, how horrible, how evil these charges are, you watch the sons fight to keep the family and its honor intact. It's a hopelessly pathetic and uphill battle, but it illustrates how children, no matter what age, no matter what damage, fight with all their might for their family. Its the strongest bond children have, and It's this fight, this tug of war, that keeps you on the edge, keeps you wondering who is telling the truth. In the end, it's decidedly clear. The winners and losers are defined. Life continues on. The illusion of a happy family is only now a muddy memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this documentary to be so intensely sad yet beautiful. The Friedman's are a family who on the outside seem so educated and loving and filled with character and warmth. The family consists of Arnold Friedman, his wife Elaine and his 3 sons: David, Seth and Jesse. The children idolize their well respected father, a teacher both in and out of the community school, and they get along famously. That is, until one day their family portrait is shattered when child pornography is found in Arnold's possession. A whirl of lies, secrets and confusion arises to the surface. Arnold has a secret, dark past unbeknown to his picture perfect family. Arnold Friedman is tangled in a mess of accusations and charges as many of his students speak up to tell their stories. His sons see their father as a hero and stand by their father and believe strongly he is not guilty and seem to have the spirit that they will fight to the end to see that he will be seen as free and innocent. His wife, who has completely lost her ideals on who her husband really is, is in despair. To her sons, she has abandoned and betraying her family and is now seen as the enemy. The documentary displays many family videos due to their obsession with documentation; shots of the family playing and laughing, shots of them fighting, shots ultimately showing their demise. It is a very powerful tale of the destruction of a family. David video tapes a diary, which i found was the point in which you ultimately understood the family was no more; knowing his father was a weak man and will not be able to face his eventual fate nor be able to live with his son facing the same. Filled with many twists and turns, the story follows a path of everyone being able to see the truth except the Friedman sons who are blinded by the admiration and high regard they hold for their quiet father, who in turn, weakly defends himself repeatedly as if only so he will not lose his status in his family and most importantly his son's eyes.For me, the end of the documentary presented a family that was scattered and scarred and one that would never be the same again. Also, something interesting that was received was the examination of how one incident in one's childhood life can truly affect the person they are for ever. This came across as similar to the documentary of "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer". Arnold and Aileen share similarities that encounter them as children and force them to grow into this obscure mold that holds them that way for the rest of their life and are both set on the fact that the police have fabricated their doings and made them out to be a grotesque monster, which leaves the audience questioning, "perhaps they were monsters all along?" Truly a documentary worth seeing, it is immensely emotional, vivid and stunningly sad. However, i find something very artistic about this film and the sadness that is portrayed. Do yourself a favor and see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has been stuck in my head for days. I feel so confronted and exposed-I am forced to realize how much I am brainwashed by media. See, I wanted the end to be like an episode of NYPD blue or something. All solved. I wanted a clear answer to what happened. I wanted to be led to some sort of conclusion.But the greatness of this film is that it does not do your thinking for you. You sit there, uncomfortable-watching a sad and painful and dark dark dark situation play out...and you are left wondering.What really happened? I want to say that i know the three friedman boys were abused by their father-based on what? instinct? intuition? or am I just a thoughtless lemming, carried on a wave of hysteria? child abuse? or witch hunt?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A biased account of questionable injustice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film, styled as a documentary; Capturing the Friedmans is primarily a vehicle for the director to become acclaimed at his profession. This alone brings distortion into the film, and undermines any objectivity the film intends, or purports to have.What the film manages is a view and perspective which is biased toward a family who are in fact portrayed as victims of injustice. The injustice is placed in the context of seemingly doubtful and unreliable evidence. But, the evidence is only made to appear unreliable by a director who tends to portray the police as inadequate professionals, and psychologists as mere quacks, finding things which are not really there. This situation is exacerbated by the lack of tangible, hard evidence.There is no doubt that the police lack training in cases of paedophilia, and that there are ambitious psychologists, but this does not mean that their accusations are unfounded.By manipulating the public understanding of such complex a case toward a biased sympathy of the Friedmans, particularly David's denial of his Father's actions almost legitimises paedophilia. Although we can only speculate as to why Arnald Friedman committed suicide, it could be that his 'deviation' was perceived by him as acceptable, normal behaviour made criminal by a jury he thought misunderstood him. Or he could simply have felt guilty about causing the family to implode into a dysfunctional one. But, as his former wife Elaine states there was dysfunction simmering below the family for years, only to surface when her then husband and father to their children was exposed as a paedophile, and thereby officially labelled as such.Watch this film,but look further than what is been shown. Also be aware that it is a perspective of a family by a director who sought recognition via his ambitions, culminating in controversy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the end of this fascinating documentary, the viewer is left to make up his or her own mind about the story presented to them. Did teacher Arnie Friedman and his teenage son Jessie molest and rape dozens of boys or were they victims of media hysteria?The tale is told from both points of view, with candid home-video footage taken during the trial, and later interview material used to convey the tale of perversion in a well-to-do, but very dysfunctional, Jewish family.There is no doubt that Arnie was guilty of paedophilia ? his collection of dodgy magazines condemned him from the start ? but whether he or his son were guilty of all charges, we may never know for sure.This well constructed and absorbing film unflinchingly reveals how the shocking revelations had a devastating effect on the Friedman family, resulting in despair, divorce and even suicide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dysfunctional family, dysfunctional times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only caught this recently on TV, and I found it a fascinating, thought-provoking film that had my partner and myself discussing well after it was over.Watching it is an emotional roller-coaster: first you think the father is guilty, then you don't, then you do, then you...just don't know. It becomes clear, very clear, that the authorities handled the case very badly and railroaded the father amid Salem-like hysteria which had young boys claiming they had been molested. As was pointed out during the film by a couple of people, considering the statements made by these boys, none of them had seemed the slightest bit disturbed at the time and continued to go back to the classes. Even the prosecutor says, "there was a dearth of physical evidence".And yet...something happened. For a start, Albert Friedman, without a doubt, is a pedophile. It's also quite clear, as the footage unfolds, that the Friedmans are no ordinary family. Their insistence on filming EVERYTHING, through every emotional trauma, proves invaluable and is yet disturbing: during the most heated arguments, the camera is running, and the sons are so concerned with performing for it (and heaping abuse on their mother) that nobody actually communicates with each other. Everyone, apart from Arnold himself, is highly-strung, accusatory, boiling over with hatred and frustration. None of the sons can see the betrayal their mother feels upon learning that the man she's been married to for over 30 years is not, in fact, the man she thought he was, and none of them can see the shame that the father feels that stuns him into submission. They argue endlessly, instead, over their own interpretations of their father's character and who and what they want him to be. He, in the meantime, remains a withdrawn, introspective figure, almost sidelined by his own son's anger and egos.Once you step back from the film, however, you also have to question the film makers themselves: the work is carefully crafted and edited to take you on this particular roller coaster ride. Revelations are arranged and edited and released to the audience in meticulously prepared doses: "Ah, but look at this! Ah, but now listen to THIS!" and the audience are buffeted from side to side by each new testimony until it become impossible to believe any of it.In the end, nobody comes out well from this: nobody is totally innocent, but nobody is definitely guilty, at least of the crimes they're accused of. Something has happened, but the truth gets pushed to the background and no camera can prise it out of the shadows.It's a great, disturbing film, and yet it contained at least one hilarious line: as the family rant at each other over the dinner table about pleas and lawyers and possible sentences, as they tear each other apart and start to implode, the grandmother pipes up from off-camera: "The lawyer called on a Sunday?!" Well, it made me laugh, but I had a Jewish grandmother.</fullReview>

I don't cry often but near the end of the film I couldn't help but want to-- identifying with the sadness of a family falling apart, the tragedy that is spelled out so well in gray, rather than black and white (which I think is the foundation of a truly great documentary). Seeing the love, the caring, the best intentions of the father (and the family together as a whole)-- mixed with the crippling upbringing of the father and the devastating results of his actions.

		<fullReview>CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS (3+ outta 5 stars)Excellent documentary which benefits from some amazing home video footage shot by the participants without any idea that it would ever be seen by anyone years later. Not to give too much away (the most compelling aspect of this feature is not knowing what is going to happen next) a quiet, normal-seeming suburban family has their foundation rocked when the father is accused of a series of sex crimes. Did he really do what he was accused of? Or was it all made up? Even after watching the entire film you may not be completely sure what the "truth" is. The film really does seem to bend over backwards to not take sides. Truly objective documentary movies are very rare... you can usually tell the director's bias long before its over. In this case it's not that easy to spot his agenda. The director started out making an entirely different movie (about professional party clowns) but stumbled upon this deeper, darker story. With the aid of the aforementioned home video footage and taped conversations he has created a one-of-a-kind true story that gets you as close to the center of a horrible event as you'd care to be.</fullReview>

As I found myself.I found myself coming to the conclusion that Arnold Friedman was an evil, troubled man who was probably innocent of the accusation that saw him put in jail. He, was however, guilty of crimes he later admitted and deserved what he got through that.What disturbs you the most is the power of the witch hunt and the blatant lies of the law enforcers along with just how bizarre the Friedman family is.

		<fullReview>I found this a very thought-provoking and disturbing film. The Friedmans were definitely dysfunctional, but were Arnold and Jesse guilty of the crimes? In all honesty I think not. I watched the film, and the extras, and not once were the words "physical examination" of the victims mentioned.If DNA had been found, it would have been irrefutable.The reason I have named this thread David Friedman is my absolute horror at the way this man spoke to his Mother. It was utterly appalling and his father just sat there and let him speak to her that way. I'm not saying Elaine was perfect - perhaps she had never kissed, cuddled or hugged her children, but for one of her children to speak to her in such disrespectful tones, was astonishing and rather ugly. David quite obviously has a lot of pent-up anger and hurt inside him. I hope he is seeking the psychiatric help he obviously needs.This is not a film for the faint of heart - the essence of the film is quite horrific, and lingers with you long after watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I frequently check imdb to see if a movie/DVD is worth getting. In this case the rave reviews in the magazines (with no spoilers) were enough to persuade me to give this one a go, even though it looked like it was going to be one of those movies you really had to work watch for its "worthiness" rather than because you wanted to. I'm glad I didn't read the imdb reviews first because there are way too many spoilers in the reviews which will colour the experience of seeing this documentary. There are no spoilers in this review but if you are thinking of seeing the movie I'd say, stop right there and just go and watch it before reading other reviews that might give too much away.I'm not a huge documentary fan, but this was gripping from the start. The general story, of a family torn apart by accusations of paedophilia, is probably well known from all the mainstream reviews already published. What makes it so powerful is the way the viewer is subjected to one twist after another through the story as it unfolds, which in my case, at any rate, had me railing against the two sides of the debate one minute, and the other side the next. I don't want to say any more than that other than if you get a chance "See this!". The films transcends the controversial subject matter and skillfully manipulates the viewer first one way, then the other forcing us to face up to our own prejudices and assumptions. It's arguably the most powerful movie I've seen this year (and I've seen a lot).Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dysfunction Blew This Family Apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dad's pedophilia didn't ruin his family. Unspoken, unresolved family secrets, stretching back generations did. CAPTURING THE FRIEDMAN'S is a fascinating documentary of a family in horrible crisis, and watching it is like watching a train wreck in slow motion. By the end of the documentary, I was convinced that Daddy was a pedophile, and not at all sure about his youngest son, who went to jail for 13+ years. I was appalled that the men in the family jumped all over the mother, blaming her for everything. She was of a generation where women simply didn't talk about sexual matters. Her statement about foreplay was a clear indication that neither she nor her husband knew a thing about a satisfying and intimate sex life, despite the fact that they had conceived three children. It's entirely plausible that she knew nothing about his porn collection, which was apparently in full- view in her husband's work area (but the son's knew nothing about this? Hmmm...) Mom may have been in denial about matters sexual, and clueless about what may or may not have gone on with her sons, but she struck me as a decent human being who was unequipped to face the overwhelming and horrible legal and emotional choices she was stuck with.How does one cope with such a hot-button issue, particularly one as full of hysteria, headlines, and the almost obvious "rush-to-judgement" behavior of postal inspectors and police against the Freidman's? If so many kids were involved, how was it possible that there wasn't a shred of evidence other than the verbal statements of the kids. I didn't believe the one kid who was filmed in dark shadows one bit. He's in shorts, laying down on that couch in a rather provocative pose. He struck me as being in terrible need of attention. His fifteen minutes of fame kept running in my mind. By the same token, Papa Friedman's scary passivity seemed to brand him guilty right from the start. With his family falling apart, how could he not even attempt to protect them? Was there some truth to Jessie's own involvement, or simply more denial? David's enormous rage seems to be covering some kind of guilt too. Was he abused by his father? Did he engage in sexual acts with either of his brothers? And excuse the arm-chair psychology, but it does seem ironic that David would grow up to be one of NYC's most popular clowns hired by parents for their children's birthday parties! Jessie's lawyer comes off as a self-servingly arrogant. I'm convinced he's a liar. Why would the father admit he's aroused by the sight of a young boy in the prison visiting room when he's in some kind of catatonic state of passivity throughout the film--even to his lawyer? I simply didn't believe the lawyer, particularly when he later said Jessie admitted his own culpability to him. I thought it rather disingenuous to withhold information about Papa Friedman's brother's sexuality until the very end of the movie, where you suddenly see his gay life partner being interviewed. What was the director saying here?The first review written about this film on this site came from a lawyer, and I agree with just about everything he says. However, I don't believe someone should go to jail for looking at kiddie porn. I hate the idea of kiddie porn, let alone the demand and distribution of it. But it strikes me that there are better ways society can deal with purchasers of this stuff. Pedophiles should be incarcerated, with a great deal of psychiatric help so that they at least have a chance of surviving in a society that doesn't have to worry about their children when they are turned loose. This goes to the wider issue of sex in this country. We are stuck with a horrible Victorian legacy of shame where sexual matters are concerned. And religion, which seems to be in denial about anything to do with sex, reinforces the problem. This conflicting issue is made more confusing by the fact that the Internet is rife with porn, with pedophiles lurking. TV programs make open fun of young men and their porn collections. Advertisers use sex in ever-more provocative ways to sell products. If you watch that cable TV program with the older woman dispensing frank advice on sexual matters, there should be no doubt as to the confusion that is rampant about sex in our society today. And we've never dealt with the sexuality of our youth, and will continue to be in deep denial about this. Teenage pregnancy is still a societal problem. It would seem a majority of teenagers today think oral sex is not sex at all! I'm not saying children are asking to be abused by their parents or another family member of friend. There seems to be a strong probability that incidents of incest amongst siblings is probably larger than we realize. We need to understand why, so that it can stop. The tragedy of the Friedman's is that their dysfunction ran smack into society's hysteria over child molestation, and the result was bad for all sides. A deeply provocative, disturbing and fascinating documentary that should stir up the debate even further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ugly documentary about a family who has pedophile case brought against them. We get commentary from members of the family who are still alive, and snippets of cam-corder footage that the family had taking of themselves during the earlier years. They had a habit of video taping each other, and so act naturally on film. This makes it very uncomfortable to watch, as if we really are spying on them. The acts of the alleged crime are described explicitly and this adds to the disturbing nature of the movie.This movie made me think about fear and how to manipulate it, and why are some people so easily offended and sheltered?Walking out of the cinema I heard someone remark that it wasn't about a heist as he thought :) It certainly isn't, and its best if you're prepared for subject matter.Great movie. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

In the end, I didn't know who to believe, which was as it should be. There was no way of finding out who was telling the truth. However, some of the allegations against the Friedmans just didn't wash; at the same time, it's hard to have any sympathy for Arnold Friedman. Jesse Friedman is a different case, it's hard to believe he committed any of the crimes he's accused of. But who knows? And that's the point: In an emotional case involving other people's children, the parents will be out for blood, regardless of the truth. And if any of the allegations are true... but are they?

		<fullReview>I take issue with some of the remarks by law professor Ralph Michael Stein. He entertains the notion that if you buy child pornography in the mail, "the next step" is to go out and molest children. What is the basis for this assertion? For me, pornographic material is what satisfies a person's sexual fantasies and, contrary to Mr. Stein's assertion, forestalls, even cancels the need to go "the next step". I think Mr. Stein's notion is still part and parcel of the sex hysteria that put Arnold and Jesse Friedman behind bars -- unjustly.Mr. Stein ignores the most telling evidence that nothing unusual ever happened in Arnold Friedman's computer classes: the parents came to pick up their children and found no sign of sexual molestation whatsoever. How can a law professor like Mr. Stein then go on to assert that son Jesse was "probably guilty of some offense"? Where in the film is the evidence for this? Is there a different, damaging cut of the film that I didn't watch?If there's ever been a film that supports the notion that lawyers are smarmy and manipulative, this is it. I believe Jesse Friedman when he says that his attorney invented the "fact" that he was abused by his own father. Granted, we may never know all the true facts in the Freidman case, but when it comes to a guy who's been unjustly sent up the river for 13 years and his attorney who talked him into a plea bargain, I choose to believe Jesse.As for the film itself, for all the viewpoints it presented, it never let us hear from any of the parents who originally denounced the Friedmans.

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, but flawed (Spoilers Included)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****Warning: Spoilers Included******Andrew Jarecki's brilliant film, `Capturing the Friedman's' is on course to take 2003's Documentary Oscar. The haunting portrayal of an upper-middle Long Island family weaves together home footage, interviews, and archival footage in such a poignant, unflinching way that viewers will retain feelings of guilt, frustration, and empathy for months after viewing. Unfortunately how it achieves this leaves much to be desired.What led to the creation of film is that of almost a perfect modern fable. Andrew Jarecki, creator of Moviephone, decided to make a film about New York City clowns. He finds `Silly Billy,' the most popular clown of them all. After several interviews, Andrew uncovers behind Silly Billy's "happy, dappy" face is a long, strange sordid tale of pedophilia and jail. Lo, "Capturing the Friedman's" is born.As the film combines multiple perspectives involving a criminal charge of pedophilia that lands father Arnold and brother Jesse in jail, moments of incredible sadness are opened. When David films his brother Jesse dancing before his sentencing, when the mother Elaine tries to find some acknowledgement as she pleads before the camera; all these scenes had me rooting, and nearly crying, at the sweet sadness that haunts the film.But with Jarecki's unrelenting need to find these honest moments, he also finds more that, at the respect of his subjects, could be left out. The scene in which David addresses into the camera, "this is my personal footage, and if anyone sees this, I'll kill them" still shocks me.But what is there to gain with these moments revealed? Will it help David to know that thousands of complete strangers have watched him say these words?Probably not. Will it help his career? Definitely not. The only thing worth killing a man's life and career is, in my experience, insight into the human experience. Which is what the film gets close to, but not close enough to justify the means to which it achieves it with.Without key issues examined such as `What was Arnold's history of pedophilia?" and "What was David' own views on this matter?" and "Who else had opinions of the mother?' one does not begin to comprehend the volatile relationship between he, his brothers, and his parents.Instead of being a cautionary tale of the failings of the modern family, it stutters between being an abjection piece against the criminal justice system, our system of memory, the failing of the media, and the crisis of the American family. Without a deeper probe into the relationship between the brothers and the parents, the film leaves the viewer with an intimidate understanding of the family, and that the 107 minutes of film were mostly there to shock. The mythic overtures of the film are screaming for attention, much in the same way that Silly Billy must have been against getting this picture made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, but Emotionally Draining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>6 out of 10  A shocking, intricate, fascinating look at not only the American family, but our justice system, and illusion of happy suburbia. This is a penetrating study that manages to be, on different levels, both heartbreaking and disturbing. The story unfolds like a crackling best seller. The surprising revelations and twists just keep coming all the way up to, and including, the films epilogue.  The story consists of a family man, and respected teacher, who gets caught possessing child porn. A further investigation seems to point to him molesting children at a computer class he taught in his home. Yet the evidence here seems dubious.  The rest of the film then explores the devastating effects these allegations had on the family. This is shown not only through interviews, but also private home videos taken by one of the sons during that period. The result is very thorough and amazingly intimate. You really feel like you have gotten to know these people and have a very good handle on what happened. There really aren't any unanswered questions left afterwards. You get the feeling that no stone was left unturned. You are also given a complete view of the family. You get to see pictures and stories of when they were children and on up. You not only see what happened but also understand why and how.  Technically it is superlative. The editing is crisp. It really moves at a good pace and you are never stuck with a lot of extraneous footage like with other documentaries. The interviews themselves are quite candid. The people reveal a lot about themselves in a surprisingly open manner. There is also a good mixture of visuals. The videos, pictures, talking heads, location shooting, and even the montages are balanced quite nicely. It seems almost amazing that this was the directors first feature. The only problem with the film is the emotional impact. Although Arnold Friedman is flawed and troubled man there was ample evidence that nothing ever happened at his home based computer classes. It was all just hysteria and a gross miscarriage of justice. You really feel for this man and his family. Yet the director seems strangely removed from his subject. His coldness becomes alienating and thus alienating from the material itself. You wonder what we are supposed to take from this or even what we can do about it. The material is grim, graphic and unrelenting. There is no humor and not even a second of let up. You leave the theater feeling a mixture of anger and depression and no effective way to release it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My interest in this film was high because I am a practicingpsychoanalyst. I am interested in the phenomenon of community hysteriawhich erupts when somebody is accused of being a pedophile and the vicesquad is interested in prosecuting the case. What happens is that theystart 'interviewing' suspected victims and often get the alleged'victim' to 'confess' or 'come clean.' This process often succeeds ingetting people to make up stuff, to please the interrogators or to getthem off their backs! Why are some people so susceptible to make upstories of molestation and abuse? I think sometimes it happens in theirown families and it is a well-kept secret, even repressed and forgotten,but it is there in the unconscious, and the family jumps at theopportunity to blame somebody outside their own family, now the accused,who has been accused of something, so it is concluded that they didsomething to my kid. The charges escalate and before you know it, it ismultiple, brutal sodomy and God knows what else, clearly exaggerations.The father admitted to some fooling around, maybe one student, certainlyhis brother when they were adolescents, and his own teenage son, whodoesn't remember anything like that, although later in the film he says'maybe' something happened and he laughs about it. The family goes backand forth between anguish and hilarity and you know something is wrong. The naive mother is torn and feels angry and disillusioned. The accusedis an upstanding retired schoolteacher with previously an unblemishedreputation, highly admired for his computer and piano lessons, which hegave to teenage boys in his basement with his son, Jesse, as helper. Jesse was also accused of sodomy and rape, but it is clear he is nobrute. Neither is the father, but one incriminating piece of evidenceis that when the father was visited in prison by his lawyer, he told himthat another visitor with a little boy bouncing on his knee made himaroused. There is no doubt the father is a pedophile, but what he didis another story. He admitted to fooling around with one kid one time,out of four years. One of the students was convinced that nothing everhappened, while another claimed sodomy. How could he have molestedmultiple kids for years with no complaint? Everything came out of thewoodwork with the police investigation after the arrest, which startedfrom a post office sting, in which he was set up to buy a pedophilemagazine from Holland through the internet. When he accepted thepackage, he was handcuffed and taken to jail. In the upscale suburb ofGreat Neck, Long Island, that fact threw a previously calm communityinto an uproar, much like the mass hysteria generated by the McMartincase in California and the Amirault case in Boston. In both of thosecases, and now this one, relatively innocent people were thrown in jailand their lives ruined and the family destroyed.As a professional, I would hazard a guess that there might have been alittle fooling around, like the old man tickling some boy's fanny, andmaybe even under his pants, but it was probably a guilty secret andnobody would say anything, not until the ambitious vice squad got intothe act, eager to make their case and justify their existence. Why DOsome people want to be on the vice squad?There are some professionals in the film who give fairly balanced andobjective accounts of what probably happened, but they were voices inthe wilderness. The community got out of control with charges andcounter-charges, assertions and denials. When Jesse came for trial, thefamilies of the so-called victims screamed epithets and physicallyattacked him!What makes this film unique is that the film footage is replete withactual camcorder episodes of family arguments, confessions andretractions, the splitting of the family, the males against the mother,who eventually got a divorce and remarried. One of the sons wiselyrefused to get involved and moved far away. The oldest son is a workingclown in NYC, itself an amazing bit of irony, as he is viewed going intohis act for kids' birthdays like Pagliacci.The family movies go from a happy, normal family before any arrest wasmade, through the worst of it, with one telling episode of theself-recorder--- don't look at this, this is private, this is only forme--- if you are watching this, stop looking! One reviewer trashed thefilm and called the director irresponsible for not coming to aconclusion as to blame and what actually happened, even though it wasobviously impossible to determine. He called it made for voyeurs andfor those with morbid curiosity, as if to say, tell us what actuallyhappened, or you shouldn't have made the film at all!Actually, it is important that the film was made. It shows how hard itis to trust memory and the reporting of events, and shows how the mindremembers and then forgets, admits and then denies, and it is obviousthat the process is not consciously determined. Everything you see isspontaneous and believable, and then it becomes unbelievable, but thereit is, right in front of your eyes. The audience member has to make uphis or her own mind, but we can truly never be sure exactly whathappened. That is the story with each 'recovered memory,' some of thembeing about true events and some, most, being false. Only the mostexperienced expert can tell the difference</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MULTIPLE SPOILERS"Finding the Friedmans" is one of the most startling, intense cinematic experiences I have ever been apart of. More horrific than "28 Days" and more suspenseful than "Terminator 3," this film does not create its terror, but merely extracts it from reality. And that is the most frightening thing about it.Or maybe what is most disturbing about the film is that its subject, the Friedman Family, seems so typical on the surface. Father Arnold Friedman is an award winning high school teacher, and a talented pianist with a zany sense of humor. Sons David, Seth, and Jesse, all share his sense of humor and are, by most accounts, typical, upstanding citizens.And yet, Arnold Friedman is not your typical father. After being caught sending and receiving child pornography through the mail, police accuse him of hundreds of counts of child molestation, supposedly commited during computer classes he taught in his basement. What's worse, the youngest son, Jesse, is charged as an acomplice at the tender age of eighteen.But this film does not present the Friedmans as guilty of these crimes, nor does it claim their innocence. Rather, viewers are given all of the evidence through various interviews, stock footage, and the Friedman's home video recordings, to piece together the puzzle themselves. And what is the viewer left with? Doubt on all sides. Doubt that these men could have committed all of the crimes they are charged with, and yet doubt that molestation didn't take place at all. Mostly, we doubt that any one person is telling the whole truth, but rather that each perspective is tainted by the individuals own subjectivity. And this is the amazing thing about "Capturing the Friedmans," the discovery that "truth" really is a fantasy, that every individual has their own.Now, I must also admit that "Friedmans" tickles the voyeuristic side of me, mostly because of the footage provided by oldest brother, David Friedman. Friedman recorded family arguments, his brother's and father's last night at home before going to jail, and even a few glimpses from inside the courthouse. You see a family, falling apart and disfunction so strange, you cannot even laugh.In the end, your shaken by it all. The screen goes black, the lights go up, and you look at the strangers in the theatre, as if asking for an answer. The creepy thing? No one has the answer.Rating: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Capturing the Friedmans is not a pleasant film to watch. It is not a pleasant film, period. It is, however, a disturbing, thought-provoking, conversation-starting piece of documentary that leaves you with many more questions than answers. How could a well-to-do Jewish family with three healthy intelligent and outgoing boys, a well-respected, award-winning, pillar of the community father and a somewhat distant yet loving mother be upon closer inspection revealed to be a household of cover-up, denial, pedophilia, child abuse, sado-masochism and incest involving numerous children from the community? Even after watching the film, there is no right answer. The film basically sets up two premises: Arnold and Jesse Friedman are guilty as sin and the community is correct, or Arnold and Jesse are innocent and the community of Great Neck Long Island New York is caught up in mass hysteria, witch hunting and community outrage that convicts the men before a trial can be held.Yes, Arnold Friedman used to buy and lend and borrow pedophilic literature, but does that make him a sex criminal? Does the discovery of such literature in a private home constitute good cause to proceed with seeking out and interviewing any adolescents that may have come in contact with the man? It is evident from the film, or at least from the makers of the film that the law enforcement community, the judicial system and the community at large were very quick to convict these two men on just the word of witnesses, most of whom were hypnotized or asked leading questions to obtain the desired information. On the other hand, a history of confessed pedophilic sexual encounters with siblings and others in his past does; on the surface; damn Arnold Friedman in the eyes of that community. His wife's quick acceptance of his guilt and the guilt of his son is evidence of a deep rift that was built up over the years. Arnold enjoyed the company of his sons, his male students, and apparently his wife was only in the background to cook and clean and make the beds. In one interview, another son admits that his parents probably only had sex three times, the times immediately preceding the conception of the three boys.So what is Capturing the Friedmans trying to do? Alert us to the community mind that in an instant could be upon us and condemn us unheard? Or show the ruthlessness of prosecutors and judges who manipulate defendants into confessing to crimes they are innocent of in an effort to avoid a huge heap of charges and indictments that could result in a much longer prison term if found guilty? Certainly it does. But the film also hints subtly or in some cases not so subtly at the possibility that what the kiddos in that home-based computer classroom were learning wasn't necessarily DOS or Windows, but a life lesson in trust, and the betrayal of that trust. But remember, not every child accused them of abuse, some said nothing went on at all, so where is the truth? In the end, only two people know the truth... Arnold and Jesse Friedman. Arnold is dead, a suicide in prison to allow his son recieve a large insurance settlement. Jesse Friedman maintains his innocence to this day. One day, we may know the whole truth,or we may never know. I hope for the former, but fear the latter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I found this documentary overrated, I also found it engrossing. It shows a real family dealing with horrible criminal charges being brought against family members by police, who may have cheated in order to make the case.The facts are slowly revealed in a way to make one ask, "Can this get any worse?"Of special interest is an interview with a former McMartin Trial reporter. She turns out to be an expert in the different "witch-hunt" investigation techniques used by police to frame innocent people accused of this type of crime. She does a great job of pointing out what the police did wrong in the case of the Friedmans, and some of the interviews in the film back her up.Mrs. Friedman's stoicism in the home movies and in her interviews is incredible to watch. She faces charges of not standing by her husband.As more information is revealed about Mr. Friedman and his son, I found myself chanting, "Innocent until proven guilty. Innocent until proven guilty." I left the theatre not knowing for sure.The reason I think this documentary is overrated is that the filmmaker purposely withholds evidence from us, in order to make us wonder about the guilt or innocence of the Friedmans. I believe that if he had given us all the facts of the case, we would know one way or the other.Our knowing the truth by the end would not have diminished the impact of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at Sundance in January and its impact still has not abated. At Sundance, you have no idea what will happen to a movie afterwards. Since it was a documentary, I had hoped that maybe an HBO or Showtime would pick this up. What a pleasant surprise -- and testament to the film -- that it has received such wide release.As other reviewers have noted, the film touches on so many different levels: the dysfunctional family dynamic, the child abuse hysteria, the over-ambitiousness of prosecutors, the transgression of man, and the denial of reality in dealing with trauma (just to name a few).After the film -- which started at midnight -- there was a Q&amp;A with Andrew Jarecki, Elaine Friedman and Jesse Friedman (who had received special permission from his probation officer to come). Indeed, it was eerie to have them in the flesh, answering questions at some rinky-dink movie theater in Utah at two in the morning. I assure you, the film captured the Friedmans exactly as they still are. Elaine still feels like the resentful victim of a family full of men, consumed more by the embarrassment of her husband and shunning by her sons than the defense of her family; Jesse still has an emotional immaturity and an extremely naive -- almost childlike -- view of the world. This is despite being in his mid-30s and serving 14 years in prison.The film is gripping. Its images and messages will not leave you anytime soon, if ever. It's been almost six months for me, and I still haven't forgotten.</fullReview>

This documentary is so fascinating and haunting. I alternatedthrough the film feeling furious that I had paid money to see a familyself destruct, elated with the heartfelt reunion between Jesse and hismother, touched by David's willingness to ruin his career for Jesse, andannoyed by the incompetent police. Other than Requiem for a Dream, neverhas a film drawn out so many emotions from me at once. What was just asinteresting was the verbal reaction of the audience. I heard sighs offrustration as Elaine babbled on, laughs when the detectives werespeaking, gasps at various information. At one point a man yelled outbitch when Elaine was speaking. In the lobby on our way out so manypeople were discussing it and on the subway I heard a couple arguingabout it. What a response! This powerful documentary affects everyone insomeway. See it twice. I am going again tonight because I am still sooverwhelmed and impressed by first time director Andrew Jarecki and theFriedman's destruction. The mix of film, super 8, tv footage and homephotographs along with the expert editing will stay in your mind</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To view this film: an ethical dilemma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very much enjoy good documentary film making, and early on - watching the trailer and reading reviews - this film was solidly on my `To see' list. But after reading in my local paper that one of the Friedman sons refused to participate in the making of this film, my attitude has changed from interest, to uneasiness, to something boarding on revulsion.I know that I would feel uncomfortable, and even betrayed, if my early and teenaged family life were shown to the world without my permission - despite its comparative banality and uneventfulness. And I would feel that way even if all the other members of my family had 'voted' to distribute our collective images against my desire for privacy. Yet that appears to have happened with this film.Reviewers I have read have stated that this is a powerfully perceptive and emotional film, and that it leaves you feeling 'dirty' from having delved too deeply into other people's private lives. Despite what the others may have allowed, one of film's subjects has indicated that they do not give us permission to look.Our society holds as a high ideal the privacy of the individual. In images that come out of natural disaster, violent crime, war, and even decades old images from the holocaust, we protect the anonymity of the innocent individual unless they expressly grant us the right to divulge it. I wonder if the filmmakers, in a tantalizing rush for their own edification, discarded the wishes of one of the Friedmans, something that they themselves would have demanded if it had been their early family lives up for exposure.I can believe that the legal 'right' has been established to show these family images, but I do not feel I have the right to violate that one individual's privacy.One of them said no; and no is no..then one day they came and exposed me. And I could say nothing because I was guilty as they were, for not speaking out and saying that all men have a right to privacy.(with apologies to Charles Mingus)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dubious presentation of a disturbing story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[S P O I L E R S]"Capturing the Friedmans:" what does the title mean? First, filming them, and their filming themselves, "capturing" their own lives, or parts of them, on screen. This was "An American Family" that did its own documenting in the early days of video, the Seventies and Eighties. Along comes an inexperienced filmmaker, Andrew Jarecki, meaning to do a film on party clowns, and makes a discovery of a family's traumatic history. The father, Arnold Friedman, had a taste for boy pornography and was caught in a post office sting operation. This came at the height of the American hysteria over imagined satanic orgies involving children leading to trumped up descriptions of such orgies by pressured young people, to arrests and prosecutions, in various parts of the country. And it so happened that the nerdy Arnold Friedman, an award winning high school science teacher, also had a computer class at his house attended by young boys. Police got the names of the students and went to work on them. Prosecutions of Arnold and his youngest son Jesse followed and the family was destroyed.It's clear from the pornography sting and from his own admissions that Arnold was indeed a pedophile. As a youth had had sexual encounters with younger boys and with a gay brother (which the brother does not remember; nor does the film reveal the brother to be gay till the end) and he had had arousing encounters with small boys at the beach as an adult. The extent of the latter is uncertain, and whether the boys were even aware of anything is unclear. Given Arnold's evidently repressed nature, probably the events and the arousal happened mostly in his mind. It's also clear that nothing whatever happened in the computer classes and that all the testimony was prompted by the police questioners just as similar testimony was elicited during the same period on the West Coast and elsewhere, during a period of hysteria documented by Debbie Nathan, a journalist interviewed for the movie. Both Arnold and Jesse pleaded not guilty when arraigned. But a series of disasters followed. Arnold's previous pornography conviction was a bad beginning. The boys had always been a team and shared their dad's sense of humor and their mother had always felt left out, and now, in this horror, feeling betrayed already by the child porn case, the mother turned against her family and chose not to believe in her husband's innocence. Sadly, Arnold and Jesse did not have a top lawyer to defend them. And perhaps worst of all, Arnold collapsed with guilt and prepared for martyrdom, eventually caving in to his wife's suggestion that he plead guilty. Her ostensible assumption was that if her husband took on the guilt, things would go easier for Jesse. But this proved to be a grievous mistake and yet, incredibly, Jesse also decided to plead guilty and even made a tearful confession in court that was as hysterical and imaginary as the witnesses' testimony in the case. We never see the latter, but we see enough of the filmmaker's interviews long after the fact with witnesses, fellow students, and their parents to gather that it was all a result of hysteria, coercion -- and in the case of the most suspicious and talkative former witness, hypnosis.And so the Friedman's were "captured" again, literally now, by a hysterical American society and by their own helplessness to resist that hysteria, captured and brought to ground, destroyed as a family and two of their members sent away. The 19-year-old Jesse served 14 years. His father was sentenced to life and committed suicide in jail by taking an overdose of an antidepressant. Jesse has recently been released, at 32, and been reunited with his mother, Elaine, who has remarried. The brother David, a top New York City party clown and the source of the documentary idea, may have his livelihood threatened now through the movie's revelations. The middle son, Seth, wisely refused to participate in Jarecki's project.The Friedman's let themselves be taken advantage of. And they equally took advantage of themselves, filming their early moments of celebration and silliness, and then, in the crisis, filming their anger, their mutual hostility, and their despair. And finally today they have allowed themselves to be taken advantage of again by letting Jarecki proceed with his nosey, clumsy exploration of their ruined lives. "You be the judge." "What really happened?" the movie's publicity luridly proposes. That is foolishness, of a wicked sort. There is nothing important that is not clear here -- including the bogus lack of bias of the filmmaker, who obviously knows the trial was a sham, and who confused the serious issues involved and further sullies the family's ruined reputation, and weakens his presentation of what could have been an extraordinarily compelling story, by hiding behind a mask of neutrality and coyly manipulating the order in which the facts are revealed.This is not a good way to present a documentary. On the contrary. The lesson is that when you're dealing with facts there are two basic ways of presenting them. Either you lay them out in the order in which you discovered them, making your documentary a story of how you assembled your material. Or you present them completely for maximum clarity from the start, like a good news story "lead," with the rest that follows simply filling in the details. Jarecki unfortunately does neither, so the movie he made is a good portrait neither of his process nor of the facts.For me the most disturbing elements of the story are Elaine's abandonment of the men and the sons' growing hostility to her, on the one hand, and Arnold's hangdog, pathological assumption of guilt, on the other. Elaine seems to have dealt with the nightmare by putting all the blame on the others. Arnold, in yet another family video, is curiously upbeat on the night before he went to jail, playing the piano, smiling, and talking more forcefully than he ever has before. It's as if he wanted to be sent away and the expectation of it was a tremendous release for him. His whole sad secret life, his pedophilia, could only be made public by his immolation and vilification for guarding it all these years. He had decided that he was the sacrificial lamb. For a moment he was fulfilled, going away to be punished for his sins and setting his family free. But of course it was not that simple and his happiness was not to last. In the reality of prison he was miserable and rejected and filled with the more terrible guilt of being the cause of his son Jesse's ruined life. Jesse was beaten and nearly killed in jail. If this material sounds undigested and painful, that is the impression the movie leaves. There is no catharsis of tragedy and no revelation of truth, just the scandal and downfall of a family and a documentary profiting in a dubious fashion by that family's guileless willingness to tell all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...that elusive thing called truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a continuous surprise, as events keep evolving that contradict what the viewer believes is the premise, and by the end, it is as hellish an experience as IRREVERSIBLE. What appears, at first, to be a closely-knit, middle class family with a penchant for home movies, capturing every waking moment on film, including the typically happy horseplay of children, turns instead into a cinematic revelation of each and every embarrassing family moment. The power of this film is the subject matter, pedophilia, in the manicured affluence of Great Neck, Long Island. Charged are the father and his teen-age son, who may himself have been abused by his father at an early age, but the individuals involved, the alleged perpetrators, the alleged victims, the neighbors, the police, an investigative reporter, the Sexual Crimes Unit, the defense attorneys, the District Attorneys, and even the presiding judge, all are scrutinized by the filmmaker when a host of contradictory information is revealed. The editing is extremely effective, as little by little, bits and pieces of information are carefully revealed, each continuously changing the complexion of the issues being examined. This myriad of `evidence' doesn't come close to revealing the truth, not as you and I would like to believe, not to a degree of certainty, but is instead a bizarre RASHOMON-experience of mixed-up, partial truths, with plenty of never-ending denials. These denials, on the part of the father, the son, and the loving family that simply can't bear to believe these allegations, are perhaps the most heartbreaking aspect of the film, as such intimate, personal awkwardness repeatedly captured on film, simply makes the viewer cringe with discomfort. However, the film is beautifully composed, mixing family photographs and videos with documentary footage, the subject is thoroughly examined. There was a little of the secrecy of AUTO FOCUS to this film, only unlike the outlandish sexual activism and nonchalance shown there, the repression here is so severe it's emotionally suffocating, and we are left with the devastating after-effects, literally, of chaos and turmoil. These broken parts will never be put back in place again, and the sick feeling in our stomach is likely to be our own unease with our failed attempts to come to terms with so gripping a subject. This is a shattering film experience. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>`There's your version, there's my version and there's the truth,' is at the murky heart of Andrew Jarecki's brilliant and disturbing, `Roshamon-like' Shockumentary, `Capturing the Friedmans.'I can't stop thinking about this movie, I've seen it 3 times and each time I believe something different. Like some cubistic courtroom nightmare, each character adamantly tells their version of the truth. The masterful way the filmmakers enlist the viewer as juror, carefully revealing the 'evidence', is at once courageous and exasperating, never manipulative. This is what documentary filmmaking is all about.What phenomenal luck or fate, while making a movie about Magician Clowns who entertain at privileged New Yorkers children's parties (David Friedman did my sons 4th Birthday), Jarecki and his crew wound up capturing the Friedmans in a way they never could have imagined.The rich film (not video) and lush score, juxtapose the harsh reality and hysterical blindness of justice, making it even more painful to watch. One particularly haunting scene, a tearful David, alone in his underwear, raging at some future viewer, is so visceral and intimate, you almost have to look away.Perhaps David and Jesse are in some sense relieved that their truth is finally told. How fortunate they are to have stumbled upon such a noble facilitator as Andrew Jarecki. I met Jesse at a screening recently and was moved by his gentle kindness and David's choice to exonerate his brother over a successful career, is the essence of devotion. The courage of these brothers and of the filmmakers, should garner an Oscar and more importantly, set the record straight. This is truly filmmaking as healing art.</fullReview>

But the following is my version of a recommendation:Andrew Jarecki was present at the screening I attended and was available afterwards for a Q&amp;A session with audience members. During this time he revealed that the original cut of the film lasted about 5 1/2 hours, but was cut down to its current 2 hour version (presumably for financial reasons). Suffice it to say that I'd eagerly watch 5 1/2 hours of Jarecki's film - or even 10 1/2 hours. This is one of the finest documentaries I've ever seen.</fullReview>

At first I thought the whole thing was fake, like Blair Witch, but then I read about it on the web and checked out and it all checked out.I think they let the cameras roll during such painful times for two reasons. One, because it gives the whole thing a movie-like fantasy quality to help distance the the subject his grim reality. It's like, if you videotape someone dying, you can subconsciously experience this as nothing more than a video, not reality. Second, as a plan to ultimately exonerate Arnold and Jesse, because maybe they could gain some sympathy by seeing how overblown their charges were.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is The Crucible for modern times. A little bit more of late '80s verisimilitude would have been helpful to give a backdrop to how this family was destroyed by a society bent on burning paedophiles at the stake. Remember that there was AIDS hysteria, the Meese porn commission, the right-wing anti-gay "pro-family" anti-libertarian fear-mongering agenda, just-say-no-to-everything, and a nation ready to burn witches at every turn. Enter a warm, nebbishy computer teacher and his teenage son who attract a following of boys more interested in learning about computers than baseball after school, and you just know that all hell is going to break loose when the teacher orders the wrong kind of Dutch magazine (offered to him by the Post Office, of course). That launched a police investigation in which the computer students were tracked down, interrogated, and even hypnotized so that they could "remember" the sexual abuse that the DA knew must have gone on during the computer classes in the Great Neck home, never mind that no boys or parents ever made a complaint of any kind. This is America at its most hellish, and someday (hopefully soon) we will be in awe at how easy it was to replay the Salem witch trials in 1988 Nassau County.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A documentary about the nature of truth when a respected married man and his son are arrested and tried on gay child porn charges.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What fascinates me most about the film is the way the way the filmmaker deftly appears to weave together officials, experts, family members and home movies and video to attempt to give a sense of truth of happened when the Father, Arnold Friedman, was arrested on various sex with minors charges. On first viewing it seemed so full of ballyhoo - what officials were saying was so different that what the family was saying (even the mother, Elaine) - That it seemed little more than a highly concocted docudrama. In fact, I dare any docudrama maker to create a story this engaging. Upon a more careful viewing it became apparent that the truth was likely not embodied in any one person's statement or perspective (Arnold died in prison before work on the film began). Perhaps the truth in some cases cannot be known and perhaps it is a mental construct of sorts. The film "captures" oh so well the dysfunction that existed within it and a power of denial strong enough to actually change reality.A landmark film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No justice for all....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This startling documentary is disturbing in about 50 different ways, from the subject matter, the fractured personalities on show, the emotional numbness, delusion, ability to argue and defame, mass hysteria, media hysteria, an actual Jewish witch hunt, horror revelations and the fact that there is a camera rolling through the whole catastrophe. And then there is the parents, so peculiar and almost bewilderingly icy to each other, or reacting with either fury or affection, pleasant then heartless.... as this horror story unfolded, it became obvious that there was nothing obvious... such is the dilemma and enigma of this knotted family and the avalanche of scrutiny that befalls them... oh and some sort of hypnosis that each participant or even town official seems to fall into. People invent things and regale them like facts, a son is jailed for crimes he did not do, the father admits the worst... it is a maze of shocking revelations. And so sad. Poignant photos and home movies of their seemingly idyllic 1950s and 60s, then hideous sexual molestation and intellectual brainwashing. How the hell did this film ever get made let alone this story evolve? You must see this film and even at the credits you are not sure what you just saw and heard. And one son becomes a party clown. Yes fact is stranger than fiction because if this was just a movie it would be unbelievable. As fact is is even more so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insane clown posse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is about a family which has had the most serious charges of child sexual abuse levelled at two of its members: the father, Arnold Friedman, and his son, Jesse. Using interviews with members of the family, the police and the legal fraternity involved, as well as home movie footage taken at the time by some of the Friedman's sons, we get a well rounded examination of the case. There is enough material in this documentary to satisfy whatever side you may take in this tragedy/travesty. Initially, Arnold is discovered to have bought child pornography from overseas-a very creepy fact about the man, no doubt. When the police investigators learn that he has been running a computer class for children in his basement (where he hides his child pornography magazines), they put two and two together, and come up with...six hundred and sixty six!What is so fascinating about this documentary is what it reveals about the nature of mass hysteria, delusion and memory. There are some revelations which Arnold makes which you wonder about...is it true? If it is, why doesn't his brother remember it? Is Arnold himself a victim of delusion? I will concede that Arnold did deserve action taken against him, concerning his possession of child pornography, but...You have to conclude that the police involved in this investigation were either manifestly and grossly incompetent in their work, or they were deliberately framing Arnold as a result of their outrage of the magazines they found. In either case, they are not fit for the office of police work. Perhaps in their own mind, the graver the imagined offence alleged, the greater the police officers involved reflected glory in 'stopping' the 'monster'. My take on this is that the officers were not corrupt-but, like the witch trials in Salem (or the case of Lindy Chamberlain or Dr Haneef in Australia, and the parents of JonBent Ramsey in the US), the police officers' own sick and twisted imaginings infected their work. This is borne out through many interviews with the so called 'victims' in this case...the police officers pretty much 'lead' the 'victims' to say what the officers wanted them to say. and some of that evidence was based on the at the time dubious and now thoroughly discredited use of hypnosis to 'retrieve' 'repressed' memories. As thoroughly disgusting as the allegations against Arnold and Jesse were, they were absolutely absurd in light of the underwhelming evidence for it. That the police could present such nonsense in court was one thing, but for the judge presiding to give any credence to it at all is gob-smacking. It seems to me that for the police officers and the judge presiding, their outrage at the 'crimes' was sufficient to justify the Friedman's treatment. If these people are the best America has to offer defendants, then God help America. Even though I am giving the police officers and the judge presiding the benefit of stupidity, I can do no such thing for the lawyer representing Jesse. "Representing" is such a misnomer in this case. When the documentary makers interview him, he is so unctuous and I really get the impression that he is shamelessly lying to self-aggrandise himself. The 'specific' detail that Jesse's lawyer provides about the Friedmans is meant to make you think he knows a lot of incriminating stuff about them, but really, he just seemed a lying, lawyer on the make to me...putting his career over justice...which is what this case is all about for me. As I've mentioned before, Arnold is reported to have made some confessions in therapy concerning his paedophile activity. What I wanted to know, and wasn't gone into, was the status of these confessions. Really, the documentary makers have done a much better job of investigating this case than the police or the lawyers. They could have done more investigation though. Were Arnold's recollections as tainted as that of the alleged victims?Another tragic aspect to this case is the charging of Arnold's son Jesse with similar heinous crimes. Now, if the police were corrupt in framing Arnold for importing child pornography, then you have to wonder how they could live with themselves for also framing Jesse, as he had no part in his father's predilection for child pornography. Personally, I think it IS important to know WHAT Arnold did and to charge him with those crimes. It is an absolute travesty of justice that lazy and incompetent police couldn't even be bothered doing Policework 101 to get their man. Their farcical 'investigation' says a lot about the American system. No wonder so many Americans rot in jail with dubious police work convicting them and no one bothering to do proper investigative work which could see them out of prison. If Arnold was guilty of actually molesting children (I don't believe that he was guilty with what he was charged with...I mean any previous crimes), then, if there is cosmic justice, he will go to Hell for it. And for doing such an abysmal and lazy job investigating and prosecuting the Friedmans, you know that the police officers involved (the phrase "The road to Hell is paved with good intentions" comes to mind), as well as the judge (don't they study the laws of evidence in the US? Is the notion of "evidence" in the US as 'sophisticated' as it was in the Salem witch trials, still?), and that unctuous 'defence' lawyer for Jesse will burn just as well as Arnold in Hell.The REAL tragedy here is that a community has convinced itself that something truly awful has happened to them. If there is any justice at all in the world, you'd hope that those Keystone cops who investigated the case are either sacked for incompetence, or charged with perverting the course of justice. And that judge should be forced to retire...or take some 'refresher' courses on evidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ever wondered why literature was invented?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most of the IMDb voters and commentators, I found this movie dull, nasty and ultimately pointless. As readers and cinema-goers, we rejoice in literature because real life is unshaped; lacks structure; rarely carries power in its utterances; does not provide insights. For all this to be achieved, we need writers. The deficiencies of this film (and, I would suggest, of reality TV) provide ample evidence of the primacy of literary forms, and remind us why humankind has developed drama - slowly and painfully, with many false trails along the way, but with consistent determination - over the past couple of millenia. Good documentary (and I don't think we've yet seen one on general release) analyses; interprets; examines issues and underlying causes. Good docudrama (like "Touching the Void") or a good biopic (like "Blow") dramatises reality. There is a pleasing frisson provided by the truth behind the images, but ultimately we are watching a story that has been shaped, or has shaped itself, so that it is worth watching. "Touching the Void" intersperses dramatisation with talking heads, but the heads are worth listening to as they have a real drama to relate - a tale of triumph over adversity, of the great outdoors, of experiences that thrill as well as horrify. "Capturing the Friedmans" does none of this. I was frankly bored by this rather squalid and self-regarding family, with nothing worth saying despite their endless self-documentation, and their perpetual squabbles. The only one of them for whom I can conjure up any respect is Seth. He, you will remember, is the one who refused to have anything to do with the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A paradigm shift in documentary filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One may say of this film as being one of "cutting edge journalism" or "brilliant and concise sympathetic introspection" or, quite possibly, "self-indulgent and self-absorbed". The meaning of the film is deliberately ambiguous for several reasons. 1)The viewer of the film doesn't know anything about the Friedman's prior to the viewing, unless, they have done research on the case study, 2)The audience member is seemingly presented anecdotal home-movie footage so as to create a "normal" portrait of a "normal" family in middle-America suburbia, 3) The inexplicable nature of the crime committed by the father of the family leaves the viewer poised with morbid curiosity, 4) The movie is deliberately open-ended so as to create within the viewer questions on the nature of truth and the social construction of that "truth", 5)The viewer is presented with an overwhelming amount of legal and psychological theories presented to them by "experts" in the field, so as to confuse the viewer about the true nature of structural reality and it's relationship to the individual, 6) Finally, the viewer is presented an argument about "victimization" by the media and community "hysteria" in line with creating a modern day witchunt. Will the viewer accept or reject this argument?What may "turn off" the audience to this movie is that it tends to present i nformation in a scattered and unorganized way. Our conventional linear way of thinking is challenged. However, this is the point. The burden of proof is on us. What will we do if this happens to us? Will we learn what happened in Great Neck, NY? What efforts will we incorporate to avoid the disintegration of a family, a community, if such accusations were to come to fruition in our own neighborhood? The answer may very well be , "Nothing". Hopefully, what this film will accomplish, will be to educate us that the institutions that govern our behavior ought to be regulated by us, and that clear concrete evidence ought to be utilized in the act of condemnation. This act of condemnation is something that our society seems all too willing to enjoy. Thank you Jarecki for bringing this film to the mainstream audience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't like documentaries, but I love a good Whodunit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate documentaries. Can't stand sitting through them, and frankly I believe it's the most boring way to run footage through a camera that I can think of. As a filmmaker, I dread doing them, and rarely do I ever see a reason to make it to a theatre to see one. Yes, yes, Michael Moore this, Michael Moore that. Whateva. So I get invited to go and see this documentary, and having nothing better to do with my time, I go, and showing up fashionably late, I walk in and notice two things. One, is that from the first frame that hit my eye, this film HAD me, the cinematography was on point, even though it was a documentary. And the home movie footage? I think was the most disturbing stuff I have ever seen, and is essential in driving the point of the film home. Now, as a filmmaker, I watch a TON of movies, per day, per week, etc. After a while, your eyes seem to have seen it all. Camera angles, tricks, dialect, sound, foley, etc, nothing really grabs a hold of you and if it does, it doesn't hold on for very long. This film was different. The second thing that I notice, is that this room that I am standing in was packed, hence why I was standing, because there were no seats left. This is the story of a suburban Jewish home in Great Neck, Long Island (which if you are from Mars or Iowa is in New York) who's dirty secrets and skeletons come out for the entire world to see in the 1980's. For many of us around at the time, there is a good chance that by now, you have forgotten what a huge story this was. Originally, this documentary started out as being about the top New York clowns in the city. Y'know, the one's you had at your birthday parties? Now, personally, I think clowns are pretty dark folks, even darker must be the stories behind them. This film puts an exclaimation point on that take. Arnie Friedman and his youngest son, Jesse were charged with multiple counts of child molestation, rape and sodomy. This film takes you on a trip through Great Neck, the police, the D.A., and the Judge, who next to Arnie Friedman is the real monster of this case. But moreso, it takes you inside of the family's home with real footage of the inner fighting between the family before, during and after the trial. If you don't see this film in theatres, get the DVD and see the story behind the story, because there is a ton more that didn't make it into the final cut. Even by the end, I was still left saying to myself "Okay, now who and what do I believe?" and this was after talking to the director (I'm not even sure if he knows for sure) This is a must see film, it is disturbing and unsettling, it is the real story behind the comedy done in "The Celebration". Everyone should see this film, even if you happen to be like me, and hate documentaries.</fullReview>

This film dares the viewer to make a decision, to be a jury in what Jesse Friedman considers the only fair trial he'll ever receive, and to see if you can choose a verdict without a reasonable doubt. I challenge you to watch this film openly and NOT experience a rollercoaster of emotion and doubt. The only certainty in this film is that there is no commentary greater than the hands-on, visual and aural experience to show the sadness and horror of a family being torn apart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth is a very subjective thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a unique film. I would dare say that there will never ever be a film like this again. For one, I don't think there is a strange enough family in the world to record so much personal information on themselves. This film explores the child molestation charges brought against the father and son of a rather eccentric New York family in the 1980's. I have to admit, as I watched this film, I really started to doubt the guilt of these two. Then, bam, the director gives you something that makes you re-think your position. Then bam, something else that sends you the other way. Five minutes later your mind has changed again. So many different truths out there and they all seem to conflict with each other. Moreover, this film is an examination of the child molestation hysteria of the 1980's. Many mentions of the McMartin tragedy are brought up and there are some parallels. The most common, is just how unbelievable these charges were. in fact, some of what the police said happened appeared just downright insane. Certainly there was no way this could have happened. In the McMartin trial, it turned out that it did not happen, it was fabricated by gung-ho prosecution and children hoping to please authorities. Well, if it happened there, who is to say that it did not happen with the Friedmans. However, for some people, it is just asking too much to think that kids would lie about being raped or that somebody would confess to something if they had not done it. However, I would argue that nobody beats the rap, when you are charged with 141 counts of child molestation. The charge is guilt itself. Moreover, the Friedman family is just so odd and so, well, guilty looking. Did they do it? Yes and no. They did something, but I doubt they did all of what they are accused of. But Lord knows what all they did. Great film that will stay with you. There is no great truth revealed here, but nor are there any great truths revealed in life. You observe and then form an opinion on what is the truth. Of course your truth is just that, your own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Documentary about the arrest of Arnold Friedman in 1987. He received a package with images of young boys in sexual situations which he ordered. He then is accused, along with young son Jesse, of sexually molesting young boys in a computer class he taught at his house. But did he? The documentary talks to prosecutors, family members, the police and the alleged victims, and it becomes very clear that the Friedmans did absolutely nothing. It's just a case of sexual hysteria that goes barreling out of control. Along with the interviews is home footage shot by family members during this time. You see the underside of a seemingly perfect suburban family and watch it slowly fall apart.Harrowing, moving, absolutely fascinating. One of the best documentaries ever made.

		<fullReview>This documentary film by Andrew Jarecki, founder of Moviefone, is simply one of the best ever made. It does everything a documentary should- ask questions, provide insights, and allow a viewer to draw their own, if differing, conclusions. The film started out as a short film on New York City clowns, following the lifestyle of Silly Billy- played by David Friedman. During the course of filming Jarecki found out that Friedman's brother and father, Jesse and Arnold Friedman, were convicted pedophiles- which makes the viewer wonder about David's chosen profession.When I picked up this DVD I thought it was on the 1990s spy case involving the traitor with a Jewish name I forget. Instead, it's about the last big 1980s sex ring pseudo-case- the most famous being the McMartin Daycare case. Like that this case was way overblown and innocents suffered many false accusations. The difference is that at the center of the case was an admitted pedophile- Arnold Friedman, a retired science teacher who taught computer classes from his basement home with his eighteen year old son Jesse. They, and three neighbor boys, were not only charged with sodomy and sexual abuse, but patently ridiculous charges that were typical of the era before False Memory Syndrome was scoped out. On Thanksgiving of 1987, the Friedman home in Great Neck, Long Island, was invaded by a SWAT team, intent on nailing Arnold for buying child pornography through the mail?. The prosecutors are reprehensible- claiming mounds of porno all over the house, while photos taken the moment the cops busted in showed one small hidden stash in Arnold's private room. A female prosecutor contradicts herself many times, her bias is evident, and- ala the OJ Simpson case- while Arnold's guilt for that he was accused of may be wrong, there's little doubt the cops more or less framed him. Yet, Jarecki lets them all prattle on- David, in his belief that, contrary to Arnold's admissions, his father was totally innocent, to Jesse's lawyer- who may be the worst attorney in the nation. All speak with authority- yet those things verifiable undercut almost every assertion. Many of the original accusers now say they lied, under pressure from parents and police- one father of a 'victim' admits that police pressured his son. Many of the 107 counts against Arnold and 245 counts against Jesse simply could not have occurred in the time frames claimed, and physical evidence was utterly non-existent. Add to that the fact that pedophiles almost always act alone, for fear of being caught, and the whole bizarreness of that time and place shines through?.Capturing The Friedmans is one of those endless Chinese dolls-within-dolls conundra which begs for repeat viewing. One is left hoping that such witch hunts are a thing of the past, but knowing they are not. That you, your child, or a friend, could be the next Jesse Friedman- whether you feel him guilty or not- is a quease that won't leave, and why the film is great art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It all started innocently enough: director Alfred Jarecki was making a short documentary about clowns who work birthday parties. One of his subjects was David "Silly Billy" Friedman. But after spending time with David, Jarecki found a more shocking story. The horrors to come would become the controversial documentary "Capturing the Friedmans." Not only was David's father Arnold found with a collection of homo-erotic child pornography, but both he and younger brother Jesse were named in a sex abuse scandal. Jarecki follows the Friedman family through the huge legal obstacles that would befall them, the breakdown of Arnold's marriage to matron Elaine, and of the family, and ultimately, to Arnold and Jesse's incarceration, and Arnold's suicide. Many of the family home movies appear in this documentary, chronicling good times and bad. The burning question remain, were Arnold and Jesse Friedman guilty? Several interviewees try to answer: various law enforcement officers, members of Arnold and Jesse's computer classes (most of whom appear anonymously), and others. The truth may never really be known. Watch "Capturing the Friedmans," and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to this movie, father and son Friedman are, for "tactical" reasons, put into prison for many years. Not because they have raped small children, but because the father has had pedofile magazines in his possession. From the beginning to the end this is about how the American judicial system functions at its worst. TV publish names and films on the suspects long before they are convicted, which means their lives are ruined, even if they are found not guilty. The police seems to have got the answers they wanted from the maybe abused children by leading questions and sometimes hypnosis. The father do confess to give his probably innocent son a milder punishment and the son do confess some crimes, which he didn't commit, for the same reason, because his lawyer tells him so. This is disaster.What makes this film unique are the video tapes taken by one of the other sons, showing quarrels and discussions in the family after the arrests. Great documentary indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Capturing The Friedmans" is a documentary that challenges your sense of reason. It is filmed in an intriguing way. One of the sons actually made home movies of this dysfunctional family during the crisis of all crises. The audience finds it difficult to believe that the father, Mr. Arnold Friedman, an upper middle class Jewish teacher from Great Neck, New York, is a perverted pedophile. In addition, it becomes convincing that their later testimony in court is that such peculiar circumstances could never have taken place amongst a moderately large group of students. That is simply not so. Indeed, the shock of this film is that it is true and the observer is overwhelmed with the truth as the film draws to an end. Jesse Friedman, the youngest of the three sons, is equally involved with the sexual games his father plays. His brother, Howard Friedman, and the oldest son, David Friedman are duped by the insistence of innocence that is portrayed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, the '80s. A time of fantasy and frenzy over supposed classroom/pre-school child molestations, every single day in the news it seemed. Where have all those stories and accusations gone in the past 14 or so years? To child molestation hell? Hope so. We have not become a better world, so must they still be going on? No, and I doubt they ever did. And, I guess the fad, and it was a fad to be sure, burned it self out by its own cruelty and implausibility. Even nuts got sick of it eventually and saw it for what it was, witch hunts and publicity stunts done for maximum exposure in order to gain profile for whatever.This wonderful film had me thinking throughout, I'll bet this case is the one that gave the OJ trial its impetus and resulting national exposure, and the country's total rejection of misguided and bad police work. The Great Neck police were sure seen by me to be out to get the Friedmans for whatever they could pin on them, as it seemed to be the Italians(police) against the Jews(the Friedmans)for the flavor of that long day on Long Island. What hate toward the Friedmans was expressed by the retired officers in their interviews in the film! Remember, that hatred could be against you next time.This film was beautifully done, if that can be said about this subject, and showed that Nazi-like fanaticism is not dead in the hearts and minds of some "law enforcement" officials, and their "justice" counterparts in the good old USA. The town officials, including the ridiculous publicity hungry judge, just got caught up in the hot news of the day and wanted to make a big nationwide splash for themselves showing how hard they were on child crime. It was to be their 15 minutes of fame. No way Arnie Friedman would have been so loved and respected by so many in that community if he were the monster they tried to prove he was. Nor his son. And, no matter what you may feel about your wife, run to her now and give her a big hug of thanks just for being her, as you could have married that treacherous and ice cold bitch Mrs. Friedman and had a miserable life at home just like Arnie Friedman did for over 30 years.Sensitive but direct film including a great musical score, of all things, for a film about pedophilia. Editing was superb and shots were done just right for maximum effect. A truly fine effort on a tough subject. Very impressive and disturbing, as it should be.Just goes to show you that none of us is safe, even in America, when law enforcement gets a bug up its ass about you and your private thoughts in your own home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Capturing the Friedmans", is a look at the lives of a middle-class, Long Island Jewish family which was torn apart by the arrest of the father and one son on kiddie porn and child molestation charges. As independent documentary film-making goes (which isn't very far) this one is excellent. However, the subject may not be interesting when you consider how it pales next to OJ or Dahmer or the vast panorama of past evil doers. The film could have used a narrative to fill in the blanks but otherwise makes good use of time and available material and may even conjure some sympathy for the perverted patriarch and his family. Be wary of this Oscar nominated and award winning documentary as the value is not so much in the subject, the revelations, or the entertainment as it is in the quality of execution - the production. In the final analysis, it is simply the story of one pedophile and his family and that ain't saying much. (B)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keeps me guessing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I have yet to finish watching the whole film I will write a few thoughts on where I am currently.I have tried to convince myself that this is a regular suburban family but based on the evidence and testimony that I have seen so far, I cant help but be led to believe that this may in fact be the most delinquent family I have ever seen. How can Arnies(I believe that is the main characters name) wife, after everything that was uncovered about her husband stick around after Arnie admitted to molesting children? And how can these people admit guilt in court and still try to maintain their innocence? I really cannot wrap my head around this family. The more I see the more disgusted I get. If this was not a class assignment to watch the film I would never have considered to watch it. Perhaps once I finish the movie I will have a different opinion but for right now I am dreading having to watch the rest of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very thought-provoking but contrived documentary on one family's downward spiral. The saddest thing with this 'story' is that the woman in the family was so maligned. While the old man may have been a pedophile she was the one who put a brave face on everything and tried to keep the family together, all for the sake of her sons and for 'appearance'. It is a tragedy that she is left with one son who is stunted by years in prison for crimes he probably didn't commit, while another son is so terribly abusive of her. So much for being brought up in a nice neighbourhood, with money, holiday home and relative social independence. All it takes is a few child psychologists and social workers to brainwash a few kids into believing they were abused and a happy home comes tumbling down and we see the true faces behind the masks. Ironic that the worst abuser in this family (although mental and verbal only) wears a mask in real life. Maybe he is ashamed of how he treats his mother, and so he should be. The shrinks must be laughing all the way to the bank. The one nice gem to come from this was that the Mother has found happiness elsewhere and despite one son's efforts it is obvious to all she very much loves her sons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>{spoilers}this is the story of father and son homosexual pedophiles who have been lying their whole lives, and the codependent in-denial enablers in their family who shill for them. as such, they are able to convince those who already have an anti-American/anti-police bias that, notwithstanding the voluntary, uncoerced confessions of guilt by both defendants in open court to being homosexual child molesters, somehow it is America in general and the police in particular that deserve to be censured here, not the perpetrators. (even the Friedman's narcissistic self-obsession is blamed on *america* -- isn't that special!).what to do about the fact that the wife believed her husband was guilty from the outset? demonize the wife, of course. what to do about the fact that the father's lawyer and the son's lawyer both insisted that their client was guilty? mum's the word.whatever you may have read to the contrary, both lawyers were sharp as a tack. in the most damning evidence of all (besides the little matter of the confessions), Arnold's lawyer says he went into pre-trial discovery confident that he could get the witnesses to contradict themselves (after all, they were children who had supposedly been brainwashed into making the accusations). he came away shaken by the fact that he couldn't. after that, he knew that a plea bargain was Arnold's only viable option, as a trial was out of the question.in this supposedly even-handed film, this particular segment lasted perhaps 20 to 30 seconds. i could tell that the audience i watched it with was barely affected by it. but, if you know anything about criminal defense, this was devastating to any doubts you might have had about Arnold's guilt.Jesse's lawyer got a lot more time on screen. he said that Jesse had told him that his father had molested him from an early age and that as he got older he helped his father molest children. he blubbered about how sorry he was as he entered his plea of guilty in court. he has since recanted. which time would a reasonable person infer he was lying?so far, as far as i can tell, not one other commentator has mentioned a single word about the overwhelmingly persuasive statements made by the accused's lawyers. apparently, it got in the way of their agenda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird f***ing family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***As I was watching this, the main thing I was wondering, was why this thing got so much attention? There's nothing new here. We've seen allegations, we've seen perpetrators defending themselves, we've seen victims crying, we've seen police, lawyers, the families, etc. Go watch A&amp;E, Lifetime, or any daytime talk show for 10 minutes.Why so much attention for this film? I think I have the answer: VOYUERISM. What we have here is actual, real-life tapes of a dysfunctional family cracking under massive pressure. It's reality TV for the new millenium, baby. You can't GET more real. It's a gut-wrenching story, but there is nothing new here. I think Jarecki deserves contempt for putting this in the public eye. It has no value beyond voyeurism. I think all the critics deserve contempt for praising it so highly. Some of the reviewers say they asked themselves what the point was to the film? Answer: none. These reviewers (including myself) have realized there is absolutely nothing new here. The tapes are real, but watching them is on the same level as watching Geraldo, Jerry Springer, whatever. REVIEW: I watched this film assuming the pair were guilty (my bias is to assume people are probably guilty when they get caught - I don't live in a courthouse). However, my mind was very much open to the possibility that I was wrong. Honestly, I *wanted* to be wrong. Child abuse is so awful, I never want it to be true, I don't want to have to believe that people can act that way. Call me naive, I can't help it. Having said that, this is one weird family. The mother seems like the b**ch from hell. Her kids hate her and she has no explanation for it. She hates them back. Second, how can she be married to a child molester for so long without knowing there was something "off" about him?The father seems so passive, so quiet. The mother and the kids are going at it, and the father just sits there like a rock. Why isn't he defending himself? Why isn't he screaming his innocence from the rooftops? Because he's GUILTY. He's got the mags, he did something with his brother, and god knows what else.Watching David defend his father - pathetic. At one point the director reads David a statement from his father where the father says he was sexually aroused by boys. David's defense? He protests that "he doesn't even know what that sentence means" Huh? Denial ain't just a river in Egypt. And why would he videotape such painful moments? And KEEP the tapes? What would motivate him to do something like this? What purpose would it serve? Weird.Based on several inconsistent statements from Jessie, I'd say he's guilty as well, though I have a strong feeling his father molested him, which could be a mitigating factor.The other brother Seth? Don't know, don't care. Sorry but I was trying to focus on the guilty party. Can't imagine he's 100% normal, though his refusal to participate seems to indicate he wants to distance himself from the entire situation, which seems like the most natural reaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>http://www.exile.ru/2003-December-12/kino_korner.html This movie is disturbing not only on the criminal/sexual level, but much more so in the way that it exposes human denial like no film before it. Denial is really the protagonist of Capturing The Friedmans. Denial is about the most gut-twisting villain in cinema history. I will give you one example. The police intercepted a child porn magazine from the Netherlands being shipped to Arnold, the father. He got busted. The police sat his wife, Elaine, down and explained to her why they had arrested her husband. The wife is a sullen, intelligent, rather cold and gloomy Jewish woman, while the three boys and their father are all goof-offs and hams, loud and annoying and full of energy.The police showed Elaine her husband's child porn magazines, pictures of young boys getting sodomized or sucking some old man off. But as she confessed, "I looked at the magazine, I looked at the pictures, and I still didn't see what was wrong with them. I didn't see what the police were talking about, and I told them that. Even though the pictures were right there in front of my face." Turns out the entire house was stacked with kiddie porn mags, and in all their years of marriage she had never even seen them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the time I saw capturing the friedmans, I had been told so many great things about it that I was certain it would be as life-changing as the Corporation, or any Nick Broomfield doc. But it was not, not because of the story: the story is tragic, a classic tale of fit-ups, family breakdowns, bad legal advice, with the added bonus that it has something at its centre that no episode of CSi could: a likable paedophile who may or may not be guilty of the committed crimes. The weakness is in how the material is handled, it never explores anything properly: the police home in on Arnold from mailed magazines, is this entrapment? Would statements produced under hypnosis be admissible in courts now? Did the police woman say that she saw "foot high stacks of child pornography" in the trial? If so, has this now been struck off the records? There were just not enough details, and that made it feel wishy-washy and frustrating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A interesting approach to home videos...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remembered the story as it unfolded from the news any years ago. It is an interesting documentary. I was interested is the documentary style he director use in the movie. It had a great flow from each topic and the stocked transitions were effective of trains, streets and miscellaneous object. To have the Freidman family home videos was a priceless tool that made the movie. I feel that if the director did not have the home videos it really would have fallen into the same or documentary category, boring. I was wander about the footage that was not used if that was convicting evidence but I guess I will never know. I feel the documentary covered both sides of the issue but I still think it is a propaganda documentary. The issues they covered against the Friedman's family are limited. The officials were more so reporting facts than opinions. Granted, most of the direct interview process was with the family members and they were not going to convict the father and boy or lead to believe. The other thing is the question of manipulation of children is over and over brought up. Did the police convince the children they did this to them. A few boys only answered this question of direct interviewing. I remember one for and the other against. We never really could prosecute the children's stories; just read affidavits. I found this part very important to create a neutral side, Friedman's against the children. But instead lacked that balance of the documentary, which made it lean toward the Friedman's. I was happily surprised about the Judge and Law Enforcements to give their opinion later in the film but felt it was all irrelevant. The children should have been in the stoplight. Did Arnold Friedman really commit all the acts of sexual abuse? That is a question that was not answered in the movie even though Arnold pleaded guilty. But the most important thing was the mother against her husband and own son. She was supportive in the fight but believed they did do it. The mother, Elaine, acting not to believe them was also convincing enough. To completely know your husband and son is her existence of being. And the look of disappointment on her face was completely visible. The movie is thorough about Jesse Friedman's life from a baby to today. I think it was disturbing that he did not get in front of the camera to tell the truth and to protect his name. He skirted around so important questions. If I was to have the chance to finally protect my name and innocents, I would have yelled, scream and fought to let everyone know my side. And the fact the Jesse was passive, calm and disassociated from the situation had a guilty facade. The questions like 'what is he hiding', 'Why did he never say I did not do the acts in question' came up but never answered. And toward the end of the movie, Jesse's final demise with the court hearing, filmed of him playing and joking around. I felt like if I were put in that situation, it would be a definite time to cry and reflect. This only gives me the impression of a disturbed psychological boy, distancing himself from reality and taking his punishment that he knows he deserves. In conclusion, this movie is a propaganda documentary in my opinion. The family would not have convinced to release the home videos if the director was to bash Arnold or Jesse. And the family is persuasive to be on there side, we by the end we come to know and love the family. All there little quirks and clowning a rounds. I feeling like I should be sympathetic towards Jesse and his family but to dislike his father, separating the same acts of crime like with the court trials. It was also a twist as rather to morn and honor Arnolds dead. I felt the friends and family was happy and felt good reddens to Arnold. Having everyone pass judgment on his soul. Spitting on his grave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A confusion of mixed stories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a good 18 months or so for the Documentary ouvre. While Etre et avoir stands out as being truly exceptional, 'Spellbound' and 'Touching the void' also achieve much. 'Capturing the Friedmans' falls short of these high standards. It is a very confusing story in which no one comes out well. The Father, the brothers, the mother, the police, the lawyers - none of them seem worthy of our trust at face value; all of them have guilt and our suspicions are aimed at all of them. Ultimately this isn't a story about the case of the Friedmans but rather about who one believes. Do you side with the family (and with which elements of the family if you do) or do you side with the authorities? The narrative of the film chooses to follow this did he? didn't he? theme which seems a little insulting to the victims. If they are guilty then this toying is somewhat in bad taste. I don't like films that predictably attain that awful word 'closure'. But the grey ending style of film is becoming a little predictable too. This just ends with a what happened next to the main players which tells us nothing and we leave with nothing but disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Capturing The Friedmans is a documentary that "captures" a family during the good times, the bad times, and...the ugly times. These men are guilty. The film shows the effects of perverse desire. It destroyed a family. Plain and simple. What these men committed was wrong. The Documentary asks us, if the events happened at all or were grossly exaggerated. Did the documentary do a good job at giving out all the information? Perhaps, just enough to give intrigue. The beauty of the film lies in the happiness we see on the Friedman home videos. It's the model image. What lies under the surface are truth's of human nature. The ability to capture these truth's is a difficult task for any family. The Documentary is able to capture these truth's and the effect is painful. **1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capturing a Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hauntingly captured by the controversial documentary `Capturing the Friedmans'. Director Andrew Jarecki's stunning look at the dysfunctional Friedman family is no doubt the supreme documentary of the year. `What's up with this Doc?' You ask. The Friedmans were a Long Island Family whose father Arnold and younger brother Jesse were charged with child molestation among other hideous child sex crimes during the late 80's. `Capturing the Friedmans' brilliantly captures the insights and opinions of most everyone that was directly or indirectly associated with the controversial turmoil. Jarecki's objective directorial style was a cerebral conquest! Marvelously done! The film will stay on your mind for days in capturing your own insights on what really happened! Questions that you might ask yourself after viewing `Capturing The Friedmans': 1) Was Arnold Friedman a `fried man' once he was suspected of such crimes? 2) Was Jessie Friedman wrongfully charged? 3) Were there many prison inmates that wanted to be Jessie's Boy-Girl? Ouch! 3) How much did the Prozac stock rise after the bulk packages that were purchased by the Friedman family? 4) Why didn't they entitle this documentary `Child's Play IV'? Again Ouch! Hey, since the film is controversial the review has to encompass a few controversial components.Seriously though, this reality show is compelling, dramatic, and heartbreaking. It should not be missed! ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen this movie in the Sao Paulo Movie Festival. I don't know why the movie didn't touch me at all. After the session was ended, a question came to my mind: `so what? that's their business, not mine!'.The movie sometimes takes you to a direction where you presume the Friedmans are in fact guilty. Sometimes it takes you to the opposite side. The point is: so much it was said about the `disturbing life and rotten secrets' beneath that apparently normal upper middle class family. But it my view, there was nothing wrong with them (obviously not considering the supposedly father's taste for child molestation). OK, every family has its problems, its arguments and its bed moments. But the Friedman's looked a normal and very close family for me: the love among brothers, the respect for the father, a passive mother.It is like watching `A Cry in The Dark' with Meryl Streep: scandals, hysteria, Press pressure, accusations with doubtful evidences (the statement of the supposedly molested victim is unconvincing), but you won't have the charismatic characters of that film (except David, the elder brother, who seems to be the most affectionate son). 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an important story that needed to understood as much as it needed to be felt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film yesterday, I feel compelled to comment upon it. After reading a few reviews lavishing praise on "Capturing the Friedmans," the film went right to the top of my "must see" list. After a day of reflection and reading as much as I could find about the film on Google, I have come to some conclusions about this troubling film.Minor spoilers ahead.What troubles me is apparently not what troubles many others. While I found the film a compelling viewing experience, I feel the film was an inadequate attempt to tackle a very compelling and complex subject. When I left the theater I did not know what to think about the Friedman's case--obviously things went on involving sexuality and children--Arnold admitted to a couple of interactions and he was in possession of a number of magazines--but whether there was anything that went beyond that is likely suspect. The director clearly believes that and yet he feigns uncertainty.Does the film attempt to steer you to a viewpoint--absolutely. Consider how the two boys from the computer class were photographed--one lying down in the darkness, while the other speaks in the light of day with identity fully exposed. Who are we conditioned to believe? The one in the light of course. And it does not matter that it is likely that each subject chose to be shot in the opposite, aforementioned manners--How would you react if both subjects were shot in the same way? And what would you think if you got to hear the boy who said that nothing went on like Arnold and Jesse were accused of doing, spoke of Arnold's less volatile inappropriate behavior that was edited out of the final film (as I have seen mentioned in some reviews). Things all of a sudden don't appear so obvious and clear cut.Why didn't I know what to think? Well, I realized pretty quickly that the film gave me no real context whatsoever from which I might be able to understand and interpret the material I was presented with in the form of home movies and video for the most part. Instead, in the intervening screen time, I am presented with beautiful time lapse cinematography that does not enrich this story in any essential way. One of the most telling moments in this regard in the film, happens when the director chooses to tilt up to a street sign, which I presume is the Friedman's street and then cuts to a slightly different view so we may see the cross street. Do moments like these really matter to this film--or do they only further define this neighborhood as rather typical--but there are so many images already that have told us that. Similarly, the video diary of David doesn't really add any additional insight into his character, it merely reinforces the impression we already have of him.Moments like these and many others in the film are at the expense of crucial information the audience needs to attempt to truly dissect what they are seeing. We only get a fleeting sense of the community of Great Neck. In my mind, a compelling issue that is never considered is how this couple was able to achieve their obvious level of success despite the fact that both parents came from not only broken homes, but Arnold was raised in very difficult circumstances along with his brother. How was Arnold able to become a bandleader? Attend college? How did the relationship with his wife develop? How did this former bandleader become so nebbish? His brother, when he appears at the end with his partner (and why did he withhold that until the end) appears to be somewhat affluent as well, based on his surroundings in the Northwest. It would also really help to see how the hysteria unfolded. These are thoughts which immediately came to mind. There are certainly many others.Instead we are given provocative moments that are sure to emotionally impact us rather than intellectually engage us--as in Arnold being turned on by the boy in the man's lap story for example or David's ranting at the video camera. Critics have praised the film for allowing the audience to make up its own mind, but we are given very little to work with here by the director--he apparently lets the film and video home movies to speak for themselves, but whatever interpretation the audiences draws from these images likely comes from their own experience and psyche.In the end, it is the Friedmans and the audience who have done the real work here. The director's effort barely registers here except in the few ways he chooses to shape our view of the story. This is a film that begs to be seen for its shortcomings and unfortunately not for its artistry. Too bad, because this is an important story that needed to understood as much as it needed to be felt--and it wasn't. It's not that this story is so difficult to understand, it merely appears that the director did not care explore anything other than its provocative nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i'm not one who enjoys eavesdropping on the private lives of others. i don't run out to buy the latest book on the kennedys or bill and hillary or j-lo. who cares? but the trailer for this movie was intriguing because of its implication that the media and police can twist and turn a story so thoroughly as to create guilt from innocence. as this movie demonstrates, though, it's not that simple.(spoilers here) while it's obvious that the police were intent on finding more than the initial uncovered crime, it's also obvious that the accused were guilty, to some extent, of the myriad charges against them. the dysfunction of the family is nothing new, nor is the nonchalance of the offenders. what i found most curious was david friedman's state of mind. he unraveled before our eyes. he had a desperate need to keep his family contained and whole, and no interest in the truth. it was as though he couldn't allow himself to even think about the charges, lest he have to confront something himself. it makes me wonder what his father did to him when he was a kid, and if the right son went to prison.but the most offensive part of the whole movie was the ending, when the audience was very clearly supposed to feel sympathy for the family -- oh how sad it is that this wonderful family was torn apart. what?? i'm totally offended that the filmmaker would try to manipulate the viewer's emotions, and thereby distract us from the ugliness of the sexual predators and the others who enabled them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have recently watched Capturing the Friedmans. THe sensitive subject matter is of course something which draws upon many emotions and moral or ethical perceptions of an individual. I worry how far free speech is to go in our democratic world when a movie is made for the purpose of finding the innocence in a sex-offender. I wonder how the director can be sympathetic with such a cruel and disgusting topic. I am a huge film fan and try to keep my eyes open to any film and look at it critically. A documentary must be fair and although many brilliant film techniques where used, as far as being an honest look at an horrific subject i wonder about the director's view on child sex-offences. the one victim showed in the movie is a young adult who claims to have been abused by the Friedman's. His honesty and bravery to speak is undermined by personal and unfair questions. perhaps what is the saddest thing about this film is that the Friedman's are painted as the victims of a dysfunctional family environment when really all those kids are. So if you want to see a one-sided, naive and debatable documentary. this is the one for you. However, when someone says their guilty for whatever reason... they're guilty. i guess we'll never know the truth because there was never a trial but portraying these men as innocent 17 years after the accusation is pathetic in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From start to about an hour or something in I thought the film was captivating. Then i got a sickening sense in my stomach once i started to see the whole picture the filmmakers were making. A horrible distortion of the truth.I think there is no question Arnold and Jesse molested some children during computer class. Did they do the ludicrous Leapfrog game? most likely no, however there is no question in my mind at least a few children were molested. The film successfully casts into MAJOR doubt 50 of the 200 counts the friedmans were charged with, but what about the 150 other counts? They are totally ignored, and only 4 people. 4 of the People related to the families who accused The Friedmans are interviewed. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER FAMILIES. And since all 4 of the people interviewed supported the Friedmans' stance that they were innocent (that one flaky guy on the couch does NOT COUNT), and since the other families are not even mentioned we are forced to assume that they were valid accusations. Why? because there is so much evidence supporting the fact that they molested the children that the filmmakers needed to keep the film interesting by casting doubt on their guilt. They chose to show you only part of the story, the part of the story that made their film interesting INSTEAD OF THE TRUTH.The filmmakers did a horrible job of presenting the prosecution's side of the story and a terrific job presenting the defense's side. The fact that Jesse supports the movie speaks volumes.My Personal belief is that all 3 children were also molested. That is the only way to explain their absolutely bizarre behavior. If your dad never did anything to you and was a perfect father, how would you react after you found out he had a massive stash of Child Porn involving boys? I would think i had no idea who my father really was, in short i'd react like the mother did. We are talking about GROWN MEN (older than 19 years old) here, and they acted like 10 year old children.I say this film is horribly manipulative, a horrible manipulation of the truth to make a point that sometime the truth is hard to discern. which is an interesting point, unfortunately the obvious truth was sacrificed and I'm certain a substantial amount of people will leave this movie thinking that Jesse Friedman and Arnold Friedman are victims, rather than the horrible human beings that they are, human beings that would rape children. IT MAKES ME SICK.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irresponsible Film Making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general, documentaries that are based on crimes (moral or otherwise) tend to want to accomplish one of two things: They either try and raise a high level of doubt as to the innocence of the accused, or they try and raise a high level of doubt as to the guilt of the non-accused. This film doesn't come close to either.Arnold Friedman was arrested for accepting deliveries of and owning stashes and stashes of child pornography. During that investigation, and even more heinously, he and his son Jesse were charged with molesting some 30-40 boys who were taught in computer classes at the Friedman's home.While there is no disputing the child pornography charges, the objective of the director in this film was to try and shed some doubt on the molestation charges by claiming that the town and children of Great Neck, NY were whipped into hysteria by the line of questioning of the police during the investigation. While a couple of the children who claimed to be molested during questioning (Friedman was arrested in 1988) have later said they were not molested by the Friedman's, 95% of the other kids have not. And granted, there is no physical evidence and hence, the only basis at all for this movie getting made.But the problem I had with this film, as did most of the people interviewed in the film, was not the information the movie contained, but the information the director LEFT OUT. For example, after Jesse was released from prison (late 90's) he went on Geraldo Rivera and essentially confessed (I could go on and on with the "omissions"). On top of that, there is account after account of Arnold Friedman, through journal entries, interviews with his wife (how about having to sleep in the same room with his mother while she had sex with dates?!?), his attorneys, etc... who all only help, almost nonchalantly, paint Friedman as even SICKER than just the story of the molestation charges. If anything, the movie in my opinion, CONVICTS ARNOLD AND JESSE even further!! It seemed like nothing more than an attempt by the director (and probably Arnold's son David) to try and drum up some sense of sympathy for Arnold and Jesse. And the worst part is, IT BACKFIRED!!!This was absolutely horrendous and irresponsible film making. Was there a lack of physical evidence? Sure. Did some of the children who levied crimes later remit? Yes. Did Jesse have to dance around on the courthouse steps the morning of his sentencing? No. Even the eyes of Arnold and Jesse in all of the footage during the trial seemed to make you feel as if they were winking at you with everything they said and did. I was terribly offended by this movie and it had nothing to do with crimes committed or charged. It had everything to do with the agenda of a documentary film director who did not put out an objective film, but rather a slanted, skewed and blatantly edited version of what I'm sure he understood, was not the picture he hoped for when it was all over. It was National Enquirer film making at best. I could recommend "Thin Blue Line" or many other documentaries that actually do raise suspicions convincingly. The subject matter of "Friedman's" is hard enough to digest, but the fact that the direction doesn't accomplish it's objective makes it simply putrid. Do not waste your time or give money to the makers of this film. You will only be disgusted with yourself afterward!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is supposedly a true story, BUT why didnt I believe one single moment of it. It was nothing but home movies of this revolting family.I felt absolutly nothing. How this won &amp; was nominated for awards is beyond me. It was an amature production from beginning to end. At least in Micheal Moore's documentaries,(hated the subject material) They were professional productions &amp; watchable. One of the 3 brothers in the family was so disgusted, he refused to have anything to do with the film.</fullReview>
