		<shortDescription>Dirty, funny, sexy, violent and unabashedly romantic: Deadpool has arrived!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.P.S.

		<shortDescription>This is what it looks like when filmmakers take risks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is a 2016 film that the eighth film in the X-Men franchise where The Merc with the Mouth seeks revenge in a humorous way.Wade Wilson is a mercenary who spends his time in New York City protecting teenage girls from would-be stalkers. He meets escort Vanessa Carlysle at a local bar and they become romantically attached for nearly a year. He proposes to her one night, then he suddenly collapses and is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Though she remains by his side, he fears losing her.One night at the bar that he met Vanessa, he is approached by a recruiter from a secret program. He is offered an experimental cure for his cancer, but he rebuffs the man and leaves. Desperate to live, he reconsiders and leaves Vanessa in the middle of the night to undergo the procedure. He is injected with a special serum by Francis Freeman and tortured for days by Angel Dust in order to trigger a mutation. After weeks of no success, Wade is strapped into an airtight chamber after insulting Francis. The drop in oxygen triggers a healing factor that removes his cancer, but severely disfigures his face and skin in the process. He escapes from the chamber by blowing it up and attempts to kill Francis, only stopping when he claims he can cure Wade's disfigurement. He is then impaled by rebar and left for dead in the destruction of the lab.Although he tracks her down, he cannot come to terms with his complexion, and he keeps himself away from Vanessa. Wade moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al, and with the advice of his best friend Weasel, he becomes a masked vigilante named "Deadpool", and begins hunting down Francis and dismantling his organization.Following a string of leads from various syndicates, Deadpool attacks a convoy of cars on an expressway before getting his hands on Francis, demanding for a cure to his disfigurement. The confrontation is suddenly interrupted by the X-Men Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who want him to join the team. Their intervention enables Francis to run off, and when Colossus handcuffs himself to Deadpool on their way back to the X-Mansion, Deadpool cuts off his own hand and escapes back to his home.The next night, Weasel convinces Deadpool to go back to Vanessa, but when they arrive at the strip club she works at, Deadpool discovers that she has been kidnapped, and Francis and Angel Dust tell him to meet up with them on a decommissioned aircraft carrier at a scrapyard.Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him, and the trio take a cab to the scrapyard, where Colossus and Negasonic have a grueling battle with Angel Dust while Deadpool slashes through an army of goons on his way toward Francis. Deadpool and Francis then engage in a bloody hand-to-hand combat before Negasonic uses her power to destroy the aircraft carrier. In the end, Deadpool gains the upper hand in the fight and Francis admits that there is no cure for Wade's disfigurement. Although Colossus urges Deadpool to spare Francis and be a true hero, he shoots Francis in the head, finally killing him and avenging himself. Deadpool removes his mask and shows Vanessa his new face. Though she is angry that he left her, she accepts him and they reconcile by kissing.In a post-credits scene, Deadpool urges the audience to leave and go home, then announces that there will be a sequel involving Cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I Have Seen In A Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with One Star because the movie had "Foul Language" and "Sex Scenes" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not With that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are easily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and Pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One word describes this movie - pointless.Wow, this film was incredibly boring. People are hyping this movie over nothing. The story is so simple and boring. It didn't even feel like I was watching a thought-provoking movie, more like a short and simple TV series with an unfunny, forced and pointless main character on his pointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains. The X-men were pointless as well. They didn't add anything to the story. They only assisted Deadpool with fighting the villains when their original goal was to have deadpool work for them. They happily accepted Deadpool as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them. The only okay point in this movie was the action. However, the action still could have been better as it felt very rushed at times, and at other times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography. It didn't feel intense at all, more like you know the villains are going to fail very easily.I also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit to explain the purpose of the weapon x program e.g. "superheroes", "superslaves" etc. What are these villains even doing? There was nothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains. The story was lacking in too many ways. The world felt very empty and hollow.Looks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they would enjoy anything just because it is r-rated. That is the truth, that is the only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of "F" words and other vulgar words, it has sex and nude scenes and it is gory and violent. None of this is new. Again, the Story and Characters are terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Combining brutal material with childish humor yields a fun movie which is going to irritate more serious among you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a friend of mine first invited me to see Deadpool my expectations were quite low: I had known nothing about Deadpool and expected to see a classical super hero movie suitable for all ages which I usually don't enjoy. Little did I know Deadpool was a full blown comedy super hero movie made for mature audiences.Watching Deadpool 4DX was amazing experience. A scene where Deadpool jumps from bridge into a car was one of the most entertaining movie experience I've ever had! If only the rest of the movie was this good... if you're still somehow able to see it 4DX, don't miss the chance.Deadpol is very bloody with a lot of violence and mayhem. Language used is too obscene for my taste. Many conversations and scenes are very childish. The whole movie is very immature. Deadpool is going to strongly entertain younger audiences. So yes, Deadpool is pretty bold and quaint experiment: you have brutal violence combined with childish humor. For it's authors audacity I give it a seven. Objectively, it's more of a six.Still, Deadpool's delivery is pretty homogeneous. All the violence and mayhem fit nicely within the context fostered by Deadpool's character. Ryan Reynolds is the guy! He delivered much, much better performance than in Self/less. Morena Baccarin played Vanessa, Deadpool's girlfriend. And when I say she's Deadpool's girlfriend, I mean she IS Deadpool's girlfriend. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. Let me mention that soundtrack plays a somewhat important role (Deadpool loves good music!) - producers picked good hits which contribute to milieu. Wham! If you're in for some non sensible crude humor and brutal violence, you'll surely have fun. Just don't forget not to bring your kids with you! "Witness the beginning of a happy ending".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, blow me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say at the very beginning of this review, I loathe super hero movies. I can not stress that point enough. For me, watching anyone of the countless driveling movies which have been pumped out by studios in the name of entertainment over the past decade is, for me, akin to having teeth pulled. Painful to say the least. My friends however are addicted to every single bombastic franchise, and through sufferance, I've endured countless hours of mind numbing boredom watching yet more Lycra-clad numpties saving the earth from ridiculous threat (there are of course exceptions to the above; 'The Dark Knight', the original 'X-Men)I was once again convinced that spending an evening with chums watching Deadpool would be an excellent waste of my time. I envisaged 15 minutes of feigned interest, followed by an hour 45 of updating my email and some cheeky online shopping. Well that new Morphy Richards kettle and toaster are still waiting for me to purchase as low and behold, shock of all shocks, this film is bloody marvellous!! Bloody, hold your knickers cause they are about to get blown off, marvellous!The dialogue is witty, sincere, and delivered by every single actor with a naturalism which seems more like improvised off the cuff genius, than drab scripted nonsense.The pacing of the movie is excellent. It held my interest through its entirety.The actions scenes directed with the skill of a more seasoned director.I was so pleased that for once, I was being forced to watch a movie that treated me like an adult, with adult humour and themes, made for adults. Not for grown children masquerading as adults.This film is a perfect storm! Just everything is right! I look forward, to my great surprise to any squeals!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, that was fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of superhero movies favor special effects over character (I'm looking at you, Avengers), but perhaps because Deadpool had a relatively low budget for this sort of thing - something I only know because I read it on wikipedia - this movie is full of character. The protagonist is a vengeance seeking madman constantly breaking the forth wall, his best friend is a hipster bartender who gambles on his brief longevity, and he and his girlfriend (the ridiculously attractive Morena Baccarin) engage in the dark clever banter you'll love if you're a fan of the series You're the Worst).Deadpool proves that giving your characters personality does not mean you can't also have great action scenes, such as the crazed one that begins the movie (and clarifies the funny and perplexing title sequence). I found the action in this movie far more exhilarating than the bigger-is-better approach of some movies (I'm looking at you again, Avengers).Overall, this is as fun and funny as Guardians of the Galaxy and has action as memorable as that in X-Men: First Class. Ryan Reynolds beautifully plays Deadpool as a psychotic version of Spider-Man, and really, the whole cast is excellent.This is a sort of tangential X-Men movie, but it still exhibits a lot of what makes that series the best of the Marvel universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated movie written by a 12 year old.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its an overrated movie with curses written by some 12 year old. No story, no real plot, the film could have done without the villain. This film deserves a 5 or 6 stars at the highest. The reason I am giving it a 1 is due to its over rating. The film mainly attract audiences of 16-25 years. Just a cash grab film. Simply marvel's worst. And there's the feminism there. The heroine always has to save the hero now. Ryan's acting was good in this movie. It suited him. The cgi wasn't bad. But if this movie were to come out before the Iron man then it would've got 4-5 stars. There are some marvel films which deserve higher rating instead of this movie .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally an R-rated comicbook movie and they make it this lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to Deadpool as I'm a Ryan Reynolds fan and it's rated R.However the humor is toilet humor. It's about farts, jerking off and comments about actors, including Reynolds himself and other movies.The plot is that Wade Wilson gets terminal cancer and in order to save his life he agrees to undergo an experiment that will give him the power to heal. However Ajax, the man that turn people into mutants and sometimes just kill them, can't be trusted. And Ajax, who is the villain is played by the awful Ed Skrein from the awful reboot of Transporter. Ajax tortures Wade and the lab explodes (I can't remember why) and Wade has become scarred and takes the new identity as Deadpool. He starts to kill a lot of people looking for Ajax. But even though the movie is rated R, some scenes where he tortures badguys are actually not shown. Ajax in a desperate attempt to stop Wade kidnaps Wades boney girlfriend and Wade has to get help from the two most annoying X-men characters I have ever seen. Some lesbian looking teenage girl with a shaved head and a cgi-Russian guy made out of metal.The violence is awesome and a welcome change from the bloodless Marvel violence. However all the violence can be seen in the red band trailer and the rest is crap. So if you've seen the trailer, I recommend not watching the movie as you will be really disappointed.Bringing X-men into the movie is annoying as hell as I've always hated the X-men. And Wade talking to the camera gets really annoying after a while.On top of that the action itself is disappointing as this is clearly a low budget movie.Avoid this and watch the first Kickass movie (not the second one!!!) if you like violent superhero movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of all Marvel movies made, Deadpool was the worst. The main character talks too much it became very annoying after 5 minutes. The jokes were not funny. The scene transition between flashbacks and present conditions were not well done.They tried to put in 2 X-Men character in the worst possible way. It really shows that the studio had no budget for many characters, but instead they invested a lot in the slow-motion special effect, which was cool.In terms of story-line, there's no story. There's no character building as well. For about 2 hours, all you can do is endure the horrible blabber mouth of the main character. Not funny and irritate the ear.I wonder how many people did the studio pay to write in good reviews in this website...Worst Marvel Movie Ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoy sitting in on conversations that are typical of young and foolish teenage boys this is the movie for you. Every other line contains the F word and for some reason the director thought penis jokes are the funniest around.The story is about as hollow as the humor. It's a cheap and bland story about revenge and invincibility painted with a veneer of "love" that is as misguided as the character's personality.The movie is littered with sarcasm and cynicism that just becomes depressing after a while.Ryan Reynolds acts like a 13 year old boy throughout the movie, cursing and making penis jokes and then talking to the audience thinking he is very funny. This is the most overrated movie I've seen. Most of these reviews on IMDb had to have been paid for. Hollywood had to have paid for this hype or people these days have really low standards. This is a low brow film like no other.Save 2 hours of your life and do not watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A PERFECT Deadpool movie, but isn't going to please all casual movie-goers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be honest here, the year of 2016 hasn't been a good year of comic book movies like 2014 was. 2014 brought us excellent comic book movies like CA2, GoTG, and X- Men: DoFP. However, 2016 was a year of "set-up". So far from what I've seen, "Civil War" was concerned about introducing new characters to kick-off phase 3 (And some of the new characters are shoehorned in with no motivation). "Dawn of Justice" was concerned about expanding and showing what's about to come in the future of DCEU installments (Wonder Woman, Doomsday, Justice League set-up were all rushed and shoehorned as well). I haven't seen "X-Men: Apocalypse" yet but from what I've heard it has the same flaws from other superhero movies we got this year. 2016 is a year of saying "I know we brought you movies that are misleading but fun to watch. But that means we promise you next year we will learn from those mistakes and give you possibly the best year for comic book films".Deadpool on the other hand is the only comic book movie this year which was not concerned about setting-up for another installment. It only cared to be a "Deadpool" movie. That's what makes it unique. It's mostly true to the source material as well but with a few changes here and there. It's an awesome movie for the fans. It has all the "Deadpool" elements that fans know from the comics. It has 4th wall breaking. It has the brutal bloody violence. It has funny jokes. It has a whole bunch of inappropriate content. And it has Deadpool being "The merc with a mouth" because he couldn't stop talking in the movie. Think of the movie Deadpool like this. It's FOX saying "We know we messed up with Deadpool in (X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and made him look like Baracka from Mortal Kombat. But now we want to apologize for that and give you this movie". In my opinion, it's a perfect apology and fans will accept it. The movie on the other hand, isn't going to please all casual movie-goers. The main problem with Deadpool is that it's simplistic in everything. Simple plot and pretty predictable. It isn't large in scale. The movie also wants to earn its R-rating. And that caused a problem with the origin story. Instead of exploring more about Wade Wilson's origin and buying into his motivations and making us care about him, they throw these inappropriate montage scenes that have nothing to do with "cohesive storytelling". I know some of you fanboys are raging at me for saying this. But assume I'm not familiar with Deadpool. I will not find this movie a good movie at all if I haven't read the comics and it will turn out just OK. The action is good but nothing mind blowing. the jokes are funny. And the character of Deadpool is great and likable. But the storytelling sometimes just falls short and things get pretty awkward. That's my casual movie-goer's perspective about Deadpool.To me as a fan, Deadpool was an awesome adaptation. It was everything a fan would ask for. It's possibly the best comic book movie this year. I say that because it didn't try to set-up for a sequel, it only cared about making this movie. It was a PERFECT "Deadpool" movie. And I couldn't be more excited for Deadpool 2. But I wish they would go large in scale next time.Side note: When I rate comic book movies I have two sides. Casual movie-goer &amp; Fan. By rating it as a casual movie-goer I give you my honest score. Which is the score I would give if I weren't familiar with the source material. By rating it as a fan I give bonus scores to the movie if there is some fan service, or because generally I love superhero movies and they are fun to watch.Casual movie-goer's experience: 6/10 (Okay).Fan's experience: 8/10 (Great).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie proved that you don't need hundreds of millions of dollars to make a enjoyable and great movie. After it final hit the cinemas excitement about this was huge. Deadpool is the funniest and most entertaining strip character. Movie had some holes in it but it was nothing to care about. Everything how we get to know him before and after was well edited and put together. Jokes aren't the smartest but they are just the one when you hear them you feel entertained. Deadpool as character is funny as hell but at the same time so loving and sarcastic but most of all violent. Movie just portrayed his power and capabilities. Reynolds was perfect choice for the role as he is very funny and tends to joke all the time but in the same time looks strong. Then his girl get kidnapped and he must get to her and save her while taking everybody that made him like that and showing who is the boss. It classic story of battle between two guys only that they are both in kind of way bad. Two characters that helped him get to her are well played. Granny and Deadpool are perfect, you just love them. Movie was funny, violent, entertaining, well acted and GCI is amazing just amazing. Despite all that waiting and finally making the movie that had medium budget it was a great hit. 9.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let's talk about the good: Deadpool himself is portrayed exactly the way he is in the comics. Most of the jokes are hilarious. Admittedly, there are a few bad jokes, but I forgave it. Some awesome comic book moments: Deadpool threatening the pizza delivery man. Only difference is in the comics, Deadpool kills the pizza man. The action sequences are perfectly executed. The final showdown is epic! And the bad? Well, screw it. There is no bad. Barely, if any. Either that or I just didn't pay attention to those parts because I enjoyed the rest so damn much! Colossus looks great. Angel Dust, well, she has a nice rack, and knows how to fight. Vanessa, Deadpool's girlfriend, is cute as a button and is also kinda bad ass. The villain, Ajax, I guess could've been a little better. And the post credit scene implies a sequel with Cable in it! Yes!!!! Bring it on, Deadpool 2! One more thing, is Weasel, Deadpool's friend at the bar, is so funny, especially when he finds out what Dead looks like.</fullReview>

Right from the start he is in costume and we're expected to know who he is and what his mission is? Just a bad movie. Really bad. I don't get why it is/was considered so good or why it made so much money but lots of garbage movies make lots of money. There's no driving force encouraging me to watch more as I enter the movie, I don't care about the characters, nothing attractive at all about this movie. Total garbage. And I hope - if I even continue to watch Marvel movies and grew up reading Marvel comics but Avengers Age Of Ultron, 3 hours of battles with little story that has me thinking the overall Marvel movie plot has been lost - that Dead Pool character has nothing to do with future Marvel movies because it's total garbage. And even if the character does, I'll fill in the blanks if I continue to follow Marvel movies. But this movie is sh-t.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst Superman is fighting Batman and the X-Men are going back and forward in time, you're just wasting your time watching them. The best Superhero movie is Deadpool.Let's just say first and foremost, this movie is NOT for kids.For adults, though, this movie has everything - action, boobs, superheroes, boobs and laughs. There is comedy from the very first scene and although I'm not a fan of Ryan Reynolds, I must say he is perfect as Deadpool. His comedy timing in this is fabulous and his chemistry with other characters means the jokes appear so natural and subtle it's almost like there wasn't a script, rather a "let's film it and see what happens" kind of director.Watch the movie. Listen carefully to the dialogue because a lot of the jokes are subtle and just enjoy. I would watch this over and over again, foregoing all X-Men and Marvel movies. Bring on Deadpool 2!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds is indeed the perfect anarchic, motor-mouthed, regular guy turned vigilante crime-fighter. The constant gags, humor and referential jabs are just as over-the-top as is the brutal action and violence. Putting these writers together with this director made a movie that will be mentioned forever. By far one of the superhero movie I have seen. Even my wife, who is not a superhero fan, laughed, cringed, sighed so much that this has converted her to a superhero fan. Definitely not a kids movie, although they would love it too. Can't say it enough, awesome from the beginning to the end. Keeping and eye for a sequel to this outrageous movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave it 9,cause I am keeping 10 saved for when the finally gets the budget to ONLY get slightly better editors for the action sequences.But really,the action sequences are etched in your memory.The graphic scenes are etched in your memory.This movie is Deadpool having so much fun while being so sadly tragic that I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW CAN ANYBODY NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE .This is the best superhero movie I have seen,best romantic , twisted humor, movie I have seen,and it is a really good love story. I mean I am a bit surprised.Deadpool is so memorable he is better than goddamn tony stark without the suit.Yes I will go that far.Ironman can suck it.This movie has so many inside gags on the whole super hero franchise,that I do not know how they will top it in any further franchise.That worries me.This is a cult classic.I am trying really hard not to give spoilers.The jokes are hilarious,not because Deadpool is a stand up comedian but simply cause his life is so tragic,and you cannot help laughing with him.It is a very satisfying experience to watch if you like gore,they have well thought out sequences that just hit you right in the cringe-worthy satisfying sympathy for the guy.The movie plot is so pointless and so satisfying cause it has nothing got to do with saving anyone but simply this guy's own personal vendetta/pointless vanity effort to fix his pointless life.He is such a romantic.The whole premise of this movie is so romantic. And so cheesy.And so irritatingly pointless.The sidekicks in this movie are well thought out,and while Deadpool steals the show,the others just add the right mix of hilarious sweetness to this.This is the best gangster movie/super hero movie/passably romantic movie/a memorable movie I have seen.I think I have made it clear I adore this film.If anything I would like to have changed in this movie is that while the action sequences are so,so satisfyingly delicious,I would have liked the editing of only those sequences to have been better.I love Deadpool.He has pointless super powers and I don't even care.I love him.Hearts.How are you guys ever gonna top this.I like him better than Ironman and Batman.But seriously how will you top this?I go and check Deadpool's actor Ryan Reynold's google page which points out his spouse to be Blake Lively,and an ex to be Scarlet Johansson.Ryan,you dog.And you are green Lantern and Deadpool.I love you.New fan.Though,don't watch this if you are under 18.And,it is really bad as a friendly superhero movie for the family,I should point that out.Your kids will not dress up as Deadpool the way they dress up for other superheros,it would be wrong.Yes that is about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too funny, isn't it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well what genre this film was made upon? Sci-fi? Action? Drama? Oh yeah, I think it was just a plain romance story. Aah, what a combination though!I was spellbound watching this flick when I started off. But when I reached through the interval, my brain was hammering me to put this ill-scrappy story aside and have a nice sound sleep. What's so nice in this flick that I along with millions of people got attracted? Well, theme is comedy. Ryan Reynolds holds the story firmly,villain is terrific to smash good, hard punches to Deadpool's face; what else do a movie watcher want? True. But apart from humorous scenes, movie is plain boring video of two super heroes fighting for survival. Romance is at its place but, as Deadpool itself says- "A love story". Really? I'm skeptical over this issue. It isn't actually just romantic. It's another straightforward sci-film. Remember Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy? Yes, Deadpool is easily comparable to Spider-Man unfortunately. First of all, positivity. Character development takes time and eventually on the beneficial side of the movie. Story is slow, yet enjoyable on how it creates tension in between the movie. Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool part is amazing. Funny, hilarious, charming, witty, talkative - everything perfect. Morena as his partner is nice to see in parts. But again, it reminds of Kirsten Dunst from Spider-Man. So Character development was a go. Appreciable. Now, bad part. The premise wasn't good. Just another action packed movie right from the beginning. Though screenplay being watchable, story is able to hold the spectators. The duration was longer than enough for such film. Ninety minutes of fun is perfect but no need of extra twenty minutes to concentrate on Deadpool's biography. But after all these multi-variant propaganda, screenplay was just not inevitable. The conclusion was- nothing new to offer. Tim Miller tried way too hard to make this film a super hero film. Overall, it was an average movie to see one time. If you want to skip it, good enough. Deadpool 2 is coming soon and hope it won't be too stretchy as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average Disney superhero film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new age of superhero movies shows how meta references and involving an expanding world of superheroes can create an entertaining flick.Deadpool isn't an average hero who has noble intentions or wants to save the world for the right reasons. Deadpool is in it for the revenge and to make something out of his worthless life. I saw bravery and true potential from him in the start when he was willing to risk his life for a girl who's boyfriend wouldn't leave her alone. Most wouldn't care or get involved.He undergoes experiments to transform his body into a super mutant, but instead is betrayed by the mad scientist to become a slave. While in not usually a fan of self aware films that pretend to be intelligent or witty yet this turned out to be a hidden gem.Ryan Reynolds has come along way from being a pretty face and a one note actor to be a leading man. He brought heart and conviction to this role.The xmen extras felt a little phony and not true to form of the characters we seen portrayed in the xmen series. Yet I found a certain appeal in their willfulness to risk livelihood and loved ones for the greater good.The leading lady willing to over look psychical beauty for the man inside was touching. She didn't care what anyone thought or how strange they looked in public. You don't get depth like that in super hero movie or kick-ass.Still it leaves the question on if Deadpool is gay, straight or bi since some of the action or phases he sprouts are questionable about his sexuality.The final fight scene was magnificent and kept you guessing. Will he save the girl or let her go to save mankind. It was heartbreaking, funny and touching.It earned all ten stars. Don't be put off commercials that don't do It justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is the most unpleasant and surprisingly entertaining superhero movie with brilliant humor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool (2016): We may have seen a lot of superheroes but you will never meet the one as Deadpool.He is the most mischievous,obnoxious humor filled guy I had ever seen.He is always mean to others and never takes things seriously.He is selfish,vulgar,rude and what not.He didn't have any quality to be superhero except having some mutative abilities.This is the first feature film of this crazy guy.So how is it???Plot: Wade Wilson(Ryan Reynolds) is a small-time mercenary. He meets Vanessa(Morena Baccarin) and falls in love. Life is idyllic until one day he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Things look bleak but a man appears who says he can be cured, through a treatment that gives him superhero powers. After initially turning him down, Wilson agrees, and meets the man behind the project, Ajax whose actual name is Francis(Ed Skrein). While undergoing the treatment he discovers that it will involve him becoming a mutant, and he will need to undergo several painful tests to discover what his mutant abilities are. Plus, Ajax is a sadist. The treatment results in Wilson getting powers of accelerated healing but also leaves him terribly disfigured. Ajax tries to keep him a prisoner but he escapes. He now has two aims: find Vanessa and make Ajax pay for what he did to him. Killing Ajax may not be as easy it seems, as Ajax is also a mutant and the meddling superhero Colossus and his sidekick Negasonic Teenage Warhead keep getting in the way. Oh, and Wade Wilson is now operating under an alias: Deadpool.Plus Points:1)Deadpool: Deadpool is one of the most fun superhero I had ever seen.While all the superheroes are busy in saving people's lives,Deadpool has his own issues and deals in hos own way.He has zero morality and kindness.Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him.He even broke the fourth wall and talks with audience which is a good point.2)Humor in latter half: Initial half of Deadpool has some good humor but nothing special.But in latter half I couldn't stop laughing because Deadpool never looked back with his humor.There are a lot of LOL moments which I loved.Especially few scenes are remarkable for its humor.3)Climax: Climax is awesome with brilliant mix of humor and action.The scene where they make a slow motion walk and the scene where villain gives a superhero entry is hilarious.Even the scene where Collosus fights with Angel is awesome.4)Performances: Ryan Reynolds is perfect as Deadpool.He showed the character's innocence and insanity pitch perfectly.Others also gave decent performances.5)VFX: VFX is awesome and flawless.Initial scene where car blasts with Deadpool inside is creative and is one of the best ones.Minus Points:1)Initial half: Initial half of the movie is not as expected and gave some mixed reaction on this movie as it has no great moments.Even humor is not that good so I wondered how this movie got such highly positive reviews but latter half proved me wrong.2)Level of Profanity: Deadpool is one of the most obnoxious superhero movie with high level of profanity.There is at least a single use of f**k,a*****e etc...So this movie is surely not for everyone.Mostly its focuses on teens.So,Deadpool is the most unpleasant and surprisingly entertaining superhero movie with brilliant humor.My rating 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless and Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all I've hardly read the Deadpool comics I did initially find the premise of a movie based on the anti-hero quite interesting with his wise cracking jibes and sarcastic humour. I thought that it could have delivered a fresh take on the well-established Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films of "the good guys vs. the bad guys", perhaps something a bit more daring and mature but still in keeping with the theme of its predecessors. Oh how I was wrong. Enter Deadpool, the most overrated and pointless MCU film currently out there.It all seemed to start fairly well with more mature humour and some gory violence with a bit of foul language thrown in, everything I expected Deadpool to be. Slowly, however, the jokes became so similar to the point that they seemed to just give three decent ones at the start and then recycled them. This continued to the point that it became annoyingly predictable and for jokes that weren't greatly funny in the first place, I was becoming extremely bored by the end, especially when other people at the Cinema were laughing so hard at the same crude vulgar stuff over and over again. Don't get me wrong I'm no prude, but I don't think I laughed again after the first quarter of the film.SPOILERS BELOW: So the film is basically about Deadpool getting revenge against the villain Ajax for disfiguring him completely during an experiment to make super soldiers. The experiment, however, has gifted Deadpool with accelerated healing factor allowing him to regrow limbs and mend wounds within a matter of hours practically making him invulnerable. That's my second problem with this film. Why did the writers decide to pitch an almost unbeatable protagonist against Ajax, a second rate villain who's powers basically include enhanced strength and speed combined with an inability to feel pain, which fair enough would give him an advantage when fighting normal people but against other super humans he pales in comparison. So, what happens when an invincible Deadpool fights a very mortal Ajax? You guessed it, Deadpool wins! That's why the plot is so predictable. Yes I understand its a comic book film and the protagonist always wins but why not pitch him against an actual threat? The MCU has thus far provided good matches for our heroes such as Captain America vs. Red Skull or Hulk vs. Abomination. Having Deadpool vs. Ajax was as expected a result as Superman vs. Robin, giving it no sense of danger or excitement.This combined with the typical boy meets girl "oh wait I'm disfigured so she can never love me again" relationship which is...you guessed it; rekindled at the end, along with the seemingly stuck on X-Men only adds to how terrible the film is.Well, that's basically all there is to this steaming pile that is the movie Deadpool. Its only redeeming quality I thought were the action scenes, though again they were dulled by the included jokes.So, if you're someone who enjoys crude immature humour and a predictable plot then you'll enjoy Deadpool. If you like suspense, good jokes and a strong well written story, then avoid this at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not for the weak of heart and definitely not for the sound of mind. This movie is basically the ultimate combination of humor and violence that every movie should be.Most people who dislike this movie have a more tamed sense of humor, but that's okay. Leave it to people like me to enjoy it. Every now and then, we get tired of these conservative movies. Deadpool stays true to its comic roots. It's a great treat of ardent Marvel/Deadpool fans. I would urge some of the negative reviewers to reconsider. However, to new fans, read the comic books before you watch this movie. You'll understand the humor much better to appreciate the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame, unfunny waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Deadpool" is a tiresomely unfunny stab at making both a superhero movie and a parody of superhero movies that succeeds at neither. For a huge budget superhero flick, the plot and scenarios are just way too uninspired and boring. It has a pretty good opening action scene, but after that it has absolutely nothing you won't have seen before in any other recent comic book movie. For a parody, it isn't funny, and all the nudge nudge wink wink moments get old in the first scene, and then continue all the way up to the inevitable after-credits-scene, which is just as unfunny as everything we've seen before it.The movie seems to think that name dropping everything pop-culture related is funny by default. You leave, probably unable to remember an actual gag, but maybe some of the relentless name dropping is still with you, by virtue of the law of averages. Reynolds, as Deadpool, even name-drops himself at one point, and not even that got a laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chop chop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on my local 4K Digital theatrical viewing of a severely chopped version, with more than 60% of language and perhaps 40% of action sequences excised after the local scissor-run.The same distributor, who respected their maker's artistic rights when David Fincher flatly refused to make cuts to his remake of 'The girl with the dragon tattoo', which caused in that movie being banned here, though its global box office was nothing to scream about, have this time decided to make money off this particular version anyway, and released this in its PG-09 form. Good for the kids who sneak in, I guess. Oh wait, that's not gonna be the case, since this is rated 'A', supposedly equivalent of the R/NC-17/15/18 abroad, depending on the region. To be fair though, Fincher (and another studio) did release the chopped version of his 'Gone girl', which introduced a new kind of chopping (at the time) where keys sequences remain intact, but the scissor-happy folk try their hand at panning and scanning, zooming into a neutral background, retaining the soundtrack, while eliminating the offending visuals for our 'safe' viewing at the cinema. A lot of that in this flick. Wonders of technology and all that.....Well, Deadpool's supposed to be the Merc-with-the-mouth, in spite of the fact that he wears a mask. Surprisingly, not to protect his identity as such, since mutants in the X-verse do not have multiple identities, but to cover his being burnt. Merc-with-a-mouth means, he's supposed to mouth-off, and we're supposed to listen, reflect/weigh- in, and react/respond accordingly. However, in the local market that I luckily happened to watch this in, I got little opportunity to do that. However, the masters-of-the-scissors do their jobs with their typical inefficiency that few cuss words do slip through, and then the audience started playing the game of 'guess-what-cuss-word-got-muted' all the way to the end (yeah, stay beyond the credits - this may be Fox, but it IS Marvel). I cannot present a fair viewpoint on the version I watched, and my rating of this flick reflects the version presented here. However, assuming I did not miss much in terms of plot, there are a few observations, that may/may-not recommend this one to you: 1. Breaking the 4th wall in a mainstream superhero movie is good, but it gets old real fast (take a cue from Leo doing it in 'Wolf of wall street', where it shows up in just the right amount). So if they're relying on this alone for the sequel, ahem...they just might have to write better jokes. Also, it gets old real fast, except for those who do not know the background about the movie, or about Ryan Reynolds. At a point, it got so I did not know if it was the character breaking down that wall, or Green Lantern, or Ryan Reynolds. Too much of a good thing gets real old real fast. And, heh, he also breaks down that 4th wall for telling us that he broke that 4th wall down. Nuts. 2. The red-band trailers, sadly, have more content that the final local theatrical version, and also does the disservice of spoiling many key sequences for the audience, and that might be felt more in regions which have those sequences intact. 3. Best Stan Lee cameo. Ever. Hint: Think SNL Jason Sudeikis.4. One of the best X-men ever, in the form of Colossus, whose earnestness, used almost as comic relief to Deadpool's own devil- may-care wisecracking hero, this is one character to remember, nee, treasure. 5. Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Go. Watch. 6. Blind Al. Old lady pants. Wish they'd shown more about how DP and she got together, but the one with the growing 'hand' is something most audience-members (heh) missed. 7. Homeland's Morena Baccharin. But. No, not at a local viewing. 8. Only 3 action set-pieces. Tight budget, apparently. And yeah, our mouthy hero tells us that thrice, after having broken 16 walls, per his own admission. 9. Corny love. Earnest love. Mainstream love. Predictable love. Corny...wait, did I just say that earlier. Oh heck...Initially, I thought this was counter- programming for the usual Valentine's day fare. But, if you see the Wade-Vanessa ooh-aah (and remember, minus all the good parts over here...), its just so...yawn...10. The transporter refueled. What's Ed Skrein doing in this one. Seriously. And why's he (the character) there? Doesn't even make for a menacing bad guy. Almost like the excessively self-referential faux-credits at the beginning had to be true, and the real heroes just could not be bothered to write better. Several million drafts, and this? 11. Gina Carano with excess baggage. Had better presence in both Haywire and Fast &amp; Furious 6. Disappointing. 12. TJ Miller could've been utilized more, though his character is kinda funny in the scenes he's given...Now, obviously, I cannot recommend this movie for local theatrical viewing, unless you're one of those that gets off on all the scissor-happiness that's prevalent this month (H8ful 8 got the chops too, in case you were wondering, and there was precious little left to watch, or to listen to, at the end of it all). In fact, this might be my last R-rated movie viewing on the local big screen, for a long time to come, unless I hear of some massive change in the way mature movies are presented to local audiences.And oh, enjoy the smoking and alcohol disclaimers littered across the screen throughout.</fullReview>

It has a few good action scenes and that's why I gave it 6 stars, but if it was just meant to be a comedy then I would give it maybe 3 stars if it was lucky.It definitely isn't appropriate for children under the age of 15 or maybe 16 because it has an unnecessary amount of filthy language, some pretty mild violence which probably shouldn't be an issue if you're kid is mature, plus some sex and nudity.So basically you can watch this movie for entertainment but it's not very good for a comedy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of making an R-rated superhero movie is good and I think it should be a trend but this movie is not a very good example.A few scenes did make me laugh. I liked the action scenes.However, one problem I have with this movie was that it was trying too hard to be funny. Some of the humor was just ridiculous and very bad taste. Examples would be the scene where Ryan Reynolds farts and the scene close to the ending where Ryan Reynolds was lying next to his lover Vanessa as he was still fighting Ajax, he made a hole with his fingers and stuck a finger in the hole as a sex joke. Also the scene close to the beginning of the film where Ryan Reynolds had a hole right in the center of his ass on his suit was just childish.Another problem I had with this movie was that Ajax was just not an interesting villain. He tortured Deadpool, fought him, kidnapped Vanessa, fought Deadpool again, and then got shot in the head at the end. For a supervillain, Ajax didn't do much. And the movie never explained how Ajax got his super strength.My last issue with this movie is the fact that Deadpool was played by Ryan Reynolds. He is like Jackie Chan, Danny Trejo, or Adam Sandler, you can't take those guys seriously, especially after Ryan Reynolds was in that horrible Green Lantern film in 2011.Hopefully, the sequel will have better humor and villains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is an amazing film. In fact is my favourite movie along with The Terminator and Beverly Hills Cop.This is a superhero movie. But not any old superhero movie, it is a full on comedy/action. And this is why it is so great. For example, in one bit he cuts off his own hand (it grows back due to his healing abilities), normally this would be disgusting (which it kinda is), but this time it's HILARIOUS! Also the main character (Deadpool) always breaks the fourth-wall. This just adds even more comedy to the film.The plot is pretty good, I'm not gonna spoil anything. It's not amazing like in The Matrix or The Da Vinci Code but it's a fun idea of Deadpool trying to get his body returned to normal (because the main villain, Ajax/Francis, kinda f*cked it up.Overall, the characters are all hilarious, the action is bloody and brutal and the film is rude AF.A definite 10/10 or 5 stars</fullReview>

And if someone loves you, the looks won't matter (this however can only be believed if that person is already in love with you and your looks changes after because I personally find it hard to believe that in the beginning looks like dead pool's wouldn't be repulsive).Character analysis: characters are not deep enough. Even Wade is shallow. It is like he is two characters, the one who sees everything as fun when he is in the costume and the angry one out of the costume. The character is just not believable. Wade should have had a better sense of humour when not wearing the mask, if they wanted to make him seem as one and not two characters. What ruined this movie for me, despite having a good storyline and plot, is Wade's constant talk to the audience (however I did like the scene when he said 'it's like the studio couldn't afford more than than two x-mens). It just didn't feel organic and natural even though the aim was to make it funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good superhero comedy, but not the second coming for the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool was a long time coming with all these talks of a solo movie, Reynolds promoting himself to get the role, and the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Add the leaked test footage and it seemed to be close to becoming reality. Now we have Deadpool which goes for a comedic spoof of superhero films while maintaining its own superhero film. The result of all the wait was an entertaining movie with a great turn from Ryan Reynolds despite the hype blossoming a film a bit more than it deserves in my opinion.Good: Ryan Reynolds is the glue that holds this movie together. He is funny and goes all in for the character of Deadpool. He delivers the meta humor and is a great lead. His relationship with Morena Baccarin is funny and provides enough character development for both. The humor is of the fourth wall breaking variety and it works for the most art. There are plenty of clever jabs at superhero movies and the business behind making them. The action is also pretty cool.Bad: The main drawback is just the story is nothing special. Despite a great turn from Reynolds and the humor, there is nothing here that can be seen as that special. The basic story is the typical hero has to save the girl and while it was done to poke fun at it, it is still the same plot line and it hurts the movie a bit.Overall, it is a really fun movie that does give the superhero genre a much needed jolt although it doesn't cross over to great for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most jokes fell flat for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping to see a really good comedy that has a superhero. In other words, I was hoping for something as good as the first quarter of Hancock. Instead, I saw an X-men movie in which the comedy bits were written by oversexed undergraduates. In other words, it was both boring and inappropriate. To fill the ten lines requirement, without giving spoilers, I'm going to say that the main characters behave like people who have just broken onto the bar scene. The movie does a decent job at introducing them, but it's just that they aren't interesting enough to make this comedy fun. The other characters are much worse. Actually, nothing much could be said about them because they are so forgettable they could have been replaced with stuffed animals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what genre this movie is. It may be comedy. It may be action. It is hard to say because this movie tries to be a little bit of both. But the humor in this movie is toilet humor. There is simply too much of it. When I watched the action scenes, the attempt at humor is very distracting. So first, yall made a movie that is not funny, and then you have diluted action scenes. It's really bad, there is too much distraction in the movie. Do it like the Avengers with short funny lines after the action scenes. But I think this movie is better than Batman vs Superman because at least something happened in this movie. It's just that they try to insert toilet humor each chance they get. Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean. It is just not funny!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>R Rated Comic Book Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely for the 20's crowd. It is a comic book story which appeals to the young, but the lewd scenes and language is not for teenagers (it's rated R) and definitely not for the morally faint, and the body count gore is not for the faint-hearted. I gave it a 7 because it is overall fun, funny, and entertaining; but the plot is simple revenge, with a side note of shallow romance, with a few snide remarks in psychological therapy. It's an experiment in the anti-hero where the protagonist character traits are worse than ever, looking villainous. A few scenes don't make sense, such as what the villain was trying to accomplish, how the hero escaped the rebar, and a few others, that left me wondering how to fill in the blanks. Finally, some lame explanations were made for a few puzzling scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is one of the worst Marvel comic book movies ever made and one of the worst films and one of the silliest films I've ever watched. It was silly and over the top. The action was crazy, the language was really bad and it was rude. It was a load of crap. After an hour of watching the film, I gave up on it and 80 minutes into the film I stopped watching the film. I completely lost interest in it and I got fed up with it. Although Ryan Reynolds really suits the role and was born to play Wade Wilson/Deadpool, the character was really annoying and he was a real pain in the ass and a bit of a knob. Deadpool was no better, no worst than Crank 2: High Voltage and Iron Man 2 and 3. What a waste of 80 minutes! I am glad I didn't go and see it on the big screen. I give it two thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky and funny Marvel Comics parody with a dirtbag non-superhero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 2016, "Deadpool" stars Ryan Reynolds as a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary who is permanently scarred after undergoing a dubious operation, but is enhanced with accelerated healing powers. He adopts the alter ego Deadpool and, armed with his new abilities and a twisted sense of humor, hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life. Morena Baccarin plays his potential babe while Stefan Kapicic and Brianna Hildebrand are on hand as Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead.This is a creative, energetic and often funny parody of Marvel superhero movies highlighted by cutie Baccarin and an excellent portrayal of Colossus (of the X-Men); the X-teen is pretty cool too. Reynolds is outstanding as the protagonist, but Wade/Deadpool is the main problem with the movie. While there are glimpses of Wade's potential good side throughout, he's so foul-mouthed and vulgar it's hard to see. While consistently amusing, the movie's also a barrage against one's moral senses. I suppose this would be easier to overlook if you grew up in some sheethole where the dirtbag clientele cussed every other word peppered with nasty sexual-oriented verbiage.Don't get me wrong here, a couple of my favorite superheroes are radical antiheroes, like Wolverine and The Punisher, not to mention my favorite superhero flick is 2009's "Watchmen," which is hardly a goody-goody superhero movie. But "Deadpool" is just so over-the-top foul &amp; vulgar it becomes a turnoff after 15 minutes DESPITE its good humor and innovative filmmaking. The movie will no doubt be cited in chronicles on the decline of Western Civilization. That said, the message at the end is unexpected and good (I don't want to give it away, but it has to do with Deadpool's babe).Unfortunately, "Deadpool" is so offensive and nasty it overshadows its attributes and I have no desire to see it again. In fact, I threw the DVD in the trash.The movie runs 108 minutes and was shot in Vancouver &amp; Victoria, British Columbia.GRADE: D+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to cinemas expecting to see a good superhero movie and oh boy how wrong was I. I didn't watch the trailer, maybe I should have?The humor was "fun". If you like really irritating characters then this movie is totally for you!I have seen comedies like Shoot em up that do over the top things in a good way. You won't get irritated with constant tacky humor like you did with this title. Of course it's good that some movies wanna push the boundaries etc and try out some outrageous things. Those things can result in really great movies but it certainly wasn't the case with this movie.I heard this phrase from a person commenting this movie after the cinema: "I'd rather cut my hand off with a spoon than watch this movie." So I conclude my review with: I'd rather cut my hand off with a spoon than watch this title again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I understand that almost everyone loves this movie. With that being said, I personally was very disappointed and do not understand the hype. I had been excited for years waiting for this movie and it was not what i had hoped for. The story (or what the writers pretend was a story) was terrible. I was honestly so uninterested in the protagonists that I did not care who won. I know that deadpool is a funny character, but i was still hoping for grounded storyline. The plot was all over the place and not intriguing whatsoever. Some of the jokes were mildly funny; however, I found the majority of the jokes too immature and frantic to be of any real comedic value. They felt very forced. Furthermore, the humor was overall too childish and crass. I got tired of most of the jokes very quickly. Based on how this movie turned out, I would have preferred a Pg-13 version similar to other x-men movies. It is a shame to me that the worst X-men movie (In my opinion) became the most popular and highest grossing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout the entire movie Deadpool cracked jokes about superheroes, from origins movies to their self-righteous lectures etc. So LOL... your making fun of other movies some people actually love, very funny and original it's not live we haven't seen Vampires Suck. So if you found the comedy over the top, is the rest of it good? No it's terrible. Even though it jokes about all cheesy clichés in superhero movies, the rest of the movie still checked all the items on the list for a origin story.****Spoilers ahead****** Feels alone at first - check, Meets beautiful girl - check, Falls in love - check, Cant be with her - Check, Experimental something to give him powers - check, side effects - check, Wants revenge - check, Bad guy kidnaps woman he loves - check, He need to save her and get revenge - check.The only thing about this movie that was different is that it is R rated, sex, cursing, violence and joking about almost anything and a lack of morals. So it gives the illusion of new and refreshing but the content is very basic as a origins film.Almost every person I spoke to said they loved it but I can't say the same. To be honest I was bored especially by the jokes. You no that kid in class who never would stop with the jokes even if they weren't funny... that's Deadpool. It's exhausting, where is the off button?Anyway I am very opinionated about the movie.If comedy is your type of movie try this one out if not move on.</fullReview>

By adding on a layer of self-referential artifice, Deadpool makes it even harder, if not nearly impossible, to give a crap about anyone or anything.In a lot of ways, it's like watching pornography for the story. I'm not saying that's bad, or not entertaining, but it's like why bother. For both parties...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a movie has to rip off ideas from other movies such as Ferris' Bueller's day Off, Guardians of the Galaxy, Hancock, Three Kings, Natural Born Killers and a few others, you know something is desperately wrong. But unfortunately, Deadpool doesn't even possess any of the originality or charm of the aforementioned flicks. And to think that those movies had any charm requires a stretch of imagination and personal taste. Did I mention that the Title also rips off Clint Eastwood's fifth Dirty Harry installment? What Deadpool fans see as original and innovative, I see an amalgum rip off. it borrows ideas from many movies and tries to mask itself under innovation.I'm not going to rehash this crazy plot, because it would just lend unearned value to this cinematic drekk, but Deadpool has uneven and inappropriate tonal problems that just jar against what movies have done before and what made them work well. This genre and the way they execute it doesn't work. Ultra Slow motion violence in the opening credits is a lousy way to start a movie. It looks retarded, ugly and doesn't prepare the viewer for any buildup or suspense. Instead, I was dreading ninety-eight minutes of offensive dialogue and nonstop cartoon violence which I predicted accurately.My biggest peeve about this cinematic waste of time is the Ryan Reynold's character. Watching a wisecracking, effeminate and sadistic superhero spewing out metaphors, pop-culture references and caustic remarks at a rapid fire rate is about as appealing as watching torture porn. I understand he is supposed to be an anti-hero you love to hate. But this ostensible intention misfires. I'm not sure exactly the class, distinction or persuasion of the category of people who gravitate to this type of art, but I know it doesn't include me. I can find solace, in this case, for being left out.Inserting humor with corny love songs for violent and repugnant scenes prompts me to wonder if the film maker knows what he's doing. Nothing seems appropriate here and leaves me shaking my head and rolling my eyes. Do not look for any subtlety, intriguing plot twists or thoughtful messages in this, because they don't exist here.I haven't paid much attention to Ryan Reynolds and I don't think he possesses enough leading man qualities to remain as such, despite how Hollywood is using him. I find him very plain and unappealing.Another curious and disappointing part of this work was Morena Baccarin. She looks too dignified, classy and sophisticted to partake in such juvenile smut. Hopefully, she can rise above this to where she can be regarded as a creditable actress in years to come and not some cheap eye candy for trashy films. I've read some blogs about how Hollywood has been churning out movies that distort the sensibilities of impressionable minds who don't know any better. Some even believe it's a conspiracy to destroy our youth. I can understand their concerns, but I try not to ponder such 'Doom and gloom' prophecy. I think humanity can survive if movies like Deadpool will cease and desist all future projects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a professional blogger here. An honest opinion, from a HUGE comic book fan. This movie was flat out TERRIBLE!!!! A 5 year old, could have written a better script. I read comics quite frequently, and I understand deadpool was a smart alec, but the sexual graphic content was abit much. I don't care, if the movie was rated-R. The cursing, was a laugh or two at first, but it got a bit old. Then when it got to deadpool showing quick scenes of playing with himself, I just thought it went too far. REALLY! Come on! WTF! The overall script was boring, I just thought it dragged on and on, and the whole point to the story was deadpool wanted revenge on a guy, who gave him superpowers. But, the whole story line of giving deadpool super powers was not well thought out by the writers, directors or producers of this movie, as compared to wolverine series. It was dragged on way too long. In fact, the only bright spots in the movie was colossus and negasonic teenage warhead characters. This was an absolute disaster in fight scenes, I mean my goodness I know that deadpool is a violent comic book anti-hero or villain, All he did was kill, kill, kill. There was CGI effects, but it was nothing new!Consent foul language jokes just got old! Deadpool, YEP, he was always yapping. However, I think this movie took the foul language and sexual content to the extreme. All I can say is it should have been rated XXX for a porn.I don't understand how comic fans are raving about the movie, other than the fact, they just wanted to see any movie, good or bad on the movie screen about DEADPOOL. Quality or Quantity? I was surprised to see Disney or even STAN LEE produce a crappy movie like this. This is the worst out of all of the marvel movies. For those that say this is the best movie of all time, need to get out of their cave more often.... Shame on the people who created this movie.And there going to be a DEADPOOL 2 movie. DANG! What a waste of money and time.</fullReview>

The action was impressive, with an incredible amount of violence, blood and scenes of a sexual nature (very questionable rating which I would not recommend for below adult viewing. The problem with this film was the lack of connectivity or sense of empathy generated for the "super hero". It may have been the aim to have such a frustratingly grating protagonist, however it detracted from a potentially very good film.

		<fullReview>I'd never heard of this film, the only reason I sat through it all was because I was on a long distance flight and it was part of the inflight entertainment. Entertained, I was not. Now there are two kinds of bad films, ones that are so bad they are funny and the others that are just bad, unfortunately this falls into the latter category. It would not be possible to put a plot spoiler in this review, since the film has no plot. Basically, someone decided to make a film with the usual explosions, car crashes and gun fire and put a really camp guy in a red suit and give him as many awful unfunny one liners as possible. To perfect the badness of the awful script they found a really bad actor to deliver unfunny lines, although granted, even Al Pacino could not make this script good.The only thing fascinating about this film is the fact that somebody made it, edited it and released it, not noticing how truly awful this film is. If I were an actor, I would be so embarrassed to be associated this film. This really could go down as one of the worst films ever made, but not in a good way. I would not have believed with a budget of $58,000,000&nbsp;somebody could make such a truly terrible film, it's just incredibly bad.</fullReview>

I'm all for violence, action, shootings, etc. (loved Edge of Tomorrow), and I like Ryan Reynolds, and Morena Baccarin is cute... but this movie is junk.It's like a cross between Eraserhead, Spiderman, and a snuff film. If that grabs ya, go for it. There are also lots of fourth wall violations (i.e. talking to the camera), which I generally find conceited and obnoxious. Read the comic book instead. It just didn't translate well at all here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>bad acting, stupid dialogue, bad script, and worst of all is the use of obscenity and sexual references trying to fix the hole idea. I understand and known all my life that the character from the comic is similar, but in the movie the deeper exploring of this resources instead of trying to tell a better story or even the writing seems to me a lack of creativity and poor ethics. The only character creation was done in Vanessa interpreted by Morena Baccain who deserves a 9/10 in her role for this movie. Woudn't go tho the theater if there is a sequel and would recommend to start fresh from scrap if there's still interest in delivering any other Deadpool Movie, this beloved antihero deserves more...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>of a movie that tries to be cliché. At one point I had to ask myself if the dialogue and jokes were written by a ten year old. The movie tries so hard to stay true to that edgy annoying shtick that was laid out, and ends up looking tryhard in the process of trying to be tryhard, if you catch my drift. The "humor" was extremely predictable. The plot was extremely predictable. You have to be simple-minded to enjoy this tripe. I love dark, sarcastic and dry humor, but this movie was a terrible attempt. That this movie has a 7+ rating shows you how simpletons easily fall victim to the hive mind hype carried out primarily by comic-dorks who struggled with aspergers in high school and their social life in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banal, puerile, staid, mostly awful and predictable humourless 'super' hero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm so glad to see that there are actually other people on the planet who think this film was terrible. Everyone is losing their minds over the film on social media billing it as the best film they've ever seen ever. I think its got something to do with 'breaking the fourth wall' (something Malcolm in the Middle did expertly), making jokes only funny in a 13 year-old boy's changing rooms, unnecessary graphic violence and nudity which is absolutely unnecessary... that is until you realise that this film has been written by/for people who still think farts are funny. The humour in this film isn't even as sophisticated as White Chicks or Scary Movie. It's not a parody either. As an example, the guy behind the bar delivers his lines like he's reading them for the first time. No comic timing, no life, no urgency. That may be his character but whatever comedy is supposed to be in his dialogue goes missing immediately. They also take jokes too far. Sometimes, just leading a viewer into the realm of a joke is fine, leave them there, let them get it themselves - not Deadpool. It's like they knew people with the sense of humour of a 9 year old would be relishing every pointlessly gory banal second and they not only explain the joke, but they keep talking a good minute after the joke has been, gone and not been laughed at; still telling the same joke. In short - no, this is not the best film you've ever seen ever. For that (in a comic book adaptation), go watch The Dark Knight or The Avengers. This film's storyline, jokes and content have all been either written by or for adolescent boys who still think 'boobies' are things to snigger behind your hand at at the back of a biology lesson. Everyone involved in this film needs to grow up and so do the people leaving 10 star reviews. I'm sure if they watched Postman Pat the movie and he swore, they'd give that 10 stars too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's the fact that I never read any of the Deadpool comics.Or that I'm simply too old, to find D*ck and f*rt jokes funny. Whatever it is,deadpool just don't do it for me.The fact that it works to break the fourth wall in comics,doesn't mean it work well translated to the big screen. I found the characters boring and unimaginative. But since the die-hard fans claim the movie is very close to the comics, I'll take their word for it.And guess I won't like the comic either. But I think deadpool would've worked better as a cartoon. They portray colossus as the stereotype Russian from the cold war,but to give it some positive words. Some of the fights scenes was pretty good,though a bit too much wire stunts for my liking.All in all.This may be a really good movie for some,but for me it was just boring</fullReview>

Thus it massively missed its mark.Punching people in the groin is not funny, it stopped being funny back in 1990 when I was 11 when will Hollywood realise that. And if you are going to do things like that at least have some gender balance and have it happen to women as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm seriously considering ranking this movie a 1 out of 10, just because how of pornographic it seemed. Honestly, the movie is very fun and could have been a great time for everyone if the producers of the film didn't decide to cater to the manchild virgins out there. Without all the raunchy crap, I would rank the movie around an 8 or 9. A few people did walk out with their children during the film for understandable reasons and that is what pisses me off the most. The people who made this movie know Deadpool inside and out so it stands to reason that they should know what demographic reads Deadpool comics. Just thinking about it pisses me off. F*&amp;k it. I'm giving this film a one out of ten. The filmmakers should know better. There was literally no reason why they had to put out a "hard R" film. They could have even made the movie PG-13 if they wanted. I don't mind a graphic movie but I do mind a graphic movie targeted at children. If the sequel does the same thing, I'm not going to spend a penny on it.</fullReview>

Deadpool's fellow superpowered beings ? Colossus (Stefan Kapicic), Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), and Angel Dust (Gina Carano) ? mostly just stay out of his way, though Colossus and Negasonic each have their moments. T.J. Miller is effective as Deadpool/Wade Wilson's BFF Weasel, but he feels like he was just ported over from HBO's Silicon Valley, where he plays a startup bro. Ajax, the movie's main villain, is sinister (and good-looking), but his mutant ability ? not being able to feel pain ? doesn't make him feel like much of a threat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple summary (without the spoilers); what you need to know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We live in a time where super hero movies are all the rage. Who doesn't love a good super hero throw down, cool origin stories, and awesome villains? While decent hero flicks are easy enough to find, occasionally a masterpiece, like "The Dark Knight", will come along and in the process wow the critics and audiences alike.And then we get Deadpool. Where to start with this one? To give it some comparison, it makes "Batman and Robin" look like an Academy Award-winner by comparison. How is that? Quite simply put, the movie is terrible in every sense of the word.Deadpool is untrue to its source material and to the very character himself. The character is known for his violence and humor throughout his comic book, TV show, and video game appearances. The filmmakers, in their apparent efforts to make the character more "edgy" and appeal more to adults, have stripped him of this, instead replacing the comedy and fun with crude dialogue, sex, sex, more sex, and more foul words than possibly all of Eminem and Lil Wayne's albums combined, and all of this without any of the substance that have made Wade Wilson's adventures and misadventures alike over the years so memorable, exciting, and laugh-out-loud funny. No wit, and no soul. It insults the intelligence of its audience, and then expects them to pay. We've come a long way in terms of the quality of super hero films; to call this a step back could potentially be the biggest understatement of the year.For those who have been waiting for a good Deadpool film, this unfortunately is not it. Perhaps the best on-screen appearance to- date can be found in the animated short "Hulk v.s. Wolverine", but for the time being we're still going to have to wait for our favorite "Merc with the Mouth" to get the big-screen sensation that he deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the jokes and 4th wall breaks are just references to pop culture. I had a hard time trying not to cringe at the jokes and around 90% of the movie I kept a straight face. I will admit it did have funny moments, although not enough to boost this rating up. In all honesty, it doesn't deserve a 1 rating but its rating is way higher than it should be. The hype around this movie made me watch it, even though I thought it would be pretty bad. Take away the crude jokes and 4th wall breaks, and all you have is an average superhero movie and not too good of one. I honestly can't understand why this movie has such a high rating. Normally comedy movies are ones you can quote, and I haven't heard a single person (who enjoyed the movie) quote it once. 1/10</fullReview>

The story and plot is also dull and tedious which goes along with the dull and tedious jokes.

His reason: "dealing with my cancer will upset the former prostitute". Disposable men, don't want to upset that low value female!! Guy joins a scheme to cure his cancer finally and gets tortured to activate his mutant gene, which unfortunately makes him unkillable. He escapes and plots revenge, badly. Later he encourages a taxi guy to kill the guy his girlfriend is interested in. How cute! Well he screws up his revenge, and his girlfriend prostitute gets kidnapped, and in his final revenge scene, SHE SAVES HIM. This liberal garbage HAS TO STOP. Iron Man 2 or 3, Pepper Pots saves Tony Stark, Batman 3, catwoman, the fem idiot, fighting in high heels, with NO back story, saves batman. The latest Mad Max, Max is a pathetic side character whose only value is saving women like the "badass" Furiosa.And thats when I switched off the movie.

		<fullReview>Deadpool tells the story of Wade Wilson who upon being diagnosed with terminal cancer then goes to a shady place with shady people ran by antagonist Ajax. After being cured but disfigured Wade goes after Ajax in order to fix his face.Let me start out by saying that I had a blast watching this movie. I thought the action was outstanding, and found myself laughing at the films crude and sadistic hummer through out the whole runtime. The movie was also incredibly fun. If I was rating this movie purely on how much I enjoyed my self during it I would be giving this movie a perfect 10/10. But upon analyzing it I can only recommend it as good.My reason for only calling it good is because the movie relies mostly on its sense of hummer. And upon analyzing it what I found is that if you find Deadpools hummer chuckle worthy at best you will probably not like this movie nearly as much. Also the plot as well as antagonist are only unique when compared to other marvel movies. Where as if you look at as just a movie it is cookie cutter.In conclusion I had a blast at this movie and any one else with that sense of hummer will. But if you don't share Deadpools sense of hummer you will find it only has action scenes to offer after that. And when more then half of the movie is not an action scene you will be disappointed. And I'm giving this one a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings everyone, As I have promised, I'm gonna review-- Real Deadpool: DEADPOOL!!!! JWB: GOD DAMMIT DEADPOOL!!!!!! I was gonna say it first. Deadpool: Too late, I called it first. JWB: Yes the Deadpool Movie... Based on the Marvel Comic Hero of the same name, Played by Ryan Reynolds, If you remember reading the comics, He has a similar origin to that of Wolverine. Deadpool: And I have awesome Regenerative Powers, Much cooler then Wolverines. JWB: Right (Trying to hummer him), And Did I mention that Deadpool is insane like Charlie Sheen. Deadpool: Oh please, I'm more crazier then him, I'm more Crazy like The Mask, and the Joker from Batman, But I use my Lunatic Skills for the greater good... And the fact that Ryan Reynolds is my Stunt Double, I'd bee nothing without him. JWB: Oooookey, By the way I should point out that this wasn't the first movie Deadpool was in, No his first movie appearance was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Yeah that movie didn't go right for Byan Singers original vision ,And given the X-Men (film series) that's saying a lot. Deadpool: And the that I was doing Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 so... I didn't make it to help out. By the way, Shouldn't you upgrade your old DVD copy of the movie to a Blu-Ray, just when you are ready to review it someday? JWB: Well, My DVD of the film is starting to get jumpy because of the scratches at the bottom of the disk, Wait, How did to... Wait, YOU'VE BEEN SNEACING AROUND MY ROOM WHILE I WAS AT WORK YESTERDAY, HOW DID YOU GET PAST MY DOGS AND GRANDMOTHER!!!!!!????? Deadpool: You forget, I'm a professional. JWB: May I please return to the Review? Deadpool: Procceed. JWB: Thank you.I treated mother to the movie and... well she liked it, But I for one enjoyed it as it, They stayed true to the Original source material which are the comics other then that Fantastic Four movie, The Forth-Wall Jokes where, I give credit for are quite funny, Original, Cleaver and very creative, The Character is aware that he is a fictional comic hero, Which makes Breaking the Forth-Wall work, I noticed it when I heard people in the theater room laughing, The Story is not all over the place, Makes me which I have got the Marvel Platinum book of The Definitive Deadpool so I can learn more about the character (If the book exists), Seeming that This is set in the same Cinematic universe as the X-Men, It's fare to have Colossus in it, By the way he looked and with that Russain voice, It's a big improvement from his previous appearances from the other X-Men movies, But one think remains, What the heck was Bob doing in this, I thought he was a Hydra Agent? Deadpool: Simple, I blackmailed him into the movie, Just as I Blackmailed you into this Review with that false evidence Letter. JWB: So it was you that got me into TROUBLE WITH LOVELIVE!!!! Deadpool: That's right... I was gonna Involve Shun Obihiro, Hoshimiya Akechi Blaze, Cornelia Angelite Kane, Kazuhikoyuku Tsukikawa, Brent Lee, Katrin Wei, Julio Iborra and Jossa Garbo Manalili into this, But You'll have to do. JWB: What, Shun and I have you in our own teams in Marvel Avengers Alliance. Deadpool: Ahh, But I know something you and them lot have in common, Your interests in the Pretty Cure Franchise... I might plan on signing myself up for a role in future Precure Allstars installment as the guy who drives them crazy, And I'll convince Loki, You know him, to be there Ultimate enemy. JWB: How is that gonna work? Even Shun might see some plot-holes in that plan. Deadpool: What about the Idea of my Guide book to driving magical girls insane is inspired from your Contingency plan book with Spiderman on it, Only to be used, Should Pretty Cure ever turn against you if they don't play by your rules? JWB: I have no Idea what your talking about (Lying), Can we get back to finishing this Review please? Deadpool: Okey. JWB: So yeah, I really enjoyed this movie, And I might look forward to what Deadpool might be up to next, It's clear that this is sent in the New Timeline thanks to X-Men Days of Future Past, I recommended this movie for anyone who is a Fan of the Merc with the mouth. And as always, if there is a Movie, Anime, Game or Comic you would like me to review, don't ever be afraid to bring it up in the comments below, Just don't make a big deal of it like Deadpool did with me on this. Deadpool: I have some questions, Why where you complaining about Cure Fortune's motives in episode one of HCPC, And is it true that You wanted Cure Tender to yourself, And-- JWB: Oh, that's it! I'm coming over! I'll f@#$ing whoop ya! Deadpool: Ha, Your gonna find that really challenging, I'm somewhere here you can't possibly find me. Roy Tovey: OH Joseph, There's a Random guy in a mask speaking to the Camera in the office! Deadpool: Ho-oh. JWB: Coming Roy. Deadpool: Wait wait, It's not what it looks like! JWB: You chicken-blowing, Leno-stick! COME HERE, BLACKMAIL ME ON LOVELIVE!!!! WILL YOU!!!!

		<shortDescription>A bit too hyped but a solid movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, Deadpool. It was hyped so high and smashed it in the box office. A 'superhero' movie that's rated R. I did not go and see it in cinemas due to the fact that most seats were booked for a while and apparently kids were being taken by their parents which is not very responsible but that aside, I have sort of been delaying the watching of this movie simply because I had high hopes and I did not want them to be destroyed like they usually are.Before I watched the movie, I was told that Deadpool was a hero but not really. I've heard that he has some sort of mental disorder, can be quite lewd and raw but that is what makes him so fun and relatable. I knew that the movie was gory and also quite sexual, given the R rating.Overall, I think the movie was quite entertaining. I did not know too much about the character: what his motive was, his back story etc. so it was hard to judge or have expectations of him. I think Ryan Reynolds was great as Deadpool and I don't know if anyone could do it better.Deadpool is not my favourite character but I understand him and like him to a degree. People may call me a party pooper but I am not a fan of his lewdness. I don't believe he's a bad character, however. As for the other characters, I had no clue who they were. I particularly liked Colossus. Vanessa wasn't too bad either being the protagonist's love interest. The other characters were mediocre but I didn't necessarily hate them.The movie itself was great in terms of camera angles, lighting, direction etc. I actually don't remember much of the music apart from the end so I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. Story was solid. I really enjoyed the narration and the way that the story was told by starting with a hook and going back. It gave the right amount of information and in such a way that makes the audience interested the whole way through.Rewatch value: I would rewatch it with someone who has never seen it before but it's unlikely I'll watch it again from start to finish, seriously. It's quite hard to just have this movie as a background thing since it cuts and the story is important. I would have rated this a 7 but I'll give it to Deadpool for being charming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the comic books Deadpool, this movie was amazing to me. The people who have reviewed this movie 1 star etc then they haven't read the comics to understand the character. Some reviews say he talks too much, weird giving his nickname is 'Merc with a mouth'To anyone who is a fan of the comics this movie is for you, it delves into the back story of how he came about to have the powers he does along with the humour you would expect from Deadpool.I really hope this turns into a huge movie franchise as the stories that have already been made through the comics and any situation you can put Deadpool in are endless.I also like how they threw Bob into the movie for a split second(anyone who reads the comics will know Bob)So for such a short budget this movie gets an 8/10 from me. Im sure the next one will be even better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Anti" Hero still ends with "Hero"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect anything before I saw this film. I know nothing about original comic books. I was surprised in a good way while I saw this film.I saw a Super Hero who is completely not a typical one. Swearing, murdering, impolite and rude, stupid, childish, nasty. You barely think he looks like a Super Hero. But actually he is. Only he doesn't recognize it and he is crazy indeed. If you observe deeply, you may find he still has his principle and boundary.It really refresh me after I saw so many typical Super Hero movies. I totally agree with his opinion. If being a super hero means let bad guy live and keep hurting more innocent people, I'd rather being just super.Also I like the romantic story between Wade &amp; Vanessa. They both carry heavy burden and very lucky to find each other. There is not just sex!The way Ryan talk to the 4th wall to make fun of X-men series, Movie company and even himself is just funny.Most people may dislike this movie because the R rate expression and I agree too that this movie is definitely not for children or teenagers. It still can't change the fact of "Deadpool" is a well making, ironic, entertainment movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reynolds Plays It Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds finally plays a comic book character that we was meant for. After the disaster of Green Lantern, years ago, Ryan got his chance to play a role he was destined for.As an R-rated film, and highly discussed by many about how "this is not a kid's movie" the film is kind of tame in its uses of adult subject matter. It's a good story, about the vigilante / anti-hero Deadpool. It has strong comedy elements, it plays out realistically, and it really works well as a romance too. It hardly even feels like a comic book movie. I'm hoping the atmosphere of Deadpool 2 is similar. Morena Baccarin was wonderful in the role and fits really well with Ryan. Supporting characters of Colossus and Negasonic seemed forced, however, due to limited budget of licensing for more X-Men characters. Most of the action sequences are fun but some people may not be able to handle them very well due to the gore. Humor is very active in the action scenes and the film's R-rated content keeps light hearted. Aside from some of the kills in the film, the laidback feeling makes me feel that the film is suitable for some kids (depending on age).This was definitely the first must-see of 2016. Deadpool is a great film all around and should be seen by everyone, even if you're not a comic book person.</fullReview>

If you are over the age of 15 and have not seen DEADPOOL, i assure you, go and watch it. This film was awesome. Tim Miller, Ryan Reynolds and much more help from loads of people made this film for a long time. IT WAS WORTH IT. Colossus was amazing in this. Negasonic Teenage Warhead was brilliant.

		<fullReview>I honestly think that if it wasn't for Ryan Reynolds, this movie would not have received the high average rating it got on here. Ladies, (and gents), let's face it: if Deadpool was played by some average schmuck would you really be giving this movie 10 stars, keeping in mind that he delivers the same lines the same way? Yes, this is a snarky movie and it's supposedly true to the original series, but as a movie on its own it's just cringe-worthy. The jokes are funny-ish, the beginning is loaded with unnecessary sex scenes and shots of Reynolds' a**, and towards the middle I was falling asleep because it just seemed like the movie was all over the place and not really going anywhere. One of the most over-hyped movies this year. If you want a semi-love story, action, snarky remarks and cheesy one liners, and of course brief glimpses of Ryan Reynolds doing the nasty with a hot girl, yes go ahead and watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool Well what can I say about this movie apart from it's fricking awesome. I haven't laughed this much at a movie for years. There are many movies out considering themselves to be full blown comedies, however they couldn't lace Deadpools boots. It's absolutely refreshing to see a major studio have the balls to make a film like this. They have done the comic books proud keeping Deadpool's character true to the written material. Ryan Reynolds is as if he's been sent down from God to play this part. I can't think of anybody better to wear the mask. Just as Hugh Jackman made the part of Wolverine his own, Reynolds has done the same here. But while the Wolverine standalone films were pretty average at best the Deadpool movie knocks the ball right out of the park. A sublime blend of Humour action and romance make this the unexpected hit of 2016. While this is not a comic book movie that should be shown to children it is a real treat for all us grown-up kids. The story if you are unfamiliar is about a mercenary named Wade Wilson who finds he has cancer and undergoes a horrific experiment to try and cure himself of the disease. The result gives him superior healing powers just like Wolverine. However he is horribly scarred due to the nature of the experiment and because of this he believes he has lost the love of his life. What ensues is an action comedy fest as Deadpool goes on a quest to catch the Man who disfigured him and have him make him look like Ryan Reynolds again. You must watch this film at least four times to catch all the jokes and even then you still missed plenty. The gags come thick and fast delivered superbly by the very funny Reynolds. I could go on all day about some of the sidesplitting moments in this film. But rather than that just rent or buy this film. If you have an ounce of a sense of humour you will be laughing from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe too much hype?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this movie was good, and I gave it a 8 doesn't mean I fully liked it. As a lot of people have mentioned "deadpool" is going to be the most(badass) movie coming and it will be so hilarious". Regardless of the nasty sexual humor in the movie, I think it still missed some spice to be a "great" movie. I actually liked how it was built to be a cliché with the bad guys with bad guys versus good guys that might not be that good after all.In a nutshell, a nice movie with too much hype. The music in the movie added a really nice input since it was planned well with the scenes :). The movie was easy to watch and it was something that I didn't really need to fully pay attention to. I actually multi tasked while watching and I still stayed aware of what happened.I recommend you to watch the movie though if you haven't yet. It's nowadays a good thing to know what the movie was like because after all it is quite popular!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was A pretty good movie. Just wish the studios would make up their minds about how they want the characters to look like and keep it they way and at the same time keep it close to the original comic character as possible. First The had him in Wolverine with swords as arms, too funny. I mean when did Colossus become Russian? And think they could have picked a better known x-men other than "Negasonic" to be in it. I hope they get it right in the squeal. But over all was a decent movie. Just sucks that its rated R for people with kids who like X-Men. And Wolverine 3 is supposed to be rated R also. Kids are gonna be disappointed again.And they need to stop messing around and make a movie about Gambit!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a terrible movie, but after all the hype I was pretty disappointed really. I was expecting something at a higher standard than say the avengers but that's unfortunately about as good as it was. Could have missed this one. That's not to say it has absolutely no redeeming qualities. The action scenes for one thing weren't terrible but even still, they may have been a little too cgi. There weren't many interesting plot developments so it was hard to stay captivated and by the end of it I felt like I had just wasted the past 2 hours or so of my life. I would recommend spending the 2 hours of your life that you would spend watching this movie on something more useful like making a meal that you've never made before, or going for a run. If you are thinking about watching this because of the hype, just know that you're not really missing out on much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic book turned movie, lots of inventive action and a great sound track.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw this at home on DVD from our public library. I am not familiar with the source comic book. The movie is rated R for a good reason, the main character has a very filthy potty mouth, but it fits his character. Plus a few shots of bare-chested women.This is an origin story. Ryan Reynolds is Wade, always a bit of a loose canon. At his favorite bar is a list on a chalkboard, a "dead pool", predicting who will be the next to get killed. Wade is with his girlfriend when he collapses, at the clinic his doctor informs him he has cancer, but in three places he doesn't need - his brain, his lungs, and his prostate.He meets a man who says he can "fix" him, Wade has no choice and submits. He ends up being tortured in various ways, it is an attempt to make the hidden beast in him come out. When he finally escapes he is disfigured but has gained some pretty impressive strength and fighting skills, plus his cancer is gone. He can't go openly as Wade anymore, so takes the name 'Deadpool.'His nemesis is Ed Skrein as Ajax, and his girlfriend is Morena Baccarin as Vanessa. Can he defeat Ajax and get his girl back?The action is impressive, including the opening ultra slo-mo shot of Deadpool and others in a roll-over car accident on a bridge. And, where appropriate the deep bass worked over my subwoofer and rattled the walls.Overall a very entertaining movie, for those who can get past the constant filthy language. Reynolds is very good in what amounts to a dark comedy.</fullReview>

Don't have to look far for the problem: written and produced by the same guys responsible for the overworked wordfest that was Zombieland. And again they chose a whining, self-satisfied lead actor.The intro is interesting, action pacy, but the formula keeps repeating until the editing runs out of imagination and a giant sigh of boredom is released at about the hour mark.Music is standard, with the worrying fact that a teen movie keeps harping back to stuff from 30 years ago. And the unfunniest post credits gag ever. Yes, you will gag.Surprised they didn't include a midget in a clown suit and an ugly pet. Plus the boob cover up was pure, "How much can't we get away with - hehehe!" Overall: Lots of energy, but tiresome. Like Saturday Night Live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was super fun. Made of low budget and they said that in the movie too. You have to have a little idea of other X-Men movies prior to watching it. The jokes were awesome. The trademark Marvel post-credit is even better. If you want to have a good laugh then this movie is for you. Ryan has done well after the debacle of his previous super-hero movie Green Lantern. Oh, there is a joke on this too. You can find if you listen every dialog carefully. You might not have seen an anti-hero with such sense of humor. Ryan is the perfect cast for the role. His comic timings are great. You might get disappointed with the action scenes as those were not as par with other X-Men movies. But he is Deadpool and he fights on his own unique way. The content is for adults, so watch it with friends and colleagues; not with your family unless you have a cool family :P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool from comics to A film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Deadpool, being a comic lover, I thought that the dramatization and personal life of 'dead pool' wade Wilson was overly exaggerated, to the point of making the character simply dumb. The character Jubilee and Colussus were accurate portrayals to their comic counter-part, however Deadpool was overly talkative and lost his furious approach to all-things decadent. I was honestly expecting his voice to be charred and more cruel (less happy). I mean isn't that why there's a yellow bubble around the character's voice in the comics? Although Ryan Reynolds joked around and played the part well, even if the director missed some actual personifications, I would have maybe used a less personalized script. To me Deadpool is a new York street hobo, whom was slightly borrowed from Deathstroke the Terminator, Rorschach from watchmen and maybe IDK spider-man in personality and in this regard Rob Liefield is a genius. However, the movie itself was drab and made me think of deadpool as some loser whom gets a quick-rich scheme if you know what I mean. Not because of the actors themselves but because of the directing to please Rob Liefield...the jeans commercial guy..loll. No really he's been in comics since the early 90s, so he knows what characters work, and what characters don't. This movie was another Spawn IMHO. It was just a movie with a crazy budget. I would in fact like to see more of the third party characters then deadpool during the escapade. The Matrix style effects though, works, and I wouldn't know it from a movie made in the late 90s. Another minor miss would be the mask not doing the Lobo's fetal's giz gesture syndrome, idk a big eye and a small eye...No kids we won't be seeing a sequel. For reasons unknown, Deadpool needs a plot, without the love and romance. I would like him to be more carefree? Chris Pratt could play deadpool more effectively like idk Daniel Day-Lewis. Then, if you could use some sort of Sin city like transition to comics in the scenes that would be too cool. In the end though, Deadpool was just too tame.</fullReview>

It's like he's actually talking to us during the movie. The rest of the movie is just amazing with its incredible action sequences, funny pop culture references, and what the Deadpool comics are all about. The villain nothing new though. He's like this mad Doctor who wants to Make experiments on people but i will give him credit that he can do some awesome fights with wade. This movie is just one heck of a thrill ride of awesome Visuals, descent fight scenes and some pop culture references and fourth wall breaking to make every Deadpool fan exited.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) has cancer and undergoes a procedure by Ajax (Ed Skrein) to cure him of the cancer, and it gives him super powers. The idea was to make Wilson a superhero who can be auctioned off to the highest bidder for other mercenary work, but he escapes from Ajax. The main problem is that his face changed to something hideous and he is afraid to confront girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). He now calls himself Deadpool, and he needs to find Ajax who he believes can reverse the procedure and make him normal looking again. What was good: the action scenes with generous compliments of CGI is spectacular and very creative. Kudos. The acting was good when dialogues weren't being too silly.What was bad: Silly childish dialogues mostly from Deadpool, toilet humor, F-bombs and other disgusting sexual language. To be fair, sometimes Deadpool's humor was spot on. I said "sometimes."Deadpool gets X-Men Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) to help him defeat Ajax.Notable: Leslie Uggums as Blind Al.The movie would have been better if much of the bad stuff above was toned back a lot. The way this was presented was too over the top and bordered on being most annoying and childish, at times.This movie has taught me to be wary of Marvel comics presentations to the big screen. They just go too far with language and toilet humor and now we can add silly dialogues. This was disappointing. (3/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, one time in the beginning. Nudity: Yes at a girlie bar. Language: Yes. Rating: D</fullReview>

This is a very different comic book adventure with numerous inside jokes including a couple of shots of a People magazine cover with Reynolds pictured as the sexiest man alive. The language and a brief sex scene give the film an R rating, and the CGI is as good as expected. Reynolds and love interest Vanessa(Morena Baccarin) have good chemistry and the villains; especially Ajax(Ed Skrein) are excellent. A good story line and great casting; including Leslie Uggams as an old eccentric blind woman make Deadpool a solid 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy fun flick - if you can take the blood and gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My teenage son encouraged me to watch Deadpool - theoretically an R- rated love story. Wow, what a different kind of film. Self-deprecating, witty, different, funny, all these apply to Deadpool. I guess you could loosely call it a love story. There are some sex scenes, and lots lots of blood and violence. The story constantly pokes fun at Marvel, Ryan, previous flics, future films, but mostly continually at itself. This self-humorous approach, roughly similar to Ant-Man, hits the mark. Deadpool is a pretty cool, innovative story. Ryan plays the role of Wade who eventually becomes Deadpool. The story pokes fun at him over and over, especially around his love for sex and his lover. The editor had a ball with stop action film sequences where Deadpool stops to tell us what is going to happen, pulling himself out of the scene, then diving back in. It works.The movie does slow down a bit in the middle - it was impossible to keep up the non-stop level of witty repartee that introduces the film, starting with the introductory credits - just watch - you'll understand.The end was somewhat predictable, good guy against bad guy. There also is the tie-in with X-men, so I expect that will continue. I understand there's already a Deadpool 2 en route, so buckle up for more fun.I loved Deadpool, and you will too, if you don't mind the blood/violence. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scale here is 1-10, that should mean that a 10 should have almost everything you would want in a movie and a 1 virtually nothing to offer. So how can people score this 1 or 10?Yes this movie is "bad" both in the good "cool" way and in the bad "immoral" kind of way. They action sequences are great, its a non-stop action-thrill with a lot of blood, gore, violence, bad-language, nudity, toilet humour and virtually everything a hate-loving psychopath could want. Great! It was fun and entertaining at times and if you never get tired of constant violence, gore and cheesy humour and have nothing better to live for. Then I am sure you would love this movie, which takes movies like Sin-City, Kill Bill and Spawn and upgrades it, and makes super-hero movies like Spider-man and Bat-man look like a vegan dinner. So whats not to love?A lot actually. To anyone who likes to eat anything other than extra spicy Bean Burritoes for breakfast, lunch and dinner the constant repeat of same lame childish jokes combined with endless of pointless violence gets pretty boring after awhile. There is virtually nothing new or original for this movie to offer which has not been done many times before. Its definitely not a movie to with kids or anyone with a sensitivity level above that of a street thug, and I would not recommend if for that reason. Its the kind of movie which not only has the "hero" act and kill before thinking or asking questions, but it seems the movie makers and everyone involved with the movie did too. On a positive its kind of what you would expect looking at the trailer and don't disappoint in that, but on the negative it doesn't offer anything more.A well-done non-stop action movies for those who don't wish to think, feel, create, change anything for the better or be surprised. For anyone else, this will likely seem like a Waste of time, where there are many more movies out there to chill to with far more to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as fun as it wants to be, but still fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a lot of clever marketing around this film ? marketing which not only got the sense of humor of the film, but used it really well to get to, and expand upon, the target audience. Like the film itself, it was all done with such irreverence and lack of respect for the genre, that I found it quite refreshing ? particularly as superhero films continue to puff themselves into bigger and more serious epic franchises. Mostly, the film itself manages to deliver in the same vein, but it is not as consistent as I would have wanted ? and I can understand those that hate it.For all its subversive humor, the plot of the film is a collection of familiar tropes ? the kidnap, the revenge, the origin story etc. An added downside is that this flaw doesn't really matter, because the plot always feels like it is an afterthought that the writers added once they had all the jokes and scenes they wanted down on paper. These are pretty funny, and the irreverent tone helps it work, but if you are not in the right frame of mind then it will probably grate quite a lot. The action set-pieces are pretty enjoyable though, and it does play well as a faux-subversive entry in the genre.It is fun, rude, and gory; and it is enjoyable for it. It does have its weaknesses though, and in the end it is not as clever or different as it thinks it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into Deadpool with seemingly high expectations. The video game series was great, so i set my standards high for the movie. And well, I wasn't exactly 'disappointed' but I wasn't exactly pleased. Now look, I read the original comics, but I'm not gonna act like a butt hurt fan boy about this. The humor was 'meh' and pretty crude for the sake of being crude. (the scene with the ring pop was kinda funny). And it had its fair share of boring moments, and i'm not gonna lie, but the scenes where they tortured him to unlock his 'powers' kinda felt like some weird torture porn seen straight out of a Japanese hentai. But overall i still enjoyed it, Ryan Reynolds was a great cast for Deadpool in all honesty, i looove him as an actor. Some of the side characters were pretty meh (i loved the blind old lady to death), but his wife and Francis (was that his name i forgot) were pretty forgettable. But I still enjoyed it none the less, (still kinda hated how the chick saved him in the end, his wife or whatever, kinda forgot her name). But the costume looked fantastic, like it was ripped right out of the comics! i give this movie a 6/10 because it wasn't awful, but it wasn't good,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spoiler-Free Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like your movies violent and vulgar, then Deadpool is right for you. Based on the Marvel Comics character, Deadpool is about Wade Wilson aka Deadpool, a masked merc with a mouth who is on a mission to find the jerks who physically scarred him, and that's about the whole movie right there. Deadpool is essentially one long chase movie with flashbacks thrown in to give the chase context. Ultimately, how much you enjoy the movie simply boils down to how funny you find Ryan Reynold's filthy-mouthed portrayal of Deadpool. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a fun superhero movie for the whole family, this movie has a hard R-rating, and deservedly so. While I personally found a lot of the violence, nudity, and language unnecessary, we live in a day-and-age where so many are desensitized to these things, I know I'm in the minority. Bottom line, if you enjoy movies that are as rude, crude, and socially unacceptable as possible, Deadpool is right for you.I give Deadpool a 5 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun superhero flick with an extra layer of M-rated sass.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool tells the origin story of Wade Wilson, a former member of the military who now takes on justice under his own terms as a mercenary. Wade falls in love with a hooker and as his relationship with her flourishes he ends up getting diagnosed with terminal cancer. In a move of desperation he accepts the offer of a mysterious man that operates in a clandestine lab, who promises him not only the cure of his disease but also greater powers. In an unfortunate incident in this secret lab with one of the operatives, he ends up with a disfigured face. However, he also ends up with the power of fast healing and regeneration, making him almost invincible. DP now faces a life of almost immortality but plans to seek revenge to the man that disfigured him, and also fights to get back the love of his life. DP teams up with X- Men residents Colossus, who spends the entire movie trying to convince DP to join the Xmen, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, a mutant who comes off as Daria-level cold but snarky teenager, but ends up being a real powerful and reliable sidekick. As a character Deadpool is a blatant mix of Wolverine and Spiderman, but augmented, and then with sarcasm and self-awareness sprinkled all over. DP is really your typical Marvel flick, but what it has going on for it comes thanks to the nature of DP himself. Marvel certainly had some fun with him as he constantly talks to the audience and breaks the fourth wall. There's also a lot of real life pop culture references, several of which take jabs at Ryan Reynolds himself. A recurring joke across the film for example, is poking fun at Ryan's old role as the Green Lantern from the 2011 DC movie. The M rating also allows them to take some liberties on sexual and drug references, swearing, and violence. To be honest yes there was a lot of that, but still it was all very comic-bookish if you ask me. Nothing too out there except for a few semi-shocker scenes.I wasn't too excited about the first half of the movie, I felt that they could have handled DP's origin story better. It didn't seem too credible in the way it was presented. Still it was important to follow everything as it would give context to the happenings in the 2nd half of the movie, which was much more entertaining and let the character fully express himself but now under the actual motives of the plot. This movie isn't very deep; it is actually very straightforward on what it wants to achieve. Which makes it popcorn- flick level good. It is fun, but I don't know if I will care much about it after seeing it the first time.In conclusion, Deadpool really doesn't stray any far from a standard formula of a superhero movie and it is not going to win any outstanding awards, but it at least keeps you engaged with personality and sass. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But it is entertaining and that's what matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with One Star because the movie had "Foul Language" and "Sex Scenes" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not With that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are easily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Character Works, but the Rest Doesn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I did chuckle a number of times during the movie's onslaught of nonstop jokes. However, that's really all the movie has going for it. The fight scenes are not involving (mainly because Deadpool is invincible and has a lackluster villain). The love story doesn't really work either for such a violent character nor does the back story. Fox probably shoehorned all these elements that really drag the movie down--the superhero movie clichés--because even though they were taking a risk in making this R-rated movie, they didn't want to go all out with it. All those clichés really stand out against all the parts that do work because they are so lackluster. It felt like no effort was put into any of those areas mentioned above compared to the effort put into making the character as good as he was.The potential is there to make a good movie in the future with Deadpool though and given the massive box-office success the film was, I'm sure the sequel will be better able to focus on giving us a plot worth caring about and more innovative action sequences.Add-on: Some of the jokes are very rape-y and off-putting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It knows what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This title knows what it's about. Unlike other marvel movies, this movie keeps it low-scale, the plot is not over the top, and it keeps to its material. It is not too ambitious, and stays within reason.The acting is quite good, the actor that plays Deadpool is so good at the act, that it feels like they are almost the materialisation of the character of the comics. The humour is on point, it does not feel forced, and it captures very well the kind of humour that the comic book character has. And I am also a fan of how the Deadpool character recognises that he can not be a hero, which makes him feel a lot more human, unlike a lot of superheroes that just jumps into this large responsibility by the fact that they're powerful in itself.The action and choreography is quite good, and the action scenes all were appropriate. However I must warn for all viewers that the movie is quite bloody and contains a lot of sex scenes, and even involves decapitation and depicts characters being shot.My only complaint is that I am confused as to the role of this movie, and how it might play into the other marvel universes.I would recommend it, as it is good for what it is, and deviates from the typical comic book movie genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay...But Not Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool was an okay movie. It was definitely not great, as many would suggest. It was very funny, but that is literally all that it had going for it. The film was extremely anticlimactic - I found myself bored, midway through. Also, the X-Men reference was so forced, I laughed at it. Deadpool was a filler movie - something to entertain superhero film fans, while they wait for the next blockbuster. I am a bit disappointed in myself for spending $4.99 renting it, On-Demand. The film felt like something you rent while hung-over, and - even then - that's not helpful, because you still wake up, wondering why you have a boring movie in your line-up. I would highly suggest that anyone looking for superhero fun go see X-Men: Apocalypse, which is an awesome film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I wasn't sure to expect from this movie. After all, it is a comic book movie. Excuse me, graphic novel. But I enjoy those if they're well-made. I enjoyed this one. It is funny, and the acting is simply superb.But it's also crude, rude, and largely insensitive--in a good way. This is not a movie for kids, and should've been rated X. X as in you're going to be trying to eXplain stuff for several months afterwards if you make the mistake of letting the children in on it. Ryan Reynolds is a hoot, and everyone else seems to be pretty much having a great time feeding off the energy he brings on. Everything else? Geez, I can't really think of anything I didn't like about this movie except for the slightly guilty feeling I got after wallowing around in the off-kilter humor and gore.Deadpool somehow manages to capture today's urbane, cynical point of view and turn it into something positive. That in an of itself is a neat trick. Just put the kids to bed first. No matter how much they whine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Reynold's smart-talking anti-hero makes a brilliant of one of the most amusing additions to the X-Men universe (of course we did see him in Polverine)...one of the best I have seen for quite some time. Ryan Reynolds is great. CGI is great, humour is great and the action is fantastic. I have no idea why some people have given this a grudging one as it has everything you need. The number of jokes is off the scale but this is sarcasm and this is a fun. It is an alternative to the end of the world superhero fests we have all got a bit used too.This is a fab film, simply watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! This movie really blew me up! I was not expecting this at all. Having a life and not being a nerd I had no clue about this character. I love him! Finally someone that is not a product of the Hollywood crappy world of Illuminati.This "anti-hero" is exactly what I would be if in a similar situation. I might actually be even more crazy. This guy is simply not accepting the weak-ways of the Batman, Superman and all the "man" series that follow the laws so that the criminal can still get out and make more lawyers work. (Hey, even losers need money, the fact they use a dishonest job to get it is only part of the horror but then again, they are stupid humans!)Deadpool, to me, is the REAL hero of Earth. When he gets a criminal, that criminal will not do evil again. With Batman and Superman he would be back out on the streets within 2 weeks, they use the "law", you know that thing for some losers to make a salary...There is plenty of action, laugh (in my case at least), and yes, violence. If you don't want violence watch the smurfs or Tinkerbell. The comments from Deadpool made me laugh the whole movie, I like his disrespect of the "caped boy scouts" which I agree with. (I loved the "vulverine" ones, it took me 5 minutes to stop laughing, it is so true! Big knives instead of fingers but cannot even scratch a villain! Wimp! Freddy Krueger was scarier and more efficient than Vulverine.)To the people that did not like the movie I can say; stick with your Twilight crap! For the real movie amateurs this is a must, it will show you that you can be a bitch and a hero!</fullReview>

I think the film is a bit overrated giving it an 8.2 on IMDb I think at least give it an 7.3 instead just because some of the sexual scenes are a bit too much. I do like this movie as it is one of my favorite SCIF but The sex scenes where a bit too much overall its a great film if you don't take it too seriously 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was about f****g time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is easily the most fan service of comic characters, so it makes sense that his big screen spotlight is a movie that feels a fan service movie. The "merc with a mouth" is a character that doesn't take himself seriously and neither does his big screen adventure, which is the biggest appeal of an otherwise standard super hero formula hiding under waves of winking irony, crass humour, and gleefully bloody violent mayhem.I'm pretty sure this is my new favourite Marvel movie (alongside 'The Avengers')Whether or not you are a fan of this style of humour is one thing, but this film as a whole, is fantastic.The concept of superhero fatigue only exists when films begin to bleed into one another, without even a modicum of originality or creativity. Deadpool is the outsider the genre desperately needed -- a hysterical exercise in separating itself from the pack with no 4th wall in sight and a titular character that offers more heart than anyone would have anticipated.</fullReview>

Dead pool was probably the best role Ryan Reynolds could have if he wanted to play a superhero funny witty and fun to watch. The movie had great fourth wall breaking and the why the story was told was excellent.The plot follows Wade Wilson who's wife gets kidnapped and he goes to try and find her from a villain known as Ajax who gave Dead pool his powers. Dead pool has the help of two other mutants one of them being Colossus who was great by the way.The movie was perfectly self aware and was great and fun to watch and easily the funniest marvel movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 words to describe Deadpool: Awesome, Hilarious and Ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I myself am a huge Deadpool fan. I saw this movie the second day it was in theatres, and even though I already knew Deadpool was a joker and all that because I read the comics a lot, when I went into the theatre I was expecting this to be an action movie with a little bit of comedy and it was even more comedy than action, it was so funny. "Ha-ha-ha! You're about to be killed by a Zamboni! TELL ME WHERE YOUR F*CKING BOSS IS OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE! In five minutes!" "Did I leave the stove on?" A lot of juvenile humor, too... "Whoops! You weren't meant to see that." I live in Canada, and I can't believe this is rated 14a here! It should be 18a in Canada! The ridiculousness were in scenes such as when Deadpool saw his girlfriend for the first time in months, and cartoon unicorns and a cartoon heart with big eyes and arms and legs started dancing around her and also the end credits with the cute little Deadpool was ridiculous, too, how it was riding the unicorn and everything. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall a very enjoyable movie. Deadpool breaks the fourth wall as expected, and tells a lot of jokes. However, the film loses points for having a weak villain. Ajax is weak, which is obvious for someone whose superpower is not feeling pain. Sounds more like a disease than a super power honestly, and he dies from one shot to the head. It does however have some great action scenes. Ryan Reynolds did a good job as Wade Wilson, but to be honest, he plays himself in like every movie. It is truly a rated R movie, so having children watch it isn't advised, as it has some hardcore banging and jokes not appropriate to little kids. Colossus was alright, and the Negasonic Teenage Warhead was alright as well. Deadpool talking to the audience was really fun to watch. Overall a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great movie, but great fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhat obviously Deadpool is not a great movie in the sense of having a lasting impact on the art of cinema, but it is a very well executed and entertaining film that combines action, comedy and romance very successfully. The strength of the film derives from it's well aimed ambition. It doesn't try to be anything it isn't, but does well everything it attempts. In no way does this film transcend it's genre, but it does quite adroitly play with with the genre's limits and conventions. On the whole the film is irreverent and crass, but there are some surprisingly well done sincere moments that give the proceedings some emotional resonance. While I liked the film very much, I'm probably just the kind of person for whom the film was made for. If, unlike me, one shies away from graphic violence, juvenile banter and crude language it might be hard to enjoy the other things that this film has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long awaited Van Wilder Sequel continues the tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Snarky, sarcastic, inappropriate, mildly racist Van Wilder is back and he's able to regenerate body parts (it's unclear whether he's immortal - would he eventually die of old age?). In this super rough, hard-R, cape-and-tights comic saga, the implausible combination of pretty and muscular Ryan Reynolds kills 90 people (by his count) and yet somehow is the titular hero. By comparison, Ajax (the name "Mr. Clean" was copyrighted), the main baddie only tortures people (who did, after all, come to him) and puts damsels in distress. The movie mixes ranch comedy with torture porn and Reservoir Dogs type violence into a volatile concoction that will have many of the millions who bought tickets leaving the theater early. While clever at times - particularly any time T.J. Miller is on the screen - the movie has only a nominal plot centered around Deadpool's mostly uninteresting and unlikely origin story (couldn't the techniques be refined to produce mutants with superheroes on an industrial scale; sure the process is painful but so is cosmetic surgery and people line up for that?) . Ryan - presumably stepping in for a part written for Jim Carey - presents another major issue mostly around the fact that his handsomeness is so overwhelming that the latex mask he wears still leaves him more attractive than your high school prom date. Also, note to the special effects team, ever time Reynolds turned his head right or left, the mask bunched and gaped like a 60's creature feature. In short, a mess but an entertaining and sometimes witty one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is all... heart?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard the buzz about the movie and read the gushing reviews, but it takes a lot to get me to the theater in the dead of winter, and I ultimately decided to wait for Mr. Pool to arrive on Blu-Ray. Big. Mistake. Boasting more belly laughs than any pure comedy I've seen in years, this is a movie I should've seen with an audience. I love that communal joy with a group of people when a movie is hitting all the sweet spots. It's so rare and I regret that I missed it here.The laughs I expected. Everyone I'd spoken to said it was really funny. That it worked so well with the stylized action was a bit of a surprise, but not a total shock. What did surprise me though was just how invested I was in the characters. The film does a great job of making you care about Wade Wilson, and he's easy root for here. He's not a perfect man when we meet him (or when we leave him). Far from it actually. But he and Vanessa's love story reminded me a bit of Rocky and Adrian's from the original 'Rocky'. There's that moment when Paulie asks Rocky what he sees in Adrian and Rocky says that she fills gaps. Paulie, now utterly confused, asks Rocky what he means and Rocky replies "Gaps, you know? I got gaps. She's got gaps. Together we fill gaps.". Wade and Vanessa are two damaged people who just sort of fill gaps. The humor and the action may be its calling card, but the heart of this film is that love story and that's what holds it all together. There's also a really great villain in Ajax, who is as cold and ruthless as any I can remember seeing. Certainly in a "comic book" movie. Too often I find that I'm ambivalent toward the bad guys in these kinds of movies (See; 'Captain America: Civil War'), but here I was actively rooting against Ajax. I mean ACTIVELY. Ed Skerin was great, as was the entire cast. Reynolds was born to play Wade Wilson/Deadpool and I wasn't surprised that this--being somewhat of a passion project for him--saw him deliver. But he gets a lot of help from Morena Baccarin, who is just exceptional, TJ Miller, Leslie Uggams and his would be X-Men compatriots Brianna Hildebrand Stefan Kapi&#x10d;i&#x107; as Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus respectively. Both were critical in bringing out the best ( and worst) in Deadpool.Funny. Exciting. Moving. Yes, moving. 'Deadpool' is a refreshing entry in the crowded, somewhat fatigued, comic book movie genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the best way to describe the 2016 film Deadpool? There are just too many words to actually describe how incredible this film is, not just as a superhero comic book film but as a film overall. Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast as the fourth wall breaking, murdering, wise cracking Merc With a Mouth. The film intelligently plays with the usual tropes of a superhero origins film with its fun jokes, perfectly timed flashbacks, and great fourth wall breaking moments. Just like the character and his stories in the comics, the film is very meta and knows how absurd the movie is especially at the beginning when it gives us the credits. Deadpool may be a sadistic insane killer with macabre jokes but he's still lovable enough you don't care how much blood and guts he spills wherever he goes. Though one would normally be annoyed when stuff in the trailers aren't actually in the films, it makes sense since a lot of jokes in the trailer were probably different takes so as to not overplay the actual jokes. With its success, proving that hard R rated superhero film can work, hopefully other similar movies that deserve the rating will be made and not just make something R rated since it went well for Deadpool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Deadpool Rises...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Deadpool" (2016) is the first superhero film to arrive this year, and sure has a lot of competition from giant blockbuster superhero films such as "Batman vs Superman" (2016) and "Captain America: Civil War" (2016). Do to it's risqué R-rating full of violence, foul language, and awkward sex scenes/comments, it seemed that "Deadpool" had a lot to possibly loose or gain, especially for 20th Century Fox and their X-men character rights.Even though "Deadpool" is not the first R-rated superhero film ever made ("The Punisher," 2004 and "Watchmen," 2009 to name a few), it is the first to push full on Marvel style fun with a raunchy R-rating. The film succeeds in being fun entertainment, while also staying true to the character of Deadpool.Ryan Reynolds completely redeems himself as Wade Wilson/Deadpool (after the underwhelming and dull "X-men: Origins Wolverine" 2009), and proves that this is the role he was meant to play. His snarky immature humor, hyper active personality, and especially his voice help make Deadpool one of the most lovable (or maybe unlovable to some) characters in superhero cinema today.The other supporting characters don't have as much to go on as Deadpool, aside from Colossus (whom shines more here than in any past X-men film). The rest of the cast seems to just be there for the story elements (a villain, henchman (or woman), girlfriend, and best friend). This is a Deadpool film, however, so Deadpool wouldn't want any other characters stealing his show."Deadpool" is well filmed, and the way he breaks the fourth wall feels natural and not out of place. Director Tim Miller may not have a lot on his film resume, but he proves that he knows this character through and through with his technique.This film is great entertainment and proves that you don't have to be associated with a PG-13 rating, or Disney/Marvel Studios to make a successful superhero movie. It will be interesting to see how Deadpool affects the future of its X-men franchise, and other superhero franchises in the years to come (especially now that the "Deadpool 2" is being made). I'm hoping that studios take this as a lesson in making a true character to the comics, not just making an R-rated film for the sake of an R-rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ironically enough, the movie's worst character was Deadpool himself, and the only good parts of the movie were before he was not wearing the red suit.I don't get the hype. The story was lame - let's just say that really, there happened nothing in the movie, but badguys getting kicked in the butt. The action is quite boring, filled with stupid slow-mo's and still images, which were ultimately ruined with the constant yapping and really just irritating jokes by Deadpool. And the 4th wall breaking - geez, it just got so boring, that I wished I could have breaking the wall and yell at him to stop this annoying thing they called movie.I guess the movie was supposed to be fun with the jokes and all, but most of the time I ended up with a facepalm. As said above, ironically the only good parts were the serious ones, which those too were usually ruined at the end by Deadpool saying out loud another lame joke. The whole movie felt like it was scripted and acted by a bunch of teenage kids, who found out that there are funny curse words.The music choices were bad, even though I get their point, but it just doesn't work. Everything in this film that was supposed to be cool and funny, turned out to be lame and just stupid. I just don't get what people see in this.The sexy scenes and blood were just fillers, because, frankly, there was nothing else to the movie. Was it fun to watch? If you left your brains on the doorstep, sure - there are worse movies. But there are also better choices, even if you just want a good laugh, nice action, and a couple of nude girls; this had all those, but only those, and even movies where these are not the main things, you can find better.In the end, I don't know who are supposed to be its audience: surely it's not for any adult that has his brain activity functioning correctly, nor is it for children because of it's gore, sex and repeated use of the f-word. Who is supposed to like this movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as a Deadpool movie was ever going to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is on the same universe as the X-Men films and it is directed by Tim Miller. It stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano, Leslie Uggams and Brianna Hildebrand. In Deadpool, Wade Wilson hunts the man who gave him an accelerated healing factor but also a scarred physical appearance. I liked this movie a lot, it's probably up there on my X-Men movie ranking. Though my favorites are still First Class and Days of Future Past. Ryan Reynolds is P E R F E C T on the role of Deadpool. He has comedic talent and is very good at acting. The jokes he makes on the movie are straight up hilarious, and the puns are just as clever. This is definitely as good as a Deadpool movie was ever going to be. Though it was clear they had a small budget, they still made the most of it and nothing looks fake at all. The action is amazingly shot and superbly done. There's no shaky cam or whatever that thing is that other cheap action movies do, here is just great stunt work mixed in with great visuals and hilarious one liners all around. The fourth wall breaks are genius and well though out. They had great timing and were actually funny. While the overall story might be a bit formulaic, still all the other amazing things just surpass that and make us forget the abomination that was X-Men Origins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool works as a comedy film, a superhero film, an action film, and the RomCom aspects were decent however it does have some blunders including: an over-reliance on 4th Wall Jokes and Pop Culture references which is a large aspect of Deadpool but it can get annoying at times. Despite this the movie has a great cast, stellar action, a well written script and it does have a lot of strong moments but to this movie's disadvantage it does fall flat several times due to going from a RomCom-esque movie to a Thriller to a Revenge Plot to a Superhero Movie to an action-comedy and back and forth and it is sometimes done well and sometimes it's not, still a must see for Deadpool and Action-Comedy lovers everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My New favorite film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had waited 7 years for Deadpool to get the movie treatment. I love Deadpool. He is my favorite Marvel character. He was never properly portrayed in film until now. You see with the disappointment of X-Men Origins Wolverine, Deadpool just looked like Baraka without a mouth. This movie is a superhero movie like no other. It is hilarious. It is the Deadpool we all know and love on the big screen. The R- Rating was perfect for the film so they can get away with what ever they wanted. This is fitting for Deadpool as he is an irreverent character who swears a lot and makes hilariously crude and raunchy remarks/jokes. This movie is outrageously funny and every two minutes I was laughing my head off. The opening credits in his perspectives was priceless. There was never a dull moment in this movie. This had it all, Violence, Comedy and a few over-the-top, but hilarious, sex scenes (don't show kids) If you love Deadpool, you will love this film. Keep in mind this is R-Rated and not suitable for children. Take them to see Captain America: Civil War instead. It's more age appropriate. If you like irreverent comedies with a dark sense of humour, then this is perfect for you.</fullReview>

I'd hate to think what your lives are like, or what type of films you would consider good if you thought this was that bad???? I personally thought the cinematography and effects were amazing as well as the acting, especially Ryan Reynolds. The humour was also brilliant ; maybe it was a bit childish in parts but, I am 50 years old and laughed my ass off at the cinema. OK, there was sex scenes and offensive language that might of offended some but surely the majority of people for this was, exactly how it was meant to be taken, FUN.... You don't get an 8.7 on IMDb for nothing!! To the haters... Get a grip, get a life, is very short!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is the funniest and most enjoyable to watch super hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though it's not really my thing I watched almost every Marvel or super hero comic movies. Just because they are entertaining, but without being great. But Deadpool is different. It's definitely the best super hero movie I ever watched. besides the obvious action scenes this time you get the dry humor for free. The funny lines of Deadpool are what makes this a very enjoyable movie to watch. I heard from others it was completely different then the usual X-Men movies and I have to agree with that. It's totally refreshing. The cast is well chosen and are perfect in their characters. It's the first time I actually can't wait to have a sequel for a super hero movie. For the haters that complain about the language or scenes just inform yourselves before watching something and just avoid going to a movie like that if you take offense. Giving Deadpool a one star rating is just childish behavior.</fullReview>

Ryan Reynolds is hilarious and the costumes are amazing. This is a little violent and has a fair bit of foul language but that just adds to the comedy of the movie. I found myself laughing throughout the whole movie non stop.The writers deserve amazing credit for this movie and hopefully we get to see a sequel. I'm sure everyone will get a laugh and love the movie. All in all, it is a very comedic movie and what is not to love about it? Ryan Reynolds? The comedy? What not?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not easy to pull Deadpool off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool as a character is not easy to do. Many writers have tried their hand at the Deadpool comics, and for a lot of people, his sense of humor seems to be wacky, random, and of the nonsensical "monkeycheese" variety. I maintain that there is, and always has been, a method to Deadpool's madness. Without it, the character quickly becomes tiresome and annoying. It's the difference between a noisy eight year old and in-jokes shared with friends.Ryan Reynolds nails it. This movie is incredible. It is sharp, weird, and funny in all the right ways. This is the Deadpool I like. Over the top without being too over the top, referential, and not afraid to break the fourth wall -- but with a degree of moderation and tact that doesn't make it feel too wacky. And violent. Deadpool has to be violent.The only complaint I have is that for the first half of the movie, it jumps back and forth a little too much, and there's a stretch where things drag just a bit when the movie threatens to take itself a little too seriously in order to give Deadpool some pathos. It's necessary, I suppose, but it also feels a tiny bit formulaic for my tastes; like the movie HAD to have some kind of romance because it's a movie and movies have to have romance, or something. It's a small complaint, though, and if we're being honest, it doesn't REALLY get in the way. Every other part of this is a movie worth gushing about. Just, gosh, wow. I almost don't even believe this movie exists, because it is so pitch perfect. You should probably watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Reunolds' best yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds is certainly a rising star in Hollywood! Deadpool is certainly proof! Reynolds has been one of my favorite comedians since Blade Trinity; his delivery of lines was superb and his on-screen presence was uncanny, hearkening back to my previous action-comedian, Eddie Murphy, so Reynolds was a welcome addition to the current actors in Hollywood. Deadool is a delightful progression to Reynolds' career and a wonderful departure from his lackluster string of weak movies and lame comedies. Action-comedy is a great fit for this actor. Deadpool's high-octane action is a terrific showcase for the delivery of the character's brilliant one-liners and other comedic elements. The nudity fit the tone of the movie and didn't feel gratuitous This has been addressed, but unfortunately this isn't a kid friendly movie, lots of violence, gore, profanity, and nudity, should appeal to most mature audiences who aren't prudish and or delusional. This movie's not for the casual comic fan, but someone who doesn't mind the grittier side of superheroes!</fullReview>

After the god awful Green Lantern, the unbearable X-Men: Origins, the cringe worthy Blade: Trinity and the unfunny R.I.P.D I had pretty much given up on Ryan Reynolds as a superhero. Lucky for me he was no superhero in this film. The action and the humor fit like two puzzle pieces and the supporting actors are great in each others own way. Best superhero Movie of 2016 so far ( Haven't seen Civil War and Batman V Superman was garbage). I highly recommend buying this movie as soon as you get the chance, You're in for a ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Reynolds portrays Deadpool perfectly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you did not like or enjoy this movie, then it is quite clear that you went to the movie not knowing who Deadpool is, not having researched the character at all, or you did not see any of the advertisements for the movie. Deadpool's character is a "merc with a mouth," which means he is going to curse and say sarcastic things at every turn. It would be like going to see "The Punisher" in theaters and being upset that he maimed people or seeing "Spider-man" and saying it was boring because all he did was shoot webs. The character is who the character is. If you do not like the character, you will not like the movie. My suggestion is to research your superhero characters before seeing the movie so you know what to expect. Ryan Reynolds perfectly portrayed the Deadpool from the comics, video games, and cartoons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Reynolds "gets it"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Golf clap for Ryan Reynolds and the team that brought this film together. For all the wrongs in super hero cinema, Deadpool will give you hope that it will be all right. Of course, then 'they' released X-Men: Apocalypse... Deadpool is not the greatest movie ever made. No super hero movie ever will be and Ryan Reynolds likely did not set out to make the greatest movie ever made. But what he did accomplish with Deadpool is something more important to the future of the genre. He has the credibility to trust his instincts and to make super hero films fans want. He is an authority now and the success of Deadpool will reverberate through Hollywood. This will transcend into other genres as well; such as sci-fi and fantasy (Star Wars, I am staring directly at you right now... don't divert your eyes from me I'm going to make this hella awkward for you right now)Reynolds and company captured everything that makes the Deadpool comic loved and successfully transferred it to the big screen. He even corrected long-time failures like Colossus and was able to make a seemingly absurd and obscure character, Nega Sonic Teenage Warhead (did i get that right?), relevant, relatable, likable and memorable. What's more is he did all this while not diverting from the central story with cloddish origin stories or other blockbuster tropes.I don't write reviews but this film left me so happy after years of disappointment with my favorite properties that I was compelled to publish something to show my gratitude. RR, please executive produce every Marvel film from here on out because you get it.Thank you.P.S. Singer and Abrams can eat a d***.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually watch comedy movies as they most often fail to achieve their purpose, of making me laugh. Deadpool was a stunning combination of stupid but funny jokes, jokes and the occasional bad jokes. Ryan Reynolds seems to play Deadpool as natural as if he'd written the role himself, while also respecting the comic book character's persona to a high degree. Deadpool is one of the best comedy movies I've ever watched if not the best, and I'd also place it in my top overall movies. The reasons why it's considered unsuited for children and R-rated are pretty obvious, but if you're not planning to see a movie with your kids, it's definitely a title to keep in mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to watch this at the movies for my husband's birthday and it was hilarious. The movie theater was full but everyone respected the film and was quiet except when you couldn't help but laugh. I had never really heard of Deadpool before the movie so I can't comment on the movie compared to the comics but I hope there are more movies to come. Ryan Reynolds owned the character and I'm glad he was able to leave the green suit behind. Definitely don't take the kids or watch with your parents. I can't really remember ever being bored and thinking the film was too long or too short so that's also a plus. I would probably buy this and watch when I'm bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This kind of humour in the world of movies was getting kind of rare, but I'm so happy there is a real good comedy around again.This movie is a good mixture of comedy, action and a bit of drama. From start to finish you are entertained with a reasonable story and lots and lots of well-written jokes. The breaking of the fourth wall really does it every time. This might just become the best most liked movie of 2016. Ryan Reynolds did a magnificent job in putting this film on the big screen finally.Besides that, Monica Baccarin is a lovely lady to watch. So when you have some spare time with friends, just watch it and have a laugh. When you're going to the movie for a first date, pick another one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We really enjoyed this one. Great writing, lots of action, excellent comic timing, blowed lots of stuff up real good... Keep this team together and make more I say. RE Ryan Reynolds, I never took him seriously before, and maybe it's because this happens to be the perfect wisecracking witty role to finally showcase properly, so now we have one good memory to erase the sadness of Blade Trinity, RIPD etc. RE writers Rheese and Wernick who also wrote Zombieland screenplay - I really think you have a good team there - keep doing what you're doing, don't let egos, a Yoko or agent split you up. Director Tim Miller comes from an animation background and applies an animator's sense of motion that really added to the pacing and style. Some may say there's too much gratuitous violence and nakedness but, they may be getting used to the sanitized family content of most comic book films. As long as this gets put into the adult category with Tarentino and Frank Miller (Sin City), the rest of us will have a place to party away from the Harper Valley PTA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly I was actually bored through most of it, which is unusual for me. The entire movie was like a collage of meta jokes, which was fun for about five minutes but got old really quickly. There is no substance to the movie; the best thing you can say about the story line is that it exists. The characters are boring and couldn't compensate for the lack of plot. And while I don't normally mind violence and gore, these fighting scenes were not clever or creative in any way and seemed only to try and shock people. A lot of talk about penises and assholes and "wow look at how meta I am!". And it would have been funny if I had been a kid or a teenager or an adult who hasn't seen a lot of movies before. But for me, it was lame and embarrassing. I can't believe it got a higher rating than Kingsman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suspect before becoming a soldier and a mercenary, Wade Wilson must had tried very hard to become a stand up comedian for teenagers. With no success.It is painfully obvious that our hero desperately tries to do stand up comedy during the whole film: while fighting, while working, while having sex, while being tortured, etc etc. He is even talking to invisible people ( I guess he is fantasizing he has an audience, the poor bastard..). Sometimes he does manage to make good jokes. But most of the times his non-stop comedic delirium is falling flat. Soon you wish his mutation will extend to his vocal cords and you will be spared with a few minutes without juvenile jokes about..well everything. In vain. The wanna-be-comedian torture continues till the end.4 stars for the scene where Ajax gags him. I literally cheered!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOT only did I find this movie absolutely hilarious, but the way they made Deadpool pick on X-Men, Ryan Renoalds (himself), and the Green Lantern, JUST made me want to watch it even more !!!! The way they phrase words and emphasizing on certain words and phrases, is just out-standing ! I have watched this movie over 10 times the night I purchased it, and I can not stop laughing !! It is GREAT !! I LOVE IT !! Now, as I was doing research, I did not know until today that Deadpool IS part of the X-Men series ! The original title of this movie is -----&gt; X-Men Orgins: Deadpool, also known as - X-Men: Deadpool. Another part I noticed is, in the beginning, in the black truck, one of the bad guys' head was being rammed into the stereo. Each hit changed the station. JUST for a brief second or two, you will hear Batman's music, which I thought was funny too. There are a bunch of little things like that, that are hidden within the movie that you will hear and see, but you will not realize it's there. That is ANOTHER reason why I loved the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The masked Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) uses the taxi of Dopinder (Karan Soni) to chase a gang commanded by Ajax, a.k.a. Francis Freeman (Ed Skrein). He explains that he is the former Special Forces agent Wade Wilson that worked hunting down bad people in New York. When he meets the prostitute Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin) in the bar of his friend Weasel (T.J. Miller), they immediately fall in love with each other. One year later, he proposes to marry her; however he faints and he learns that he has an incurable cancer. Soon a man offers the cure to Wade and he decides to leave Vanessa to submit to the treatment. Ajax and his assistant Angel Dust (Gina Carano) submit Wade to painful experiments in an underground laboratory. Wade discovers his true name and his true intentions with the experiment, intended to transform the patients in powerful slaves to be sold. Wade is left trapped in a machine for the weekend, but he succeeds to escape. He finds that he is cured from the cancer but with awful scars on the face and body. Further, he has developed healing powers and is super strength. However, he is a monster the decides to leave Vanessa forever and seek out Francis Freeman. Now he has found him. "Deadpool" is a funny, gross and violent anti-superhero film. Deadpool destroys the clichés of the superhero that does not kill and protects the innocents; further he loves a hooker. Ryan Reynolds performs a hilarious hero in love with the Brazilian Morena Baccarin. His concern is not to protect the innocents but to kill the man that destroyed his face and body. The film is a great entertainment for those that like "politically incorrect" movies. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Deadpool"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm aware most will feel a 10/10 is unjustified and that even an 8/10 is too high. People are also very upset this is becoming considered one of the best rated super-hero films of all-time. What they are missing is that this film did exactly what it set out to do and was everything it promised its fans. We had the test footage of this video, we had trailers that revealed just about everything. Those of us that loved it, knew exactly what this film was before filming was finished.This is a film that fans pushed for. This is a film many can say they had a hand in helping become a reality. Fox was terrified to make this film, it barely squeaked through the cracks. Their jaws are now on the floor and are probably ready to listen when it comes to some fresh ideas.If you have ever read a DeadPool comic you know how faithful this was. The things they had wanted to do and planned, weren't in the budget. They cut entire scenes out and had to change others. Seriously, just watch him talk about all the things they had to do just to stay in budget. The bullet count had to be low, the character forgetting his guns in a certain scene, the lack of other x-men, all cut corners. However I think working in these parameters did nothing but help push the creativity.So,this film was perfect in the fact it was enjoyable and it ended up being what was promised.</fullReview>

Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years.After all the 'straight' superhero flicks of which we might have seen too many, this is a fresh breeze and welcome addition to the genre. So if you see one superhero movie this year see Deadpool. If you are sick of or hate superhero movies this is also right up your alley. Very highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think most of us have been expecting this movie. Or at least something like it. A superhero film that is a bit more... I would say adult, but that doesn't quite fit. More willing to cross the line of good taste, a film willing to be gory, immature and full of adult humour, as well as brutal violence.And who better to embody the ideal of bad taste than Deadpool, the fourth wall breaking punkster of Marvel. He's pretty much what would happen if you gave a Looney Tunes character Wolverine's powers and removed the kid filter. And he's awesome because of it!Now, this is not actually Ryan Reynold's first time playing this character, as he also appeared in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but the less said about that particular incident, the better. Suffice to say, they didn't treat the character kindly, and apparently Reynolds has always wanted to return back to the character and give him a movie worthy of his insanity. Well, mission accomplished. Deadpool is exactly the kind of movie it needs to be. It's ugly, hilarious, constantly veering between brutal violence, cringeworthy dark humour and the occasional somber moment, doesn't take itself at all seriously and is actually well-done movie in general terms as well. Especially because they crack jokes at the expense of the relatively cheap budget. Like the fact that they could only afford the licences of two very minor X-Men characters.If you like Deadpool, you're going to love this film. If you have no idea who I'm talking about, do go see the film if you like dark humour or the idea of an R rated superhero film. Because trust me, it earns that rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only ever cared for Blade and the X-Men films as a movie buff. The other rubbish like Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four, Superman, Guardians of the Galaxy and the myriad of Avenger heroes and their own crap films that they keep rehashing every few years are the most boring, generic, "epic" cinema experiences I've ever put up with that weren't aimed entirely at little children such as Ice Age 4 and whatnot.Deadpool was a breath of fresh air. It couldn't have been better. They finally made a superhero movie for people who were kids when these superheroes were big commercial comic book successes. I bought Deadpool comics all throughout the '90s as a teenager and knew exactly what to expect. Ryan Reynolds couldn't be more perfect for the role and Deadpool couldn't be a more perfect character for an adult-oriented hero movie.What bothers me is the amount of 1 out 10 ratings I'm seeing here. Some calling it too foul-mouthed, others calling it too violent, others again, whining about the sex scenes and then others who took their children to see all of this! What, I have to wonder, were you thinking? This movie is rated R and months and months before it was released this was made very, abundantly clear through advertising and Reynolds' own interviews. This movie is rated the same as Reservoir Dogs! The same as Saving Private Ryan, Django Unchained, The Green Mile, Traffic, The Wolf of Wall Street, Seven and Schindler's List! You came into this movie not expecting violence or swearing or sex? You brought your children to watch this movie?!? Why is this getting 1 out of 10, I wonder? The onus, then, is on yourselves. Obviously the fault here is with the common sense of the people buying the tickets and expecting some sort of PG-13 fare. Because as somebody who pays attention to a movie's classification rating I knew exactly what to expect. The movie did not swindle us as movie goers into thinking this was a family film.Once again, I loved this movie, I got all of the references and all of the fourth wall breaks which, no doubt, would have flown over the heads of those who haven't had a keen investment in Deadpool for a long time and would probably take away from a lot of the laughs, so that's to be expected, but I'll just say to anybody reading this review that if a person complains about the violence or the sex or the swearing just disregard their rating of this film just as they disregarded the actual rating of this film. Movies rated R are rated R for a reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Reynolds and the quest for hotness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds is despicable. And while it's quite possible that I hate him out of jealousy, glancing over his filmography (which is primarily composed of egregious nonsense) I can say with a certain degree of confidence that that is likely not the case. Reynolds has never had the opportunity to endear himself to his audience, being consistently the star in projects that cast him in the worst possible light: a straight-up, no holds barred, unapologetic douchebag.That being said, the character of Deadpool is widely known for his zany vulgarity, so perhaps Reynolds was in fact the right choice. A famed douchebag to play a fictional famed douchebag? Sounds right to me.But once again, Reynolds' capacity to entertain is destroyed by a real yawner of a script, that pretends to elevate itself above (or even below) its comic-book predecessors with fourth-wall breaks, awful jokes, and graphic violence. While all this could have been effective in creating a delightfully subversive comic-book film that poked fun at literally everything with gleeful abandon, it eventually devolves into a blatantly self-congratulatory splatterfest that assumes that it has achieved its goal of challenging modern film without doing so itself.Despite Deadpool's unique take on the superhero genre, it all revolves around a formulaic, ridiculous plot populated with unlikeable characters. Ryan Reynolds stars as ex-special forces something-or-other named Wade Wilson, who goes around being a jerk to stalkers. He then finds a woman at a bar, who is equally despicable, and they have great sex for a very, very long time. Then he gets cancer.Jesus Christ. Ex-special forces? The Punisher? No wait. He goes around being a jerk to stalkers. Sounds sorta like...Kick Ass! Wait, now he has cancer?! I'm not sure if Eddie Brock had cancer in the comics, but I think he did. And the sex? Well, that's basically every superhero, isn't it? Sigh. The formula is all too evident. Everything we see in this film, apart from the jokes, we've seen before in other films and comic books. And then, when it couldn't get any worse, it does.His cancer is cured by a not-so-nice guy named Francis, who subjects him to a lot of pain in a slew of equally cringe-worthy scenes that emphasize the writer and the director's lack of regard for the human condition. Oh yes, and the story is narrated by Deadpool himself. Which really sucks, because narrated stories naturally suck.Deadpool eventually gains his superpowers, which turn him into yet another invincible superhero. He says it himself. He can't die. I hate it when films do that, making (anti)heroes that can't die even after being completely wasted, as it suddenly removes any tension or risk factor that had hitherto existed.Subsequently, Deadpool devolves even further into a mess of bullets, blood, and humourless jokes all in the vein of Ryan Reynolds' quest to regain his beauty. Yes, it's as empty and ridiculous as it sounds. It may have even been saved had the jokes been funny in any way. I mean, that was what I wanted from the film. I knew that the plot and characters would likely be a letdown, but heard that the hilarity factor of the film more than made up for it. But I simply didn't laugh. Not once. And I found this unusual. It's not as if I don't appreciate nasty jokes. I laughed until it hurt in Spy, Borat, and The Dictator. Hell, I even laugh at Mike Tyson Mysteries. But this film, despite its obvious intention to leave me laughing, left me completely impassive, if not outright disgusted.This film includes some nice cameos, which I certainly didn't expect (having avoided the trailers out of anticipation), a few well-done action scenes which brim with glorious movement, a cool, popping' soundtrack that I couldn't help but look up, and a neat visual style. But despite this, it's still a very, very poor film that left me exceedingly disappointed.I would recommend Deadpool only for its novelty, although whether such novelty is a step forward or backward is in your hands to determine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Deadpool' desperately wants to be cool and funny but it fails on both counts. The best way to summarise what this film is all about is the following quote - 'Have you ever heard David Beckham speak? It sounds like he mouth-sexed a can of helium.' The film is packed full of these type of jokes and the one I quoted is one of the better (or less cringeworthy) ones. Most aren't funny in the slightest.I would usually write something about the plot but unfortunately there isn't one, so no spoilers here. That's right, a movie with no plot has somehow managed a score of 8.2 on IMDb - higher than some classics. Obviously I've missed a trick here, but 'Deadpool' didn't do anything for me. My score of 3 is only because of some of the action and violence which was mildly entertaining. Otherwise this was a bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Immature, Unremarkable Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewing anything comedy related tends to lead to disgruntled readers and accusative comments. Comedy, as a rule, is not supposed to be exceptional or even good by most accounts. In Roman times, humor stemmed from jokes about genitals and bowel movements just as we laugh at the same today. There's really no such thing as high-brow humor and so I find it disturbing when people mistake my dislike of humorous movies or cartoons or such as the complaints of someone high and mighty about himself. I love a good dick joke as much as the next guy, but humor for me comes from execution, pay-off, and unexpectedness.Deadpool from a humor perspective has very little of that. I chuckled occasionally at Marvel's latest superhero flick, but I never found myself laughing out loud. The opening credits roll making jokes of the producers and director set the tone of the films humor stylings: blatant, crass, and occasionally funny.Deadpool is the tale of a man named Wade who contracts a serious form of cancer. In order to combat it, he accepts a proposal to become a superhero and winds up instead in a miserable situation, tortured by a mutant named Ajax (Francis). It's a revenge/love plot that was a surprisingly perfect fit for the Valentine release.Deadpool tells its story in a segmented and awkward way, throwing us into the action immediately, cutting back to the past, then cutting forward again, then back again. It kind of works at first but the third flashback is long, boring, and ultimately kills the middle of the film. This was the point I was struggling to stay awake.I don't mind plot in a movie contrary to what I'm saying, but the origin story of Deadpool is nothing spectacular and in a film that relishes violence with an almost sexual passion, I felt that the pacing was poor and killed the entire experience. After you get past the flashbacks and get to the current action, you'll probably be too bored to care any further what happens.And for me, even trying to stay attentive of the movie through the final act, I was still bored. The villains were boring, Deadpool's hero companions were dull, and the final fight was not epic or well-directed or choreographed?nothing stood out to me. And despite a gory, violent opening, the ending seemed relatively tame.And that's where Deadpool fails for me. It's an R-rated movie that feels like it doesn't particularly have to be. The cursing, the gore, and the sex are all self-indulgent, the entire movie a middle finger to traditional superhero movies. And I respect that and went into the film expecting an enticingly adult-slanted Marvel movie. But what I got felt more like something a middle schooler would write. The cursing was middle-school level, ,many of the jokes were juvenile (there were some decent mature jokes in there too)?it just didn't feel organic, much of it felt forced. And as I looked around the theater at the kids watching, their parents irresponsible enough to allow eight and nine year old's entrance, I realized that maybe this WAS meant to be "Babies First R-Rated Film".This movie is doing exceptionally well at the box office and I'm guessing this mature action/comedy is being talked about in many a schoolyard. Deadpool is a technically poor movie with bad pacing, a lackluster set of characters, and humor that just wasn't my style relying too much on obscene one-liners than jokes with actual buildup and payoff. But, I guess, it's an okay film and probably one Marvel fans and Deadpool fans especially will enjoy. But aside from a good opening action sequence and a couple chuckle-worthy jokes here and there, Deadpool was a dud for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie a pathetic attempt at making a super hero movie with a twist of spoof, but it fails at both. The supposed hilarious moments in the fights including a scene where Ryan gets shot in the butt were repulsive rather than being funny. The movie does not have a plot to begin with and the director thinks that showing some violence, the blood and gore can fill for the gaps in the story line. The movie also fails in portraying the protagonist as a bad guy who is in some ways good but takes on enemies who are worse. This movie was like watching the X-Men origins:Wolverine, Breaking Bad, John Wick and Kill Bill mashed up in 90 minutes and I wasted 90 minutes on a Saturday watching this stupid movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated (mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my money, Deadpool is nowhere near as funny as its star rating would have you believe. The jokes are repetitive, crass and boring. On three separate occasions a character is described as looking like 'thing A had sex with thing B'. The movie is only two hours long, you'd think a bit more variety in joke insults would be possible. Sadly the writers seem to lack imagination and instead repeatedly fall back on reminding us how much Deadpool likes having sex, or breaking the fourth wall and making some reference to the film's budget.Deadpool as a character is totally unlikeable. He's a completely self-absorbed narcissist, whose main dilemma in the film is that he's not as attractive as Ryan Reynolds anymore. The plot is virtually non-existent. Some vague reference is made near the start to the fact that the bad guys are creating mutants/super-humans and selling them as weapons, but it's never really followed up on. The main villain is utterly two-dimensional, we don't really know anything about him except that he is really evil and has a grudge against Deadpool for some reason that seems to largely be down to Deadpool's 'hilarious' smart-assery. The final action set-piece at the end of the film is totally boring, and in this day and age it takes more than some whizzy CGI to make for an interesting film sequence. There's a bit of fighting, a building/thing falls over and there you have it, the film ends.All in all the film is well made, and looks nice. The actors put in good performances. I just found it to be totally boring, not nearly as clever or funny as it acts like it is, and to be almost entirely without any sort of interesting story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is an unfunny drudgery that brings nothing new to the table</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard it again and again over the last few weeks, people keep saying that Deadpool brings something new to the superhero genre. The problem with this claim is that no one seems to be able to tell me what it is that is so revolutionary about this flick. Is it the dick jokes? The fisting jokes? The prom sex jokes? The face sitting jokes? So revolutionary. I suppose it's necessary to say that I am no prude, and that I take no issue with those types of jokes, other than the fact that they just didn't make me laugh. The humor in this movie just reeked of desperate immaturity. The jokes seemed aimed at the middle-school-boy-who-lurks-on-Reddit-crowd, which is, thankfully, a frame of mind that I have long since moved past. The "humor" often felt like it was trying too hard, as if it was screaming at the top of its lungs, "LAUGH AT ME! I'M SO HILARIOUS!" And if the humor doesn't work for you, which it did with many people at my screening for some reason, then there is really very little for you there. The beginning credits of the film call the writers the "real heroes" of the film, an assertion that I must wholeheartedly disagree with. The movie is remarkably light on plot and what is there has been painfully rehashed from every superhero origin story ever. The non-Deadpool characters are all paper thin, none of them are given sufficient arcs to make them interesting. Even Deadpool himself is not entirely interesting. He begins the movie the same way he ends, smarmy as ever, violent as ever, wanting the same things he did 1 hr and 48 mins ago. The saddest part of all of this is that because this movie made so much money, there will be a sequel, as well as many worse rip-offs of it that are even more cringeworthy and forced.</fullReview>

They are so thrilled with the "R" rating that they sound like kids trying out swear words in the school yard at recess. The sex is terrible. Not erotic at all, what with all that smirking. The plot is, um, missing. The acting is what you would expect when you make a movie using 100% green screen/CGI. And here's a secret, and a major spoiler: oxygen does not explode. Oxygen does not even burn. Woah! Try to wrap your head around that while you munch another hash brownie. It's like, wow, man, does water float? If you light a match in 100% oxygen, the match will burn quickly and brightly until the wood (ie the FUEL) is exhausted, and then the fire will go out. No fuel, no burn.

Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is the perfect fit. Just when you think he could not get any more clever with his words, he would say the most off the wall comments possible.The fighting sequences in this were incredibly jaw dropping! Deadpool really is one of the most innovative fighters I have seen. His techniques are totally unorthodox and cannot be matched nor mimicked by any other who dares.The only thing that was not satisfying is the length of the movie. It was much shorter than expected. The backstory to Wade Wilson before becoming Deadpool is short lived. Despite that, it still was an excellent movie, and I cannot wait for more!</fullReview>

I wonder, how is it possible that Deadpool got such a high rating on IMDb. Even adolescent kids in the movie were bored after 20 minutes of pseudo-action without any sense. The plot seems to have been written by unimaginative conservative men, who wanted to make business by trying to give the main character an anarchic behavior. Didn't work out. Deadpool is a simple conservative guy, who is not interesting at all. Not what he is doing, not what he is suffering, not what he is loving. An empty character. Nobody will feel for him or with him. Out of the cinema, I cannot even remember why he was part of that - ergh? - movie.</fullReview>

Even during sex he is cracking lame jokes. Cant get any more ridiculous than that ! As for the storyline , couldn't they add a little more detail.

And that is a major success on its own.Personally, I learnt and loved this character from the awesome mini series DEADPOOL: MERC WITH A MOUTH, that is still the best DP read yet, and his best characteristics is: awesome nerdy/pop culture puns, breaking the 4th wall with the reader (in a good way, unlike Millar's Wanted) awesome suicidal fights and of course EPIC SCENES. And this movie DELIVERS EVERYTHING. So, what not to love?The only flaw I could find, is the omega list villains. The good guys are OK, but the villains not. But honestly, we have seen a-list superhero blockbusterish movies where the villains are unknown (eg Avengers' Chitauri) and, if you would know, the 90% of DP stories have unknown villains so that he could kill them with no consequences to the Marvel universe. SO THIS IS Faithful TO THE CHARACTER TOO!Ryan Reynolds also nailed it, giving all his love to his character and be a real DP!In a nutshell, DP is one of the BEST comic adaptation yet, brings to the audience a schizophrenic character that we love and I personally hope that he will cameo at the next X-Men movies!DP IS GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU AND HE DELIVERED.EPIC AWESOMENESS / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I've personally never been a Deadpool fan I went into this movie with fairly high hopes. I love the X-Men franchise, enjoy Ryan Reynolds, and love action comedies. This movie however fell flat on all levels. After constantly hearing about the "game changing, fantastic, hilarious" Deadpool I was excited to see it. After all I did enjoy Reynolds take on the Merc with a Mouth in the horrendous X-Men: Origins Wolverine. I will start with a couple pros, the flashback, proved interesting and new dynamic for a comic book movie, the homage after credits scene, TJ Miller, a couple jokes. Literally everything else is a con and would take far to long to get into then I want to spend on this. So instead I would like to recommend that anyone looking for a comic book comedy go watch Guardians of the Galaxy!!! This movie and its fanboys desperately wishes it was GOTG. If you would like a R rated action comedy please check out Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. I feel like this movie was written attempting to be a mixture of both those and failed. Don't trust the fanboys, don't believe the hype.</fullReview>

And one hilarious scene in particular that will make you laugh so much, that you shouldn't eat anything while you're watching it.My final thoughts: In general, I like every Marvel film, so as always I think it's superb.

		<fullReview>Deadpool (2016) Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Ed Skrein, Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller, and Gina Carano Director: Tim MillerSynopsis: Ryan Reynolds stars as red suited comic book antihero Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool. After becoming horribly disfigured, Deadpool plows his way through all manner of criminals in an attempt to reach the villain responsible for his condition, Ajax (Ed Skrein), and have it reversed to return to his beloved.Bang! Pow! Zoom! From paper to film, comics have come a long way. In the cinematic universe, comic based movies have become one of the biggest genres of movies of the current decade. Marvel Comics gained popularity through the Spider-Man and X-Men movies in the early 2000s but shot to the forefront of pop culture with the release of the film Iron-Man. Since then the Avenger initiative have release several successful movies but Marvel had always shied away from rated R films of superheroes, as these had been marginally unsuccessful in the past, such as with The Punisher or Spawn. Eventually there was enough feedback, fan request and push to release a film that would come to reshape the face of rated R comic movies about the near indestructible "Merc with the Mouth" Deadpool.Deadpool has quickly risen to be one of the most profitable and amazing movies of the year. Directed by Tim Miller, who made his debut with this film, the movie Deadpool brings to life the Stan Lee comic of the same name. Actor Ryan Reynolds's portrayal of the biggest Anti-hero of the Marvel universe is single-handedly the best and most accurate rendition of a comic characters since Hugh Jackman's the Wolverine. From his sense of humor to his iconic 4th wall breaks and murderous rampages, Reynolds perfectly portrays the "Merc with the Mouth" from start to finish in this big screen hit.After discovering he had terminal stage four cancer, Wade Wilson tries to find any way to survive so he can stay with his new fiancée Vanessa Carlysle. In the process he is approached by a mysterious man about a program to make him a super hero. Though he initially scoffs him off he soon changes his mind, accepts the offer and is taken away to the private lab in which he develops his powers and malformations due to the malicious makings of the movie's main villain, Ajax (or Francis as Wade calls him, much to his frustration). After escaping Wade spends several years of his life trying to track Ajax and rectify the injustices done to him and get back with the Vanessa. With the assistance of the X-Men Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (NTW) he goes about in a deadly and explosive finish in true comic hero style.This low budget film goes out of its way to be true to the comic from the constant spew of foul mouthed humor to the blood bath of corpses that tend to be left in Deadpool's wake. The CGI of the costumed hero with a heart of gold and deadly skills showed just how action packed the film should be even and that there could be humor even in violence. With a script filled with dark and low brow humor this definitely isn't one you would watch to educate yourself but there was a lot to laugh at. Overall the movie was true to its romantic release date of Feburary 12, Valentine's Day weekend, in that the guy goes through great lengths and personal growth to get the girl.Overall, I found there to be very few shortcomings in this comic film of love and war. From the violence to the romance with a comedic center, the film well encapsulates the core of the comics and is a film that should be seen by all most all adults who can find humor in the dark. With a rating of 9/10 I say the movie is definitely one you will want to watch again and again, it won't be regretted.</fullReview>

You'll also find a lot of raunchiness, with constant f-words, sex references, and more. But they earn their place, making me laugh and being creative with their humor. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it has a good moral of accepting people for what they are inside, like Vanessa does to Wade.

		<fullReview>Rating: 8.5, Great Movie *After so many fantastic X-Men movies and two disappointing Wolverines, Deadpool has finally been given his very own movie. Director Tim Miller's very first movie is MARVELlous and with the talented actor Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool pleases expectations and lives up to its R - rating. If there is one movie I recommend to watch on a Valentines Day it would be your friendly neighborhood Deadpool!* Characters - Deadpool: I can guarantee that Deadpool is Ryan Reynolds alter ego, he was born to play Deadpool unlike his failure in Green Lantern (5.7) and Blade Trinity (6.5). Deadpool is a hilarious, violent yet lovable character who can break the fourth wall with ease. - Ajax and Angel: Although these two mutants are physically dangerous and cunning they try to hard to be menacing for a Deadpool movie and are considered rather weak motivated villains. - X-Men: The X-Men Colossus and his 'trainee' are great side characters whose positive motives provide a great reference to the X-Men universe and some cute humour along the journey. -Other Characters: Vanessa, purely sexy, Dopinder purely funny and Weasel was a pure cheesy sidekick.*The story line is Deadpool is not original, it almost like every super hero movie, male hero, damsel in distress a walk to a strip club... It did have a more violent twist then other heroes in movies, another difference was there was little themes or motives other than pure love and sex. But when a movie is directed with a slick style of humour, action and music, it can carry its way from pointless to awesome. *Of all MARVEL Movies this is the most unique we will ever have and can hopefully inspire other violent heroes such as the Punisher and hopefully this years Suicide Squad, to become successful R - rated super heroes. Deadpool is movie produced for enjoyment, unlike Batman V Superman, Dawn Of Justice. Whether Deadpool is a hero or villain his movie is purely super!Once Again, Please Check Out My Lists And Ratings At riyork2! I hope this review was a valuable source</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, funny love story of a super hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love: The love scenes in the movie were really beautiful. Especially, at the end where the movie puts forward the message: "Love is more than just looks."Action: The action scenes in the movie make you go "Woah!". Peppered with delicate humor and wonderful screenplay, the action scenes were both super-hero-istic and also very close to reality.The direction was bang-on, as well as the wonderful. Especially, directing a fight which is less of a superhero kind, and more of a realistic kind is very difficult, and the director pulled it off really good.Overall, a super awesome movie from the X-men cinematic universe. Must watch for Xmen, action and humor fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YaY Deadpool! I waited so long for you! Was I a little disappointed because the budget was too small for you...? Yes, a little. Was I a little underwhelmed because I anticipated you for EVER and day... Well, yeah, ...but it's not your fault. Fox has problems budgeting movies. And Ryan Reynolds still played you &amp; he was still everything I hoped he would be. So, here's to more $$$ for a GIANT "Empire Effect" in Round 2!Ryan Reynolds is AWESOME as Deadpool &amp; I am a late bloomer having only gotten into Deadpool comics in 2010. Sure, I was aware of the Wolverine fiasco, but this crazy ass comic book character come to life was cast just right! Deadpool 2 can only be more money, less problems, as Reynolds was born to play Wade Wilson!8 of 10 stars (it could have been an easy 10 of 10) for a tiny budget and that thing that Fox does to X-Men movies in general. It's kind of like holding a Fabergé egg and then dropping it. It's still amazingly beautiful, it just has a scuff on it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Comic Book/Superhero Flick!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein and T.J. Miller star in this 2016 action-comedy based on the Marvel Comics. Reynolds (Green Lantern) plays Wade Wilson, a wise-cracking, ex-special forces soldier who learns he has terminal cancer. Soon, he becomes a mutant test subject of ex-soldier/criminal, Ajax (Skrein) undergoing pain and torture which leaves him deformed, but with healing abilities. Wade becomes masked anti-hero, Deadpool who is determined to find him and get revenge. Baccarin (Gotham) plays Wade's love-interest, Vanessa, Miller plays Wade's pal, Wiesel and creator, Stan Lee makes an amusing cameo as usual. This is a good comic book/superhero flick that pokes fun and pays tribute to recent ones like "X-Men" and "Spider-Man." Reynolds is great in it, he &amp; Baccarin have good chemistry and there's some neat action/fight sequences. I recommend this, especially for comic book fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A former special service agent gets accelerated healing powers after a experiment gone "not exactly as planned". He then creates the free spirited superhero that accentuates his own view of right and wrong, a vigilante of sorts. Deadpool is that "take the day at it comes" kind of guy, that you want to have as your best friend. Even thou he can be utterly irritable just because he lives so unhampered. A fun, romantic, classical superhero film with a twist ( if the film were a drink, this would be what you read on the menu ). Among all the superhero movies we have seen over the years, this one leaves you with the sought after "feelgood" so many films claims to give you but fails.Movies are made with love, love them back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having marvel forced down our throats for two decades I didn't even want to watch this latest installment. I thought Ryan Reynolds would continuously annoy me throughout the whole film, and that it would just be another mashup from the marvel universe, with the possibility of a Wolverine cameo.Boy was I wrong. It's stupid, it's dumb and it's annoying, yes, but overall very entertaining. Being stupid was a good thing, this is the first marvel movie that didn't take itself so seriously. There is a lot of fun in this movie, adult fun, this movie is definitely rated R, but again, this is good. Marvel fan's aged 20+ probably heavily outnumber the teens now.All in all, highly recommended. Again though, this movie is definitely rated R, and isn't serious at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really no what to expect when I put this on. I'm not a comic book fan, but I heard from friends that this movie was outstanding. Indeed it was. Ryan Reynolds put on one of the best performances of his career. His wiseguy remarks and out of the box insults (shit- speckled Muppet fart) made the movie enjoyable. This movie was pretty hilarious in my opinion. Also, it was probably one of most well written films I've ever watched. TJ Miller also put together a great performance as Weasel. This movie was a little bit of everything. An action film, a comedy, and a love story. The casting was also outstanding. Also, is it safe to say Ed Skrien was probably one of the most unlikable villains in cinematic history? He's up there, but not quite. All in all a great movie and I highly recommend you watch it10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming None Too Soon, to Give Pause and Relief to the Repetitive Releases of Franchise after Franchise of Comic-Book Movies, "Deadpool" Rhetorically asks the Question, "Have we jumped the shark yet?"Someone Said that when something becomes Self-Parody the Original Idea has Run its Course. But Comic-Books have a Certain Resilience to what is "Normal". There hasn't been anything quite like the "Deadpool" Movie. Although "Kick-Ass" (2010) might be Sighted as a Cousin of Sorts. Ryan Reynolds Stars and had a hand in Producing and Bringing the Movie to Audiences and was Determined to Get it Right. Success!!!Audiences and Critics Love the Film to Varying Degrees but No One can Deny that this is a "Balls to the Wall" attempt at Supercharging the Super-Hero Movie.It's Completely Nutzoid, Irreverent, Reverent, Sharply Written and Directed, makes Onslaughts of its Own Wallowing in Excessive Everything, and is the Most Fun that Fanboys have had at the Movies, maybe, Ever. Comic-Books have always had an Ability to Hold-the-Hand of the Reader as He/She Holds it in Their Hands and makes You Part of the Club, an Insider as You Enter that Nether World of Outrageousness. You're In with the In Crowd, You're In on the Jokes, You're Part of the Action.That's "Deadpool" in a Nutshell...Oops left it Wide Open for Wade with that one.Note...Thank the Comic-Book Gods for the "R" Rating. There's no wimp-out with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He is a hero by pure accident</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A marvel of a Marvel anti hero or maybe superhero, or perhaps simply a hero brought up in the man by the right girl. Just let him be the hero he wants to be since anyway we know from the start that he will get the girl he loves and that he will defeat his main enemy, even kill him if necessary because she will forget his looks and only hear his heart.Romantic the way Hollywood likes it. Romantic and sexy, you could even say obsessed and obsessively obsessed with his flesh at that. It could have been an erotic film if he had not decided one day to live his life and get on the way where he met the worst possible people and first of all that demon Francis. I thought Francis was a Saint, but after all nothing proper in a proper name that is not common in a way or other. And common he is that Francis.A good séance of torturing to heal a cancer that is un-healable and the whole story ends on the other side of the divide between reason and insanity. His cancer is healed for sure, but he lost his good looks and he went through a mutation that made him immortal, not exactly in fact but unable to be killed, unable to die and the result is quasi- immortality. For someone who just wanted a love affair with his girlfriend, the cancer sauce and the hot chili peppers of a treatment made the future quite different.He will get his vengeance and he will recuperate his girl friend back but in the mean time half the city will have been destroyed, dozens of bad guys will have been killed or maimed, what was a disastrous building site will become a pitiful field of ruins. But our Deadpool will have his girlfriend and his love story, slightly more than a simple love affair, after all.If you have a hormonal teenager in you, that's the film for you. If you have a liking for special effects, that's the film for you. If you like happy endings, that's the film for you. Just let the merry-go-round of the If clauses continue its circular route to the end of time. But don't come and tell me I did not warn you: it is not an intellectual and social minded exploration of human life and society. So have a good trip on the other side of the looking glass.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't picture Ryan Reynolds playing this character before I saw the movie but once there I thought he was fantastic. It is not by any means your usual Superhero movie but surprised and delighted me from the very start. Hit the spot for me all round. Definitely not for children it is very dark and violent in some parts but funny in others. I could easily see the movie again and maybe pick up on some parts I missed, it is one of those types of movies you can watch several times in my opinion. If you love a bit of carnage, action and fighting then go see this movie. My advice go in with an open mind. If you love comic book characters with a twist then this movie is for you. It is extremely entertaining and am hoping there will be a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds demeanor is perfect for this role. The movie is an excellent blend of action, humor, and excitement! It catches you from the start and holds your attention throughout. The special effects are great. The flow of the movie jumps around a bit but is done properly and conforms to the story. References to the X Men may suggest a possible merge of characters from this movie in the future. I think that would be an amazing addition to the X Men genre as it would bring the Deadpool humor into that series. However that would also have possible effect on the ratings, or they would have to tone down the Deadpool character in the movie or at least limit his appearances to avoid the crudeness and violence that would give it the "R" rating... As the warnings have stated... this is not for children!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Mockumentary style of the Merc with the Mouth: Killed it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, it was an origin story - again. I don't know how many more super hero movies - Especially origin stories - I can take.But this one killed it, and for a couple different reasons: First of all, it was fun, funny, sexy, and almost gratuitously violent (hey, I'm a North American movie watcher, I like those as much as the next guy.) I found their approach to sexuality hilarious - one nice big montage, get all that super steamy sex out of the way, so that Boom we can go back to the plot. The violence was great - I thought they could have done more to establish the fact that Wade Wilson was a badass apex-fighter Pre healing factor, or shown some training montages after his powers, or Something to justify his triple-sow-cow aerial-marksmen maneuvers (lol) and I thought the fight between him and Francis at the end would have been more realistic if Francis (who had enhanced reflexes) took less hits, while Wade (with normal, albeit "Peak" reflexes) just kept taking hit after hit but wearing Francis down gradually. Aside from that though, Epic fighting and I loved it.But finally, I think part of the reason it was a success was the Mockumentary style - like The Office - of Wade constantly breaking the fourth wall (like in the comic book). It was hilarious, and added new levels of humour: it also allowed the character to comment ironically on himself and his situation, and connect with the audience in a new way through that. The lines themselves were funny too, and the delivery excellent, but the 'Mockumentary' fourth wall style turned out to be super conducive to getting viewers to connect with the character (which is particularly important given his anti hero status - we forgive Wade for a lot because of his brief asides to us.) Excellent flick, highly entertaining. One of my favourite lines was when Wade is talking about being good looking, and asks "Do you think Ryan Reynolds got by on his 'acting method'?" I thought that was hilarious - and then watched as the same Ryan gave an excellent performance while looking like a diseased avocado. Well done ol' boy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potential Spoilers : Arguing with people who gave it 1 star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm only writing this review to argue with those who gave it 1 star. What the f*** is wrong with you. Sure it wasn't the best movie ever made but it deserved at least a 6. And the reasons you gave were not all valid like :1. Deadpool thinks he's a stand up comedian even though "his jokes are not funny" - That's who he is, if he didn't spit out some lame and pointless jokes every ones in a while than he wouldn't have been a good Deadpool now would he.2. The villains' intentions are not clear : Yes they are, as Francis clearly states that they were going to give Wade super Xmen powers, and create the deadpool version from Wolverine origins, so brainwash and use him however they want to.3. Women Worship bs - Of coarse the chick had to save the day. The movie was released on Valentines day and a ton of girlfriends were forced to watch the movie at the theaters (or secretly wanted anyway because of Ryan Reynolds). 4. For whoever said that deadpool isn't funny because it's not quotable, You're gonna die... in 5 minutes :P(I only used an arrogant tone + swear words because it's a deadpool review. I actually respect your opinions and all, so I'd like to apologize about that)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vile, offensive and insane with no redeeming social value at all. In other words; IT WAS AWESOME!!!!! Deadpool is what happens when you take the usual superhero movie, mix it with an antihero drama and then decide to make it an action comedy. The movie is super meta with vile language and adult situations so this is not for the littles. This is one of Ryan Reynolds better movies but that isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. This is less a superhero movie and more a revenge fantasy that becomes a twisted love story somewhere along the way. Not for the faint of heart, anyone with a low tolerance for vulgarity or for anyone who takes superhero movies seriously. This is fun and vulgar and funny vulgar but it doesn't pretend to be anything else</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie, unless you hate the style of character and a simple story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I took a look at the reviews and I found something. Most of the low ratings are complaining about Deadpool talking too much, the lack of using the budget to put more X-Men in the film, and the clichéd and predictable plot. Well, I have one thing to say to all of those people: read a Deadpool comic. His character is supposed to be talking all the time, making fourth wall jokes, and overall, being as raunchy and inappropriate as he can. That's his character, and it was pulled off perfectly. The plot was simple, but that was the point. It wasn't supposed to be this deep, thought-provoking movie. This was supposed to be a fun rendition of the Merc with a Mouth. And with the action in this film, it was a great one. This movie was a fun ride with plenty of jokes, and a few somber moments sprinkled in there. But if you don't like raunchy humor at all, if you're not a fan of the main character not believing there even is a fourth wall, if you don't like the way the character is supposed to be or a simple and fun movie, then this isn't for you. Otherwise, buy this movie, because you will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You're probably thinking, "my boyfriend said this was a superhero movie but that guy in the red suit just turned that other guy into a f*cking kebab!" Well, I may be super. But I'm no hero.Despite the feeling of satiety when it comes to superhero movies, I still had to see this new hero from the Marvel stable. Now, you didn't need much to persuade me to watch it. Certainly not after I saw the revealed trailer last year. Immediately I was convinced that this could become a mega blockbuster. It was so brilliant and witty. Trust me, I was sick and tired of the world of The Avengers, X-Men and Super/Spiderman. Besides "Guardians of the Galaxy" and "Ant-Man", most superhero movies were just a copy from the previous episodes. Another story-line but with the same principle. "Guardians of the Galaxy", "Ant-Man" and "Deadpool" are an exception to that rule. A refreshing breeze through the superheroes universe.Right from the opening credits you know what to expect. A mixture of bluntly, spectacular action and sharp, unabashed humor. "Deadpool" is "some douche-bag's film" and as protagonist "God's perfect idiot" with "a hot chick" to take revenge on "a British villain" with the help of "a moody teen" and "a CGI character". Produced by "asshats", written by "the real heroes here" and directed by "an overpaid tool". You can read this during the opening shot with the camera zooming out in slow motion during a devastating car-crash. Maybe it's not high-level humor, but it's an indication that you shouldn't take it all seriously. A crossfire of sarcastic, sexual and provocative one-liners throughout the whole film. Deadpool is an outsider at all levels who uses both self-deprecating and offensive text lines. The humor is sometimes as explicit as the violence used in the movie. Graphic violence with well thought sarcasm is exactly the combination I love the most.Ryan Reynolds could drop his acting talent, since he wears the Deadpool mask practically the entire movie. I have no doubts about his abilities as an actor. Certainly not after seeing him in "Mississippi Grind" and "Woman in Gold". The mediocre movies in which he turned up ("RIPD", "Safe House" and "Green Lantern") were from a significantly lower level. But this was certainly not due to Reynolds, but rather because of a measly movie script. In "Deadpool" physical stamina, agility and speaking skills are more important than acting skills. His greatest merit is his perseverance to get this Deadpool project realized, despite the resistance of the Marvel despots. After a cameo in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine", his obstinacy and the enthusiasm of the Deadpool-supporters made sure this film was realized. Thank God for that!I include this highly entertaining and over-the-top movie in the list of most successful movies of the year. For all I care they can think up a few sequels, even though I thoroughly hate sequels. As long as the concept stays intact and both humor and action are of an equivalent level. "Deadpool" fascinated me so much, that even the presence of Gina Carano didn't bother me. Ed Skrein showed again that he's cut out for a role as crazy villain and that participating in a monstrosity as "The transporter refueled" was a misjudgment. One thing is clear though. Haven't you seen this flick? Put on a red latex suit, place yourself in front of a widescreen television and have fun with this unpretentious, anti-hero.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly, I loved it!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided this movie when it was in the theaters, but recently I was on a long haul flight and watched this movie. I thought I would probably give up on it after 30 minutes and move on to another selection! This isn't the sort of movie I would normally watch but I'm so glad that I did. Ryan Reynolds played his part beautifully - he's good in comedy, I love his dry sense of humor!! The special effects were spectacular, and there was a reasonable story-line to follow. I was enthralled from start to finish. One minor criticism - the overuse of bad language - had it been used less it would have been more effective and have more impact.If you're like me and avoid all kind of superhero movies, give this one a go. It really is better than you probably imagine. The consistent foul language is a bit of turn off, but apart from that, it's an enjoyable spoof and send up of this genre. I have no hesitation recommending this movie.</fullReview>

The movie is fun and enjoyable.With it's R rating this movie doesn't shy away with sex and blood.The movie cuts it's budget fearing of a flop but instead it was a success.The main douchebag Deadpool is well portrayed and true to it's comic counter part with 4th wall breaking and always cracking jokes.The other one were also great they were funny and has some comic relief.The villain is okay but not that great.the plot is much more pf a revenge plot was cliché but because of deadpool's awareness and his offensive jokes are just plain funny .Because Ryan Reynolds wants to do the character justice,it really works.the film is a fresh breathe of air of the superhero genre cause superheroes this days are the same but Deadpool gave us some laughs and new things to the table .The film covers it's flaws and shows its potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am writing a review for most likely, one of the best movies of all time, Deadpool. First I would like to discuss the plot of this movie. The plot of this movie is a mercenary who meets a beautiful women falls in love, leaves the business of killing people and right when everything is going well he gets news that he has cancer that will more than likely kill him. So as he is sitting in the bar having a couple drinks contemplating his situation he gets offered a way of getting his cancer cured but in exchange he becomes a test subject that will make him appear as a freak but have powers of a mutant. After he gets free after he puts the facility on fire he search down for the man who tortured him for months and at the end he ends up finding him but only at the cost of his wife being kidnapped. There does end up being a happy ending and Deadpool considers joining the X- Men. Now although the ending is no different from most super hero endings I still was extremely connected to the plot and I don't even know why. The humor aspect of it was also very good the whole time I was watching the movie I was literally dying of laughter. This is why I gave this movie a 9/10 and if the director is seeing this keep up the good work.</fullReview>

I am impressed 8 minutes - the action is extremely absorbing to say the least 9 minutes - a definition of how comic book film should feel like39 minutes - it really makes me laugh, and it is not from despair 44 minutes - I freaking love it... Now, I wonder if it is my number 1 superhero!? I love the back story as well 53 minutes - so far, I understand exactly why the film received such high rating, it simply deservers it 58 minutes - so he got the best gift he could ever have and he is still not happy because of the look!? RETARDED 1h 20 minutes - I love the freshness in it and the humour is really goody good~! 1h 28 minutes - the action is good and when it's gone the humour still keeps you entertained at all time 1h 38 minutes - lol, it really effortlessly makes you laugh 1h 41 minutes - and even the end credits are worth watching as well Totally worth every minute~!!*make sure you watch a short scene after the end-credits tgchan's rating: 7.5 /10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Bit as Vile, Profane and Gratuitous as it Needed to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just the kind of fresh blood this genre needed. Superhero films (and modern pop culture at large, really) have been ripe for satire for some time now, and Deadpool is a great vehicle for bringing that about without feeling disingenuous or trashing the original character along the way. The first hour is basically one long dose of fan service, sharp and egregious with both wit and weaponry. The seams show through in a lot of the CGI, but that just plays into the act and, in a way, adds to the film's clunky, DIY charm. Ryan Reynolds is really what makes the whole thing work, both on-screen and off, as he occupies the character with uncanny zeal and was instrumental in bringing the mercenary back from Xavier's junkyard. We stop short of the unhinged, deranged depths of disconnected insanity that typify Deadpool's comic book persona, and the closing act / happy ending feels force-fed, but that seems like a small price to pay. Otherwise, it's effective at becoming what it set out to be: a chaotic, gratuitous, shoot-from-the-hip misadventure that blows stuff up, decapitates bad guys and takes every opportunity to squeeze in a literal wink and nod at the viewing audience. I had a ball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reviews are all false.. does not deserve a rating of more than 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the movie is a complete waste of time. It should be totally avoided. The rating of more than 8 is completely weird. It does not deserve a rating of more than 2. That too because of some 10-15 minute of violent action scenes and that's it. Watching this movie is like watching a failed experiment of the producer/director of mixing kick-ass and x-men. Deadpool is failed experiment of borrowing pool of old super heroes but the movie is plain dead to watch to say the least. Starting movie is somewhat good for say 15 minutes and after it is X-men in kick ass suit and very boring and slow. Save your time and avoid this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humor, like most things, is a matter of taste.Several good friends of mine with generally similar senses of humor to mine love the movie Tommy Boy. I hated Tommy Boy. Go figure. Different strokes. So I'm never surprised at 'bipolar' reviews for a film.That said, OH. MY. GOD., I LOVED this movie. LOL funny. As in, I was literally laughing out loud throughout the movie. I've never seen Ryan Reynolds in this type of role, but he nailed it. He channeled his inner Will Ferrell and kept me in stitches. The humor, the sarcasm, the irony, the comic timing, the inside jokes, the chemistry among the key characters, it was all just nearly perfect. I don't give a lot of "9" ratings, especially for comedies -- I've rated ~470 movies, with 29 of those earning 9 or 10, and of those, only 1-2 romcoms -- but this flick earned it from me. Rarely do I buy the DVD of a movie just after watching it on demand. But I immediately ordered the DVD because I know I will watch this multiple times with different friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's RARE when a comic book character (especially a marvel one)is captured in such raw and punctuated beauty that it makes you pause at the perfect homage of modern actors and score old persona. The glib tongue and cheek repartee of Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin is priceless. The story line is perfect and I really am glad they didn't "kid it up" and turn it into an impotent farce. As in all super hero movies they open with French opening aka they throw you into the action. Yet the director does it in a very unique way. The moving camera in a still frame shot of a yet to happen action scene is both hilarious and brilliant. Lots of little Easter eggs as the scene unfolds.This movie was the epitome of wit and slap stick. I literally fell out of my chair LMFOing all over the place. Reynolds delivers his jokes so effortlessly and so fast you really don't catch them all until about the 3rd watch. Definitely adding this one to my favorite movie collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly fun flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.If you are tired of all Marvel Capt. America type of superhero flicks, "Deadpool" (2016) offers probably the best antidote imaginable. The movie itself is one very fun ride, which (finally!) doesn't take itself to seriously, and mocks everything and everyone - and does this truly funny. It's is rated R but it is not gore fest, back in the 80's and 90's R rated movies were much, much bloodier.Overall, "Deadpool" is a one highly enjoyable ride. At running time 1 h 40 min it runs smoothly and almost every scene has something more interesting to offer then your average one in a year Marvel movie flick. Thank god this one wasn't made by them, because we wouldn't have this bold and highly unpredictable (in the way it flows) picture. And while the true Marvel fans could be left disappointed that it doesn't play by their fan boys rules, everyone else will be highly entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a silly movie but I love it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can I describe Deadpool? First of all, Deadpool is not the kind of guy you would want introduced to your respectable parents. He is rough, he is vulgar, he has no ethic whatsoever and he's superficial. At the end of the date, you would all end in jail alongside him while he's eating a pizza.But this anti-hero side makes him so attaching and so charming in the same time. He's so refreshing compared to his X-Men buddies driven by justice and compassion while he clearly doesn't give a damn at all. This clash between two philosophies is a great source for hilarious scenes.The huge dose of humor is by the way welcomed because Deadpool is really violent as well. Some scenes despite being funny are also quite gory. A lot of people die in the movie most of them in a very violent way. But the lightness which comes from Deadpool makes them more enjoyable to watch.But most of all, the movie is allowing us to see the huge comical talent of Ryan Reynolds. He bears the movie on his shoulders. I can feel he has so much fun impersonating Deadpool and he shared his fun with his partners. This is making Deadpool a feel-good movie despite the huge darkness of the scenario. Even the big villain is funny in his way.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone can enjoy this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 99% of superhero movies the hero himself is the most boring character (at least in my opinion). Even when it comes to Batman, by far my favourite superhero, I'm more than willing to admit that the villain is almost always still the most interesting character. However, this certainly can't be said for 'Deadpool'. Admittedly (even by him), he's not exactly a superhero. In fact the film ends up playing out as more of a revenge flick. Nothing is off limits. Cold-blooded killing, torture, nudity, it has it all and much more. The greatest thing about this film though is the simple fact that people who enjoy superhero movies will love it, but so will people who don't. That's an accomplishment.Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast in the title role. Having already had one try at the superhero genre, and failing badly, it's good to see he was willing to get back on the horse and give it another shot. I'm sure he's glad he did. The script is terrific, balancing humour, action and even drama exquisitely. The only put down I can find is that I would have liked to have seen a slightly more menacing villain. He was unpleasant, there's no doubt about that, but he never felt like anything of a threat. To be honest though that really is nitpicking in a nearly flawless film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool (2016) *** 1/2 (out of 4)I'm not sure people need a plot description here but we've basically got a man named Wade Williams (Ryan Reynolds) who comes down with terminal cancer and he accepts a deal to try and have himself cured. The "doctor" named Francis (Ed Skrein) instead does a horrible experiment on him and soon the deformed man takes the name Deadpool and goes out for revenge.I'm not a comic book person and I know very little about them outside of what I see in movies. With that said, it seems DEADPOOL got a pretty big group of people who gathered around to say that a R-rated comic book movie would never work and that the studio was committing suicide. Well, the box office numbers certainly proved them wrong as the film managed to take in a lot of money as well as please critics and fans. Personally speaking while most comic book movies are good, they are start to look and sound alike so getting something as fresh as DEADPOOL was terrific.I think the best thing that can be said about the film is that it just stands out among the various other comic movies out there. Naturally the R-rating is the selling point because this "hero" loves to cuss, have sex, tell dirty jokes and when he kills someone he wants their brains splattered everywhere. All of this madness is what makes the film seem so fresh because the action scenes are pure 100% action with non-stop bloody violence that is just fun to watch. The comic tone is hilarious at times due to the character's sarcastic nature and dirty mouth. Everything here works extremely well and this includes the real mutants and their super powers. Everything in the film is a joke and what's most shocking is that it's all funny.The casting was certainly the most important thing and Reynolds handles the role with ease. I think it's safe to say after watching the film that they selected the perfect man for the part and can you really think of anyone who would have done it better? Reynold's comic timing is flawless and he really makes Deadpool one of the most memorable characters out there. Skrein is very good in the role as the villain and Morena Baccarin is also very good playing the love interest. Even more great humor comes from T.J. Miller in his role as the comic relief.DEADPOOL certainly earns its R-rating and delivers the goods in terms of dirty laughs and graphic violence. I'm not sure how many other comic book movies are going to be willing to do this but this certainly stands out from the crowd and best of all is that the dirty humor isn't just a gimmick because it actually works very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wade Wilson (played by Ryan Reynolds) is a small-time mercenary. He meets Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and falls in love. Life is idyllic until one day he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Things look bleak but a man appears who says he can be cured, through a treatment that gives him superhero powers. After initially turning him down, Wilson agrees, and meets the man behind the project, Ajax (Ed Skrein). While undergoing the treatment he discovers that it will involve him becoming a mutant, and he will need to undergo several painful tests to discover what his mutant abilities are. Plus, Ajax is a sadist. The treatment results in Wilson getting powers of accelerated healing but also leaves him terribly disfigured. Ajax tries to keep him a prisoner but he escapes. He now has two aims: find Vanessa and make Ajax pay for what he did to him. Killing Ajax may not be as easy it seems, as Ajax is also a mutant and the meddling, do-gooder superhero Collossus and his sidekick Negasonic Teenage Warhead keep getting in the way. Oh, and Wade Wilson is now operating under an alias: Deadpool.After all the all style-no-substance, CGI-driven comic book movies, this movie is a breath of fresh air in the genre. Outrageously funny, original and entertaining. Clever, snappy, laugh-a-minute dialogue. Some great cultural references and in-jokes, especially regarding other comic book movies.Basic but decent plot. Hardly Citizen Kane stuff but at least it has a plot, which is more than one can say for most comic book movies. Decent character depth and engagement.Good action sequences too.This all said, it really is all about the humour and Ryan Reynolds delivers it with aplomb. Good support from TJ Miller in the humour department and Morena Baccarin in the drama, romance and looks departments.Easily the best comic book movie made in a very long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Film but daft at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! I have never really been a fan of superhero movies, but then again is Deadpool even a hero? I think this film is definitely one to go and see, there is humour romance and some bad ass action scenes. What else do you need? Deadpool is played by Ryan Reynolds who did a fantastic job at his role. He was able to represent the hero we know from the comics, just as witty, just as different. I think the humour in this film would defiantly budge up the age group to...lets say...50? A lot of the jokes personally reminded me of inappropriate dad humour. I have already heard that there is likely to be a Deadpool 2, as if, its only been out 2 months. The main aspect of the film that I found the most creative was their interpretation of a clique superhero movie. By getting Deadpool to narrate the clique scenes in a cocky attitude maybe the film way more entertaining. I would give this film an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie For Kids, Cheap Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's a mean summary, but it's the truth. I'm a big fan of Marvel and DC, but Deadpool was disappointing. First of all, the history has nothing interesting and the end of the movie was very clear for me since the beginning. It's a cool movie, i think Deadpool is a great character, deserves a movie, but something deeper than that. It has a lot of blood and shooting, as a deadpool movie deserves, but that scene where he kills 3 guys with one bullet, while he's doing a impossible stunt? Really? I'm sorry but only kids buy that kind of stuff. And what about those lame jokes? Not all jokes, but some of them were so cliché and not funny at all (kids will enjoy). I will give 7 because the movie has a lot of great action sequences, violence, good effects and it has even some x men (colossus and negasonic teenage warhead). Besides that, the history is boring and the actors are lame. Kids will enjoy more then adults, because there's a lot of superhero action, without much story to understand, To me Batman vs Superman still the greatest superhero movie ever, along with watchmen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was an OK movie. The dialogue was the best. The plot was a boring, standard revenge plot. The story telling was very unique. The scope of the movie was small - it all took place in one city. The characterization was poor. Many of the characters were flat, their motivation was unexplained, and some were even one-dimensional - just placeholders. The main character was OK though. By the way, Deadpool has an ENTP Myers-Briggs personality type. His friend, TJ Miller, who also plays Erlich Bachman in Silicon Valley, is also an ENTP. Rick Sanchez from Rick &amp; Morty is also an ENTP. I don't mind the R rating, but it had very little adult concepts. Rick &amp; Morty has more adult themes.</fullReview>

The movie opening is excellent the level of humour and fun is steadily kept up but the story dips a little towards the end where most of the action takes place. I must admit if I was able to make this film I would have given it ten out of ten but as I am only writing a small review for this thing, then I have to honest. I was smiling through out the film and laughed out loud a few times some of the humour missed it's target and this is a super hero movie, go on the internet and listen to Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo on BBC Radio 5 pod cast too. If you want to go and see a movie that really misses it's target go and see an Adam Sandler or Will Farrell comedy or BVS DOJ a superhero movie with a very poor story line.And hello to Jason Isaacs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that succeeded against all odds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before we dive into this review I am going to give you a little history of this movie. To sum things up, it was doomed from the start. It was stuck in the back of Fox's (The company behind this movie) shelf for more than ten years. Ryan Reynolds, the main star, was trying to get this movie made for ages and it didn't get the green light until an anonymous person released the test footage online. For those of you who don't know a test footage is a small scene in the movie that is designed to convince the heads of studios to give them money or permission to make a movie, kind of like an audition for the play. The footage was released on September 2014 and due to overwhelming fan response the movie was given the go ahead; however the director had two options: either make a it a blockbuster PG-13 action with a large budget, which would hypothetically draw in a larger but upset the fans or let it be a R-Rated movie, which turned out to be a way better choice.Now that we have gotten through the history of the movie being made I shall give my honest, professional opinion: IT IS AMAZING! Coming from the guy that has waited about two years for this movie I was more than excited, I was thrilled. Writing this blog is very hard because I have to try to push my geek fandom away and treat this gem like another regular movie, so here it goes:Actors: This cast had a lot of really good rising stars. Ryan Reynolds definitely stole the show with this but what can you expect for a guy who's been training for the role for more than 10 years. The supporting cast was average: the comic relief guy, T.J. Miller himself, had a lot of good jokes and gave a pretty good performance. Morena Baccarin plays the love interest and she does a good job with what she is given, which isn't much. The villain, Ajax, whose is played by Ed Skrien gives a great performance, but again the character itself is a stereotypical comic book movie villain. The rest of the supporting cast is great because of their ability to create levity in any situations, which is what drives the movie.Plot: The movies main goal was to give the audience a different kind of superhero movie, which it certainly did; however, there are still some things in the movie that are questionable when it comes to the plot. The movie is not funny, it is hilarious. The plot follows the average superhero movie that isn't a sequel: the origin story. If you ask anyone if the scenes where Deadpool in costumes is better than the scenes when Deadpool is not in costume I can almost guarantee that they will say yes, I know I will. The plot is explained through Deadpool in costume followed by flashbacks to the origin story. The origin story, at best, is necessary, but Deadpool would still be a great movie if he didn't have one. The plot is very shaky and all over the place, but when it comes to this movie the greats jokes and action sequences blot out the plot.Overall the movie sells itself, and it is almost certain that there will be a sequel. However, the thing to watch out for is now that Deadpool is successful a lot more comic book movies are going to try to copy its success. Mark my words, the next few years will certainly see the change in comic book movies. I personally welcome the change to the comic book franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best of Marvel's cinematic universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always loved Deadpool. Brash, humorous, violent, and not giving a f***, I've been a fan of his since I was a little kid. Fansnof his have been waiting for this movie for a LONG time, and now that its had its theatrical release and is finally available to own, I think it was well worth the other wait. Ryan Renold's is the best pick they could have chosen to play Wade. He's always had the perfect mix of humor and sarcasm, which old 'pool has in abundance. And thank god they stuck to the comics.version of Deadpool, instead.of the horrible Wolverine: Origins version. This movie has everything in abundance. Humor, violence, etc. Just as anything relating to Deadpool should. Before this movie even came out, there was a lot of controversy surrounding its rating, since it would be the first R movie Marvel ever first out, making it impossible for a very large young fan base to see. Quite frankly, I don't see what the big deal is. Sure, the F bomb in one variation or another is dropped constantly throughout the movie, along with the usage of sh**, but that's not really anything these days. As for the violence, some of it is over the top, as it's supposed to be, but its not really that bloody or gory, and except for a few scenes, there really isn't any sex or nudity, although there is some talk of masturbation, but again, that's not really enough to warrant an R rating. So except for the constant swearing, I don't really see any need for an R rating. But in my opinion, to date, this is the best movie Marvel has ever done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the verge of being a masterpiece aside from a couple of faults!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have rated Deadpool an 8...or perhaps even a nine......had it not been for the over-the-top swearing and a bit of the gratuitous violence.Now before some of you jump down my throat, bear with me for a moment as I walk you through my thought process and explain why I feel this way.In addition, I'll preface this by saying that I get that it's Deadpool as I am quite familiar with the source material - I have read several of the comic books/graphic novels.First, let's start with the swearing shall we.I, myself am known to swear...sometimes often...not so much that it would cause someone to think I have an extremely limited vocabulary, but often enough! However, from what I can recall, Deadpool didn't swear a ton in the source material. Matter of fact, I can't quite remember him swearing at all in the comics. Not saying it didn't happen, but I can't recall it happening; which suggests that it didn't happen often enough for me to notice, and certainly not enough for it to become trite.For me, part of the reason Deadpool is so damn funny (and lovable), is because he's so darn clever while at the same time remaining utterly innocent. This IMHO, is what keeps him teetering on the verge of annoying the crap out of everyone to the point where no one can stand him. His charm is in this ability to be clever in such an innocent manner, that even if he sometimes crosses that line of bothersome to the point of being annoying, he's easy to forgive. His innocence is what makes him endearing while at the same time making him tolerable.Unfortunately for me, when you have a script calling for the character to swear like Barnacle Bill the Sailor, it nullifies any ability for the character to appear innocent and instead, simply makes him look like a tool or a jerk. There were moments of brilliance in this movie where you would see glimpses of Deadpool possessing this innocence and charm; only for a twinkling of a moment, before it is quickly dissolved by a poorly timed cuss here or there. For me, it was a negative as it took away from a lot of the charm that makes Deadpool great.In regards to the gratuitous violence, I am a little more forgiving here as this is for the most part a bit more unavoidable if you are sticking to the source material. Having said that, it would have been nice if they tried a bit harder to avoid some of the graphic violence, or at least toned it down a smidge in an effort to appeal to a wider audience. Personally, I would have loved to have taken my daughter to see this at the theater, but because of the extreme violence, decided against it and thus, didn't go to the theater to see it myself.Regardless, Ryan Reynolds does an excellent job as Deadpool, but that's not saying much as Reynolds was pretty much born to play this role. I can't imagine there was a lot of character research that went into this role, nor was there a need for Mr. Reynolds to "get into character". My impression is that the two are very similar and that there wasn't too drastic a change when Reynolds had to become Wade Wilson.As far as the direction is concerned, Tim Miller does a brilliant job for the most part. There are some moments of pure directorial genius in this film, such as the opening scene where the car is flipping over in slow motion to the song, "Angel of the Morning". Pure genius!For the most part the writing is good with only one or two questionable moments where I felt like the script was lacking.Overall, Deadpool is an enjoyable movie that stays pretty close to the source material. Had it done the things I mentioned above, without question I would have given the movie an 8 rating, perhaps even a 9. If it could have done that as well as avoiding those couple of lackluster moments in the script, I would have considered this a comic book movie masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan takes and piles Deadpools comic characters wit and sarcasm into a real-life version so well that wait for the sequel is going to be agonizing pain. Visually there isn't gigantic scenarios of destruction like other Marvel movies commonly have, but this movie goes deeply with violence and humour with a twist of black. Movie does NOT suit for serious people, since the humour is so big part of the violence that most serious people just grunts unpleasantly. The biggest separation from other Marvel titles is that this one goes overboard with the possibilities "hero"movie can offer. If you want to enjoy and have good time alone or better, with friends (booze), this one is top notch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay for the few naysayers out there, well, it was made abundantly clear prior to the film releasing that there would be full extensive use of the R rating. If you are a Deadpool fan, then you would also have been well aware of what to be in store for. If you watched any of the 30+ trailers, social media clips, promotions, etc you would have been well aware before going to this film what to expect. My personal opinion (and people are certainly entitled to disagree with it) is that like any movie, you should rate it on whether it delivered as promised. Not give it one star because you either expected it to be watered down, or didn't bother to research it at all prior. No this isn't like the other Marvel movies out there (which I adore, and follow avidly!), it is a completely different animal but no less wonderful. I have watched this 3 times in the theater, and if I get the chance I'll watch it again before it is out of the theater. It was brilliant from beginning to end. Pay attention if you haven't had the pleasure of going yet to every little thing. Because there were incredibly few instances of anything in this movie being face value, be it references to pop culture, alternate movies, comic books, or other happenings in the film itself. Do NOT bring your children. Seriously they may beg you to watch it, but there are some actual adult situations, including torture that may not be the best material for them. Maybe check it out first, and go from there. But I had a pair of grandparents behind me in the first viewing with their 6ish old grandchildren and they ended up leaving in the first 20 minutes. So totally 5 stars, I'd give it a 100 if I could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film a great deal. Few films have the testicular fortitude as this one and Ryan Reynolds found his calling, nobody plays smart ass like this guy. It's funny as hell but could have actually been a great movie as well. It tries to be a satire of the super hero movie (something most super hero movies accidentally do anymore) but what it really is a super hero movie with some (admittedly hilarious) dirty jokes. This film would bump up to a seven or even eight if they cut down the origin story. No super hero origin story will ever be interesting--Nolan's Batman had an interesting one not because the story was good but because it was well photographed. Honestly, I cant wait for the sequel though. The origin will be gone and Reynolds will have more time to do what he does best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I am not overly keen on superhero movies, but all that I know who have seen "Deadpool" has been overly excited and thrilled about it, so I decided to cave in an give it a go, and check if it really was as fun and entertaining as everyone said it was.And they were right! Wow, "Deadpool" is a fantastic combination of action, comedy, satire and spoofs. The story in the movie is fairly straight forward, actually bordering on being generic. But it was the sly remarks, the physical comedy of the Wade/Deadpool character that really made the movie work out so nicely. And Ryan Reynolds, despite already having played other superhero roles, really was nicely cast for the Deadpool character.The audience is thrown into the fray right from the very beginning, and the movie kicks up into an impressive gear and high speed from the very start, and it never slows down.The cast in "Deadpool" were doing some good jobs with their given roles and characters. And I must admit that I was more than genuinely impressed with what Ryan Reynolds (playing Wade / Deadpool) managed to deliver with his part in this movie. But also Morena Baccarin (playing Vanessa) really brought something good to the movie with her skills and on-screen charisma. And T.J. Miller really had a great part in the movie, despite it not being a prominent character.There is a lot of action throughout the course of "Deadpool", which was really well choreographed and equally well executed.I will say that "Deadpool" is without a doubt the best superhero movie that I have ever seen. And it is definitely well worth watching, even if you like me, am not a particular fan of superhero movies. Deadpool manages to score a rock-solid eight out of ten stars from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm so glad that Ryan and DC parted ways, though I liked GL, I loved Mr. Pool. I've been enamored of Morena Baccarin since I first saw her appear in Firefly, perhaps my favorite series ever, and perhaps the most beautiful, sweet and funny actress I've ever seen.Before the movie even started, I knew it would be a favorite, if not the. Asshats aside, the opening was brilliant, previewing the fun to come in one of the most creative ways I've ever seen.The interactions of the two stars were magical, and truly believable, and this ride took me through my full range of emotions, as most movies only dream they could do.I knew NOTHING of Deadpool before seeing this, as I was a DC comic fan as a child, which may have been why I loved this movie so much... something new for a change. Marvel has blown DC completely out of the water since they started their new universe with the newest HULK in 2008 (X-Men was barely passable), well, until S v B, which I loved almost as much as this. Keep it up Marvel, and get to work on this sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie knocked me of my socks, the jokes were running like a landslide without leaving you air to breath. From the start of the film i knew i was in a big fun ride without a steering wheel. The editing and the pacing were excellent and was one of the major reasons that make this movie shine. The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and T.J. Miller was hilarious and the cab driver scene with Karan Soni was awesome and all those one liners made this movie become nostalgic for all those action/comedies of the '80s. In my this movie should be use as a milestone from the filming industry to listen more to the people for what they want to see. A big BRAVO from me and these kind movie will keep on coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DEADPOOL is a spoof of MARVEL comic book characters, directed with panache by Tim Miller, rich in one-liners such as 'Life is an endless series of trainwrecks with only brief commercial-like breaks of happiness. This had been the ultimate commercial break. Which meant it was time to return to our regularly scheduled programming.' It is apparently based on the Marvel Comics character by the same name (Deadpool is a fictional antihero Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool is a disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. He is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used by writers for humorous effect and running gags). Even for those saturated with the endless expensive overblown repetitious Marvel Comic films that flood the market (making billions of dollars), This film is funny, not only due to the comedic writing of Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, Fabian Nicienza and Rob Liefeld, but also due to start Ryan Reynolds inimitable talent for admixing silly banter with heroic handsome good looks and fancy footwork. Very briefly (because there isn't much story), 'This is the origin story of former Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, who after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopts the alter ego Deadpool. Armed with his new abilities and a dark, twisted sense of humor, Deadpool hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life.'Much of the success of this film is due to the cast ? Ryan Reynolds of course, but also a brilliant role for Ed Skrein as Ajax, T.J. Miller, the every glamorous Morena Baccarin (of Homeland fame), as Vanessa, Gina Carano as Angel Dust, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, etc.The film does go overboard in noisy destruction and massive killings and foul language, but hey, this is a Marvel Comics outing ? so you expect something different? Entertaining if a bit too long.</fullReview>

It perfectly takes the mick out of every super hero cliché and even at the company who produced it.Deadpool is the mercenary with the mouth that takes everything as a joke. Deadpool's advert is funny, to the point that is just like the old adverts, that contain no movie sequences at all.

		<fullReview>Very few times have I ever fallen head-over-heels for movie...in its opening credits!! Such was the case for "Deadpool." I mean, when the credits display "Directed By: Some Tool," I knew I was in for a good time.Due to a complete loss of any kind of imagination, recently movie goers have been inundated with every movie imaginable concerning Marvel and its "super heroes." Most have been huge disappointments, some were "meh," and very few were actually entertaining. "Deadpool" had me from start to finish. I mean, c'mon, who could not like a character by the name of "Negasonic Teenage Warhead"?!It is a story about a former Special Ops mercenary, Wade Wilson, played remarkably well by Ryan Reynolds. He is trying to get out of the business, but as luck would have it, he just cannot seem to break free. He falls in love and when he finally musters the courage to pop the question, receives some awful news. Even the villain in this movie was a cut above the rest. "Ajax," who seems to have a narcissistic personality, was completely bad- ass. He was also superbly played by Ed Skrein, who, if memory serves me correctly, was formerly in "Game of Thrones." His sidekick, although not named, was one tough broad.This movie lasts 108 minutes and is rated "R" for non-stop graphic violence, language, simulated sex, and nudity. Other reviews I have read list "graphic nudity." I do not even know what that is. If you're nude, you're nude; there's nothing graphic about that.Anyhoo, I cannot recommend this enough. If this site had "half- stars," this would definitely garner a 9.5 from me. Enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best X Men movies so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, let me make a confession. When I first head "Deadpool", I felt the guys who come up with things in Marvel ran out of ideas and names. I watched the movie quite reluctantly and boy was I in for a surprise!This has to be by far the best X Men movie to date. A very "unique" opening sequence, followed by some mind-blowing action sequence. Enough cannot be said about the action and choreography: amazing action, coupled with punchy one-lines and super cool slow-mo scenes. The humor in the movie is dry and sarcastic and really well written (some may not agree). The dry wit adds a very realistic and natural dimension to the character and makes you connect with him. The one- liners and wise-cracks is almost continuous when Mr. Dead Pool is around, and when he is not on, we wish him back just so that we can hear him mouth-off!Negasonic and Colossus have limited role in the movie (except towards the last big action sequence). But this movie is all about Deadpool. The casting in Ryan Reynolds is spot on, and I now I cannot imagine anyone else playing Deadpool.Overall a superb movie, a solid 9/10.</fullReview>

That is extremely impressive.no tip my hat to everyone on that one well done. The only shrug with the movie is that I do like the fact that they put Colossus in the movie. But they could have put another side superhero instead of someone nobody really knows. But overall I'm glad there making a 2nd movie. Hopefully they put other X-Men characters in it besides Cable and Colossus. I believe they should somehow involve deadpool with the upcoming movie infinity war part 1. Even if it's for only 10-15min. Or even a cameo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvellous mix, very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Some minor spoilers ahead ***I must admit that I am not a comic book fan. I have only a passing interest in the x-men series and stories of the genre. This wisecracking goofy fun character was the most entertaining one of the whole bunch. Certainly NOT for younger kids. And that right there might be part of the 'charm'. It was made for an adult audience. Nothing was too heavily dumbed down or cleaned up. No high moral ground here. It was witty and gritty and those aspects were almost nonstop. the repeated breaks to the 4th wall (directly addressing the viewer) gave an even more fun aspect to it. The film did a serious and job of putting the story forward and at the same time, didn't take itself TOO serious. The film, right from the opening credits tells you to 'sit back and enjoy the ride'. The laughter started almost immediately. The intense and complicated action started right on it's heels and the wisecracking was peppered throughout. Repeated events of leaving the guns and ammo bag in the cab reminded me of the infamous blue snack bag from 'The Middle' that was always forgotten. The film is continually referring to and making fun of other projects (like Green Lantern) in the dialogue. The chemistry between Ryan and Morena was palpable. If there was no actual spark offscreen (yes, I know they are both married to other people) then extra kudos to their acting. It looks like this might finally be the vehicle that Ryan Reynolds can have a genuine success with. The man has been in a lot of films and most of them ended up (through no fault of his) being 'big budget awful'. He's a good actor and very talented, just bad luck that they have been less than good films. Other excellent actors like Eric Bana and Edward Norton could not save the Hulk movies, so this is hardly something new. Ryan is an actor that just comes across as a guy that you really want to like and it's sad that it took this long for him to find a film that let's him succeed. As to another co star, TJ Miller talks and looks way TOO much like Ryan Reynolds in this, to the point where I thought it was him playing a dual role. So in summary, if you can handle rapidfire wisecracks, violence, action and strong language. This will be sure to keep you entertained. As with many films these days, watch through all the credits for an easter egg at the end. If you get the Blu Ray or DVD, the extra scenes are fantastic and funny too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshingly filthy superhero movie that is bound by its origin-story trappings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is evident for around 5 minutes of Gavin Hood's disastrous X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) that Fox were onto something with their casting of Ryan Reynolds as the gobby mercenary Wade Wilson aka Deadpool. That was until he had his mouth sown together and turned into a super weapon before he could resemble anything like the character who had garnered a legion of loyal readers in Marvel's comic-book world. Talks of a reboot were in the air even since, and despite Reynolds' public support of the movie and obvious fan anticipation, it felt like it would never happen.With Fox now piecing their beloved and highly lucrative franchise back together following Days of Future Past's re-setting of the timeline (deleting Hood's movie and Brett Ratner atrocious X-Men: The Last Stand in the process), the 'Merc with a Mouth' finally arrived to glowing reviews, fan adoration, and a box-office taking that was beyond anyone's expectations. The early trailers teased that the character would be at his foul-mouthed, sarcastic best, and although Deadpool is set firmly within the same universe as Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, it certainly doesn't follow the same rules.Deadpool is all about Deadpool, and so the plot can be summed up within the same sentence. The climax essentially plays out throughout the entire movie, with Ryan Reynolds' already-suited-up hero ambushing a gang of bad guys on a freeway and taking them out in various gruesome ways. We flash back to his time working as muscle-for-hire in New York, where he meets escort Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) at a bar and the two fall in love. Wade soon learns he has aggressive cancer, and, without Vanessa's knowledge, volunteers for an experimental treatment that he soon learns consists of torture at the hands of Ajax (Ed Skrein), who hopes to awaken latent mutant genes in his subjects. He escapes the lab with the ability to heal but permanently disfigured, with a plan to take revenge and win back Vanessa.A lot of Deadpool's success has been put down to its R rating, and the film certainly flaunts its freedom to make dick jokes and kill its characters in a variety of gruesome ways. While this may be the case to some degree, it seems that people forget Deadpool is, most importantly, offering something different in an already-overcrowded superhero market. While the filthy sense of humour does grate at times, especially whenever Wade's friend Weasel (T.J. Miller) is on screen, Deadpool is anything but the traditional brooding superhero with the weight of the world on their shoulders, he is selfish and self- absorbed yet motivated by his love for Vanessa, repeatedly breaking the fourth wall and informing us that he is fully aware of his role in the movie. When he is dragged by X-Men Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) to Professor X's mansion, he wonders whether it will be Patrick Stewart or James McAvoy awaiting him.But the low-key approach, although refreshing, also shrinks the movie. The fragmented narrative offers a slightly new take on the origin movie, but take this away and the film still falls into the same genre trappings. There's the love interest, the life-changing experiment, the forgettable bad guy - all tropes covered in a hundred films before it. So without an enticing plot to sink the teeth into, a lot falls on the charisma of Reynolds as a character intended to provoke a strong reaction. Thankfully, Reynolds gives his best performance, a role worthy of his natural screen presence and slightly idiosyncratic delivery. Whether the humour is for you or not (it certainly made me laugh out loud throughout), you have to admire director Tim Miller's belief in such a risky project, and it will hopefully open the gates to the possibility of more adult superhero movies in a genre always in need of fresh input.</fullReview>

"What are we watching" For a start any movie that has the actor talking to the camera is off to a bad start and this just got worse. It was being crude just for the sake of it and 'trying' way to hard to be funny when it wasn't. The action scenes were well done and so were the fights and special effects which is why I gave it a 5 otherwise it would have been much lower.Shame super hero movies seem to be heading downhill like they have no ideas left and this was surly scraping the bottom of the barrel to jump on the super hero money making bandwagon.</fullReview>

People will argue that x-men "pullverine" origins covered this already that he was an awesome mercenary, but that Deadpool character seems to have been voided from the marvel world and a new fresh comical vigilante appears.Only con in the film was that if you had already watched the trailer more than two-three times you've seen a fair bit of the funny bits of the movie already, but most of your time through the film the scenes just laugh out loud!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where exactly does Deadpool stand in the History of Cinema?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you could image your subconscious thoughts during a movie, you'd come up with a leather-bound thesis after watching The Godfather and Pulp Fiction, an exuberant treatise after La Dolce Vita, a double-retrograde flowchart after Memento and a dialectic paperback after The Dark Knight. After Deadpool..you can relay such thoughts using a binary alphabet;"Ha. Haa. Ha ha. Ah! AHH!! Hah. AAAH." It humors in its own laughability. That's something, if you'll go for anything.Ryan Reynolds is inviolably cast as Deadpool (not-so-much as Wade), and Ed Skrein as "A British Villain", whose invulnerable machismo would have sipped the tension out of Game of Thrones, is appropriate here, sneezing at impalements-by-sword like they were fly-bites. Morena Baccarin looks good naked and is a good actress. The movie kindly lets her reveal one of those things as Vanessa.Up on the technical floor, does Deadpool have a unique cinematic vocabulary, in the way of Battleship Potemkin or even Un Chien Andalou...? The opening tableau vivant was more imaginatively rendered in Days of Future Past...and the concept was more provocatively employed in Cashback (2006), objectively; it's a tired, haggard dog of a trick. In its defense, there IS that ass-to-ass match cut, and...that's it. Other than that it speaks in the same bromidic visual clichés our optic ears are numb from hearing, it might as well be (and is) a competently made romantic comedy about a guy whose uprooted penis can grow back, each time with a "boing!!"Yet it's billed as an "action" movie. Violence is a delicious promise from the trailers. Do its cartoonishly (the script admits as much) over-choreographed dance/fight scenes contain anything 1/10th as visceral as Morsov's Leap from Fury Road, or even Buster Keaton's locomotive hypercrobatics from The General (1926)? It fartin-wishes. More like those burn-worthy Kung Fu D-movies circa 1995, whose poster is the hero walking away from a 'blown-up' matchstick explosion.Down on the fundamental story level, there's only a string of 30 seconds during its 108-minute unspooling time during which Deadpool acquires the illusion of depth; stalking his girlfriend Vanessa and shamed by his burnt-sausage looks, strangers on the street throw censoriously disgusted stares at Wade Wilson; "get a mask!". This scene earned an echo of thought about the human condition; "Yeah, they all do that." A non-teenage film would use this development as a launchpad into balancing laughs and meditation on societal vanity versus individual dysmorphic syndrome. But hey, the movie tells me....meditation is for the temple, NOT the multiplex. Touche and ha ha. Safer to take the crowd's advice..and please them.So much for being a "popcorn movie"--and only a passable one at that--Age of Ultron features one timelessly ponderable moment: "What is This?", wonders Ultron in basso elettrico upon awakening and achieving self-awareness. It's a bit of writing that invoked the same feeling of primal, dread-filled fascination in me as The Genesis of the Robot and the subsequent Birth of False Maria in Metropolis (1927). It also made me wonder, on an embryonic cogitative level...if that same thought had occupied my inchoate fetal mind at a point during my gestation. All this during an ultimately disappointing Superboys' Day-out Comedy. You see a different kind of self-awareness in Deadpool...Wade knows he's a comic book character in a Fox movie with an audience watching it. Only problem is this--apart from pandering to fan-men and fan-women (but ..fanboys, mostly)--does not serve the story at all. The existential disequilibrium between Deadpool and Ultron is; Ultron will always have achieved self-awareness, duplicated it and attempted to destroy all those who preceded him to it, while Deadpool ends up talking to himself if you go for a snack and leave the BluRay playing. Even he can't laugh at how kooky-ridiculous he looks doing that. Detractors of Deadpool cite how it only shuffles the deck without adding any fresh cards; breaking the fourth wall has been popular since The Tramp winked at us in Charlie Chaplin's films...die-hard fans bark at that, "it's the first time it's been done in a comic book adaptation!" Alrighty then. I suppose the next time a kid splits his knee open, and some Superloon licks the wound..it'll be heralded as novelty too.As one blasphemer--who hasn't been in the game much between 1994 and now--put it, Deadpool is the freshest script he's encountered since Pulp Fiction...except Tarantino's Film is a deconstruction, a subversion and a re-invention of the Hollywood Gangster Genre. Deadpool on the other pole isn't one cent more than a sardonic riff. The kind of insights Deadpool brings to the superhero-cash-cow genre are the sort you throw-away with pothead bar-acquaintances on a lazy Saturday afternoon (ouchie! superhero landings are hard on your knees!), or lying awake on the operating table..(the camera's the only thing that's pulling out tonight!)..waiting for the second half of your lobotomy. Apparently, say the fans, that's more than good enough for a Comic Book Movie. Ah.Am I a pedant-on-stilts who can't have fun at the (real silly) movies? Ha ha ha ha. "Nah", I'm just an adult who was thinking when I watched the movie. That's why, it earns a 6/10.</fullReview>

In my honest opinion, Deadpool is one of my top 5 favorite marvel films of all-time!Ryan Reynolds redeems his superhero status and then knocks it out of the park playing the merc with the mouth! His performance is both timeless and outrageously hilarious!Morena Baccarin is great as Wade's love interest Vanessa, as she captures the kinky funny girlfriend scheme perfectly.The film touches on all aspects that I wanted to see, Action, sadness, romance, redemption, and pure badassery!The music in this film also is awesome, from Juice Newton, to Chicago, to WHAM! It gives the film a ironic, yet fitting feel.The only aspect that I can pick out that the film lacks is the budget setbacks, these are EXTREMELY minor and you cannot tell, but I can see the little details, and the funny thing is, the film jabs that too.Deadpool is unlike any comic book movie ever made, because it gives us a giant superhero middle finger stereotype movie but with its own fresh concept that is flourishing in the box office.Overall I loved this movie! I give Deadpool a solid 9/10 Highly recommend this movie to anyone!....over the age of 13 at least...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to make the chimi-f***in-changas!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now you may be wondering why someone who saw this AWESOME movie opening weekend is writing a review NOW? The very simple answer: Batman V Superman sucked (I wrote a bad review for it) and it made me want to praise a recent comic book movie that DIDN'T suck!Ever since that abomination they called "Deadpool" in X-Men Origins: Wolverine I became a pretty big fan of the REAL Deadpool. I own and have read the entire "Deadpool &amp; Cable" series and the "Merc with a Mouth" series and absolutely love them. I will admit when this movie was announced, I didn't know much about early (90's) Deadpool which is what the movie was based on, but I did know Deadpool himself.Now for the review: This movie was perfect from the opening credits all the way to the ending credits. They made me laugh, they were creative and it's even funnier if you know how the opening credits came to be (LOOK IT UP!) I don't watch comedies very often, but how I judge them is simple: how much time out of the movie do I spend laughing my @$$ off! In Deadpool, the answer is THE WHOLE TIME!Between breaking the fourth wall, pop culture references, and references to other movies (both Marvel movies &amp; Ryan Reynold's movies) the only way you cannot laugh is if you have no sense of humor (or a clean one, which is boring!)As for the story, it is Deadpool's origin story. Long story short, Wade Wilson (Deadpool) gets cancer, he's made an offer he can't refuse (well he does at first) and in curing his cancer, he becomes horribly disfigured. He then goes on a revenge mission to kill Francis/Ajax (he doesn't like the name Francis!) My only real complaint to the story was, much like Iron-Man 3, it jumped around a lot/wasn't chronological. That's just a personal pet peeve though; probably won't bother everyone.The characters: Deadpool - the Merc-with-a-Mouth out for revenge. Vanessa - Wade's girlfriend/future baby-mama. Weasel - Deadpool's BFF/weapons dealer/intel guy. Colossus - The big CGI metal guy from the X-Men. Negasonic Teenage Warhead - The moody teen/X-Men protegee. Francis/Ajax - British villain who turns wade into an abomination. Angel Dust - Francis' right-hand woman who does most of his dirty work.Summary: The movie plays out in such a way that it will please action fans, comedy fans, comic fans, and honestly probably anyone with a messed-up sense of humor. If you're okay with swearing, inappropriate jokes, sex and lots of blood; THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU! If not, well then that's too bad (you're missing out!)Final verdict: I WOULD give Deadpool a full 10/10 instead of 9/10, if not for these 2 things: 1. The non-chronological story (like I said, just a personal pet peeve) 2. I saw it opening weekend as well as the following weekend, and it wasn't as funny the second time. I'm not saying it wan't AWESOME a second time, I'm just saying that when I buy it on Blu-ray I can't watch it too often/soon. I gotta leave some time in-between viewings so the jokes aren't fresh in my mind.GO SEE THIS MOVIE, AND BUY IT WHEN IT COMES OUT! IT DESERVES EVERY PENNY IT'S MADE! GOOD JOB FOX/MARVEL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Former Special Forces Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is the good kind of mercenary. His best friend is bartender Weasel (T. J. Miller). He falls for equally irreverent Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Their warped love story is interrupted when Wade gets cancer. Agent Smith recruits Wade for experiments. Francis 'Ajax' Freeman with his sidekick Angel Dust (Gina Carano) turn Wade into an immortal ugly superhuman. Wade takes on the identity of Deadpool as he hunts down Francis for a cure. X-man Colossus and his grumpy trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead try to recruit Deadpool into the X-Men.Simply put, this is funny. Ryan Reynolds is built to play this smart-aleck, crude character. From 'Two Guys and a Girl' to 'Van Wilder', his early works show his truest persona. It's unlikely anybody else could play Deadpool quite as well. This is a non-stop, fast-paced, 4th wall breaking, no holds barred style of comedy. I guess a minority could object to its crudeness. There is a monotone to this style. That's why the funniest moment is the cabby's second ride. It comes out of nowhere. The shock and awe of it is hilarious. I like Negasonic and Colossus. Gina Carano again proves that she's no actor. Morena Baccarin more than makes up for it. All in all, this is funny and an action-packed superhero movie with a solid story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually thought I had a dodgy DVD and the directors commentary couldn't be turned it off. I was cursing my mate Dave. Turns out that's part of the film.Deadpool is excellent. Crazy action, intelligent comedy, fast paced, romance (Spoiler alert it actually ads to the story), and well written characters. Only let down is the villain. He's sort of rubbish. But that didn't affect the overall enjoyment of the movie. Looking forward to more of these. Maybe a family affair with Burt Reynolds as the villain!Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what it said it would be, Spoilers subject to interpretation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film could not have been any better, mostly because 20th Century Fox believed they would fail with an R rating so they gave them a minimal amount of money and a minimal amount of time. That being said, because I felt someone had to, they succeeded anyway. Deadpool, as a character is perhaps the most brilliantly simple character in the Marvel Universe. He is immune to death. Likewise his character's true gift, in the sense of entertainment, is his unique 4th Wall awareness. Deadpool is the only character in the Marvel Universe to know he is in a comic book. That has always made him different from anything else out there (In terms of DC or Marvel). This film was fun. The casting, without taking the time to single out Ryan Reynolds who seemingly was born for this specific role, was great. The supporting cast and antagonists blended well, Morena Baccarin was hysterical, beautiful, and well-motivated. Ed Skrein was a sufficient antagonist who played a one-dimensional character (by design) with enough tenacity to help you thoroughly despise him. Brianna Hildebrand was great, playing the quintessential teenager (though for whatever reason with different mutant abilities than her source material counterpart, possibly due to the time line divergence in X-Men films). Ryan Reynolds was perhaps the most comfortable of any superhero in any superhero film (Though he is actually both playing and based on a character who is an Anti-hero). His quips were delightful. As stated this is the role he was meant to play (When he was actually permitted to talk for his portrayal). Karan Soni was another supporting cast member (of many) who did a lot with a very small amount of screen time as Dopinder (the reoccurring cab-driver). CGI Colossus was forgivable and, though physically a figment of some computer programmers imagination, an amusingly well-written stereotypical Russian immigrant. T.J. Miller was excellent. His character was comic relief in what is a comic relief film but it was all the more entertaining with his contribution. Gina Carano as Angel was an unfamiliar face to me but she owned the role well and provided a decent secondary antagonist to Skrein. This film didn't surprise me or attempt to surprise me and in this rare case that is perfectly acceptable. The breakdown.Audio Experience: 8.5 It really didn't mesmerize in the sense of original score but it didn't really have to. The Soundtrack was great and somewhat cathartic.Visual Experience: 8.8 It was better than the budget should have permitted with everything timed well, amusing Easter Eggs for the keen-eyed fan, and enjoyable physical comedy by the parties involved.Emotional Experience: 9.0 It wasn't intended to be an emotional roller-coaster. It's a comedy-action-science fiction-superhero film for adults. Any attempt to force it would have ruined the film and they make a point to let you know that while blatantly mocking those who hide such remedial attempts at deep soul-searching content. The 9.0 is for being exactly what it said it would, standing up against the Studio's film-hacking hands even when it meant a lower budget to work with, and for providing quality entertainment without spitting in the base demographics face.Overall: A great film for those who enjoy explicit and violent comedies, violent superhero movies, and a film that can be so juvenile on purpose it magically becomes brilliant. Congrats to the cast, writers, and director for their part in making the second highest grossing Rated R film in movie history (Just, and I do mean just, after Passion Of The Christ at the time of this review) Recommendation: If you fit the previously stated demographic I recommend you see this film if you haven't already. I would strongly advise parents not to permit their kids to see this film, knowing full well they probably already have without you knowing if the question was even posed.</fullReview>

Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of analysis you might have determined if this moving-picture show was for you or not thereupon being same i'll not remove into the plot however the acting and writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are straitlaced by violence, language, or nudity this is not the moving-picture show for you however if you have got a way of humor and wish to be pleased for two straight hours you'll love this moving-picture show.Watch full movies online : http://rewfilms.com/movie/28-Deadpool</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had zero expectations for this because growing up I never cared for the comic book character Deadpool and the previous version of that character in the dreadful X-Men Origins: Wolverine, also played by Ryan Reynolds, was nothing to get excited about. But this was actually a very entertaining movie with lots of action and humor. I think it's one of the rare comic book movies that has just as much, if not more, appeal to the mainstream than to the fanboy set. Ryan Reynolds is funny and charming and I immediately wanted to forgive him for his past cinematic sins. The movie plays to his strengths as the likable frat boy (Van Wilder) much better than his last attempt at launching a superhero franchise (Green Lantern). The rest of the cast is decent, although this is Reynolds' show all the way. He controls every scene and thankfully has a good chemistry with all of his co-stars. The action scenes are very nicely done, as well, although the movie's climax is a little flat. The only real negative is that the CGI Colossus is pretty terrible-looking. Thankfully his role in the movie and how he plays off Reynolds and others provides lots of laughs. Still, he looks like a big cartoon and that is a little distracting. Anyway, this is a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously and gives the audience some great popcorn entertainment. Definitely worth a look even if you don't typically like these kind of movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a long time Deadpool fan I had mixed emotions going in to this. Part of me felt Reynolds would come through as merc with a mouth, but then could this be as atrocious as their first attempt at bringing him to life? Now before we get into the movie let it be said, any parents who brought their kids to this movie and left offended, well your an idiot. This movie stays very true to the pool and had me laughing through out the movie. Whether he's flipping Colossus the bird with a severed hand, or making Colossus puke during an inspiring speech it's bang on! These are things he would do in the comic no doubt about it and nobody is safe from his ridicule.... Nobody. All kidding aside I truly enjoyed this movie. The supporting cast was great, other than Gina Carrano whom I feel was lackluster. The only real beef I had with the movie was that it could have used a better main villain, which I'm sure they will make right in the sequel. I'm not too worried about the lack of X-men because this isn't their movie, this my friends is about the regenerating degenerate. I recommend this movie to anyone, even people who dislike hero movies. Great fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an age when superhero movies come out four or five times a year, how do you make one stand out? Deadpool, for good or bad, has certainly set itself apart from the crowd with its huge amount of bloody violence and swearing, which would be a massive turn-off if it wasn't so funny!The down sides are that in terms of story, it doesn't push any boundaries - it's your typical anti-hero revenge story we've seen before. The sheer amount of gore and swearing would also be hard to sit through for people who don't enjoy that sort of thing - and at no point do they ever hold back. There are also a few sentimental moments which, for me, didn't fit with the tone of the movie and felt out of place.On the plus side, the writing and pace are hilarious - there are so many times you burst out with laughter at something you know you shouldn't really be laughing at (sexual jokes in particular), but they're so outrageous you can't help yourself! Another key reason it works is because it's self-parodying, full of superhero clichés it has itself. The infamous fourth-wall-breaking, although awkward at first, is brilliantly scripted and actually ties the movie together very well.The other characters, however, have nowhere near the same amount of interest, depth or development. Ajax, the villain, seems to have no motive or direction, and Wade's girlfriend has no traits except she's hot. The secondary super-characters though are pretty cool - especially Negasonic Teenage Warhead (although Colossus's animation isn't as good as his appearance in X-Men 2 thirteen years ago...).Clearly a passion project for Reynolds, who's definitely having a blast in the red leather suit! Although story and character are put aside slightly, there's more than enough laughter to distract you from it!4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super. But no hero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) falls in love with escort girl Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin), but soon-after discovers that he has late-stage cancer. When a strange man approaches Wade saying that he can not only cure his disease, but also give him incredible powers, he is sceptical, but eventually undergoes the treatment?a long and agonising process that scars his entire body?unaware that the people conducting the operation intend to use him as a 'weapon for hire'.From the ironic opening credits to the inevitable post-credits sequence, Deadpool is an absolute blast, a side-splittingly funny, hyper-kinetic and incredibly bloodthirsty superhero movie for those fed up with normal superhero movies. This one takes everything expected from the genre and subverts it, creating a deliciously dark adventure in which the lead character, imbued with invincibility, doesn't want to be a hero? he simply wants revenge. As Deadpool sets about finding Francis, the man who caused him so much pain and melted his good looks, he takes special delight in countless outrageous acts of extreme violence, pausing to break the fourth wall with witty remarks aimed at the viewer. This 'self-awareness' only adds to the fun.While not 'the best superhero movie ever' as some people claim (that honour still goes to Days of Future Past), it's a very close second. I loved it! 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and Action-packed; Perfect adaptation of Deadpool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start, I am a huge Deadpool fan based off a comic book standpoint. However, I think we were all a little mad with a certain situation that occurred in X-Men Origins Wolverine. However, Fox recreates Deadpool in a hilarious and smartly adapted way in this near- perfect movie. It basically ignores everything that went wrong with Origins, which is a really good thing. Ryan Reynolds is the perfect fit for the role and brings him justice after what was done to the character before. All the side characters in the movie are pretty great, too. The only thing that really bugged me was the story's villain, Ajax. Similarly compared to many other Marvel films, the villain here is pretty underdeveloped and it would have been a little better if the film would have explored his character a bit more.Overall, Deadpool is smart, fun, and a hilarious movie that anyone, including comic fans and non-comic-fans, can enjoy.Rating: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is certainly a film worth your money. However, I would say it is an extremely overrated movie. Notable for breaking the typical superhero boundaries-especially when it comes to a Marvel product-Deadpool is a violent, obscene and gory movie, yet not in a bad way at all. I strongly disagree with it being in the top 250 (above Dances with Wolves, might I add), but a perfect movie for lovers of action, somewhat-cheap comedy and tons of pop-culture references. The humour wasn't really my thing, but certainly elicited a few chuckles and some hearty laughs, action was superbly done, plot was shaky, characters interesting and colourful. Overall, a good superhero movie but not incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is its own thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't read comics. I did when I was a kid, and that was so long ago that I don't want to even think about it. But I've always watched movies, and "Deadpool" hit a certain nerve in me. In a positive way.Comic book movies seem to be all about franchises nowadays. "Building a universe". Setting up sequels, setting up spinoffs, setting up everything - and often forgetting to be a movie on their own, like what arguably happened with "Avengers: Age of Ultron".I'm not surprised if Deadpool is heading straight into that circus of brands and formulaic nothingness, because at this point it's clear how successful this movie was. But I can hope for something better, because this movie was actually fun to watch.This film is almost like a parody. It is not only self-aware, but painfully aware of the whole superhero movie business too. Expect some jokes about that. In Deadpool, our main characters often say what the audience is thinking. The fourth wall gets broken, and sometimes the movie feels like it's more of a weird mind game than a movie. The humor doesn't land all of the time, and sometimes it's a bit forced, but I got over it quickly.While "Deadpool" doesn't take many things seriously, and it sure enough is not a serious movie, it still seems to take itself seriously in what it's trying to do. And somehow it works. R-rated violence, strong language, weird sense of humor and this lack of restraint of course helps, but there is a real heart to this movie that isn't defined by any of these things. Perhaps it's the source material and the respect director Miller, writers Reese+Wernick and actor/producer Reynolds pay to it. Perhaps it's the fact they wanted to make a fun movie, not just something for brand recognition. All I can say is that in a crazy movie like this, I don't expect to see any heartfelt, naturally emotional moments. But I did. This movie has a heart somewhere in it.Reynolds is very entertaining as the main character, and right now I can't see anyone else pulling it off. Well done. Morena Baccarin is good, and the special mention goes to Brianna Hildebrand, I had fun with her playing her role straight in a movie like this. Actors do a fine job, and even the CGI Colossus didn't bother me too much.One hour and a half went by quickly, and I got my money's worth. A simple, tight (albeit a little shallow and stupid) story that has fun with itself and the current state of superhero movies. Not once did I feel like there was a "message" being pounded to my head, and not once did I feel like I have to suffer formulaic boredom in the name of cinematic universes. Fun fact: No cities get demolished in this movie. I have missed this kind of simplicity, where stories don't revolve around the whole world ending. Not all comic book movies need to have the same threats, same boring and grey 200 million dollar visuals of cities crumbling, and luckily Deadpool steers clear from all that stuff. The ending felt very fitting too, and overall I had a very good time in the theater."Deadpool" is a weird example of how less is more, and how at the same time daring to cross formulaic boundaries can be rewarding. So I hope that they don't try to "tame" Deadpool, or try to recreate a formula out of it. Let it be what it is. I don't even know what it is, but I like it this way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right up Main Street.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, whom after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, but saves him from dying of terminal cancer, adopts the alter ego Deadpool. Armed with his new abilities and a dark, twisted sense of humour, Deadpool hunts down the man who kept him hiding in the shadows from the love of his life, and nearly destroying his life.......Fox did it didn't they, they only went and did it. In the space of a year, they gave us what must be the poorest comic book move adaptation with Fantastic Four (or Four), to what is, in my opinion the comic book adaptation that has not only set the bar for future movies in this sub-genre, but raised it so high, the next few movies will have to do something very special to even equal the enjoyment Deadpool has given.With the hype machine in overkill for so many months, this was in danger of falling down its own Ego tunnel, I can't remember hype for a film like this since Snakes On A Plane, and when that finally came out, expectations were so high, it predictably disappointed, and quickly vanished in its own after-burn.This works because it's a labour of love for all involved. Reynolds has wanted to make this movie for what seems like forever, and although he has had a knack of being in major comic book atrocities, this is the role he was born to play.Imagine Chevy Chase via Patrick Bateman, with the cockiness of Tom Cruise in Cocktail, and you have this, the biggest Anti-hero there is, and he lets you know he's not your typical comic fodder all through the movie by breaking the fourth wall several times, once even breaking the fourth wall in a fourth wall, thus creating a sixteen wall scenario.But it works because the makers go for broke, they don't pull no punches, as they knew they were taking a big risk with making a violent, profane laden, sex filled comic book movie with an actor whose track encore is less than stellar, hence the smaller budget.From the upstart, it's violent, sarcastic, sweary, movie geek heaven, and the film doesn't stop this until the hilarious end credit sequence.Another reason why the film works is that it's just so very random, from sampling Michael Jacksons 'Beat It' in the score, or referencing early nineties pop culture that may go over most peoples heads, or even spoiling other movies for the benefit of the films narrative, it does whatever it wants to do.If there is one negative about the film, it's that whenever Skrien is on screen, he reminds you of that blooming awful Transporter reboot,,and it takes you away from this just a little.Hilarious, action packed, and really nasty in places, Deadpool isn't just the best comic book movie ever made (and I honestly mean that), it's probably the best action movie in the English language made in a very very long time.I fear that Civil War and Suicide Squad may not have the same impact now Mr. Pool has entered the fray.Action fans, comedy fans, film fans, you really need to see this, it really is that wonderful..........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How good do you have be to not only unseat Guardians of the Galaxy as my favourite Marvel movie, but be the only movie I've seen in theatres twice within a week of each other AND the first time on opening night? Well, you'd have to be enjoyable yet know when to be serious, have clever wit and dumb slapstick in just the right amounts on a superhero level, and of course show your love for the fans right on the screen. In short, you'd have to be Deadpool.I've been banging on about this movie to everyone within earshot: in my social circles, on the Internet, at my job, doesn't matter. I've always said that Ryan Reynolds is capable of doing great things given competent direction and a good script, and Deadpool was what I was waiting for.Honestly, I'll keep this short because everyone else has already said most of the things I want to say. It's gleefully violent, vulgar, and profane, and everybody involved is enjoying every minute of it. I continue to maintain that people who don't like it are against joy, happiness, smiles and fun.</fullReview>

I've watched it three times in the theaters, I usually never watch a movie so many times in such a short time. This was so fun I just couldn't resist and I had to watch it again and again. It felt like the creators of the movie were also big fans of Deadpool and really enjoyed creating this movie. It is very accurate to the comic version and it's a great movie interpretation. To really enjoy the movie You need know some comics, the 90's and of course movies but there plenty of jokes and easter eggs about all kinds of stuff. The action scenes of the movie were also top notch, brutal and bloody. Also as we are talking about an R rated movie and Deadpool, well we can hear a lot swearing 'it's a different kind of superhero movie'. It's easily one of the best superhero movies and I've enjoyed every seconds of it, would watch it again 10/10. Can't wait for the sequel!</fullReview>

How many times has that been done already? And compared to other superhero movies these days, that is a really weak and unappealing plot.I guess I just don't get Deadpool or the hype.</fullReview>

If it's directed toward 'adults', I have no idea why it's so childish in nature - I had to finish watching it on my own (later) after a group of us decided to watch it and lasted 20 mins before there was a general vote that it was rubbish. I was sorry I tried to give it a chance - it just didn't get any better... it actually got worse!The jokes/humour is bad (really childish), the fight scenes match the humour, and the overall style and feel is more like.... well I honestly don't know... I just know that I braved it to the end and got very little out of it. For such a large amount of hype, I expected something better than this - much better.Such a high score brings to mind another movie - featuring a certain 'Max', where I just feel it too was overrated... over-hyped... and was very happy when it was over. I've loved a lot of what Marvel have done with many of their adaptations; but this certainly isn't one of them. Not by a long shot.3.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A level-headed review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the whole world is seemingly loosing their minds in a Marvel-based mass hysteria I will try to review this completely average movie with a logical perspective.In summer 2012 I swore off superhero and comic-book movies after the double disappointing punches of Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises. Since there was a hurricane of hype surrounding Deadpool I decided to break that rule (JUST ONCE!) and see what all the fuss was about. I need not have bothered.Believe me, I am grateful that this film shakes up the comic-book/superhero genre, which, at this point, is becoming extremely stale and boring. We are all suffering from superhero fatigue as these indistinguishable films all look and feel the same and all end with a big, blue laser shooting up into the sky. This tiring onslaught has to stop, and Deadpool seems to be the game-changer.However, the actual movie is not very good on a technical level and has a juvenile, immature sense of humor that just won't let up. Don't get me wrong, I love crude jokes, I mean Caddyshack is my favorite comedy of all time, but if the barrage of dirty humor and pop culture references were fewer and bit smarter it would have upped the quality of the film. The physics are just as impossible as any other superhero movie, with Deadpool able to pull of feats no human (super or otherwise) is capable of. And if he healing powers then why does he heal back to disfigured instead of natural?Visually, the film is very drab and ugly to look at with lots of greys and dull colors. Half of it seems to be set on an inner city freeway overpass, and many other scenes feature lots of cold, wet concrete, alleyways, junkyards, and empty lots. It almost has the sleazy feel of an early 80s exploitation film, which is not welcome and unsuitable for a film of this nature.The plot is smaller and easier to grasp than typical comic-book fare. There's no need for Deadpool to be expansive so focusing on personal problems and lower-rung villains was just fine. It also liked how it incorporated other X-Men characters, particularly Colossus, who was really quite sweet. It's in a different continuity from the Disney shared universe (which is a model I don't think works at all), but if Deadpool can share with some of the more identifiable X-Men in future movies I'd be cool with that.Just remember we've had R-rated Marvel movie before. Blade was a success, and I enjoyed Thomas Jane's version of The Punisher, but none of them were able to change the rules as much as Deadpool. Perhaps now the studios will invest in taking risks and stop grinding out safe PG-13 heroes who are too afraid to kill. Just dial down the in- jokes, the raunchy humor, and aim a little higher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you just hate classic superheroes with their moral principles and good intentions, well I guess Deadpool was made for you. Obviously Marvel decided to cover teenage bully demographic and give them character that they can relate to. This intended to be an adult movie but it actually is more then ant other marvel movie aimed on teenagers. There is no other audience that will be able to get anything from watching it. Very poor story, absolutely zero ideas, poor dialog and a bunch of toilet jokes that is what we get. They tried to make it funny but failed at that also. All the jokes are stupid and worst of all- not funny. This is first Marvel movie that I would not recommend seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to a cinema to view this with the OH due to the hype and some friends recommending it. And even though I wasn't too thrilled by the trailer, it did seem like a welcome departure from the avalanche of average, cliché filled superhero Marvel, DC movies. It wasn't. It wasn't funny, at all. The story, to the extent that there was one was not the least engaging and the "character" just felt like a cardboard cutout. And I actually enjoyed the other movies that Reynolds starred in. Not this one. I don't usually leave reviews on IMDb and I have never walked out of a movie that I paid to see before, but I did on this one. Extremely overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality Humor overshadowed by poor story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Deadpool to be somewhat of a disappointment. Like many I was psyched to see what could be done with an R rated superhero movie and it definitely had its merits.The constant crude humor and comic references make it bearable for superhero lovers and perhaps enjoyable if one is willing to pull the wool over their eyes and not engage in the meat of the movie: the plot.A basic love story which fails miserably in getting one to care for the characters portrayed. There is a weak bond made with the audience and the lead characters. We find ourselves finding Negasonic Teenage Warhead the only engaging character in the entire film. The others are too abstract and annoying for the majority of the time. Not what I was hoping for. Story too weak to fully be content with it as anything other than a token R rated superhero film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still cant believe how many people love this movie. It makes me feel left out that i cant love the movie like everyone else. Well lets go to the positive parts of the film, the beginning credit scene is very smart and one of the best i have ever seen, not using the real names of the actors and just using what they are playing as is very original and i didn't see it coming. some of the comedy is good like the scene where dead pool gets angry at colossus and tries to hurt him is very funny but unfortunately there are more non funny then funny. and now the negative. the love story is stupid and i did not care if dead pool would get his girl back. The villain was also really dumb and not memorable. and the worst part of the movie, most of the jokes were not funny like i wanted them to be. what a shame, what a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a box office success and I do not understand why.You know what to expect from the Marvel franchise but this was a poorly written script even by their standards. I absolutely hate the overly clichéd dialogue which has become tiresome. No real though went into the plot which is simplistic and fanciful. The special effects are good but it's loosely held together by a plot that doesn't make sense. For example I just found the whole idea that Deadpool believed he was going to persuade the person who tortured him and destroyed his life to help him completely ridiculous. That basically was the plot.I know I'm in the minority here and that's sad. There are far better films that flop. The directing, the acting and the screenplay is nowhere near worthy of the rating on here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The jokes are trying too hard. There's a few decent ones, but when every single line of dialogue seems to be some quip, it becomes tiring pretty quickly because there's nothing to contrast it with. The plot is nonsensical. So the untransformed guy was supposed to be a super jaded ex-military special ops guy and the basic plot is that he's afraid his girlfriend won't like how he looks anymore. Seriously? And the guy can heal complex fractures, take a knife to the brain, regrow an entire hand, close up full bullet holes, but can't get his skin to look normal - and that need for plastic surgery seems to be his entire beef with the almost kinda impressive bad guy that gave him immortality? Who wrote this? Unlike most superhero movies, there was real potential here, but it seem to have been wasted on essentially Scary Movie 8.</fullReview>

It's like the writers only understood that Deadpool makes a lot of jokes and breaks the fourth wall, they didn't put any effort into making those jokes work at all.

There a few clever jokes but that's pretty much it.This film story is completely boring. Without spoiling anything, it relies on the flashback formula, but here it's so poorly executed.

		<fullReview>I have been a great fan of all the X-Men and other Marvel movies. Mostly because they are movies that I could take my kids to and enjoy a good story with action and super heroes. I didn't bother to read the reviews or what the 'R' rating was for before I stepped into the theater which was a huge mistake. I assumed (a$$) that the 'R' was for the action and maybe a few off-colored words... no, no, no!! Sex, Nudity and every other word was the 'F' bomb! We finished the movie because it cost me $50 but it will never be watched again in my house! Even the story line wasn't that great, it was basically an hour and a half of cussing and vulgarity that a mom doesn't want to sit and watch with her sixteen year old son and daughter. I have learned my lesson though, I will never take my kids to another Marvel movie without checking what the rating is there for which makes me sad. :(</fullReview>

At first i liked the humor, but it was repetitive and turned boring to me. Looks like Marvel has got the key mantra of success after Iron Man and GODG. Just add some humor, some cheeky action, some sarcastic abuses and here you get a blockbuster.

		<shortDescription>As Sick As Anything Else With Barely an R Rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I hope the filmmakers and the actors involved in this stupidity lose their respect and credentials for participating in making a film that was ten times as trashy as Bridesmaids and was only advertised in the trailers as being slightly more trashy in terms of how sick you can push a film's disgusting aspics of its plot. I really think that Ryan R. is slightly a sick *** for being involved in the movie at all. I definitely hold it against his entire career for being involved in the utterly disgusting plot of this hell hole. What's worse, I saw this with my uncle in the theater and he is fine with nasty violent movies but was so disgusted with this film that he actually wanted to talk about how the world is going to hell after seeing the movie itself. I felt bad I took a tired old man to this action hero movie because he likes boxing and Arnold movies and then he looked nearly green... by the time we walked out of the sick ***. After we decided to leave an hour and twenty minutes into this basket of vomit, we asked the ticket management office at the theater if we could see another movie instead as they saw we were leaving and asked if everything was okay with our experience (I suppose because the audience might have been reputed to be a one full of screaming and inane laughing pieces of ****). We said the movie was terrible, and they felt bad enough to give us tickets to a different movie that we both were not very interested in going to but decided to take their ticket offer and see the next available movie worth watching in any respect and went to see Ride Along. I thought that movie was about thirty times as professionally written and directed than the garbage of dead pool. I am very serious that the actors who made this movie are now to full of *** for me to ever appreciate seeing again in a film. Please note I do feel that I rarely, rarely, walk out of any movie at all. Out of hundreds of movies I have seen in a movie theater, I have only walked out of 2 others than this and would have gladly sat through another nearly NC-17 movie if it was somehow redeeming in any way or matter at all. I am so glad people give up their US citizenship if this is what anyone enjoys watching for any reason at all. After I saw it at least I got to see a comedy I did not have a high opinion of to see without being disgusted with something like this. I would like to add that I took many classes on human rights through my college career and have actually watched many documentaries on human torture and mass genocide. I would gladly cry through a movie about human tragedy that actually exists than watch this ignorant crap. I believe that there are many people who saw this movie who would have paid to not see it, and I certainly witnessed a family member feel sick for a few days after watching this garbage. Please be aware it would be best to get a flat tire on the road to the movie theater to skip this movie instead of going to see it at all, and I think you have good luck if that happens! I actually think I have never seen a more disappointing movie at all as this one was being advertised as an action flick. To give you a perspective of how unspeakably bad the plot and jokes are, the entire crew and the management makes cheap jokes about who they are in the opening credits. They don't name themselves as they expect anyone with a brain may walk out of it. They instead say "Produced by (literally it says something this insulting) worthless a***" and then "directed by a loser" So it's basically a flagrant trumpeting of who the directors and producers feel they have become either before or after sitting through the film set of this trash fest. I know I am trying to give fair, reasonable comparisons by how much watching this movie really hurt and after fencing for four years in my high school I would rather essentially be beaten up in a fencing uniform by someone who weighs a hundred pounds more than I was and get covered with bruises than listen to this utter garbage. So please destroy yourself very thoughtfully in another way if you are thinking of going to see this movie in any amount of your thinking time as an adult!</fullReview>

We had similarly known little about other Marvel characters (X-Men, Avengers), and since we had enjoyed these other films, we thought Deadpool would be a funny and entertaining experience.We didn't walk in expecting it to be anything like the former mentioned films, and we knew this was an anti-hero movie. We aren't particularly turned off by violent movies if there's a purpose to the story, but nothing prepared us for this. The constant on-screen assault we experienced was humorless, pointless, convoluted and cringeworthy.It was after half an hour of constant swearing, graphic violence, smutty innuendo and jokes about cancer before the faint hope that the film would improve disappeared and we walked out.Don't think for a second you can take your kids to this movie.

This is completely unsuitable for any movie, and as Marvel movies have been geared mostly for family viewing this is entirely unsuitable.

It is like an annoying teenager who won't stop shouting and swearing to get your attention before saying "I don't care what you think" when you know very well they do care what you think. It wants to seem fresh and clever but panders to it's unpleasant teenage audience by including mediocre violence, a linear Super Hero origin movie plot, limited fourth wall breaks that are not creative and constant swearing. The narrative structure is irritating as it constantly flips back and forth in time which stops you becoming engrossed in the action. The main character is very unlikeable. He comes across as an aged school bully and the other characters are not memorable at all, particularly the bland villain and the protagonist's girlfriend who is a stripper (that's not sexist at all). He only breaks the fourth wall by talking to the audience which so many other films do already and the satire doesn't work as it seems just like the films it's satirising just with more swearing. The only clever joke I recall is the opening credits that I won't spoil if you actually want to watch this film. From then on it is boring, unpleasant rubbish.

They are the jokes Deadpool would crack, but most of the time they missed the mark and were not even remotely funny.There's absolutely no story in the movie, none at all. On top of that if you've watched all the trailers, watching movie is worthless. The entire story is - Ajax converted Wade into Deadpool, Deadpool searched him to fix his face and once it's cleared that Ajax is not going to do that, Deadpool killed him. Yeah, entire 10 minutes stretched into a almost 2 hour movie. On top of that, for some reason Ajax kidnaps Pool's girlfriend and sets target on his back. It makes no sense.Apart from jokes, Deadpool also has inner voice, but not in this movie. He's most of the time blabbering to himself because of that, making it much more unfunny.There cannot be much said about the movie as it's just extended trailer done badly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not a Deadpool fan and I'm still not, but like any superhero films I'd pleasure watching it. The other reason was, we had other superheroes in our time, so this guy is kind of new to me. It was a stunning launch to the big screen for the Deadpool as well as for this new director. This film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story. Like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining his natural life. But it yet to explain a couple of things and I hope it all will be revealed in its sequel.I am happy for Ryan Reynolds to get another chance, because his previous comic book character did not received well. I certainly liked the film, but nowadays there are plenty of superheroes to choose, in that, Deadpool's not in my top 5. So I am happy he joined the 'X- Men', because I never liked the boring 'X-Men' films or its characters, but I do love its spin off 'Wolverine'. I'll definitely look forward for his solo films like 'Wolverine'.This film broke a few records like the best box office so far for an 'X-Men' installment. A short film with the present and flashback narration shared the screen piece by piece alternatively. This was a strong R rated film so far I have seen in a superhero theme and there were plenty of other films referred. No offense to the people who liked it (and those who are going watch will do the same), but in my personal opinion it was a bit over-celebrated.6?/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is a Marvel Comdey and Action movie produced by Tim Miller. This came to theaters on Febuary, 12 , 2016. The beginning jumps straight to the action. Deadpool is seen riding in a taxi to find this "Francis" person for some reason. After endless amounts of killing and bloodshed, you may wonder why this is happening. It all starts out with Wade Wilson. An unordinary person who works as a mercenary, killing people for money. He is often seen as a villain, doing things only for himself or for the fun of it. Soon he finds the love of his life, Vanessa. Things go downhill for Wade when he gets stuck with a horrible fate that changes his life forever.The emphasis on the visuals really brings another meaning to the movie. Especially when Deadpool breaks the fourth wall it really adds to his crazy and psychotic personality. Also, the music is really unique. It just adds to the randomness of the movie but also the intensity how certain scenes, such as when he's fighting an enemy. As for how the plot is edited It was different m. In the beginning it dosn't start out as how everything happened, but it puts audiences straight into the heat of the moment. The movie transitions back and forth from certain points in the film, and this was really well devised and put out. The theme of this movie is anything can be accomplished if you put hard work and determination into it. As we know Wade lost the love of his life, his charming looks, and just about everything his past. Despite all of these factors he still seeks out revenge that he hoped was a cure for his illness. Also, Colussus achieved his goal because even though he knew Deadpool was a hard headed person, Colussus was still persistent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Reynolds is great, fine film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was good. I enjoyed it. But I can't help but feel disappointed. Sure, it's a lot raunchier than the usual Marvel adaptation films, more violent. But at the end of the day, it really just felt like yet again another Marvel film- not bad at all, but just fine. Aside from the wink-wink self- awareness (which is also trying too hard at times), it's really just following the same type of formula any "superhero" film follows. The longer the film goes on, the more predictable it gets and the duller it gets as well. I would say that I did like it, but a few hours after seeing it and I don't think it's anything memorable at all. For all of the talk about how "shocking!" it was and all of the publicity, it's really not all that shocking. At the end of the day, it's just like the typical Marvel fare, just too formulaic for its own good.Sounds like I hated it but not at all. I do feel like it could have been something truly, truly unique but what can you do. Ryan Reynolds is definitely the best thing about it though. Could have easily been too much, but he hits the notes perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**I was really excited for this movie but it kind of let me down a bit**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been waiting for this movie since the released of its trailer because it seemed really excited. As much as I want to rate this movie a 10 but let's be honest it is not that great. And I will explain this.The movie is quite short even though it is more than an hour long but the story line is really brief. I felt disappointed as soon as it ended because to me it feels like I just watched an episode of a TV show. Also the two X-men characters are ridiculous. I know that in the movie "Deadpool" did say that they don't have enough budget to get more characters. However, I would prefer not having those two characters then they can add more scenes or storyline to the movie.Otherwise, I really like the character "Deadpool". He is really unique and different from normal anti-hero characters. He is really humorous and I love his sarcasm . Also I just realize I have a thing for anti-hero characters after watching this movie and "Jessica Jones" (TV shows). I love that this movie is also kind of helping the people that have cancer like "Deadpool"( I am not really sure how to explain this but I hope you guys get what I mean).##So anyway this is one of my shortest review because a lot of people are saying that my other reviews are too long for them to be patient enough to read all of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Started laughing at the start and carried on almost all the way! Is the film gory, um yep; is the violence over the top, yep; are the fight scenes top notch, oh yep; is there constant bad language, um yep.This is not an intelligent film, but doesn't claim to be, this is a fun film, a fun adult film.It is a step away from any of the other superhero films who now take themselves very seriously (throughout the film other superhero films are constantly made fun of including the "superhero landing", saw Batman V Superman the next week, it was there!), its tongue in cheek humour is a breath of fresh air and a pleasure to see. Pizza, this film then pub and beer, a top notch night out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am very surprised to see this movie with such a high rating, I was looking forward to watching it especially since nearly everybody had given it rave reviews. Having watched it, I must say I am bitterly disappointed - if ever a movie suffered because it was over-hyped, this is it. I'm not saying its a terrible movie, badly acted or even badly conceived action sequences - its all just OK. I didn't find it particularly funny, his inane quips even started getting on my nerves by the end of the movie. Its worth watching if you are a fan of comic book heroes, you may even enjoy it - I just found it all a bit samey, if this movie was a colour it would be beige, its OK but don't believe the hype like I did and expect it to be great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 10 in its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is the perfect movie to watch for anyone looking to laugh and is old enough to digest obscenities and isn't offended.I see many people complaining about the fan boys giving a rating of 10. I am not a fanboy. The only thing I knew about Deadpool before this movie was that he featured in X-Men Origins : Wolverine. But this movie deserves a 10. The best movies aren't only the ones that make you cry, or give you the feels. A funny movie can also be one of the best. There doesn't have to be a good director and major plot twists for that. This is because movies are divided into genres. This means a very nice animated movie or an extremely funny comedy movie can have high ratings.Now for the movie,The opening credits themselves indicate that you are in for a show.Ryan Reynolds was made for this. He is Deadpool. And he steals the show. Breaks the 4th wall with ease and doesn't overdo it. He is perfect with his jokes and continuous blabbering. You won't stop laughing. Also apart from his, all other roles can be considered as cameos.Morena Baccarin looked extremely hot. A decent outing for a short role.Ed Skrein - He plays the villain in this movie. A joke for a villain his character was though. And the reason for the rivalry was stupid. But I figure this was deliberate to not shift the focus from Deadpool.Tim Miller - The director has done a commendable job to make the final product this amazing.Also I would like to congratulate the marketing team. One of the most awesomely marketed movies ever. The expectations were so high, and the movie didn't disappoint anyone.Overall it was a pleasant experience and a new one indeed.Why do I give this 10? I went to watch Deadpool to be entertained. And entertained I was. Not bored for even a second except for a few towards the end. I am so glad the filmmakers decided to take this risk and give us this movie. I hope this proves to be an inspiration for many other such equally entertaining movie. Not wannabe ones though. People who are easily or even difficultly offended, don't watch this. Stay after the credits start. A surprise awaits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Watch But Not a perfect 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very disappointed to see blatant vote manipulation on here for this movie. Don't expect this movie to be an 8, it's entertainng and a fun watch but does not merit a score of 8. IMDb really should start breakdown score instead of general score. This movie is an origin story of deadpool character in marvel universe, how he became superhero and join forces with other superhero characters. Deadpool is a superhero character but without the seriousness of a superhero. This is really more of a comedy genre with good amount of amazing action scenes. There's plenty of in-joke humor for the fans, not as funny for non-fans. I feel this movie tries too hard to be edgy and relies too much on profanity to be funny that it feels cringey at some parts. Maybe that's intentional.Storytelling-wise, I think it's quite effective. Due to it's less serious nature, the movie plays out quite well. It doesn't feel slow and draggy. Lot's action and funnies an overall entertaining fun watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy visual effect-centric flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like simple and rude humor, lots of violence and CGI explosions, this movie might be a good choice for you. But if you like anything beyond that, this movie is nothing. It claims to be original and something different from a typical superhero movie, but in fact it's plain and mediocre. The only originality is that the main character, Deadpool, is a rude person with a foul sense of humor. So what? Does it affect the story in any sense? No. Are there any interesting events emerging from these traits of our superhero? Not one. He might have as well been as dull as a Superman. And I don't find Deadpool's sort of humor particularly sparkling. For the most part, it's just dirty commentary on what happens on the screen. Besides, you don't need to see this movie more than once for any reason: everything is plain, no mystery, no twist, no hidden meaning. Why do I give it a 5 then? It is entertaining: no slowing down of action. It's visually sufficiently pleasant (but nothing out of the ordinary). Dialog is not particularly smart, but it maintains a certain level without dropping too low. And of course, Morena Baccarin is gorgeous, especially naked. All in all, it's a solid professional work. But no masterpiece, for certain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fairly unexpected (coming from already two-time superhero car-crash Reynolds) and surprisingly refreshing in a cinematic universe that's in desperate need of juice.The circus is on point from start to finish, and it succeeds so by not taking itself all too serious. Reynolds hits the spot by being ..well.. Reynolds. He balances the sarcasm with comic punchlines swimmingly and breaks the 4th wall without forcing us to cringe. Storyline may be whatever a critic wishes but we are not here to bring you deep and insightful dishes of moral escapades a la The Dark Knight. No, we are here to make you smile for the next 2h. I get that! One does smile..a lot. Heck.. I even laughed out loud!Being it became a huge thunderstorm success, it was inevitable for it to become followed by an oncoming sequel. On that however; one is in doubt. Hoping it will reprise itself gloriously? Oh yes! But, the big butter will be for it to keep itself out of the seriousness swamp! Without becoming repetitive. Unless it wants to appear repetitive. For the mere sake of yet again to be indulged as, tastefully careless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They nailed Deadpool!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan who has been following this character before he had any movies, I was ecstatic when I saw the film. I lived through the painful adaptation of Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and was glad Ryan Reynolds shared the pain. This pain gave him the drive to push for a film that would do the character justice and make fans happy - this film did just that.Now, the story is nothing special by any means, but never has his story arcs in the comics really hit any high notes but what did, was his character quirks(Motormouth, 4th wall breaking, etc). Seeing is believing and never have I seen a character portrayed as if it were jumping out of the comic pages themselves. Needless to say, if you're a Deadpool fan, this movie won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love At First Sight: Deadpool Entertains Like No Other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the abomination that was X-Men: Origins - Wolverine, fans have been dying to see a true and honest adaptation of the super- vulgar, mega-violent Merc With a Mouth, AKA, Deadpool. And, thanks to a fortunate leak of test footage in July of 2014, the day finally came much to the delight of myself and fans around the world. Simply put, there couldn't have been a better, more faithful and more entertaining film put on screen; Deadpool is one of a kind.There are many things that make Deadpool well, Deadpool, and each and every one of those things are alive and well in the film. Pervasive language? Check. Over-the-top, gory violence? Check. Breaking the fourth wall? Absolutely perfect costume? Excessive sexual content, and the greatest (if most mature) sense of humor in all of superhero history? Check, check, check and CHECK! The undeniable dedication of source material from the film's writers and director Tim Miller is felt heavily in the movie, and there's nothing that the comic book faithful wanted more. Watching Deadpool and his alter ego Wade Wilson swear like no tomorrow, crack countless jokes pertaining to other superhero movies among other hilarious subjects, and plow through bad guys with studious amounts of gore is down right fun to watch, leaving me with a smile on my face the entire time the camera was rolling. The character of Deadpool himself is arguably the greatest adaptation of any superhero (or anti-hero if you see it that way) in cinema history, a testament to the unrelenting passion of the superhero genre fan base. Fox may have destroyed the Fantastic Four, but Deadpool could not have been brought to life in a more absolutely perfect way.Now, the man behind the mask. Outside of maybe Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Ryan Reynolds has proved to be one of the greatest castings for a comic book hero, ever. Reynolds pushed for this film ever since his first portrayal of Deadpool in the aforementioned pile of garbage that was Origins - Wolverine, wanting more than anything to properly display the character, without a sewed- up mouth. The marketing campaign for the film alone cemented Reynolds into this role for as long as he'd like, with every ounce of Deadpool's character played spot on by the man who once played Green Lantern (which he jokes about in the film). He delivers his lines perfectly, acts like the total nut job that Deadpool is, makes you laugh out loud and also is able to pull at your heart's strings occasionally. Few actors can so closely resemble their comic book character, and Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool is one of those actors. The plot was as good as it needed to be, diving into Deadpool's origins through flashbacks showing how Wade Wilson transformed into the wise- cracking mercenary while maintaining the action and humor that the movie is all about. Along with Reynolds, supporting actors Morena Baccarin (Vanessa) T.J. Miller (Weasel), Stefan Kapicic (Colossus) and antagonist Ed Skrein (Ajax) all provide great support to the film, whether it's Weasel's comedic relief (to an action-comedy) Vanessa's love interest, Colossus's wonderful action or the awesome villain that is Ajax. The cast is great and helps Reynolds along the way of dominating the screen.Deadpool is easily the most raunchy, hilarious and mature rated character in Marvel's roster, a character few ever thought would receive the film he deserved. Not only did he get his movie, but it's an instant classic. The attention to detail in the characters source material, perfectly showcasing the extremities of Deadpool lead the way for Ryan Reynolds to own the role of Wade Wilson/Deadpool and wildly entertain from the opening credits (literally) to after the credits role (literally). Deadpool is a love letter to the fans, and what once was a strong cult following has turned into a global phenomenon. Deadpool reserves its right as one of the best comic book films of all- time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's great to see a film that sets out to do something and absolutely nails it. And...the makers (whoever they were) must have met a lot of studio opposition. (I wonder whether the studio learned from the Ant-Man experience and just let the writers/ director/ actors ride the wave).Admittedly you have to have an inner 13-year-old boy to enjoy it but a surprising number of people do.And underneath all the stylism, the action, the talking to the camera, the jokes, the flipping back and forth (all brilliantly done) is a great love story.Folks, you can be loved if you're ugly, though it helps if you have humour, a motor mouth, the odd superpower or two, and genuinely love the gal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay Okay Deadpool is Okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am happy to say that DEADPOOL is an okay movie. It ranks alongside an adequate school play ... or a good musician in the park ... or a McDonald's cheeseburger. It satisfies your hunger for 90 minutes and is almost instantly forgotten. A lot has been said about DEADPOOL's sex, violence and profanity giving it an R-rating and making it unsuitable for kids. I agree that kids shouldn't see the movie, but not because it will haunt their dreams or corrupt their morality. The action is so cartoonish (in one sequence, in fact, cartoons actually appear on screen) that it can only be taken with a grain of salt. Ryan Reynolds' performance reminds one of Jim Carrey circa LIAR LIAR; hyper, snarky, sarcastic and overplayed to the hilt. Reynolds breaks the fourth wall early and often - at one point, when told that "looks aren't everything" he replies, "Yes they are. Do you think Ryan Reynolds has had a career based on his acting ability?" In another fourth wall-breaker, he notices that there are only two X-Men characters at the huge X-Men Mansion, leading him to say, "You'd think the studio could spring for a few more X-Men ..." Reynolds has fun with the character and does make it his own. Morena Baccarin is very appealing love interest, and the two X-Men counterparts are adequate. Of course this is a Marvel (albeit Fox) film so there is the wiseass sidekick named Weasel, here played by T.J. Miller and in other recent Marvel projects played by Elden Henson (Netflix's Daredevil), Michael Pena (Ant-Man), Ty Simpkins (Iron Man 3), Kat Dennings (Thor &amp; Thor 2). Marvel's writers have obviously locked the stock wiseass sidekick into their word processors and won't let go of them. At least Miller's variation isn't quite as annoying as Henson's, which caused me to scuttle Daredevil after less than a half-hour. The villains are pretty standard-issue. Ed Skrein appears with no backstory, no motivation and lacking only a pitchfork and pointy tail to tell us that he's the super-evil bad guy. His character, like Deadpool, cannot be harmed in any permanent way, making them a pair of Terminators duking it out until one can figure out the secret formula. I figured that Deadpool had to go Highlander-style and cut off his head (hence the swords) to kill him, but apparently not. Deadpool is an amusing exercise but lacks the memorability of the best comic book films. After seeing The Dark Knight Rises, I literally hummed the "Bane theme" (Deshi Basara) for two weeks. I remembered the epic hand-to-hand battle in Gotham with everything at stake. The army of cops vs the army of villains. After Batman Begins, I couldn't wait to tell friends about the amazing cast, the new Batmobile/Tumbler and pictured the great scenes over and over. Avengers had moments that brought down the house, when Hulk smashed Loki and uttered "puny god" or when he punched Thor right out of the frame. Great comic book movies leave a taste in your mouth for weeks to come. You go back and revisit them over and over. Deadpool doesn't offer these things. There's no score of note (pardon the pun) or songs to remember, no set pieces to memorize, no toys to run out and buy. It's simply 90 minutes of motion with an occasional chuckle. It was like watching my kids play soccer - it was fun and made me grin, but now that it's over ... what's for dinner? Deadpool doesn't aspire to greatness but satisfies just enough to make it a mild diversion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I go movie, I think that this film will be same as other marvel movies. But I was wrong.. Until the end I watched with satisfaction. :) Dialogs jokes acting... all of them are so good. In my opinion, this film couldn't be criticized in super hero movies because its very different. Like a parody maybe or absurd comedi with very good action scenes.Xmen heros i think seems weird. Why did they add xmen I don't know and I don't like these parts. Another bad part is the bad guy is not enough to be bad. I mean, other films have more powerful and really bad guys but i cant see it in this movie.In conclusion, if we think deadpool in marvel films, this is a good film. However, i we don't, its OK not bad. I offer you that you should watch for jokes. I am still laufing when I think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is the most anticipated Marvel movie since the Avengers and for good reason. If you are unfamiliar with the character, Deadpool is the outcast of the superhero world. He's got the moves and the abilities, but rarely does or says the right thing, for that matter, he doesn't get along much with anyone either. Ryan Reynolds stars as the not so super hero, and he is literally perfect for the role, it's as if the comic book was written last week with Reynolds specifically in mind, it was that great of a match. There is certainly a ton of hype around the character, the actor, and where it may eventually lead, but the truth is that the story really isn't anything special. I assume the film is meant to be about the character and how funny he is, making the story an after thought, but how can that be in a major motion picture? The film is your typical, guy falls in love, loses his girl because of a bad guy, and then goes looking for revenge, a common theme in every Marvel film. There is nothing different, exciting, or shocking about the story. For the purposes of Deadpool, it's all about the character. He curses, he kills, he makes fun of other Marvel films, and yes he's very funny, but to me, it was also a bit over the top. Since being acquired by Disney, Marvel is trying more and more to appeal to adult audiences and wants to show that its films can be just as bloody and crude as anybody elses, point made. The first time I watched Deadpool, I thought it was a weak story and a little over the top, but the second time I saw it, I thought it was a weak story and really over the top. The bottom line, the character is great, Ryan Reynolds is amazing, there are some great one-liners and laugh out loud moments, but as far as the story goes, it leaves a lot to be desired, as it was predictable, weak, and has been done time and time again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool: "From the studio that inexplicably sewed his f**king mouth shut the first time, comes... me!".One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humor) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it's an A+ like Chris Stuckmann rated it or a masterpiece of all comic book movies, but did I have fun watching this movie? ABSOLUTELY. It's a film that fans wanted and got. I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and that's make the character of Deadpool he's own. He was terrific has the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it. The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated R and not some water down PG- 13 movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated PG-13, then you really don't know the character at all. I'm taking to you Grace Randolph. Just because some little eight year old boy (who probably doesn't know who Deadpool really is), whats to see the movie, but can't because he's not old enough to see it, doesn't mean it should be changed to a PG-13 for someone who doesn't even know the character of Deadpool. These fans have waited 7 or 8 years for this character to be done right, so this little boys mother should teach him some patience. Now for the flaws: How much better would this movie be if it had visual comedy. I mean Edge Wright should seriously do a Marvel movie, because I know for a fact that he will make the best Marvel movie ever when it comes to it's comedy, pasting and execution (something that Age of Ultron couldn't do). I highly recommend seeing Every Frame and Printing video on "How to do Visual comedy", because Tony Zhou knows some much about movies better then I do. But that's what I felt was missing in this movie and I know this is Tim Millers first big film (And an impressive one as well), but I'm just saying that it would be really brilliant if there was visual comedy in a movie with Deadpool. While I did think the writing was great, but some of the jokes in the movie I didn't find that funny. And no, it's not because I didn't get it or I didn't understand the reference, because all of the jokes and reference in this movie I understood clearly, it's just that I didn't find some of it funny.Overall Deadpool is a fresh, entertaining comic book movie that it's hard for any comic book lover not to like this movie. You bet I'll be seeing the squeal when it comes out since I know it's in good hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and Funny, but Not Perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best aspects of the movie is how it is able to poke fun at the tropes and stereotypes of current superhero movies, while still being an incredibly enjoyable superhero movie. It is delightfully self aware, and packs in more laughs per minute than most comedies.It is also refreshing to have a superhero movie focus on a morally grey antihero who puts his wants and needs above the greater good, or what is morally right, and have the audience still be able to relate to his motivations.That being said, it is far from a perfect movie. While it makes some great decisions, such as making it a "Hard R", and telling the story in a non-linear fashion, there are definitely some flaws that take away from the uniqueness of the film, listed below.1. Despite the unique concepts, and the satire of superhero movies, the film still suffers from the flaws of many comic book movies, such as:a) An uninteresting, one dimensional villain. Very generic, bland motivations. He is just evil, and not really much else.b) A cookie cutter plot. While the non-linear narrative compensates for this, it is still a very traditional super hero origin movie (Guy gets superpowers, girl gets kidnapped, guy saves girl). While it is told in a unique fashion that keeps the attention and interest of the viewer, when reflecting back after the movie, you realize that not a whole lot happened. This relates to the second flaw, namely:2. The film is not as re-watchable as most superhero movies. The trailers spoil many of the best jokes of the film, and the first 10 or so minutes of the film are essentially just an extended version of one of the trailers. Many of the jokes hit as hard as they do on the first viewing because they are unique and unexpected for the genre, but after the shock wears off, they don't hold up quite as much upon repeated viewings.All of that being said though, those are a couple of gripes that are essentially unrelated to the first viewing of the movie. The first time watching the movie these flaws are noticeable, but you don't care about them because of just how funny and unique the film is. While it is not a perfect film, it is a very important film, as it is a breath of fresh air for the superhero genre, and shows the viability of R-rated superhero movies, or R-rated blockbusters in general.This film is a must see for anyone of the appropriate age with even a passing interest in comedies, action movies, or superhero movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wild Bunch of Superhero Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is to the superhero movie phenomena what The Wild Bunch (1969) was to westerns. At a time every single caped crusader is fit neatly into a little box to justify a franchise or a team-up or a resurgence or an origin story, Deadpool dares to skewer the clichés, the faux intensity and yes even the fans. Don't get me wrong, Deadpool doesn't exactly re-invent the wheel. We've seen superhero films with a tinge of satire like Kick-Ass (2010), Super (2010) and even a little in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). The difference here is I think now people will be clamoring for more of the novelty showcased in Deadpool, and for that reason this film is a game changer.Ryan Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson a mercenary with a talent for guns, swords and wisecracking. He's nicknamed the merc with the mouth by those who know him but to troubled nymph Vanessa (Maccarin) he's the love of her life. That is until he is diagnosed with stage four cancer and has mere months to live. Sniffing out an opportunity, a shadowy organization headed by Ajax (Skrein) decides to recruit him to go through an experimental procedure that just might save his life and turn him into an unstoppable assassin. Problem is the procedure produces unintended consequences resulting in Deadpool angrily tracking down those who almost killed him.The secret to Deadpool's comic book appeal is his dark sense of humor, liberating amorality and unique abilities as a fourth-wall breaker. Throughout his various team-ups (largely with Wolverine and Spider-Man), he lampoons and undercuts any attempts at drama or seriousness with a few zingers and a lot of borderline cartoony mayhem. In that respect Deadpool became part of the early 90's jaded take on comic books only with a longevity that surpassed "The Mask" or "The Tick."The movie attempts to transcribe some of Deadpool's wackiness to the big screen and it largely succeeds thanks to X-Men side characters Colossus (Kapicic) and new Xavier School cadet Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Hildebrand). They play the straight man to Deadpool's shtick and the movie would be at a disadvantage if they were left out. Teenage Warhead in particular does such a good job stonewalling every single one of Wade's mugging and gleeful 80's references that she should get her own movie. Seriously get Diablo Cody on it right now!The other thing Deadpool has going for it is the relationship between Wade and Vanessa. Their chemistry is undeniable and composes the creamy gooey center that makes the occasionally foul Deadpool easy to digest. Unlike everything else in the film there's no irony or mean-spirited jokes at her expense. I am a little disappointed the film gave Vanessa so little to do. At the beginning Wade confesses "this isn't your average superhero movie" yet by the end there he is saving the girl.And what of the foul bits? Deadpool has gratuitous nudity, naughty language and a heck of a lot of violence. It's ironic that a movie very much geared towards the sensibilities of young teenage boys should have a hard R-rating but one can't help but admire such an auspicious choice. In fact as a former teenage boy myself I hardily enjoyed all the insanity. It never quite reaches the level of sustained, awe-inspiring, showstopping extremes I would have liked, but not every shoot'em up can be Shoot'Em Up (2007).In case you were curious, there are fourth-wall breaks; a lot of them. Many of them are geared towards Reynolds's other attempts at superhero glory Wolverine: Origins (2009) and the very poorly received Green Lantern (2011) movie. That in congress with Deadpool comparing Xavier's School for Gifted Youth to a boy band cranks the post-modern hipster dial to eleven.Reynolds has said before that Deadpool has been a labor of love for him. No doubt his entire career has been leading up to this film ever since his Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998-2001) days. Finally after years of teasing, the Deadpool film has been brought to the big screen. It's violent, dirty, childish and loose with the mentioning of rival franchises; and god love him for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Studios Goes for its First R-rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel Studios embraces it's R-rated but hugely comical Deadpool, while keeping the typical superhero formula, starring Ryan Reynolds as the titular 'Merc with a mouth.'Most people know the fictional anti-hero for his insane mentality, offhand humour, and downright positive attitude under fire, all the while hacking and slashing his victims to shreds in the most difficult of battles. From his humble beginnings in the early 90's, as a comic-book super villain, he rose to the top of popularity for his offhand comments, unique narration, and violent nature. Depicted as a mercenary wearing a strikingly non-camouflage red outfit with black panda eyes, underneath lies a physically disfigured and mentally insane man with a heart of gold. He likes the banter, and even during some of the most important comic book events (his Civil-War entries are some of my personal favourites).The film takes its own liberties, with its twisted sense of humour, tongue in cheek references (to past movies), and a hyper-level of violence. We get a lot in terms of who Wade Wilson was before he dawned the red pyjamas of revenge. His life as a mercenary isn't glamorous... it's actually impoverished. He's cocky and handsome, and the story begins right in the middle of his revenge, against the man who tortured him nearly to death and took away any chance of having a real life. Of course the movie detracts from the original comics in terms of his origins, which is not bad actually, but it was a lot more melodramatic than I was expecting in parts. Wade discovers he has cancer and seeks out a cure by requesting the help of an underground medical group that is illegally testing gene mutations on people (technically making Wade a mutant). His whole 'Weapon-X' origin story from Deadpool's previous incarnation is thrown right out the window, spat on, and stomped into the ground. It's not surprising considering how terrible Ryan Reynolds was as his first induction as Wade Wilson / Deadpool in "X-men Origins: Wolverine" (2009). Personally, I would have loved to see a more insane version of Deadpool, with the voices in his head that are constantly talking to him, his widely accepted acts of domestic terrorism, and violent slapstick comedic nature (instead of Reynolds ongoing commentary and pop culture references).This movie does have a lot of things I hate about the superhero genre. The simplistic 'get the bad guy' plot line, inconsistencies with story, a villain who doesn't deliver any kind of threat at all, the exceptionally obvious plot holes. Also, some of the jokes fell flat for me at times, and I was hearing some painfully forced laughter in the theatre when I saw this. But it is unique, very funny at times, and it's as violent as you would expect from this character.Worth a watch6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The anti-superhero superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very curious about and eagerly awaiting to see this film as the reviews about this one were overly positive despite some criticism left and right. Well I can tell you right of the bat: this movie is fracking awesome! So the naysayers were dead wrong (pun intended). It was a very bold move putting the same actor who played a much despised version of Deadpool in X-Men Origins in a completely different movie. But they play it very smart: deadpool is a smart-mouth character and says basically everything what he (and the audience) is thinking. This makes for some very good jokes and the humor (though some might call it crude or a bit offensive) is just excellent and works great! As terrible as Reynolds was in Origins, here he embodies the character perfectly. The script is written very well and the director (a director and creative producer for CGI shortfilms and cinematics at Blur Studios) clearly understands the material and has knack for bringing it to the screen in the right way. You could say this is the anti-superhero superhero movie. After all the 'straight' superhero flicks of which we might have seen too many, this is a fresh breeze and welcome addition to the genre. So if you see one superhero movie this year see Deadpool. If you are sick of or hate superhero movies this is also right up your alley. Very highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ABOUT TIME WE SEE AN ADULT COMIC MOVIE ! ! !There are too many people around that live under too many rocks and without getting too political on the matter, i would like to say; BOO-YEAH!About time we see people getting chopped, splattered, stabbed, shot at in single file (3 in line head shot) etc... &amp; all the above. And all those one liners that deadpool brings out, hilarious...But all excitement aside i had to drop 2 points on the movie because it just didn't quite hit the mark for me. Don't get me wrong it had all i wanted in a comic movie, but i would of liked to see more of the other superheroes from X-Man and others. with that said i am hoping that the sequel (if there is going to be one) will have more story and other heroes &amp; villains in it, lets hope fingers crossed XXXXOther then what i have mentioned before, i feel people are down voting for the simple reason its that they don't know who or what deadpool is or about. but for those people that do know of him and about him then its definitely a must watch. HILARIOUS - AWESOME - UNBELIEVABLE - FUNNY - AND MORE ! ! !About time we have an adult version of a comic, best yet. i wish all the other comic movies actually showed the brutality of the fighting scenes, just wish this movie had more of it.I am wondering though if they do bring other comic heroes in the mix will they tone down deadpool? But i would like to see wolverine, ironman &amp; the hulk with deadpool, i think that combo will be hilariously funny....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, if you know what to expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review here, done because this film is great if you know what you're getting into.A lot of people just don't get it. Deadpool isn't a superhero. He isn't a nice guy. He's not even a serious character. He's a parody. His entire persona and his comics (and other media) are all built around satire. Marvel has literally pushed the envelope with this character. He started off as a serious supervillain, but eventually became and anti-hero. The further they went with him, the crazier he got and the less his comics made sense. But, they're not supposed to make sense.With that in mind, the movie is pretty much a live action version of the comics. Extreme violence, dark humor and even stupidity abound. That's how Deadpool is. He's literally a joke. Treat him as such and you'll be fine. The movie also breaks through the Fourth Wall, as do the comics and other things, such as the video game. This is all part of Deadpool. Cracks about the stars, Marvel, Fox and pretty much everything else that isn't supposed to be "known" by the characters abound. Deadpool talks directly to the audience. Again, this is how the comics are. There's not much of a plot here. You're shown Deadpool's origins, which are similar to the comics, only changed slightly. Otherwise, it's basically a revenge flick and something of a love story. The plot is very basic, but that's how the comics are. In fact, Deadpool often doesn't have a plot.So, this movie is basically going to appeal to two types of people: fans of the comic and people who like satire with heavy elements of dark humor. It's also very violent and contains nudity and sex. If you're like "Oh look, it's a Marvel movie. I loved this and that from Marvel, Deadpool must be another one of those," you probably won't enjoy the film. Deadpool ain't like other Marvel comics.Oh, and if you took your kids to see this and were appalled by the violence, language and sex, that's on you. The MPAA exists for a reason, and they gave this film an "R" rating for strong violence, language, nudity and sex. Take two seconds to do some research before taking your kids to see a film. My sister did, which is why my 12-year-old niece hasn't seen this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool for President</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic story of Deadpool is in no way special - superhero against villain(s) etc., but despite the typical superhero-way-of-life Deadpool is one of the movies in the superhero vs villain cosmos that I really like a lot and will recommend with full heart for watching. First top ingredient - humor. Black one. For adults not for kids. Not only the violence but also the talking makes Deadpool a flick for a more mature audience (kids won't understand half of the jokes - fortunately one could say ;)) On top I didn't see many movies where watching killing (and the context how the killings are done) is so much fun - even if its not p.c. ;) Overlaying everything there is always the "vibe" of not taking itself too serious which I guess I like so much. On the otherhand the action scenes show far more hard stuff as the typical Marvel/DC movie, even some gore. What more to say!? Fortunatly the director/writers dared to do things different with Deadpool also Ryan Reynolds is just a perfect match as Deadpool. A movie with a similar approach/mixture of humor and violence I remember is Kingsman: The Secret Service. Also a superb flick. So if there would be a presidential election in the superhero-world I would work for the campaign for Mr. Deadpool - so there's just one choice: Deadpool for president!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Deadpool" is a thoroughly entertaining super hero flick for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring Ryan Reynolds as the titular anti-hero, "Deadpool" is the latest offering from Marvel and Fox Studios, and the first major comic book adaptation for Marvel that's made for mature audiences in mind. The movie's packed full of swearing, slapstick violence (which is still gory), and plenty of crude innuendo. Definitely not one to bring the kids to, which is refreshing to say the least. Since super hero movies have become bankable again, with DC and Marvel launching as many franchises as they possibly can, they try to appeal to the broadest audience possible, leaving gritter material like "Daredevil" to be made for Netflix, and not for the cinema. "Deadpool" is different though, it's a comedy, but it's ruder than most of the humor in "The Avengers", and it doesn't really fit with the serious tone of the "X-Men" franchise Fox also owns, so its happy to do its own thing. Telling the origin story of Wade Wilson, an ex-mercenary that now works for hire doing small jobs at his friend's dive bar, the film follows him meeting the love of his life; a prostitute named Vanessa who's just as crazy as he is (played by Morcena Baccarin), his fight with cancer, and his plot to get revenge against Ajax (Ed Skrein), a British mutant that performs experiments on him, transforming him and giving him super powers, but at a price. Going back and forth between past and present, the film never lets up in action or comedy, especially during the many fourth-wall breaking remarks Deadpool makes to the audience when joking about other comic book movies, like the failed Green Lantern movie, jabs at Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, or the lack of other mutants being at Professor Xavier's college ("the studio couldn't afford any other X-men"). The supporting cast are entertaining as well, featuring T.J Miller as Wade's best friend, "Weasel", Stefan Kapicic, and Brianna Hildebrand as the mutants "Colossus" and "Negasonic Teenage Warhead" (he's always on Deadpool's case about justice and doing the right thing, and she's a moody teen with explosive nuclear powers), Karan Soni as the taxi driver "Dopinder" who wants to get revenge on his cousin for stealing the love of his life, and Leslie Uggams as "Blind Al", Deadpool's room mate who's obsessed with IKEA furniture. My only gripe with the movie really is that the story is pretty straight forward, and that the villain isn't particularly memorable. But the movie is pure entertainment from start to finish, so I was never really bothered by the lack of originality or surprise in the plot. The original music by Junkie XL is serviceable enough, but no particular pieces stood out (but the use of other songs in the movie is well done, especially when Deadpool sings along to the soundtrack in certain scenes). Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast as the "merc with a mouth", and I'm glad that he and director Tim Miller got to make the movie they wanted to without changing what made the character popular in the first place, and I'm even more glad that it was a huge success, so maybe more adult super hero movies could follow soon after.

		<fullReview>Firstly, congratulations to 20th Century Fox for finally making a decent Marvel movie!I know next to nothing about Deadpool, just the basics, but that didn't stop me from being very interested in seeing this. Major, major kudos to the advertising department for the amazing ad work leading up to the movie!This is the role Ryan Reynolds was supposed to play instead of that horrendous disaster that was Green Lantern.It's funny, it's crude, it's VERY bloody and very violent and I loved it! It also has an amazing soundtrack featuring Salt-N-Pepa.There were some CGI scenes that looked very rubbery, quality you'd expect out of something like Sharknado.The cast and characters were very so/so. Reynolds and Karan Soni (Dopinder) were the best with Leslie Uggams (Blind Al), Brianna Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead) and Stefan Kapicic (Colossus) rounding out the better cast and characters. The villains (Ed Skrein as Ajax and Gina Carano as Angel Dust) were very mediocre, bordering on boring, and you have to wonder if it's due to the small roster of villains Fox have or they just wanted dull villains so the major focus goes to Deadpool.If I remember correctly, Daniel Cudmore, who played Colossus in the X-Men films was asked to play the character again in the film but he turned it down? Why the hell would you do that? Colossus spoke and was in more of this movie than he was in all three X-Men films!!Another thing I LOVED about this film was the constant jabs at Fox, Marvel, Green Lantern, Reynolds himself, the skewed timeline and many, many more.An entertaining film that I will most definitely be seeing again, buying when it's released and eagerly awaiting the just announced sequel!CHAPPY THINKS watching a guy in a suit turning that other guy into a f*cking kebab has never been more awesome!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the must see film of the year so far. It is witty, action packed, well acted and has the sexy Ryan Reynolds at the helm!The contrast of the journey made by wade Wilson into deadpool against that of deadpool and his vendetta against the evil baddie Francis is extremely well done! His sense of humour throughout the film together with the excellently shot action scenes make it a very enjoyable movie to watch. This film gets away with a lot being set against the sad back story of why wade Wilson chooses to embark along this journey in the first place.The only warning I say is that this film may be a little too violent and sexy for younger viewers who are used to the more traditional marvel films. Older viewers however will revel in this change to the normal marvel formula.</fullReview>

Also can say that the jokes and references in the movie were fun, almost bust of laughter, however there are scenes that can become dull when viewing all the action but are necessary to understand the story behind Deadpool, his clear way. Also the scenes with the x-men and references to possible encounters with other x-men are great and give us a good sign for the future of Deadpool. Finally I say it's a film to hang out and have fun not expecting much behind.</fullReview>

The punchlines are embarrassing. There are moments when you think\feel this movie could turn into a masterpiece in one twist of event but then it just never happens.I would only watch this if zapping on TV on lazy afternoon and then I would also NOT watch the whole thing as zapping to anything else seems a good idea at several childish moments throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daredevil Meets Terminator Meets Freddie Kruger: Comic-Action Thriller Which Breaks the Fourth Wall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The antihero Deadpool engages in four main activities: body slams, body impaling, shoot 'em-up's, and wisecracks. Probably the last one is what gives Deadpool its primary trademark, although the wisecracks are not necessarily directed to other characters. Deadpool, throughout the film which was true of the original Marvel creation, stops what he's doing, looks at the camera and speaks to the audience in true Kevin Spacey style. He even breaks further walls when he references the studio who financed the film and how they couldn't afford other X-Men characters.The film begins with a kind of CGI still of one of the action sequences with unusual credits. Instead of the typical "starring such-and-such", the opening credits say things like "Starring God's Perfect Idiot" for the star and "A British Villain" for the baddie, and my favorite "Directed by An Overpaid Tool" instead of naming the talent. This was actually one of the cleverest parts of the film. Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) has donned a costume, using the name Deadpool, and is on his way to meet his English-accented nemesis. He's in a cab on his way to meeting the guy who corrupted his face and body. His face looks like Freddie Kruger of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" fame "crossed" with a topographical map of Utah, according to his sort-of-friend and bartender Weasel.Then we flash-back a couple of years before Wade Wilson became Deadpool. He was your friendly neighborhood rough-em-up for hire. If you were in bad company of people who were even more amoral than you, you could hire Wilson to rough them up, or possibly eliminate them, depending upon your needs. Wilson hangs at a bar of strange and very wicked characters who makes the guy wanted in "12 systems" in the bar at Mos Eisley in the original Star Wars seem like a high-class gentleman. Wilson takes care of business there, and a constant betting pool is shown on a blackboard at the back of the bar. People actually bet on whether a regular in the bar might be killed. Weasel even bets Wilson would be the victim! There, Wilson meets the love of his life, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), and they begin first as a sex couple but eventually fall in love with each other. Until, Wilson finds out he has terminal cancer.He explains the situation to Weasel, telling him he has "el cancer" in more parts of his body than he can count. Then he meets a strange man who claims to be part of a government operation to make those who are terminally ill into better and stronger people. Sort of the "$6 Million Man" for Mutants. He goes to the "clinical" where he meets Ajax, real name Francis (Ed Skrein), who informs him that this is not a governmental agency at all but rather an independent operation. They make "new" people out of terminally ill patients then sell them to the highest bidder as mutant slaves. Ajax injects Wilson with some kind of mutating drug which won't create a bodily reaction unless Wilson is subjected to all kinds of torture. The last one does, but it changes his skin and face into the equivalent of pale hamburger. The only positive effect: his cancer is cured. He is able to leave the "clinic" under a rather complex set of circumstances.Then Wilson tries to find Vanessa, but he is reluctant to face her because of his changed looks. He then moves in as a tenant of a blind woman name of Blind Al (Leslie Uggams). He wants a cure for his disfigurement and creates the red costume and adopts the name Deadpool looking for Ajax/Francis. He batters and slashes people in the most horrendous of situations looking for Ajax, but referring to him as "Francis". Ajax realizes he's on his trail, and in retaliation, he kidnaps Vanessa.This film is reasonably well-written, and I liked the breaking of the fourth wall with Deadpool's comments. Deadpool's witticisms reference pop culture such as "I'm gonna do to your face what Limp Bizkit did to music in the late 90s!" or " I had another Liam Neeson nightmare. I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it." At first he tells us the film is a love story but later contradicts himself and says it's really a horror movie.The storyline is pretty basic as far as superhero films go: baddie does something horrendous to the "hero" and kidnaps girlfriend, and hero has to save her. Within the larger framework is a whole series of very violent action sequences which are definitely not for the feint of heart. In some places, I thought the violence was a bit overdone. I'm not too fond of lots of impaling. Throughout all sequences are Deadpool's very off-hand and even tongue-in-cheek witticisms. The jokes to the audience made some of the more violent scenes a bit more tolerable but some scenes were quite over the top, particularly the initial action sequence. Still, a relatively original and alternative take on the superhero genre. He even admits at one point he's "no hero". No kidding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DeadPool is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen for a long long time. Every thing about this movie was made to make you laugh from the first minute to the ending credit.I have read reviews claiming that there is no proper story in the movie,for those people i say who cares as long it makes you laugh because the main purpose of this movie is pure fun and some times this all what we need. yes i am a big fan of Nolan's Movies but also some times i need a movie like DeadPool for a relief and laugh.So, Please guys don't mix things together and try to understand and appreciate each movie genre.Also i found some reviews saying that DeadPool annoying because he talks too much, The funny thing is in Wolverine: X-Men Origin, people complained that he not talking at all. In a matter of fact DeadPool fans knew that DeadPool has a big mouth and its part of his character the thing was done in the Movie right, and actually he has the biggest mouth ever and every line in his dialogue was really funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this today and had a good time. It wasn't really more or less than I expected. Top 250 quality? Hmmm... iffy. The Marvel franchise really needed something R-rated (like "Kickass") and this seemed to do the job. I got a kick out of the 4th wall jokes (I like movies that poke fun at themselves). I thought the pacing was good except for the sex/romance scenes. There were some funny moments, but it dragged sometimes there and felt too much like movies from around 1980 where sex was inserted whether you liked it or not. (I would have had a less trouble with this, but some fool brought a girl into the theater who couldn't have been more than 8 years old. I can appreciate bawdy humor, but that's the stuff for grownups.)For the most part, the writing is good. Characters are fun. Opening scene is very creative. CGI is what I expected. Deadpool seems to carry the Spiderman dark humor, just raunchier. For those who gave 1-star reviews, I'm going to get Deadpool, Dr. Forrester and Pearl and make you sit through movies until you give better ratings. "Gigli" anyone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great great movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Witty, sarcastic humor.. Tons of great and heavy luls, action sequences, characters, MUSIC, flashbacks, quotables... One of the best movies! Gawd!! I loved Weasel's fondness of Deadpool! Ahahaha!! One of my fave characters in the movie! There were some things that weren't explained that much like when Wade told Vanessa that she might not accept him. But who wants a lengthy explanation at the end of the movie?? Maybe.. when done creatively tho... Anyway, I really love this movie!! Wish I can watch more of this genre. I enjoyed every moment and I loved the humor and vulgarity!! No dead air! Ryan Reynolds is the perfect choice for Deadpool! He sounds sarcastically great, too energetic which fit the character perfectly! Love it! I thought there was really a need for vulgar, explicit language bec. it's not Deadpool when it's too timid! Undoubtedly, one of my favorites!!! Must watch!*Watched on Apr. 2, Sat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedic, action packed, and vulgar telling of how Deadpool came to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** This is not a romance movie. Bloody, violent, and full of nudity, Deadpool is not a movie for the weak. No matter how many billboards, television commercials, or people saying how great it is, it is by no means a romance movie. However, it is a great movie if you're up to vulgar scenes, obscure language, and plenty of well-placed fires. The scoring of the movie was based on a scale out of five well-placed fires. In the movie there is a significant role that the well-placed fires play. Due to the nudity content, the well placed fires aid in keeping the film rated R.I found Deadpool to be hilariously funny throughout the whole movie. The relationship between Wade and Vanessa showed to be one of shady vulgarity and plenty of sexual contact. Although, like most couples they had their arguments at some points yet they still show a strong affection toward each other. When tragedy hits them hard, Wade sets on a desperate attempt to rid him of his cancer. This also meant leaving Vanessa behind as he set out to become a superhero. As he gets wheeled into an eerie and dark so-called hospital Wade meets Ajax, later known as Francis, and gets his first taste of torture in their attempts to make him a superhuman. While they said they would make him a superhero, their actual attempt was to create Wade into a human with super abilities, they would then sell Wade into slavery. Due to the fact Wade talks back a lot and sasses everyone with his sarcasm and humor, Ajax becomes very annoyed and tortures him even further to the point where he becomes known as Deadpool. Deadpool becomes obsessed with one thing in mind: finding Francis and making him fix the mess he's become. Overall, I feel like the directors did a great job with turning this comic book character into a well thought out movie. I loved the comedy throughout, yet it still had a feel of sadness, romance, sass, and action. Deadpool definitely earned it's way to five out of five well placed fires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie like 1 month after the release.This means a couple of my friends 'hyped' me up for this also very awaited movie. When the movie started I was ready for some good dirty jokes and a funny story. But I can already tell you the storyline is pretty bad and cheap, Like the jokes. I don't say this because it's not my kind of humor (because it is), but because the jokes we're 'easy'.I went to see it with my girlfriend persuading her she will like it. I disappointed her and the movie disappointed me. Instead of watching 'The Revenent' I made the bad choice of not wanting to wait until I can see Deadpool later. I regret it a bit.I am not saying it was a total failure but I think they could have made it a lot funnier with a real story ( not the story about his girlfriend). The story of him seeking revenge is like watching an old superhero storyline with simple 'good moments' than 'bad moments' and finely 'good moments' again.I can understand some people think this movie was a success, maybe I had just too high expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie, even for those unfamiliar with the character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Deadpool" is a fun movie. I've never seen the comics or any of the other films and television programs with the character, so didn't know what to expect. I was admittedly a bit confused at first, as the movie didn't play out like a typical superhero movie. It took a while to adjust my expectations and I have no idea of who Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead are supposed to be, but assume they are new X-Men recruits. But my lack of familiarity with the franchise didn't seriously impair my enjoyment. The acting is good, particularly by Reynolds and Skrein. Special effects are excellent, although a bit heavy on wire work for my tastes. Fight choreography is excellent. The vehicular carnage was adequate to the task. Some interesting minor characters, including the taxi driver (Soni), the pizza guy (Dayne) and Colossus. A few of the snappy one-liners were not as effective as others, but most were amusing. Makeup effects and CGI were excellent. Over-reliance on jiggly cam shots for my tastes, although they disguised much of the jitter with slow camera movements. But the movement is noticeable in many shots and distracting in some. Ryan Reynolds definitely carried the show with a great combination of wit and physicality. I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment, reportedly due in 2017.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We now live in a world where a Deadpool film exists, an extraordinary film that is FILLED with fun Easter eggs and references, jokes that are hilarious and dirty at the same time. Everyone played their role perfectly. Ryan Reynolds was born to play the Merc with a Mouth!The plot of the movie is plain simple, it tells the origin of how mercenary Wade Wilson became the fourth-wall breaking mercenary called Deadpool, through flashbacks that happen between various events in the movie while the present plot is Deadpool hunting down the man who made him look like the inside of a butt hole, Ajax.The way the writers used the characters ability to break the fourth wall and talk to the audiences was amazing!Could a PG-13 cut of the Deadpool movie ever work? Absolutely not! This character is known to make dirty, sexual jokes and have a gory fighting style. This is NOT a movie for children, they will be horrified and never blink again. You'll notice that this is a low budget movie, Deadpool even points that out in the movie.This is a simple review for an extraordinary movie with a simple plot that you'll definitely enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool has proved to be a fantastic movie with very comical and gore- y moments. The montage in the beginning was well choreographed if you get what I'm feeling. It was perfect because I love Deadpool. I first found out about him through Marvel Ultimate Alliance, then read comics about him, then played his own game, and now watched the movie! The producers really pushed that Rated-R limit and they did brilliantly. Of course they had to push it though, I mean it was Deadpool! His 4-D breaks were exceptional and his/his fiancé's references were outstanding. They cast a great villain and I hope to be able to watch the sequel since I was THAT entertained by the movie. If you haven't seen it then SEE IT, it's a must-see comedy, romance, action movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is awesome and funny. This movie really puts maximum effort into being great. It was also funny when Deadpool tried to hit Colossus in every metal part of his body even his groin area. It also has a good love story in it. Deadpool has been awesome and funny since the year I was born. I have seen this movie twice and I like it. Another fact about Deadpool is that he has a healing factor and not only can he heal wounds he can regenerate his body parts too. It is possible that Wolverine could do that too, but I don't know. He can probably do that too. I have some Deadpool comics you know. Also he's been a lot of comics with Spider-Man. I can't wait till this movie comes out on Blu-ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true spirit of dead pool. Simply awesome! This superhero flick is a perfect example of how to make an introduction into fictional universe filled with super heroes. It's funny, charming and perfect. Raynolds had truly redeemed himself from the green lantern fiasco. He's an upgraded version of his Wilder days, and that's what we like. He captured the spirit of the hero to the perfection. I took two points off, due to lack of proper antagonist representation (IMHO), same Indian taxi driver\Wilder sidekick joke, stereotypical teen and righteous Collosus, and few more glitches. But overall, this movie is a true fun. Also I'm having a bit trouble to see how dead pool will fit into marvel universe, as the style is different. Never the less, this one is a gem. I want to see it again, and I really want to see Raynolds return to this role. It's his best so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hilarious marvel story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool, the film that has it all. The humour, the pace, the direction, the acting.. all 100% perfect. Deadpool is like someone who was resurrected into another species. Whatever you do to him; kill, decapitate, torture him, he will still carry on and succeed his mission.Ryan Reynolds is now one of the funniest and most intimidating marvel character. His role from green lantern to this has improved 99.5%. I mean, what film but this would you find an uproarious and hysterical protagonist? The only R rated film has redeemed itself. This film is extremely inappropriate at times and deadpool is strongest on his comedic behavior when it comes to battles. The only reason why I left the other 2 stars is because I thought this film was TOO inappropriate and had luckily kept its 15 rated (UK). The sex scenes were very unsuitable for even 12 year olds, a bit too graphical on it. The majority of the characters in Deadpool seemed all right at times and I thought it could do a bit better with its action sequences considering it is a R rated film so it should include more graphical violence. His thoughts on revenge were very funny, especially when he used the dead bodies (towards the end of the film) to spell out the antagonist's name which suggests how serious but hilarious he is. I liked his ideas on revenge, considering he was chosen to be in an experiment to "cure" his cancer problems so I must admit, he did his job well. Satisfying Film.Deadpool, the film that includes graphical humour and images.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The superhero movies certainly aren't on the top of my list of genres. Got to admit that I found Deadpool one of the most enjoyable superhero movies I've seen.The film really revolves around Ryan Reynolds as the lead character Deadpool(Wade). Reynolds is made for this role and it is very similar to the way that Robert Downey Jr plays Iron Man. The plot really plays second fiddle to the wise cracks of Deadpool and this gives the movie a feel of a comic. No doubt this will become a franchise, but something tells me it's this original that I will enjoy the most. Check it out and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The perfect Kombination of Ryan Reynolds and Wade Wilson/ Deadpool. !! Deadpool is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is the eighth installment of the X-Men film series, and is directed by Tim Miller. Written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, the film stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano, Brianna Hildebrand, and Stefan Kapi&#x10d;i&#x107;. In Deadpool, Wade Wilson hunts the man who gave him an accelerated healing factor, but also a scarred physical appearance.Development of a Deadpool film began in February 2004 with New Line Cinema. However, in March 2005, New Line put the film in turnaround and 20th Century Fox became interested. In May 2009, after Reynolds portrayed the character in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Fox lent the film to writers, and in April 2011, Miller was hired for his directorial debut. CGI test footage created by Miller and Reynolds was leaked in July 2014 to an enthusiastic response, leading to Fox green lighting the film that September. Additional casting began in early 2015, and principal photography took place in Vancouver, Canada, from March to May. Visual effects were provided by multiple vendors, and ranged from the addition of blood and gore to the creation of the completely computer generated character Colossus.Deadpool premiered in Paris on February 8, 2016, and was released on February 12, 2016, in North America in IMAX, DLP, D-Box and premium large formats. The film has broken numerous box office records and generally received positive reviews; it became the highest-grossing R-rated comic book film and the highest grossing film of 2016, while critics praised Reynolds' performance, the humor, and the action sequences, but criticized the plot as formulaic. A sequel has been green lit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*gunshot* "Good Deadpool"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heads up this review might contain some spoilers.I understand why this movie gets negative criticism, you can't please everyone at least not with such movie as Deadpool. Not to put it on pedestal and praise it to heavens but this piece was done smart and witty.If you hate "f" words and cursing all around you're watching a wrong movie. If you like black, grim humor sprinkled with sarcasm you won't get half of the things. Plus if you don't have some basic knowledge of superhero genre you might not get half of the things (wikipedia helps).BUT if you're all in that, you can expect smart and well done jokes that just abuse this movie (in a good way) and makes you ignore super plain and flat "love" story behind it. You just want to see more of Deadpool and the movie keeps on giving. Having in mind that this movie can appeal to those that aren't involved in craziness of this character, it shows the character as central char not some side merc that gets handled by other superheros.I was never really a fan of Deadpool prior the movie I found him annoying and forced, hype around the movie didn't help either. At this moment I can't say I adore and that I'm on a hype wagon for second movie, but Reynolds performance did splendid job, from acting, script, even CGI and Deadpool in the mix it's awesome movie whole family can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good potential let down by questionable scripting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to like about Deadpool. It has a good cast, humour and action. What is lacks, is a good script.Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast as Deadpool. Comedy is where Reynold's shines and this film is as much a showpiece for his off the wall, politically incorrect and often ribald comedic talents, as much as it is an action film. The jokes can be crude but they are well timed and often, rather clever. The action scenes are not half bad either.They also mix in gallows humour that works well in the context of this film. Where Deadpool suffers, is in the scripting/storytelling department. The incessant oscillation between past and present, disrupts the natural flow established early in the film. The result is an annoying experience, where you start to buy into the storyline only to have it broken again and again by uncomfortable segues into Deadpools past. Worse still, the background scenes presented are often emotionally sugary, drawn out and frankly, at times, rather boring. This film, would have been much better served by getting the background out of the way, up front and in a more abbreviated fashion. The Deadpool franchise shows promise. It would be nice to see a second film that's more focused on Reynolds humour and the jokery action scenes, as these elements really define the Deadpool, anti-hero character. I rate the first Deadpool cinematic outing a six out of ten and mostly, for Reynolds chuckle worthy performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This comic book movie is dead on with its break the fourth wall self-demonstrating humorous style. It was a fun film to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After, the disappointment appearance in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Merc with the Mouth returns with a vengeance. 2015's Deadpool shows that movie character resurrection is indeed possible. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, and directed by Tim Miller, this Rated-R superhero film, is a rarity. Most superheroes movies tend to be PG-13, to fit larger with the general audience. Deadpool doesn't do that; it's lives on the gimmick of having extreme graphic violence, nudity &amp; sex, and harsh profanity as its selling point. Using over-the top adult-theme super hero type humor similar to films like 2010's Kickass &amp; 2010's Super as its calculus; the 20th Century produce film is by comparison, a lot more raunchy than it's X-Men counterparts or it's Marvel Studio produce film rivals. However, I felt that, the film doesn't go, far enough to use the Rated R subject matter, enough to make the paper-thin story of revenge seem very compelling. It's only use, as a joking matter. Somehow, they were able to, made normally, extremely, uncomfortable taboo subjects like incest, rape, and murder, somewhat too light-heartened as jokes than tools. Don't get me wrong, I like, how the movie use its break the fourth wall, meta humorous style, but it's only surface deep. Honestly if you cut it away, all the fan service, the movie's plot is pretty damn generic. Like 1990's action movie generic. I know, I'm probably get heat for this, but I just thought, maybe they would do just something more intense or sophisticated. It remind me too much of a low brow version of 2005's V for Vendetta without the political, philosophy and social commentary. Let again, I actually do enjoyed the small scale of the story and scope. It is a refreshing break from all the overused "saving the world" plots we have had and will have coming down the pike. I would definitely move that con to a pro. However, I can't say the same, about the marketing campaign in which, trailers are making Deadpool seem like a romance movie. Yes, most of the film, focus on him, falling in love with a former-prostitute, Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin); only to find out that he's been diagnosed with incurable metastatic cancer. However, it's here, where the movie veers from romance, into an oddly done revenge film that Wade Wilson AKA Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) honestly mostly cause, damage to his self. Offer for a chance of survival: to be experimented on (and tortured) until his body mutates and heals itself. Wade's sarcasm and caustic wit become too much, for his experimenter Dr. Ajax (Ed Skrein), who ends up torturing Wade until his skin looks burned and disfigured. After escaping from the clinic, Wade feels too insecure to approach Vanessa and reestablish his relationship with her, only to instead re-invent himself as Deadpool, with the goal of getting Dr. Ajax to reverse the treatment. If you really think, deep about it, all of this problems, is because Wade's somewhat annoying and obnoxious personality, not the weak-so-called 'British villain'. Despite the frail origin story and how he came to be, one thing, worth saying is that Ryan Reynolds was born to play this loud-mouthed, acid-tongued anti-hero with the ability to crush heads and crack up audiences. He's charismatic, exuberant, and larger-than-life, which isn't easy considering how much of the film he spends either in a full-body costume, voicing a CGI character or beneath heavy prosthetics. With his action skills, athletic build, and well-honed comic timing, Reynolds made the action scenes, so much, more impressive than it's honorably seem. I just wish, the movie would mention or use, Deadpool's comic book power of teleportation. I guess, the carries devices like the magic satchel that grant him that power and holographic disguise was a little too much to sink in, for the general mature viewer. I guess it was also decide to be cut, so to make the movie more self-contained and leave some room for any future films on the weapon X Project. Deadpool's power in this film is from his own innate mutation rather than derived from comic book Wolverine character, BTW. Another thing, that seem to be missing from this movie, is Vanessa Carlysle's mutant powers. Where in the hell is her shape-shifter or power mimicry powers!? I guess, they didn't want anything too much that didn't seem normalcy; since they had the X-Men cameos from Colossus (Voiced by Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), already bringing the superpowers part to the script. Also, when exactly did Colossus and Deadpool meet? They never establish that. It's too bad that we didn't get to see, any other X-Men characters like Cable or Genesis from the comics. I'm hoping for sure to see them in the sequel to this. Maybe, a Disney own Marvel crossover as well. Who knows!? Anyways, instead, we got T.J. Miller as Wade's only real friend, an arms dealer named Weasel, but he comes across, watchable than super hilarious. I wasn't a big fan of his work. Not sure how his star power rose over the years. I mostly find him, mediocre, as best, as a comedian. However, we do get to see an actor, Hugh Jackman and Marvel's editor, Stan Lee's cameo. Also, an after credit scene. So that's something, not to miss. Anyways, while, I'm not the biggest fan of Deadpool. I have to give the movie, a lot of credit, in making a film, the fans of the comic book series, wanted all along. Overall: I enjoyed every moment of it. A watchable superhero movie, indeed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic game changing comic book film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool has been a film I have been looking forward to for a few years now but I was always worried about its execution but fear not this film is fantastic. The premise of this film sees an ex secret service soldier with a wicked sense of humour transformed into deadpool a mercenary on the hunt for his creator. Ryan reynolds has been lobbying for this role for a few years and he has succeeded in his redemption. This is the perfect role for him because of how much he loves the character, he is the loudmouth outlandish character that you totally want out of deadpool but he also brings some humanity to the character. morenna baccarin plays the love interest vanessa and she was a really good character in the film her chemistry with reynolds was brilliant and it really helped me by their romance. Ed skrien plays the villain in this film and fair play to him because he does a good job even though his character is quite cliché he really worked for this film. Everybody else was great, collosus, negasonic teenage warhead, weasel and angel dust also really added allot to the film. The story of this film is very simple but it plays on the simplicity for humour and it works. Also the flashbacks documenting deadpools rise was great stuff. The script is one of the most unique ever written probably in film history. The humour is great with so many in jokes and some well placed drama. However, sometimes the jokes just don't hit because they were in the trailer. The style of the film is brilliant the combination of humour and action really works and this film needed to be the rated R film that it ended up being. Overall this is a fantastic success of a film and I so want a sequel.</fullReview>

I really wanted to give it a 9.5, I was very skeptical to see it because I thought that it was a bit over the top comedically in the trailers and thought it would be too cheesy but I was wrong! I think it worked very well with the story and characters. The story line was good and I was throughly entertained with non stop laughs and still had the action you look for in a marvel movie. It was very adult themed so I would recommend this for more adult oriented crowd but all in all I was very pleased with it.

		<shortDescription>So much to say about this movie from a RELIABLE person with prior knowledge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have so much to say I wish i could make a you tube review okay. I have been a huge fan of deadpool for a LONG time, when i was in fourth grade i read my first comic book which was Deadpool classic the PG one, I immediately fell in love, i looked everywhere for a movie and was sad ti realize there wasn't one. My love for deadpool grew throughout the years and i bought more and more merchandise, when the wolverine movie came out i hated it and they made deadpool so wrong that I a huge fan didn't even know it was deadpool. A year ago i hear rumors about a movie, i see the test footage, i immediately started a petition which failed but I wan't alone with this. The main reason it wasn't green lit yet was due to fox worrying about the R rating it obviously was going to get( and we now know that to be quite true of an issue) but they finally got working on it, i even made my parents promise to take me. The day came opening day February twelve, i come in with so much excitement and a deadpool shirt, and i was sad, really sad. THAT IT ENDED SO SOON! It was a fantastic movie that gave me what i wanted and more but i never wanted it to end. The opening credits were hilarious produced by ass-hats and the way that everything was slowed down reminded me of the opening for zombieland, the jokes in my opinion were funny and people who say that he never stopped talking have not read the comic because you don't get the nickname merc with a mouth fir no reason, the way they did the origin was perfect, the music was great, the way how they put the love interest in danger made it suspenseful and when he shot Ajax completely ignoring colossus made me laugh so hard, I definitely touched myself that night. People who were butt-hurt by this movie obviously had no prior knowledge on deadpool because in this movie, deadpool was deadpool. They came in thinking its just another marvel super hero movie that i will enjoy and has the same format, it is NOT. Don't go with your parents the sex scenes can be awkward. Finally if your kid is under fourteen don't take them, it is NOT appropriate for them you dint deserve a refund and no don't give deadpool a pg-13 version they don't have to watch every super hero movie that comes out. All in all with the small budget of 58 million dollars, with a shooting length of only 48 days and the main software using being adobe premiere cc, they made a fantastic film that lived up to my extremely high expectations, i already pre ordered the movie, and it is by far my favorite movie, nine out of ten chimchangas because it left me wanting more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is one of the best fun, sexy, and action packed movies ever made. Ryan Reynolds did a great job playing as Deadpool. It was smart, wider and just a great movie for all of the Deadpool fans over the world.Parents this is not your normal Marvel movie, you should double check the movie before you take your little ones to see this. It was a super wild movie that was just unf***ing believable.Deadpool is not your normal superhero he is like the anti-superhero of the marvel characters. You will be blown away to see how good this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best superhero movie after The Dark Knight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2016 is a year full of blockbusters and comic book movies. Marvel and DC are the most popular here and they are both preparing spectacles for this year. This is the first one out of six. But I wasn't as excited about this movie as much as I was about Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman, Civil War and even X-Men:Apocalypse. I expected this movie to be pretty good but I wasn't super excited. And when I came out of the theater, I was blown away! This is the best superhero movie after The Dark Knight and the best Marvel movie.After awful Fantastic Four reboot, Fox kinda got a bad rap, but they totally knew what they were doing with this one. Screenplay is just awesome and I hope it gets nominated at the next year Academy Awards. It's full of clever 4th wall breaks and hilarious lines. Ryan Reynolds fits the role perfectly and fans have nothing to be afraid of. We already saw him in X-Men Origins:Wolverine, but he was criminally underused there and butchered to the point that at the end of the movie he was no longer Deadpool. Thankfully, it doesn't happen here, and why would it? It would be absurd if they did that in his own movie. The villain is a great challenge to Deadpool and is played perfectly. An R rating also helped the movie a lot and if it was toned down, it just wouldn't be as great as it is this way and it would butcher the character once again, so it was a very wise decision to have an R rating.This was one of my least anticipated superhero movies this year, but it will probably end up being the best and I doubt any of the others will top this. It's so much fun and you won't be bored for a second and it's very well written. And also, if you're a parent, don't bring your kid if it's younger than 13 or anyone who can't bear violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I have ever seen.!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Deadpool on the premiere and I had high expectations for the movie. To say the least, I left the cinema with no regret or dissatisfaction. After the intro where they write the honest titles for the cast and producers such as "Starring: A hot guy" and other hilarious things, I could've left the movie then and there, satisfied. I love that he breaks the fourth wall in the movie, and it makes the movie thousands of times better! When we first were introduced to Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead and thought "Oh wow! We are in the Xavier mansion, we'll probably see some big X-Men characters", but we never did, and then later in the movie Deadpool says "Big house you're in, weird that we haven't seen any other X-Men characters, it's like the producers didn't have enough money to have the big actors", so funny! I cried about 5 times during the movie (Because of laughter). I've given the movie 10 out of 10 because I can't give it a higher review. Of course it is not for everyone, so don't bring your 7 year old child to the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was a 3 word-limit to write a review I would say: I love it. This movie was ALMOST flawless. Starting with acting and ending with highly sophisticated jokes about penises and anuses. The only thing that bothered me, however, was the fact that everything from the very beginning was expected. There is literally no turning points in this movie. Everything one expects to happen, actually does happen. However, this does not change the fact that the movie was just amazing and I was pleased to watch it.Deadpool was such a great comedy, solid romance, and a great action movie. All in one. It deserves a strong 8/10. But, because I'm a huge fun of Deadpool I have to give it a 9/10 :) I recommend this movie to everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool I must say is the best movie I have seen since Star Wars: The Force Awakens. When I went in to see this with my dad, we both knew it was gonna be amazing, but we didn't know it was going to be THIS amazing! I loved every second of it and me, including everyone on the theater, completely laughed their asses off every time a sarcastic remark or pun or joke was made because this movie was that funny! Now for the action, it was perfect and gory, just the way I like it. There is a lot of flips, kicks, punches being thrown, cute little drawings being colored and heads and hands coming off. The romance is spectacular along with how much it ties into the drama, not giving any spoilers, but it all works and you know the pain he's going through when it happens. This movie perfectly has comedy, action, drama, romance, and horror(kinda) all represented in one movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone I know and I know I'm going to see this at least 10 times more. Deadpool is definitely something you cannot miss. Definitely check it out even if you don't have time, make time, because there is always time for Deadpool. If I could, I would give this movie 12/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It. Was. GLORIOUS!!! Sadly I saw kids in there. I'm talking 5-7 years old. That movie is DEFINITELY not for little kids. The promotional stuff even said so. And bad reviews on crude humor? Gore? Perverted jokes? WHAT DO YOU THINK DEADPOOL IS ABOUT?!?!?! He ISN'T a goodie-two- shoes character. He is NOT a hero. He is an anti-hero. If those parents throw a fit, I'll fight them. That movie is a glorious example of Deadpool and how he behaves and speaks. It was great. Better than great! And for those same parents that throw a fit? If your kids got the jokes in that movie then you have bigger worries than your bad parenting choices. Just saying.Overall I think they did a great job capturing the essence of Deadpool. Any Deadpool fan won't be disappointed. I'd give it an 11/10, but the rating system doesn't go that high.</fullReview>

This movie could be called romantic too with very goofy kind way. And the best part of this movie I totally forgot how dirty, tragic, violence, and scary this movie is and enjoy it without feeling need to criticize it.But because this is an American movie with a lot sarcastic joke dialogue and popular culture reference, you might be don't get the joke if you aren't America and aren't familiar with those. Unlike me and my friends who practically feed ourselves with those thing, we just LOL non stop. There are few people in cinema just literally trunaroud their head to looked at us because we laughed so hard in a scene with faces "what's so funny bout that???".In the end of course don't bring your children, unless you don't speak English cause there are serious sensors on SUBTITLES in our country that's literally change the meaning for the whole dialogue.

		<fullReview>Okay when first hearing about the film I was sceptical. The idea was good but after the last deadpool which was terrible(thank you xmen origins wolverine) it looked like an attempt at money grabbing. The trailers were good. The suit looked much better and it looked as though it would be a lot funnier. It was. Between the many 4th wall breaks and sadistic comedic violence, the film was much better than expected. A weak and clichéd plot ,yes however it worked with the constant talking to the audience and humorous violence which was a very feature to include. All in all deapool is a great film to watch as long as you're fine with brain splats and sex. Maybe not for younger viewers though...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot because I was expecting it to be funny and be filled with action but it did all of that and then some. I was surprised at how well made this movie is, there are just so many great things about it.First off, the comedy is spectacular. The opening credits start off joking with you and it is amazing. After that you are constantly hit with jokes throughout the whole movie that make you laugh the whole time. Deadpool breaking the 4th wall in this movie was great as well. There were some lines in the movie that were pure genius and any fan of the other Marvel movies will enjoy them. Second, I knew this movie would have action in it but after hearing that this movie was actually very funny I began to more interested in the comedy of the movie. I did not know that this would be a great action film too. Also, there was a very good love story in the film as well. I was not expecting this either but this is where the film shines. It is able to balance all of these aspects at the same time. Sometimes it even mixes these emotions together. You could have a serious love scene with a joke put into it or an action scene that is funny at first and then becomes very serious.This movie is just great and I am glad that they made it rated R because it allowed for the character to not feel constrained and quiet. That being said, this is not a movie for children. No matter how much your kids want to see this movie, do not take them. Other than that, go see it, it was amazing and I know you want to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is hell of a deal for all the singles out there on valentine's day and even if you have a girlfriend by any chance, take her to the cinema. She'll love it! Movie's filled with humor and most of the time it comes when you least expect it. Ryan Reynolds has done more than justice to the character. Too many references of different Marvel characters in the whole movie. So you better do your homework before watching this movie. Also, try to know more about deadpool before watching. I'd give this movie 10/10 because there is no other movie you can compare it to. It's one of its kind. At the end of the movie, the whole audience stood up and applauded for about a minute. Last time I saw that at the end of "Batman: The Dark Knight Rises". Marvel has created at a master piece! Breakdown rating? Action 10/10, Humor 69/69, Plot 9.9/10, I'm keeping 0.1 because I'm jealous. Overall 10/10. Here, take it deadpool. You're awesome! And I'm sure deadpool will be having a huge fan following when the sequel comes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yeah yeah yeah...Its nothing like other superhero movies..where hero fights the villain and wins at last for sure either by sparing his enemy or saving a friend, its nothing like batman and green lantern. Its a movie complete in itself, first half of movie in the middle gets a little bit boring but as soon as intermission approaches, it gets bit more interesting and the second half is really very nice.The best part of the movie came after the credits...if you are going to watch the film in theatre, wait for the Marvel teaser which comes after the credits, you will die laughing, seriously.The dialogues in the movie are too awesome and you will really like it, but its not for the parents to take their children with them, of course it is an A rated movie with a loads of adult dialogues which seriously require lot of humor.Its also a good movie if you are going with your valentine...of course a love story too. Brilliant acting by Ryan Reynolds. It is decent and at its best comparing to other Marvel movies. It is bringing freshness to a bit mundane superhero world and the best action scenes that I have seen so far in any movie of Marvel Universe. Finally, best Action comedy and it deserves an applause from the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essence of Deadpool finally on the big screens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The essence of Deadpool finally on the big screens! The story is as follows: "ex-military and mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is diagnosed with terminal cancer, but is a possibility of cure in a sinister scientific experiment Recovered, with powers and an unusual sense of humor. he becomes Deadpool and seeks revenge on the man who destroyed his life. ". The synopsis already know that the film is very cliché and this is the greatest triumph.That's the premise of the journey of the more fuc*&amp;¨% Marvel anti- hero. The film begins with the most spectacular opening credits that could be seen, leading the viewer to laugh even before you start. The great triumph of the film is Ryan Reynolds, incorporating Deadpool, he can bring to the public the essence of character with a perfect performance, dictating the pace throughout the film. Another performance that convinced was the Morena Baccarin, playing Vanessa (love the life of Wade Wilson, it seems even film of romance). Other performances were erased and without much attention. The direction of Tim Miller (directing his first feature) is perfect, with action scenes and slow motion very much well choreographed and directed. Taking some scenes where it was not a good use of the characters. The visual effects was one of the weaknesses of the film but also with a budget of "only" $ 58 million dollars may have been the best they could.So we can say that Ryan Reynolds finally managed to redeem himself after major failures adapted starring characters from comics: Green Lantern and Deadpool himself in X-Men: Origins Wolverine. After long 10 years of waiting, the dream of many fans was conducted, see the Mercenary Chatterbox playing the 'fuck' on the big screens of the better (or worse, it is rs criteria) possible in your own movie. Even with all the difficulties of making a film with such a low budget, we have a film worthy of Deadpool and a real "treat" for fans.I'm sorry by my English, guys. My English is really really bad &gt;D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool: "I never say this, but: "Dont swallow"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HI GUYS! I Don't want to spoil a thing, so im going to talk about some aspects of the movie and rate them.THE Cinematography: Beautiful! This movie had a budget consisting of 56 million dollars. In comparison to for example that horribleness called "wolverine origins" had 150million... and the same runtime. OR EVEN funnier.. ride along 2 had a budget of 40 million. Deadpool looked a lot better.. had good cgi(especially considering the budget), had some cool slomo shots(the opening credits was a complete freeze shot and incredibly well done).. This movie looked great. 9.5/10THE ACTION: Yes sir. THIS R-rated action was amazing. Guys got shot, knived and slammed onto billboards and every bit of blood that left their body was seen on screen. The action was also smart! in one scene *kind of spoiler if you have not seen the trailers* the guy severes somebody's head and kicks it against another guys head! No "we needed a stuntman to do everything so we're gonna use a lot jumpcuts" bullshit. Wide-shots of beautifully made action. 10/10THE ROMANCE/DRAMA: You're not gonna believe this, but it wasn't cheesy.. The love between him and rachel was amazing.. They were both crazy in their own ways and that's what made them have a connection.. *again kind of spoiler if you don't know anything about deadpool* When he finds out he has cancer... You can see him in pain.. not because he's going to die, but because he will lose HER. 10/10THE HUMOR: Guys.. I have not had so many genuine laughs as i had in this movie. Im a kevin hart fan and went to see ride along 2 first.. I laughed chuckled once and laughed, because my friend was laughing more so than the thing itself. Deadpool had me laughing from the first MINUTE till the last minute. The opening credits, im telling you, were the funniest opening credits since the beginning of film. 2010's Sexiest man alive is also 2016's funniest man alive. I loved the humor, which was improvised and also sometimes written by ryan renolds. It was witty and not just toilet, poop-joke, humor. The references to his old *shitty* work he has done, but also the fourth wall breaking and... DOPINDER&lt;--FUNNY FUNNY DUDE, It was all hilarious. 20 out of 10. Don't know how to rate it differentlyAll in all, it was funny, it gave deadpool the movie it deserved and more, it was gripping, sad, scary in different ways(the torture the character had to go through, but also i was scared i would laugh so hard that i would cough up my pancreas. 10 out of 10 for this movie. I saw a lot of people complaining it wasn't as good as mad max yet it was a lot higher in the top 250 IMDb.well: 1. Their aren't as many votes yet 2. My girlfriend hated mad max because it was so focused on the action, it forget to be anything else. DEADPOOL was perfect in every way11/10, but since my rating is restricted by the great limitations of mathematics and stuff.. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Al tough the plot was cliché and predictable, the movie was so damn funny. A lot of great and smart jokes. That avocado joke made me laugh so hard. Not only the opening credits were funny but also after the ending credits we have a scene that was also funny. I was going to exit the cinema but the employee told me to stay and that it will be worth it. So I did and I laughed one more time and that scene convinced me that this movie is a comedy masterpiece. It is a definition of a comedy although it isn't a comedy genre.I watched it with my girlfriend on Valentines day and it was the best valentines day movie ever. Thank you deadpool for a great and fun time! I never expected that I would give a 10 to this kind of movie but Deadpool did really deserve it. And my last words: Best Marvel movie ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the movie starts and the crew members are introduced or rather described. I start laughing. And the rest is history........... I had to collect myself once the movie got over. Why did I have to collect myself once the movie got over ? Well, I was in splits and the mind was blown !!!!!!!!! You would find pieces of me everywhere in the theatre. I never wanted this movie to get over. The only bad thing about this movie is that it gets over ( and the fact that the protagonist is diagnosed with cancer). Otherwise, there is only heavenly awesomeness in every scene. Pristine heavenly awesomeness. Deadpool is perhaps the most shameless, unpretentious and blunt superhero I've seen off late. His jokes are audacious and alarmingly beautiful, his reflexes are the stuff of legends and if you are in his bad books you'll be scared of his jabs. He is a mutant you see. And his alter ego, Wade Wilson has an intense sex drive which is satisfied in possibly some of the raunchiest and innovative ways there could be. So when Mr. Wilson gets diagnosed with a terminal disease all hell breaks loose because he is kind of insecure that a zillion nice things would get compromised.I am not going to make this review unnecessarily long. All I can say is Ryan Reynolds has more than made up for his Green Lantern stint by playing Deadpool. His character is the sole reason why anyone should watch this movie. Deadpool isn't just a bad ass. He is a bad ass with a good ass.</fullReview>

IF you're single, go watch DEADPOOL! it's that kind of movie.2016 with full of superhero movies lined up, this movie kicks off the year amazingly well. Make way for the Superhero of gen next! It's fresh! It's Fun and it's a Marvel Epic.Some of the action scenes are mind-blowing, well for us watching in India, we don't have the liberty of seeing those extreme killing sequences and the inappropriate vulgar content even if you are 18+. That Sucks! It really does. So be prepared for few 'mute' moments throughout the movie.For all those who are probably seeing Deadpool for the first time or kind of getting 'load' of this Marvel's hero, Deadpool is a comic character from Marvel Universe who suffers from cancer, undergoes some experimentation and comes out as the most bad-ass character you will ever see. Unlike other heroes he is violent, cruel and cares least about human ethics and morals and he'll still be super cool. For all little boys who want to see this movie, well you cannot. Deadpool doesn't want to see you. Grow up, came watch! The movie contains highly vulgar dialogues and hence the R-rating. Coming towards the credits, believe me, you would not want to miss out the fun, better be seated till the very end and Thank me later :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good comic book movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic plot of 'Deadpool' is: A boy's girlfriend gets kidnapped by the bad guy and now he has to save her. But there is another part. The revenge part. Deadpool is driven to take down the man who has made him who he is right now.The directing was done by Tim Miller. This was his first movie, he directed. Miller did a very good job at directing "deadpool". Especcialy because it is his first movie. The cinematography was pretty enough. It wasn't really mindblowingly good, but still, it was nice to look at. The pacing of this movie was really extraordinary. It was really fast paced, and that fitted the theme of the movie very well. To come back on the directing again. There were no shaky cams! I absolutely loved that they didn't use that. These things can ruin a movie. The fight scenes were also well edited, you could follow everything well. The costume design was also pretty good. I thought that the Deadpool costume looked true to the comics. And the rest was good as well. The set design was good too. Now, the CGI. This is the part were you can see that they didn't really have a big budget. The eyes of Deadpool were CG, and you could tell. Also Collosus, looked a bit too CG, for me at least. And now one of the best parts of the movie, not regarding the acting and script, the soundtrack! This was really good. It's not music I will start listening to, but it fitted the movie well. Very well, actually. The violence was very good too, as I have said, now shaky cam, etc. But it was very good choreographed too. I am glad this movie got a R-rating. The blood and gore were very good in the movie.The acting was very good, but let's start of with the best casted person of the entire movie. You guessed it. Ryan Reynolds. This man was born to play Deadpool/Wade Wilson. He absolutely blew it out of the park. You can't always see his face, because of the mask, but the voice acting and body acting was great on it's own. He was like Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine. Absolutely fantastic, straight out of the comic book series. His character also had a lot of development. Then the next person is the best friend of Wade Wilso. This was a man called Weasel. Weasel was played by T.J. Miller. What I liked very much between those two, was the friendship. It was very convincing. T.J. Miller did a good job portraying this character. Now, another person who had great on screen chemistry with Ryan Reynolds, was Morena Baccarin. Morena Baccarin played Vanessa. Vanessa was a prostitute, before she met Wade. But when they find each other in a mercenary bar, they fall in love. She is the one that gets kidnapped. I liked her character. Now a man who is less liked by Deadpool, Ajax, or as Deadpool likes to call him: Francis. Ajax/Francis was played by Ed Skrein. I am happy for him that he had this movie in development after the disaster of "Transporter Refuled". Because he was very good in this movie. The only really problem I have with this villain is that he didn't really have a motive to hate Deadpool/Wade. I know Wade was pretty annoying against him, but isn't it a bit overreacting to kidnap his girlfriend? You can also say that he is just crazy, and I can't disagree with that point. But overall Ajax was well acted. The next two person I am going to discus, helped Deadpool getting Vanessa back. These two are Collosus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Collosus was voiced by Stefan Kapicic. He was good. The Russian accent made his character more funny in his own way. Negasonic Teenage Warhead was played by Brianna Hildebrand. She was very good. She was a typical teenager, with some awesome superpowers. The next two person, was just funny to have in the story. The first one was Blind Al, the person who lives together with Deadpool. She was funny, and well acted, and now the last person I am going to discus was played by Karan Soni. He was the taxi driver. He was funny as well, and acted good too. I left out the actress of angel dust, on purpose, because I don't really have anything to say about her.The script. This was a very good part of the movie. It was very funny. The jokes all worked, even the hidden ones. And with 'Hidden ones' I mean movie references, and comic book. The dialogue was very good as well. They managed to slide from a very funny tone, to a more serious tone, very well. I am glad that Ryan Reynolds got the chance to change stuff in the script, I think that that made the script a lot more funny. Another thing that was pretty good, which you can see as a part of the script, was the opening credit scene. This was very hilarious. Als the image you get at the end, was funny. A cool part of the script is the story telling. We first see a Deadpool in a cab, willing to find Ajax, but than at the end of the fight scene, we go to a origin story. I think that this was very original and well handled. The fourth wall breaking is a bit unusual at first, but you will start to get used to it. The jokes, are as I've said, very funny, but I think that there might be a bit too much jokes in it. There are also a lot of clichés, in the movie, but due to the good acting, directing, and funny jokes, I could see past that.Overall Deadpool is a funny movie. It is also a great directorial debut. I would definitely recommend watching the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd and fun parody on the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool, this crazy superhero that mercilessly kills and refuses to call himself a hero. Wade Wilson is an ex special forces operative who after his service works as a mercenary in New York. He meets the prostitute Vanessa and falls in love, but cancer forces him away from her. After voluntarily signing up to a clinic that claims to be able to cure his illness, he is deceived and tortured until his body deforms and mutate so he gets superhuman powers. Ashamed of his new appearance and driven by revenge, he takes the alter ego Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds plays the red avenger that half mad kills his way through the underworld of New York, looking for his creator.Deadpool joins Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man, as Marvel's latest more comical superhero films. The humor has always been there in the Marvel films, but these three films at times, belongs to the comedy genre. Deadpool is really a sort of parody that both mocks and salutes the superhero genre. Movie references and classic clichés are fired in all directions when Deadpool also turns to speak directly into the camera. Also sometimes the film completely stops and our hero narratively and humorously explains exactly what is happening. It's sort of playing with the genre and mixing different styles, matching Deadpool's crazy personality.It is Ryan Reynold's interpretation of Deadpool that is the driving force of the film. Many scenes last quite a while so that we all can get in on his jokes but the rest of the film actually isn't that long. I guess that's the weak spot of it. When we've understood Deadpool as a character and the parody around the genre, there's not that much left to lean on. The British villain's motive to mutate other people and his personal grudge against Deadpool's sassy attitude, eventually gets tiresome. Even Deadpool's jokes are at times childishly foolish and also the brutal violence loses its meant effect after too many decapitated heads. The best thing about the film is actually the short romance between Wade and Vanessa at the beginning. I want to see an entire romantic comedy with just the two of them. However, I don't think that Deadpool should be taken as serious as other superhero films. It is a small and odd contribution to the Marvel family, meant to provoke and take other paths than their big flagships. Light, odd and smart.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does NOT disappoint!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool was true art. There are many comic book movies these days, but I don't think there has ever been any comic book movie as true to the comics as Deadpool was. This movie may have been one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and the cast is amazing. Finally, Ryan Reynolds has nailed a superhero role and he couldn't have been any better in this movie. The supporting cast is good as well. Only issue was Ajax, who was a pretty bland, lame villain. The action was absolutely amazing and that actually surprised me considering this movie's budget was much lower than many other superhero movies. Anyway, I recommend this movie to all superhero lovers out there, (though be at least 13 plus years old.) I repeat, Deadpool does NOT disappoint!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds is a good comedian and Morena Baccarin is always one of the most beautiful women ever (unfortunately for me: both Gemini and married). The movie is simply goofy, fun, dynamic, crazy at moments, off-beat and entertaining. Full of good one-liners. Jokes really aren't as bad as some of the reviewers suggest here. If we take the whole context into the account, the highlight of this movie is not exceptional sfx, but humor. Essentially, this is a mockery, but who says superheroes cannot be fun? As many observed here, not for children (and language is a minor issue here). Still exceptionally entertaining and I watched it with many smirks on my face. Let's say: intelligently fatuous. Just the way I like it. Worth watching several times to catch all the details (yup. it's fast paced). Go for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film! Some really funny but gory moments to watch out for! Wade Wilson/Deadpool was acted out perfectly. The villain played by British actor Ed Skrein was dark &amp; moody but had a dry sense of humour in which made me love him as a character. I really connected with the storyline of a new superhero with the special power of invincibility and trying find his girlfriend and save her. I give big props to Ryan Reynolds as he totally pulled it out the bag! There was however a moderate use of bad language but not entirely out of proportion. I would definitely see this movie again and would recommend it to family &amp; friends but most certainly not children. The age rating (15+) is appropriate. Overall, a decent motion picture.</fullReview>

I judge a movie by the feeling I have after watching, and this one put a big smile on my face, made me feel good! And I never really liked Ryan Reynolds! Now, go figure! p.s.One of the fellow users put the fans of this movie into some categories.I find that very offensive, besides, I'm a middle-aged mother of three, and my favorite genre is horror and psychological thriller, so I don't think I fit anywhere.

Parents would be very stupid if they generalize all movies with costumed characters in them as movies suitable for kids. Deadpool finally received justice in treatment for a movie. This movie kept it staying true to the character's whole aspects; the fourth wall breaking, the smart mouth, the crazy comedies, and all the nicely flowed action. Though it seems that the studio put some distance to the wider X-Men franchise by only showing the group's name and references without any cameo from the previous movies, Deadpool in itself has already been a great fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest I had high expectations because the main character is presented as a funny, smart and insane guy in the comics,but, to my surprise, I wasn't disappointed at all. Tho it is one of the movies that will last for 4 years max, because the jokes sort of relate to todays trends, like internet, hash-tags and similar. But I would definitely recommend watching it and I am sure I shall watch it again anytime soon. The plot is one of a kind, sticks to the main subject and doesn't bore you with random fillers. The very beginning with the cast names is already hilarious enough and so is the ending scene (credts). In my opinion they tried really hard for this movie and gave us what we wanted as ''fans''. The next movie I am expecting is Suicide Squad, I guess they have competitors, don't they? :) Good luck SS</fullReview>

Don't let the DC fanboys influence you in any way and make up your own mind. Some people are complaining about the explicit material in the movie, but you see more of that on a regular 24hours of TV than those couple scenes you get in the movie.

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is pure fun, so long as you treat it that way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool follows Wade Wilson as he gets diagnosed with terminal cancer, and enters a program to hopefully cure his cancer. Soon, everything goes awry, and he becomes immortal, and horribly disfigured. After taking some time, he goes after the man responsible in an attempt to get his powers reversed, and becomes the anti-hero Deadpool.This movie was great. Let's start with the acting. Ryan Reynolds redeems himself for X-Men Origins and then some with this amazing performance. He has the comedic timing and acting chops you would never have expected from him given his previous film work. He's the thing that really holds this movie together, and it's great. Morena Baccarin is also great as Wade's girlfriend and eventual fiancé, Veronica. Ed Skrein's Ajax (also known as Francis) is a kind-of one-note villain (we'll get to that later), but he does a good job in the role, making up slightly for The Transporter Reloaded. T.J. miller is a riot as the comic relief, and Brianna Hildebrand does a great job as Negasonic Teenage Warhead.The writing, done by writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who also wrote Zombieland, was spot on. The movie continuously throws jokes at you left and right, and even if some don't land, the ones that do make you laugh extremely hard. Even after my second watch, I still found myself laughing at quite a few of the jokes. It's a movie that you definitely need to watch again, to be able to catch more of the jokes and more about the movie.The score, done by Junkie XL and also the general music choice, was great. I particularly like the song "Maximum Effort." The use of songs like Angel in the Morning, X Gon' Give it To Ya, and Careless Whisper were all warranted and really enhanced the experience. I think my one issue with the film as a whole is basically the villain. He feels a little one-note, as we only ever see him through Deadpool's eyes, except at the beginning of the movie. I wish he had been given a little more development and had been a more compelling villain as a whole. But, really this is a minor nitpick in a great movie.Overall, Deadpool is a fun time at the movies. If you're looking for a film that you and some buddies can just have some fun and laugh around at, this is most definitely up your alley. The acting, the score, the writing and mostly everything else was fantastic. Go see it, if you haven't, as it's a fun time. But don't bring the kids. Seriously. They earned that R rating. I want that Deadpool 2 now, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how you suppose to make super hero movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are always a ton of super Hero movies that have been made and are in the making.But I've always watched these super hero movies, and "Deadpool" hit a certain nerve in me. In the most positive way.Comic book movies seem to be all about franchises nowadays. "Building a universe". Setting up sequels, setting up spin-offs, setting up everything - and often forgetting to be a movie on their own, like what arguably happened with "Avengers: Age of Ultron, and even more shockingly happened with Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice.I would not be not surprised if Deadpool is going to head straight into that circus of brands and formulaic nothingness, because at this point it's clear how successful this movie was. But I can hope for something better, because this movie was actually really fun to watch.This film is almost like a parody of superhero films, which is what the comics were, a parody of superhero comics. It is not only self- aware, but painfully aware of the whole superhero movie business too. Expect some jokes about that. In Deadpool, our main characters often say what the audience is thinking. The fourth wall gets broken, and sometimes the movie feels like it's more of a weird mind game than a movie. And that is what makes this so much more special and original among all of these same formulated superhero films.While "Deadpool" doesn't take many things seriously, and it sure enough is not a serious movie, it still seems to take itself seriously in what it's trying to do. And somehow it works. R-rated violence, strong language, weird sense of humor and this lack of restraint of course helps, but there is a real heart to this movie that isn't defined by any of these things. Perhaps it's the source material and the respect director Miller, writers Reese+Wernick and actor/producer Reynolds pay to it. Perhaps it's the fact they wanted to make a movie, not just something for brand recognition. All I can say is that in a crazy movie like this, I don't expect go see any heartfelt, naturally emotional moments. But I did. This movie has a heart.Reynolds is very entertaining as the main character, and right now I can't see anyone else pulling it off. Well done. Morena Baccarin is good, and special mention goes to Brianna Hildebrand, I had fun with her playing her role straight in a movie like this. Actors do a fine job, and even the CGI Colossus didn't bother me too much.One hour and a half went by quickly, and I got my money's worth. A simple, tight story that has fun with itself and the current state of superhero movies. Not once did I feel like there was a "message" being pounded to my head, and not once did I feel like I have to suffer formulaic boredom in the name of cinematic universes. No cities get demolished in this movie. I missed that. Not all comic book movies need to have the same threats, same boring 200 million dollar visuals of cities crumbling. The ending felt very fitting too, and overall I had a very good time in the theater."Deadpool" is a weird example of how less is more, and how at the same time daring to cross formulaic boundaries can be rewarding.</fullReview>

I wasn't.This movie is idiotic lame joke after lame joke. This is stuff that the most obnoxious and stupid kids in the Junior-High to the tenth grade say. This was like watching really bad stand-up comedy with Reynolds narrating portions and breaking the 4th wall in others mixed with action sequences attached to a boring story. The fact that I was hearing about how good this was from some adults is what is really depressing. Ughhh, terrible movie! Comedy that ceases to be funny has little room for much else.I'm really sorry I helped with the overall gross of this box office stale joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Merc with the Mouth Finally Gets the Movie He Deserves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't many good moments in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but Ryan Reynolds turn as the motor-mouthed special ops agent Wade Wilson was one of them. Naturally, because everything in Origins is awful, they cut him from the picture early on and when he returns his mouth is sewn shut, Scott Adkins replaced Reynolds, and the character was clumsily referred to as both "The Dead Pool" and "Weapon XI". Everything that could go wrong did go wrong with the studio's treatment of the character, and the last 6 ? years have been trying to give the "Merc with a Mouth", who also has a devoted following from his fourth-wall breaking comics, the movie he deserves.Director Tim Miller has accomplished this feat with Deadpool, which may be a little rote when it comes to rebooting the character into a fresh origin story (while still getting in some jabs at Wolverine? the movie, the X-Man, and the actor), but is an absolutely delight when it throws Reynolds into the black-and-red suit and has him slicing and shooting his way through hard R-rated mayhem. Although the movie can't really do much with its thin "love story", it's enough to carry us to what we really want: filthy insults, a charming mix of clever and crude humor, and a blood-drenched, bloody good time. Moving through a series of flashbacks, the movie slowly gets us up to date on the story of Wade Wilson (Reynolds), a former special ops soldier who now makes a living by being a bad guy to worse guys. While at his favorite bar, Wade meets and falls in love with the thin and thinly-drawn Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), who's just as messed up as he is. However, their bliss is short-lived when Wade gets cancer, and seeks out radical treatment from a shady figure who ultimately leads him to meet Ajax (Ed Skrein), a mad scientist who wants to unlock Wade's mutant genes and turn him into a super-slave to the highest bidder. That sends Wade out on a mission of revenge and also with the hope that Ajax can reverse our antihero's disfigurement.While Wade certainly won't be winning any beauty pageants any time soon, the film wants to sell us on an unbreakable love between him and Vanessa that's also so fragile that she would go running if she caught sight of him. So when Deadpool tells us that this is a "love story", it's hard to take him one of his few serious statements seriously. But the character does need some positive motivation and his love for Vanessa is just enough to balance out his overpowering rage and insanity, which is where the film takes the majority of its joy. The love story angle is basically a minor, half-hearted apology for the ensuing foul-mouthed, glorious bloodbath, and it almost makes me wish we could just skip ahead to Deadpool 2 where everyone is on board with this character, because Reynolds, Miller, and screenwriters Rhett Reese &amp; Paul Wernick know him inside and out. This is almost the best adaptation fans could have hoped for, and while he's shackled to an origin story that sends us jumping back and forth in time, it's the only way to get the film out to an energetic start. If the script had gone chronologically, most of the audience would have probably tuned out before things got really good.Basically, whenever Wade is in full Deadpool regalia, the movie is electric. From the brilliant opening credits to the clever closing joke, Deadpool is dead-on with its sense of humor and incisive wit, and while it doesn't thoroughly skewer superhero movies or take note of the current climate, it tends to nail any target in its cross-hairs, including 20th Century Fox, Hugh Jackman, and others. There's nothing mean-spirited in the movie's tone; we just get wrapped up in the character's irreverence. Deadpool is just about everything you could hope for from a Deadpool movie given the boundaries of A) it's an origin story; B) it has to bring in people who are unfamiliar with the character; and C) it's upending traditional superhero tropes. Even with these restraints, the film is often an absolute blast that had me rolling over with laughter again and again. It's a shame we had to wait so long for Deadpool to mouth off again, but hopefully he'll be serving up some shortchanges in the not-too-distant future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a slightly better than average superhero movie, but that's it. It has a lot of weaknesses. Here are some of them:1. If you've seen the trailers, you've seen the movie. 2. The storyline is bog standard. The writers/director try to mix it up through an unusually (and unnecessarily) complex flashback structure that feels like a failed magic trick. 3. All the characters are underdeveloped (including Wade Wilson). Whilst there seem to be a lot of scenes dealing with character development, we are nonetheless left with very superficial, simplistic and clichéd motivations. 4. It's got tons of jokes but only a few are actually funny (at the chuckle level only) 5. It's filled with violent action but none of it is particularly creative (see a Tarantino film) nor does the violence carry any real emotional impact (see Tarantino, Netflix Daredevil &amp; Jessica Jones, or even Kick-Ass) 6. It's got plenty of nudity (and a little sex) but it feels gratuitous 7. It breaks the fourth wall but it's for no reason. The way it breaks it doesn't actually draw us into the movie, nor does it give us a deeper understanding of Deadpool himself. At best, it's used as just another chuckle level joke. At worst it takes the place of the laziest expositional voice-over. 8. Limited sets and settings make the movie feel a bit cheap. You can see where the bulk of the limited (?? - $60 million) budget was spent (initial freeway fight) and where they cut corners (just about everywhere else) On the plus side; 1. Whilst the story is standard, it's paced well. The action, jokes, swearing,nudity, etc. are all seamlessly orchestrated. It never feels flat (until you leave the theater). 2. Ryan Reynolds does a great job carrying the energy and the pace of the movie. His acting is fine, but it's his enthusiasm and alignment with this version of Deadpool that is the foundation of the picture. 3. The opening action sequence is excellent, well envisaged and choreographed. The film starts with a bang and the energy of that bang carries you through most of the film.I'm not familiar with the comic book version of Deadpool but, based on what I've read leading up to the release of the film, he does sound like a cool character. He does feel as though he could form the basis for a smart, self-aware, complex and edgy superhero movie. Unfortunately, this is not that film.</fullReview>

Dark and tongue-in-cheek adaptation of Marvel Comics' cult comic book hero (Reynolds filling out his quota frankly as a hero; c'mon buddy give some one else a break) - a mercenary who becomes invincible after being tortured into mutation after being diagnosed with terminal cancer and in a last ditch effort to be 'cured' - who seeks vengeance while dispatching sardonic quips and bloodletting with mad skills, yo. Directed with élan by Tim Miller and a tad-too-in-love-with-itself meta screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick has more hit than miss brio with style and over the top brio than your average origin flick. Baccarin adds sultry sexiness as the hero's hooker with a heart of gold and Miller's dead-pan dork sidekick much needed guffaws. Snarky and fun to a certain extent and some killer opening credits (and closing ones too); the stuff in between is just gravy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the garbage Marvel usually throws our way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year I said I hated Avengers Age of Ultron because it was just throwing one-liners at the audience. And yes, Deadpool was one one- liner after another, but Deadpool is different. It has substance where Avengers doesn't. It has a character we've been waiting for so many years. The movie is hilarious. Basically the audience got to laugh almost all the time. I think it's almost useless to say that Deadpool was funny, because we have been able to see that from the trailers and the marketing of this film alone.The story was good. It was very similar to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, to be honest. Wilson gets new powers through experimentation he agreed to, but which turned out to go not as smoothly as previously thought, and then he hunts down the people who did that to him - and of course there's romance. But Deadpool does that story way better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, mostly because it doesn't ruin any characters and other story lines while doing so. Quite the opposite: Deadpool introduces old familiar characters (Colossus) and some really cool new characters (Negasonic Teenage Warhead), and doesn't ruin them. And in Deadpool Colossus has the right accent, because I don't remember him having any accents in the other movies we saw him. Did he even talk in those? I doubt it.The action scenes were alright. But the thing is, in superhero movies - especially anything related to X-Men - I kind of hope to see a lot of different mutant powers during those fights. Like sure, we might not know who those people are, but the powers are cool. Well, here we had like two villain mutates, and both had pretty boring skills. Of course Negasonic Teenage Warhead - whom I am in love with - pretty much made up for everything else.I love the soundtrack of this movie. Thankfully it's on Spotify!Deadpool is kind of like one of those new wave superhero stuff, like Kick-Ass: incredibly violent and filled with twisted jokes. However, comparing Deadpool to anything else than a superhero movie, it's just decent. And of course I have to compare it to my favourite action movie, compared to which Deadpool is only okay. Deadpool was everything I wanted it to be - it was funny in a lot of different ways, it had enjoyable battle scenes and cool characters. It might not be the best action movie there is, but it definitely beats every Avenger movie there is. It's kind of like one of those new wave superhero stuff, like Kick-Ass: incredibly violent and filled with twisted jokes. Deadpool is worth your money, because ever comic book geek is going to love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a way to start the comic book movies of 2016 huh!?First of all, Ryan Reynolds shines in the role, truly SHINES. He IS Deadpool, and I can't think of any actor that can match what he did in the film. Second, this is rated R, and going in I was expecting, of course, a lot of violence, nudity, etc., and that aspect of the movie didn't disappoint me at all. It thoroughly goes all in with that, and I really enjoyed it. The humor was so executed effectively and was really sharp for most of the time. The action was good for the most part, especially in the beginning and right at the end. This is a fast paced movie, so for most of the movie I wasn't really bored. Score/soundtrack was awesome.With the things I didn't like with movie, it was mostly the antagonist and the second act. I didn't really care for the villain, for his character was empty and lacked background, for me. The things we learned from Wade Wilson and his back story, while was fine in the movie, it does take away some of the energy from the film itself. It started so strong that the madness does backtrack a little bit. That being said, there were some strong fun to be had during those points of the movie. Overall, this is a pure and genuine comic book movie that doesn't hold back from all the craziness and enjoyment. Don't take the movie way too seriously, and you're going to have a GREAT time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain Deadpool! Nah, just Deadpool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a Marvel comics movie about a mercenary named Wade Wilson who falls in love, is diagnosed with cancer and undergoes experiments from an organisation that - 1) cure his cancer, and, 2) give him superhuman abilities. He is lied to and told they will make him a superhero (although Wade is mainly interested in curing the cancer) and instead the group is a criminal organisation who makes super slaves to sell off to the highest bidder. They torture Wade relentlessly in order to bring out the mutant gene in him and turn him into a monster, until he eventually breaks out and sets out for revenge.The story in this movie was entertaining, perfectly paced and even when the story did slow down and get a little serious, it never lost sight of having fun. The movie initially used a series of flashbacks to switch between the present and past (similar to the show Arrow if you've seen it). I have to admit while I enjoyed the flashbacks to begin with, by halfway through the movie I found myself hoping they would stop soon and for the film to focus more on where Deadpool was currently at. Thankfully, their timing was perfect and it was at this point that the flashbacks did stop and the movie became solely focused on Deadpool's current situation. I should also note that although they used a non-linear structure for telling the story, it was constructed extremely well and the story was very easy to follow.After Fox tried to create the character of Wade Wilson in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and totally butchered it, they were always going to do their best to ensure this movie was very faithful to the comics in order to make us fans happy. However, I can not tell you just how perfectly they have crafted this character. Simply put, it is one of the most accurate on screen representations I've seen yet. Ryan Reynolds was perfect as Deadpool. His natural personality fits that of the character's so well it's uncanny. He also had brilliant chemistry with his buddy/partner Weasel (played by T. J. Miller) and they had some hilarious scenes together. On top of a perfect Deadpool this movie also has the best on screen version of Colossus yet, which for any X-Men fan (such as myself) was a massive treat (although I'm not sure why he was in "metal-mode" the entire time, including when eating breakfast). They used Colossus' good-hearted nature in perfect comedic sync with Deadpool's tainted personality. Colossus was accompanied by Negasonic Teenage Warhead (played by Brianna Hildebrand) and she mainly just played another sidekick who didn't impact the story and was kind of just there. The villain in this movie was a character named Ajax (played by Ed Skrein). There's not a whole lot to say about him as he does sort of just play the standard bad guy role without any personal or emotional motivation but he is quite menacing and served his role well enough. His sidekick Angel Dust (played by Gina Carano) was also just your typical tough henchwoman but she did have a great fight scene with Colossus.This movie is very aware of itself and the writers use this awareness to deliver some absolutely hilarious jokes. The comedy was brilliant and I can honestly say this was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. The action was fast paced and thrilling and the special effects were used perfectly to enhance the practical effects and stunt work.This movie is an absolute gem and an extremely refreshing take on the superhero genre which is saturated with PG-13 examples. Deadpool is most definitely a must see for any superhero or even just action/comedy fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool, the first truly postmodern superhero. And it's not a compliment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2008 when Scarlett Johansson married Ryan Reynolds, who I only knew back then as the sidekick from Blade Trinity, the celebrity gossip sites (another one of my guilty pleasures of that time) praised that guy for having a typical Canadian trait of self-irony. Back then it seemed like a good thing. Now, eight years from then, Ms Johansson is in the past and Mr Reynolds is by no means a sidekick anymore. But the self-irony still remains, and this time it found a fresh, almost gargantuan outlet.The genre of superhero movies is always at risk of catching a disease of repetitiveness and predictability, which is no wonder considering those big manly chins that are constantly pulling you down. So, just like Wade Wilson, at some point it had to start mutating into something fresher and more curious to retain the viewer's attention. It may be a pleasure to watch a superhero, but it's a much bigger pleasure when he is not exactly super, or not exactly a hero. Tobey Maguire might not be Spider-Man that every kid dreamed of becoming one day, but his Spidey was a person we all could relate to, with his own flaws and imperfections. A superperson who's still genuinely human inside.Then it was time for the genre to mutate again, to show that heroing can actually be fun (contrary to Christian Bale and all the X-Men's sullen faces). First it was Kick-Ass, an amazing example of how great it can be to make the protagonist a total amateur. And then, of course, Green Hornet, with Seth Rogen taking the concept of a superhero to a completely hysterically ridiculously awesome level.Well, apparently the world needs a hero again. And since all the big-chinned roles are already taken by the likes of Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth, this time the filmmakers decided to go deeper and produce a completely new type of a superhero - one that takes nothing seriously, himself included.There's no denying that Deadpool is good at being that type of a film. With Reynolds giving us a wisecracker who's both marveling at and deriding himself at the same time, and with the entourage that from the opening credits rams home the idea that no ego will be left inviolable tonight, Deadpool feels like a hot stand-up show but with fists flying, bullets buzzing and swords clashing, all in a single bedazzling whirlwind.However, the first stun only lasts for about a half of the movie, after which you start realizing that Ryan Reynolds indeed got this far not thanks to his superior acting method. The gay jokes wear out, the snarky remarks miss the spot and become annoying, and the shallowness of the sidelines gets so obvious that even the constant breaks of the fourth wall to self-admit it don't make it much better. The only thing that keeps holding you is the villains, who, despite being made of cardboard by design, hold their ground exactly because their typicality is authentic.And that is what's wrong with the postmodern approach. In attempt to bring it further on by parasitizing on the idea that there could be no "further on" at all, Deadpool eventually loops and bumps into its own rear. And no matter how Mr Reynolds might enjoy his rear to be bumped into, it doesn't compensate for the lack of heart he brings into this film, which is even comical considering the obvious binding to the theater release on the Valentine's Day, and equally tragic considering that Reynolds can, in fact, pull off decent roles, like the one in Mississippi Grind. Sorry Ryan, but this time watching you was like listening to Barenaked Ladies: the music is good and the vocals are decent, but at some point you simply realize that the lyrics are just whiny and immature, and that spoils all the fun. I only hope that Chris Evans will bring that fun back, because despite the big chin, his Captain America also has an equally big heart.I'd give it 6.5, but since IMDb only deals in whole numbers, let's round it up. For the sake of pioneering at something at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the dinosaurs are afraid of the t-Rex and all future comic book hero movies probably dread Deadpool. Reynolds sets a new standard for movies in the genre doing things comic book movies never dared before.The erotic scenes are lovely. There's quite a bit of nudity, but the entire sequence is hilarious so it's far from being porn level.The jokes are great. It's low-class humor, so if you're a snob you'd better go watch the Notebook or Titanic for the billionth time, this isn't the movie for you. The back story is cliché, that's why they get it out of the way quickly and with plenty of humor while the main bad guy makes me poop bricks in a very unconventional manner.As for the other characters. They're tools and have little depth themselves, which is just fine because especially the big guy also acts like a tool.All in all it was a great movie experience and the group I went with all loved it. If you don't then unlike Reynolds you probably do like having a stick up your you-know-what.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Marvel film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an old comics nerd, I was highly skeptical about a Marvel film featuring a hero who did not exist in the golden era of the 70's. My daughter had to drag me to the screening. But what I found was nothing short of miraculous. We laughed almost nonstop from the opening credits to the post-closing-credits teaser. Delicious millennial irony, 4th wall- breaking comic commentary, outstanding effects, rapid-fire dialog as compelling as the sophisticated comedies of the '30's, white knuckle action scenes, and maybe the best opening credits sequence in film history. For all the negative reviews, I get it. I can see why you disliked the film. But friends, you missed the point. Give it another try, take off the blinders, and approach it like a roller coaster. Enjoy the ride. It was engineered by masters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is definitely a one of a kind movie: a mash up of super hero, raunchy comedy and extreme violence, which is why many fans love the movie, and character, so much. Nobody could've played the merc with a mouth like Ryan Reynolds. His charm, attitude and sarcasm kept the whole film alive, and not to mention the rest of the cast played their parts beautifully. The story played and unfolded well too. Although the film was well adapted, it seemed to be missing a lot of action. I know, its deadpool and he's funny and what not, but they could've exchanged a few scenes for a little more action. Overall a good film, just over-hyped. 3/4</fullReview>

I can honestly say I didn't laugh once through the movie and was just getting more and more anoid at how crap the movie was and was questioning what I was doing with my life .The plot has about as much substance as a pre ejaculation, there another cock joke to go with the movie. Ryan Reynolds is annoying anyway, and this movie has made me border line hate him. I will never watch this again and definitely won't be watching the sequel.

		<shortDescription>its good if you like comics not if you like x-men movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan-boy of anything so I don't give 10/10 for anything I liked slightly. So 7/10 is a good review from me. There was only a couple of times I found my mind wandering in this. There were times I found the wisecracking annoying, but I did not mind that because it was supposed to be annoying. I liked the comic book style. For example, we spend a lot of time in silly dialogue with a taxi driver while ignoring the main plot - just as you'd expect in a comic of this nature.I found the story to be interesting and sufficiently different from other hero films to make it worthwhile (some reminiscences of Watchmen - which I enjoyed). I found the main villain also to be good; robotic in his evil as to be expected but also in some ways human (in a "its nothing personal friend but I'm forced to hurt you now" kind of way). The villain side-kick is also quite a scary woman. The involvement of the x-men was rightfully a side-issue as this was the story of Deadpool.On the whole its slightly more artistic than the usual pulp superhero movie, as was Watchmen and dare I say it, Guardians of the Galaxy (but more adult than either of those).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit that I had trepidation's about seeing this movie I was concerned that they wouldn't do the Character of Deadpool Justice. I am happy to say I had no reason for concern. I can honestly say that I was totally impressed with this movie. I found that they kept to the spirit of the comic character extremely well. I thought the writing was exceptionally well done. I like the way the story unfolded. The Special effects were there but they weren't over the top. Lastly I have to say that in the end I think it was one of my favorite movies to watch this year thus far. It had action it had laughs and a bit of a twisted moral in its own way. I know some people were upset with it but I have to be honest I think those are the people that had never picked up a Deadpool comic or even bothered to actually watch the previews. Which to me is the fault of the viewer not the movie.. I mean if your going to go spend money on a show do some research. That goes for those parents that took their kids to the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might be my favorite superhero movie of all time. There is simply no comparison. Let me start by saying how happy I am that they did not let Hollywood ruin this film by giving it a pg 13 rating. They allowed deadpool to be himself. It is witty, funny, and of course action packed with violence. I am kind of ticked they cut the budget on this movie, I can only imagine how much better the original script would have been. Usually when they do superhero movies I look at them with dread. Seeing Ben Aflack as batman makes me think instant bust. When I saw the horrible actor from green lantern staring I thought man they are going to trash another superhero movie. But absolutely nothing could have destroyed this script. It is so well written. The director did a great job in keeping it together and the acting simply did their job which is all they needed to do. I would watch this movie again in a heart beat. Best super hero movie in years maybe decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive Reynolds, but it can be better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I have too many personal biases and am very ignorant of the character of 'Deadpool', so this may not be one of my better reviews. But here I go. I felt the movie had an extreme over-reliance on immature humour. It would not have been such a negative factor for me if it wasn't for what I felt to be a 2-hour contest of "how many dirty jokes can we fit in?". The excessive everything-sex dialogue only robs the characters of their other more interesting and relatable qualities. I'm perfectly alright with adult humour, but something about this film got in its own way and came across as only pretentious and unintelligent. What could have been a simple and compelling plot was muddied. I still don't know what any of the character's motivations were, but I don't care either. And just as in so many other superhero films, there were characters thrown in from other intellectual properties that didn't seem to serve any real purpose. I find it rather distasteful when a movie like this attempts to justify the inclusion of unrelated characters only through flashy, mindless action scenes. But I understand - marketing, merchandising, etc. Overall, there was nothing compelling about 'Deadpool' aside from the lead performance by Ryan Reynolds, which carried the film entirely on its own. It was probably the most comfortable and relaxed I've seen him in a role, and he made it his own.</fullReview>

To those who are so pent up over the idea that a movie would have sex, jokes, break the fourth wall, grotesque violence, and so much more, please get over yourself.To begin with, I have four kids, two younger than 18. When the previews came out I did a littler research. Not for kids. So I didn't take mine. I knew what I was getting into. Sex, violence, jokes, jokes about sex and violence. I am 38 with a master's degree and teach at the high school level. And the movie was great. I laughed until I cried and ended up coughing because I was laughing so hard. To those who were offended by this movie. You obviously have a a certain set of standards for movies that you think ALL movies should have. You knew what you were getting into. It had an R rating. It was very evident what would be in the movie. To trash the movie because it did not fit into your world view that all superhero movies should be exactly like X-Men or Batman. Please get over yourself. Sometimes people want to see something nasty and over the top and get a good laugh. Mission accomplished. See this if you want the low hanging fruit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Superhero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the opening credits itself you'll find yourself realizing that this is the kind of superhero movie which is definitely different. In fact, it wouldn't be wrong to say that it is a much-needed shot in the arm for the superhero genre in general. While there has been no shortage of comic book hero adaptations into film in recent times, Deadpool is one with a difference. For one, it breaks the fourth wall - that barrier between the film and the audience. This results in the kind of viewer involvement that is both endearing and extremely refreshing.We find out about how Wade Wilson came to be a superhero via a series of jump cuts, flashbacks and oodles of humour. And then there's Wade's girlfriend, the feisty Vanessa (Baccarin) who is as messed up as he is. While their brand of romance has to be seen to be believed, their chemistry manages to be downright kinky to say the least, but delightfully enough, very real.Wade's buddy Weasel (Miller), a barkeep, is also his wingman. And when both Wade and Weasel share screen space, they're a laugh riot. While the rest of the cast is suitably funny (don't miss the fantastically-named Negasonic Teenage Warhead, played by Hildebrand), this really is Reynolds' moment in the sun all the way. He surely has come a long way since 2011's very ordinary Green Lantern. In fact, what elevates this movie to another level is not just the snarky one- liners, but the plethora of cross-references to a lot of other superhero films as well. Supported by a very clever script, Deadpool is deliciously irreverent, subversive and uproariously funny.</fullReview>

I was with a friend who bought the tickets so I stayed, but would have left after 20 minutes.The other user reviews will describe the puerile humour, the bad jokes, the embarrassing attempts at comedy. It was a nauseating experience at times.I spent the film on my phone on the IMDb website, trying to understand how it was so highly rated. I noticed that a deluge of 10.0 ratings were received around February 14 2016. This can't be a coincidence.The Studio has obviously paid a bunch of interns to write fake reviews so that the film would be highly rated on IMDb and other sites. This is fraudulent and I will never trust IMDb again.IMDb should be ashamed of itself for allowing this to happen. I'm so sick of Hollywood and the movie industry in general.Aside from the above fake reviews, the film is littered with the usual political BS: beta male sacrificing himself for a woman (a whore actually), tiny women saving men's lives, tiny women beating the crap out of giant men, etc, etc, etc. I'm done with this propaganda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be fair I've never been a fan of deadpool as a comic character. I find him unoriginal, crass, and tiring. And that's pretty much how his movie turned out. On one of the rare occasions when the wife and I got some time away from our daughter, we decided to see whatever was on at the local cinema. Sadly it was deadpool.It's not completely terrible, there are some cool visuals, and a few of the jokes hit the mark. it's the jokes though that really drag the movie down. They are just unending, incessantly trying to make you laugh and "shock" you with their "adult" content. But they're just not funny in most instances. The humour is juvenile in the extreme. I find it concerning all these so-called mature reviewers praising the movie for catering to their adult tastes.Likewise the violence is so over the top it is neither shocking nor effective. It doesn't serve the story in any meaningful way, so it is just there for the 'adult' fans to marvel at all the blood and brain splatter. Overall a pretty disappointing cinema experience, but kind of as expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Full disclosure, I have not yet enjoyed any of the many critically acclaimed Marvel movies. I find 'The Avengers' et al. to be contrived visual spectacles devoid of any real cinematic merit. It's hackneyed film making. Trash. I went to see Deadpool with dampened expectations, but I had a bit of hope in me given the 'R' rating and the hints at it being a little more subversive than its sister films. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.This is just another lifeless Hollywood blockbuster, albeit with a mask on. Breaking the fourth wall (repeatedly), blood, guts, nudity and all of the crude humour you could ever want. Sure, sounds great, right..? Not this time. If you put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig. Marvel has been pushing pigs out year after year, this one is just wearing a little more makeup than usual. It's still a generic shell of a film devoid of any substance. The plot and comedic devices are all entirely predictable.The jokes were forced and relentless. I dig profanity and violence and all things crude, but there was no nuance here. This film was a struggle to sit through, it was just all so... lame. They could have made something truly subversive and critical of the superhero genre, instead they just made another standard Marvel film with cursing. How disappointing.</fullReview>

That's what happens if you give a bad ass character over to Disney. No matter how many times the "F" word is being used, it is still a FAMILY movie. OK maybe a family of children above 15. So I repeat, there is no story at all. Someone scorched his skin, he goes after him, finds him, takes revenge. Movie is over. However being said all this, the opening credits kind of warn you about the movie by stating how overly paid director was hired or there is a token comic character and an English villain. Awful, yeah, time killed indeed yeah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated Comedy with little Depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of now, this movie somehow has the same top rating as Saving Private Ryan and Raiders of the Lost Ark?Hardly think this movie belongs anywhere close, merely blown up by comic book fans who think that a guy who wears a mask with crude jokes is the best movie of all time.Forced comedy, lack of a story-line makes this movie more of a DVD watch on a lazy Tuesday evening. Reynolds is good, and this is his perfect role. Certainly entertaining for college students and comic book junkies but this is a one time watch at best for those who appreciate a quality story and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused, wanted to like it but just couldn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I like Marvel/Superhero films bit of mindless escapism for an hour or two but Deadpool.....humm left me confused.I'm a geek,nerd (albeit a rather big one)but one thing that geeks and nerds can't do is humour, Big Bang gets away with it because it's geek humour not trying to be anything but geek humour where Deadpool falls flat is it's geeks trying to be cool which just doesn't work.The only reason I give it 5 out of 10 is because of Morena Baccarin who's woefully under used in most films. The film itself just feels like a procession of adverts spread over nearly 2 hours, couple minutes of dialogue then action scene couple of minutes dialogue then action scene rinse repeat.If being an anti hero is as simple as just being annoying glib when everything is going to pot, then possibly the UK has around 30 million anti-hero's walking around. Sarcasm and dry wit is something Americans just can't do well (with a couple of notable exceptions, Bill Murray being one).The whole thing just stank of laziness. Possibly a great film for teenagers and emotionally/socially immature people but as for the rest just a silly predictable and pretty unfunny film.Not going to remark too much on the lead actor apart from the fact that he was much more interesting in the film before he actually became Deadpool when he was just Wade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultraviolent. Bad language all the way. Average acting. 3 laughs. A slow-mo butchery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously folks.I left this movie with a bad taste on my mouth. Cold blood killing, bad language, mediocre plot, actors acting like they don't give a s**t. And of course, high-definition, super slow motion violence. But it's violence, it's killing, for the fun of it, if such a thing does exist. I watched the latest Mad Max, also violent, but with a story gluing it, in a post-apocalyptic age. Deadpool is something made to make you feel insensible to violence and torture. There is indeed some little fun amongst the ultra violence, but it's just not worth it. The final scenes made me feel I was at the butchery. If you go, go alone. But tell me: what type of entertainment is this, that wants you to laugh at so much violence? Any good there?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Costume Should Have Stayed Green!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time in a theater since 2005...Walked Out 27 minutes in!!! This is not my Deadpool!!! Seems they were more concerned with the "4th wall" and sales instead of continuity. This Hurts!!! I had conversations with people about how I felt DC was winning against Marvel because of realism versus being campy. My argument remains and most likely will stay the same after March 25. This Film is a poor attempt to take the greatness and diversity of a character such as DP and make him an Everyman. You can take some characters and make them relate-able(spell check) but DP is not that guy!!! I never saw grit...instead I saw Ryan Reynolds...I never saw insanity...instead I saw Childish Humor...I never saw a movable character...instead I saw a Meme!!! Unfortunately this is the worst of the Marvel Films ever (To Me) and it was made not for us (Comic Lovers) and the people that see our passion and can only relate through film but for the "Sheeople" who like the sensation of hype.Thank You!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can see why Fox never wanted to film this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most misogynistic of all of Marvel's characters. I can see why Fox never wanted to film it. The script is loaded with sexist, borderline racist, pseudo-intellectual drivel (obscure pop cultural references are stupid, not smart). Why the hell would a middle-aged, disabled, African American woman put up with Ryan Reynold's arrogant white frat boy stupidity? My first reaction to seeing him lean on Big Al's shoulder was to punch his head. In Deadpool's world there are two types of women. The first is like his real life wife (Blake Lively)--the "good woman"--thin, anxious, insecure, helpless, religiously adheres to the trappings of traditional womanhood, and lives only to make sure her boyfriend/husband doesn't leave her by crowning him the center of her universe. Then there are all the other women--the lesbian, the un-feminine, the older woman, the strong/violent woman, the woman that has other priorities than to run around pleasing men like it's the sole purpose of her existence (reality check: most women have a heckuvalot more problems and responsibilities in life than to run in circles trying to make some guy happy--it's adolescent male arrogance to assume otherwise). These are the "inappropriate" women and their silence is in stark contrast to Deadpool's endless prattle. No smart alec retorts will ever come from them because only Deadpool and his white male friends are allowed to be vocal and "witty". In Deadpool's world white male privilege reigns supreme. Neither women nor people of color are permitted to have a personality, strong opinions, or an attitude.I am a huge science fiction and fantasy genre fan. If Fox and Marvel are going to keep churning out sexist, racially insensitive crap like this, I'll be voting with my dollar and watch something less insulting at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DeadpoolWhen the random shooter jobs are all taken, mercenary work is the next best option for ex-military.However, the garrulous gunman in this action-comedy proves you can do both.Mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) undergoes cancer treatment for his girlfriend (Morena Baccarin). But instead of a cure, the formula activates his mutant healing ability and leaves him disfigured.With help from some X-Men (Brianna Hildebrand, Stefan Kapi&#x10d;i&#x107;) he adopts a mask, a moniker and a light-hearted outlook on his off kilter quest for revenge on the perpetrator (Ed Skrein).From Reynolds on-point portrayal, to the cartoony violence and the fourth-wall narrative, this reappearance of Marvel's merc with a mouth after his ill-fated debut in an earlier X-film is a ribald and refreshing reboot that is as faithful to the self-aware smart-ass as can be.Furthermore, it shows burn victims a jazzy costume is all they need to reacclimatize to society.

From the other hand his jokes are so on time and you cannot even predict or expect that this is a very place for a joke, like joking while you have somebody beaded onto your swords or jokes about the color of your pants.A story of the former soldier, romantic hero and revenger, who has suddenly got untreatable disease is always so touching and mostly aimed for the female audience, but the producer poured here special effects and humor which finally allowed to get highest scores from all over the World.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Deadpool' redefines the superhero genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superhero movies of recency have been following a similar pattern. It starts with the familiar origin story of the hero and then the introduction of a villain that usually only arises because of the hero. And then the ending sets up for a sequel or a crossover."Deadpool," starring Ryan Reynolds as the anti-hero, takes a much different path, hence the R-rating. Wade Wilson is an ex Special Forces operative turned mercenary who is diagnosed with terminal cancer and desperately seeks help from a medicinal experimentation group that specializes in mutations. The mutation methods are tortuous and although he gains accelerated healing powers he is left with a mutilated and hideous face. As a result, Wilson goes on a hunt of revenge for the evil doctor that made his face ugly."Deadpool" is one of the first R-rated superhero movies for its language, crude humor, gore, and sexual content. This is not the typical superhero movie, largely because Wilson is not a superhero. He doesn't save people unless he cares about them and he takes pleasure in murder.The plot of his movie is simple but that isn't what pushes the movie forward. It is the very well done character and his snide remarks. There are a handful of juvenile remarks in the movie but they are easy to get past after the fantastic opening, which features over the top stylized violence with "Angel of the Morning" blasting in the background.The film is also unique in its nonlinear storytelling and self awareness due to Wilson's ability to break the fourth wall. No other superhero movie has opened with the central conflict, returned to a brief origin story, and then continued to do so back and forth.It is new and exciting for the superhero genre and has inspired next year's wolverine movie, and Hugh Jackman's last, to be rated R. The motivations for these storytelling techniques stem from Wilson's motivations which are absurd and hilarious and surprisingly understandable after being exposed to all of his sass.The movie had potential to be more clever and unique but the producers are probably saving that for the inevitable sequels. Regardless, "Deadpool" is a must-see in the superhero genre and one of the most entertaining and unique installments out of the recent bombardment of superhero movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am personally very disappointed with the film as it was a fairy tale love story. The kind of hero which I was expecting since the time of Wolverine origins wasn't there. Yeah, I would say that the comedy was fantastic but I didn't pay the money for that, I wanted action scenes plus some solid story with the same kind of comedy but it wasn't there to be and the worst part was that I went to watch this movie on the Valentine's day without a girl alongside me and you know what this movie did it made fun of all those guys who didn't have a girl.The years of waiting for this movie was simply not worth it. But if you are willing to pay for comedy and love story and that too with a fairy tale ending then this movie is definitely for you. The sidekicks from X-men are terrible.</fullReview>

Mr. Dead Pool. What a ordinary man. With a flashing super suit. I am just so über hard, über awesome and acting so über cool. I am using so much metaphors that the word metaphor becomes ironic metaphor for the original morphing metaphor... or is that just a channel for a metaphor for the sarcasm of a metaphor like "Dead or alive you're coming with me"-Mr.-Robocop-in-a-shining-armor? Oh...that is right. I can dance also.Mr. Pool. Mr. Dead Twisted And Yet Ultra Violent Funny Pool.

My butt is very fetish-ish in the red leather suit. Do you find this review confusing Question mark? Well.... all you know about super heroes movie.... you take that and twist that to almost infinity. That is also kind of confusing. So...hold on to your seats and push play. Because you would push play. You would see this movie... this....this.... fascinating story of a ordinary man in a super suit with a face that looks like yesterdays garbage.And...the one liner, brought to you by Ryan Reynolds: "You think that Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting method?"This motion picture teases and at the same time squashes some clichés. That is really entertaining. Great!Over to the movie as a product: - The production : All around well made. The blood is pretty good. - The actors : Let me remind you; "You think that Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting method?" - The story : A little...twisted Dark Man....meets Superman...meets...Hancock? - Entertainment : Highly entertaining. Too much in every aspect... sometimes actually boring much. - Age : For all ages. And Deadpool is a book for children about a little red puppy. (Age 18.)7,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.)(Short elucidation for the rating: 8 Excellent and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool, not great but highly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a different type of superhero film. Is he a good guy? Questionable. He is self aware he's in a movie but no-one else is. Something I simply didn't understand the reasoning behind. It took me by surprise, it was something different but I did think it made the movie more fun. The storyline is simple but it does a nice job telling you the origin of story, by switching between the current action and he moment he becomes Deadpool. Most origin stories are often very long winded and you start to lose interest, this simply isn't the case here.Ryan Reynolds is perfect for this role. Which to me comes as a surprise after seeing his last effort as Deadpool in (X-men Origins Wolverine) not to mention his performance in (Green Lantern) which I think we can all agree, were both terrible. So I wasn't expecting much. Although you can't fault his performance in this. He did a great job and I don't think this movie would have been as likable without him.This superhero/dark comedy isn't really for children. It's not a great movie and perhaps slightly overkill with the jokes. However the movie makes fun of itself throughout and there is something very likable about this movie. Review 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a fan of Ryan Reynolds at all. Buried and Green Lantern had me shouting at the screen and were among the worst movies of the new century.But this R Rated superhero outing was pretty good. It had some funny moments and did not take itself too seriously. Ryan played his part well and I give him a great deal of credit for making this work.It had a good supporting cast especially Gotham's Morena Baccarin and Ed Skrein playing Deadpool's girlfriend and Nemesis.The violence was comic book silly but Kick-Ass style fun. The X-Men tie in was quite funny as Deadpool treated those worthy Marvel characters with complete disregard for their worthiness. The story was basically a Darkman style revenge story with our hero hoping that he could be restored to his normal Ryan Reynolds look.The Marvel and DC Universes has been a bit hit and miss with some truly awful outings. Green Lantern being one of the worst although Iron Man gets on my tits.One of the few comic book heroes that deserve a second outing. Enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, who would have thought that an R-Rated Deadpool movie would be as good as this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget everything you ever thought you knew about a superhero movie, because here comes Deadpool! Just a quick heads up, this review will be discussing chunks from the movie, so if you haven't seen it yet, here is your well needed SPOILER ALERT. And if you're one of those people?what are you waiting for?!Tim Miller's debut motion picture Deadpool provides the origin story of the 'superhero' that so desperately needed another chance to showcase Ryan Reynolds' potential as the beloved 'merc with the mouth', after the hideous attempt first time around. Yes, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, I'm looking at you. So, did Miller reassure fans that Deadpool can indeed make it to the big screen? Hell yeah, and with style too.The flood of hilarious marketing for the movie had me from the get-go, from the Christmas special trailer reveal, to the testicular cancer awareness video; I knew the movie was going to be an experience to remember ? and it certainly was. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard at a movie in my 19 years of life than I did with this movie. The humour was refreshing and comical throughout its entirety, which is something that has been missing nowadays. Its spectacular humour derives from the film's accurate depiction of Deadpool in the comic book world, a character who enjoys to break the 4th wall and address the audience directly. Not only this, but Deadpool pokes fun at both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the real world; from his continuous mocking at the X-Men to Liam Neeson's tendency to fail as a parent within the Taken franchise. Did I also mention that he mocks Batman and Robin too? Yeah, that happens.Ryan Reynolds: the man of the hour. And also the perfect casting choice for Deadpool, too. His witty nature presents itself entirely throughout the movie, and just like Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, you can't see anyone else playing Deadpool than Reynolds. His love for the character and his dedication to make things right from his last 'mouth sewn shut' depiction really shows how he embodies the character to a monumental extent; to the point where it becomes difficult to separate the man from the suit. He just is Deadpool. The introduction to an improved Colossus did nothing but benefit the movie, too, with an amusing chemistry between the two characters. One being an embodiment of patience and respect, the other being?well, Deadpool. As for Stan Lee's ritual in making a cameo appearance in each Marvel movie, this is his best one yet. Without a doubt.However, no film is flawless, and Deadpool is no exception. Ed Skrein, who played Deadpool's nemesis Ajax, being the main one. His performance, which consisted solely on a British accent and endless jaw-clenching, was nothing short of tacky. In truth, he added nothing special to the role and it became evident that any other actor could have easily played the part, which was deeply disappointing as the movie as a whole was marvellous. However, it was so difficult to try and pinpoint problems with the movie as it addresses these potential problems for us. For example, the scene where we get to see the monumental Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters with only two of the X-Men there, I was thinking "damn, where's the rest of them at?" and with complete awe; Deadpool replies with a sarcastic comment regarding the movie's lack of budget to afford more characters. Even the opening credits made fun of the conventional types of characters in this movie and most other movies overall, such as the 'British villain' and 'the hot girl.' These self-aware observations reinforce the complete hilarity surrounding the movie, and we are so thankful for it.Much to everyone's delight, Tim Miller did an exceptional job in ticking all the boxes that were required for an excellent Deadpool movie: a hilarious anti-hero, extreme violence, a foul mouth and an extreme tendency to break the 4th wall. I, for one, will never be able to take another Marvel movie seriously anymore, and because of this I can only applaud Deadpool in achieving the seemingly impossible: standing out from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and doing so in spectacular fashion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is the best Marvel film yet, and that's saying something. I can see why Ryan left DC, because nobody could have pulled off this character better than he, and though he'll be missed as Green Lantern, he breathed life into a character that may not have otherwise lived. The repartee between he and Morena is magical, she is among the most beautiful women in the world, and her quirky sense of humor and slanted smile is nearly enough to make me weep (ever since Firefly). I knew 5 seconds into the credits that I would love this, and really did. The Marvel Universe keeps expanding, while DC seems to be spread out, yet convoluted and inconsistent. I knew nothing of Deadpool before this movie, except that I often got it confused with Deathlock, and Deathstroke, and Deadshot... but will never again make that mistake, I have a new favorite and cannot wait for the sequel, chickachickaaa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best films I have seen so far this year. While it may not be the most serious or dramatic superhero movie, it does have some dramatic moments and knows when to have them. This movie takes itself seriously when it needs to, but only when it absolutely has to, which is not often. This movie is crude and packed with tons of hilarious, original jokes and I think that no one could have played this role better than Ryan Reynolds. As far as superhero movies go, this doesn't even come close to touching my all time favorite, The Dark Knight. However, this movie is certainly one of a kind. All the hype surrounding it was completely right, Deadpool is definitely worth seeing and maybe even buying on DVD. Would recommend for all who love a fun time at a good movie.</fullReview>

Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick script with it's fourth-wall- busting aspects puts as spin on the superhero film formula with wildly entertaining action set ups and self-aware witty dialogue even after the credits finish rolling. Ryan Reynolds is excellent as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. T. J. Miller is notable as Weasel, Wilson's best friend. The rest of the cast do a great job. For Marvel fans there's plenty of nods and it also includes the Colossus character. The production values are high, the score is pumping, it's a nice change from the norm so long as studios don't get on the bandwagon as saturate the market.Great adult fun, pure entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes indeed Ryan Reynolds' second take on deadpool beats crazy, lazer eyed, bamfing mute deadpool that we got in X-men origins: Wolverine. Deadpool was done right thanks to the love and passion that the people making this film had for this property and character. It was like seeing Deadpool walk right out of a comic book page, watching Reynolds I just feel like seeing Deadpool. I really feel impressed that the third wall breaking was done great too, it wasn't sort of cringe but actually made sense and those jokes do land well. I think that the eyes part on the mask being able to squint really helps build Deadpool's character and makes him seem so much more charismatic, with those we're no longer just staring at a mask without really delving into Deadpool's emotions. Because after all Deadpool is known for his outgoingness and without that would seem quite inwards and toned down, unlike "the Deadpool way".Now despite all the praise I am giving it Deadpool has its flaws, but I don't believe they surpass the positives by far. I didn't really like the order of events being not in chronological order because I feel that it is unnecessary. Some of my friends told me this too but really? That is just cherry picking. Some people told me that they felt that Deadpool didn't live up to the hype, if you are one of those people I've gotta say that you shouldn't be penalizing Deadpool because it isn't as good as what someone else told you because whether something is good is completely opinion based and just because it isn't as good as you thought it's still pretty good.I am very interested now in how Deadpool is going to further tie in to the X-men universe, the appearances from Colossus and Negasonic teenage warhead. It would be great to see appearances from X-men of the main roster and to see Deadpool in the main X-men movies too. If we see Deadpool appear in the announced last Hugh Jackman/Wolverine movie that would be great.ds' second take on</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to Marvel movies, most of the super heroes have a place. The Hulk conjures up this giant green beast of a man that cannot be stopped, Wolverine is a badass that always manages to gain the upper hand after being smacked down; you get the idea. But what about an anti-hero of sorts that has his own agenda, has a cocky personality, and otherwise just wants to spend time with his girlfriend and get laid? That would be Deadpool. He is a bounty hunter that collects bounties from an underground bar - he is part of a so-called "Deadpool Bet" which bets on the first-to-die in a list of bounty hunters. It is however, cancer that will do him in and he chooses to leave his girlfriend behind.He is given an offer to become a mutant with extraordinary super powers in exchange for working for an organization. Only he is held against his will and it is revealed he will be sold as a mutant slave. There is a side effect to this process and it tends to vary with the transformation; as does the inherent super powers the new mutants gain. Deadpool is no exception - he gets super healing, the ability to regrow limbs, as well as super perception and the ability to move in bullet time. The catch with the entire affair is his skin is completely warped and he is hideous. He has one mission - find the man that did this to him, get the cure, and then take him down.His mission isn't simple; he is forced to take on multiple henchmen, as well as dealing with members of the X-Men that want him to join. Sounds easy, but in fact it is not.The main charm of this character is that he is the one narrating the entire tale while frequently breaking the fourth wall. When he isn't breaking the fourth wall, he is usually humiliating, verbally transgressing, telling off and otherwise spitting off his dirty mouth at other people. He is absolutely hilarious in this respect.The movie is good about action, although the movie slows down a bit during the mid-half (from what I remember); but it is otherwise good all around. The movie also has another thing which makes it a must watch - it is the top grossing rated-R movie of all time. This should be reason enough to see it; but be warned, Deadpool has lots of toilet humor.Originally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/? p=10748).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool, the comedian, ladies man and a$$ kicker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that people rated this movie a 1 or a 2 is beyond me because overall i believe this is a hilarious movie, which was not intended for people who cannot see rated R movies on there own and the elderly. Deadpool is a new age superhero movie and is the first R rated superhero movie; which captures the attention of people for many different reasons for example, the dark/perverted comedy, action, and many nude scenes. During the story line Deadpool meets an edgy girl with a passion for crime just like him. This adds romance to the movie like Marvel has never shown before. The rest of the movie follows his relentless search and aggression towards Francis the man who saved his life while trying to turn him into a weapon and also made him extremely ugly and deadly in the process. Recently i have learned that they may have canceled the making of the next fantastic 4 movie to give Deadpool a higher budget. This means the next Deadpool movie will have more than 3 superheros.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a fun superhero!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the best superhero movie to date! No glam production, like the obvious suspects, but a very 'modest' movie with terrific jokes. Some of the quotes were so funny, I'm considering watching it again in less than a week. Also, Ryan Raynolds didn't seem too pretentious and what I liked best is that he was so spontaneous with the jokes - to the extent that he really grew in my eyes as an actor.The plot is absolutely nothing new. You could pretty much foresee how things will develop. But do watch it for the humour. You won't regret the experience. I'd give it a 10, but superheroes are not my thing necessarily, which is why I leave it at 9. But I'm awaiting another R. Raynold comedy now, as I am keen to see the sequel of Deadpool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie allot. Great fight scenes, though the scenes are very gore and not a good family movie to watch with kids. The humor is hilarious and enjoyed all the jokes. I liked how they added a couple of x- men, but not enough and when I saw the x-men school, it was lonely, they should have added more. The movies was only an hour and a half long, and I wished it was two hours long. I loved when they showed the funny names at the beginning, and it's true as well. At some parts was a bit confusing, and made you feel like why would you put this scene? Overall it's a good, funny movie that you should watch with your friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audacious. Sagacious. Hilarious. In a smaller word ? FUN. The script on this movie worked from top to bottom. And talking about timing on the jokes, and I should say, clever, totally clever jokes. Another thing, throughout the whole movie you should pay attention for the references, sometimes references to another movie, sometimes to an artist, and, or a song; this I think was craftily done, it couldn't work any better. The surprise performance was from Morena Baccarin, she was great in her role, matching perfectly on the screen with the main protagonist, Ryan Reynolds didn't not let this new opportunity to slip through his finger, which I think, helped and contributed for the success of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X Gonna Give It To YA! (Sort of...)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most anticipated films of the year has finally come out. Deadpool is probably the riskiest film of the year. Never mind the fact that their giving Ryan Reynolds a second chance to play a superhero again and giving the Deadpool character another chance after the bastardized portrayal given in X-Men Origins: Wolverine but this is the first mainstream R Rated Superhero film in a while. If this becomes a success then that tells Hollywood that we want more R Rated superhero movies. Does Deadpool bring the big guns or should this movie have worn the brown pants instead? Deadpool is a cool superhero movie that is by far one of the greatest comebacks for a character since Rocky. It is not the greatest comic book movie of all time nor is it the train wreck some people are calling it.Deadpool stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, TJ Miller, Brianna Hildebrand, Stefan Kapicic, and Ed Skrein in the 2nd attempt at bringing the Deadpool character to the big screen. This time instead of a PG-13 film with a sewn mouth character we get the good old Deadpool that fans have grown to love in a hard R film that's balls to the walls insane. Not the movie to bring your mom to (which one of my friends who I went to see it with did) so don't listen to Deadpool when he says you should. But I felt as if even though it was making fun of how all superhero movies are the same it also followed that formula a bit too closely even though it changed certain things that made the plot way better and more memorable.The movie has a lot of good humor in it and is consistent even though there were points that were a bit stale they make up for it with funnier jokes and cooler fight scenes. That's what I have to commend this movie on, the fight scenes. The fight scenes are spectacular and some of the best fight scenes in a comic book movie. The direction is stellar and they all feel necessary and move the plot. They were also shot especially well and since they can show anything there are no tiresome cuts and everything is shown. It's glorious. But the action scenes could have been expanded a bit more but with the budget it had it's understandable why they couldn't have a lot of great action scene but they worked around it and made some funny reasons why everything wasn't guns a blazing.One of the biggest weaknesses the film has is some of the self referential jokes. I don't know about you but it gets really annoying when you keep making jokes about how bad Green Lantern is and how dumb Deadpool was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Like they made several jokes about it and it kept bugging me like crazy.Another big problem was the romance scenes. After the sex montage the romance works but but before that it's really awkward with funny moments in it. This seems like the part of the movie that will make or break the film for people. This really just comes down to preference. The whole movie seems as if it's a film where you'll enjoy it if you like certain things. If you love superheroes you'll love this movie. If you don't you'll probably hate this movie.Deadpool overall is a cool action Rated R Superhero movie with awesome action scenes and witty one liners. While certain jokes fall flat and the romance takes a while to get into I'd strongly recommend this movie. Fans of Deadpool will like it a lot. But I'd also say go see this movie so that more Rated R Superhero movies like this can be made. This is the biggest step in taking a new direction with Superhero films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rated this one 8 stars, even though I'm conscious that there was't much of a plot for such a high rating,I enjoyed it so much that, this is it. Second time I rate Marvel movie so high, first time was The Avengers. The difference in the scope and budget is huge, but Deadpool is a proof that it matters not. Funny, clever, action packed, great movie. And the 4th wall thing was nice enough (sometimes it felt like 16 walls). The Wolverine and Hugh Jackman can suck it,this is my favorite super hero/villain now. I hope they include more X-men in the next one. I hope Wolverine cares to show up too. Overrall, it's obvious people worked really hard and with passion to create this movie. The campaign Ryan Reynolds led to promote the movie was very extensive and all of it paid of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was almost everything I expected in a Deadpool script. I only gave it an 8 because it tended to slow down a bit during the many origin story flashbacks, something that is unfortunate but necessary. Don't get me wrong, I understand why we need the origin story but Deadpool is just one of those rare occurrences where having to go back to the origins is really lame. Back when Deadpool was first released we needed an origin, that origin was used to gradually intrigue the reader and get them familiar with a hero who was set far outside the realm of what we expected a hero/villain to be. The more time that passed the more outrageous Deadpool became and he eventually grew into the figure that we know and love today. Now it feels like we were all put on hold so the story can go backwards and allow everyone else, who thinks comic books are stupid, to catch up. Again necessary for box office profits but it makes the rest of us bored during those periods of time. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from seeing it though, it is a really fun movie, the rest of it made me laugh uncontrollably, plenty of action, jokes, and gore to satisfy even the most hardened Deadpool fan. Plus now that the origin is out of the way Deadpool 2 can focus on taking all of the good stuff from this movie, and jamming more of it in the second one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun anti-hero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched &#x202a;#&#x200e;Deadpool&#x202c;, a superhero(anti-hero) movie with a twist. Marvel had created a totally different character this time from its pool of numerous heroes. Deadpool in comic sense is bit more extrovert and loud in manner as usually seen with spider-man in marvel universe. "Ryan Reynolds" acted it superbly as Deadpool and it seems his second superhero flick set to be a hit(Green lantern movie was disaster) Our titular Protagonist/antagonist kills without remorse and throughout the movie(as in comics) his dialogues are louder than action. Lots of American pop-culture reference thrown while creating the superb funny dialogues by characters but sometimes its not very funny for audience from other countries as India because we are unable to relate.A funny action movie and tight direction by "Tim Miller", literally a remolding of new genre of superhero flicks. Best part is it breaks the fourth wall(which is that character directly talks to audience and make us realize that we are watching/reading a fictional character.) Although film seems bit low on production values in some scenes as comparatively budget of movie was just modest as compared to other superhero films. A nice film and fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Further proof that this studio is incapable of doing wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going in to Deadpool I really didn't know what to expect. I knew it would be violent, I knew it would be vulgar, but what I didn't know was that I would enjoy it so, so much. Marvel has proved, once again, that they are incapable of making a movie that is patently BAD. Even the weakest among them are at least entertaining.Deadpool almost feels like it shouldn't exist in the current (mostly) family-friendly "pool" of superhero movies, and yet, here it is. There's something very satisfying about seeing the violence that would, in reality, be associated with fight scenes in comic book movies. When Captain America throws his indestructible shield into a person very destructible face, and he walks out of the movie a hero who doesn't kill, I find that pretty hard to swallow. This one, on the other hand, embraces its violence, and even the grey area that vigilantes exist in.Ryan Reynolds is solid as Deadpool, his comic timing works really well for the character, and the fun he pokes at himself throughout actually make him pretty endearing both as the character and as the actor. T.J. Miller is pretty solid, though that might be more because of my affection for him as a comedian more than his performance. Morena Baccarin is great as well, but criminally underused as the love interest.That does seem to be a continuing issue with the Marvel films, and many action films (barring the recent Star Wars or Mad Max. They just don't seem to know what to do with female characters, and it becomes more and more apparent with every new film. Though Jessica Jones did break away from that a little bit, so it's clear that strong, interesting female characters aren't outside the ability of these writers.Stefan Kapicic and Brianna Hildebrand are great as the two X-Men who show up in the movie, and I hope to see more of them in upcoming X- Men films.As Marvel movies go, Deadpool isn't the best, but it's far from the worst. It's certainly opened the door to more adult comic book films coming up in future, with the massive success of this one, and it will be interesting to see how the next films change as a result.It would be easy to write off the jokes in the movie as juvenile and crass, but they really do work in the overall tone of the film, and they make it pretty unique. No, it's not a work of comedic genius but it's fun to watch and (probably) won't disappoint.Give it a watch if you feel like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dishonorably discharged Special Forces operative turn mercenary goes on a killing rampage because of his vanity and the side-effects of a miraculous treatment which have saved his life and made him virtually immortal with super strength.Acting was fair, photo direction as well, good dosage on the special effects side. The plot is thin and giving the result, directing did a great job.Unlike most Marvel's movie this one is not about super heroes, the guy is basically a cold blooded revengeful killer. Nothing new here, I guess it's fine, let's forget all of his moral flaws, the guy thinks he is funny. He might be if homosexual sex references are your kind of treats. Torture, sex solicitation, tons of killings, drug references, disfigurement, unicorn sex and un-repentance are few of the example that comes to my mind when I asked myself. How the hell did that thing got rated PG-13 in my area? Giving the genre, I wasn't expecting much. Despite it all, I enjoyed myself and have been surprised with cinematography proceeds not common in the block-buster industry. Not a piece of art, but giving the quality of Hollywood production a worthy 6,8 out of 10 seem fair to me. Please consider living the kids home or you might end-up having a talk about fisting that you are not be prepare for!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kindly Processed Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: Deadpool is a movie in which only a certain demographic of people an enjoy it. For that reason, I decided to bump it down a notch on my rating. Deadpool is a movie about a man named Wade Wilson who comes across a woman named Vanessa at bar/club. After they have been together for awhile after hooking up with her, he finds out he has cancer. One night at the bar, he gets offered a cure by signing up for the Weapon X Program which goes wrong once he finds out he's been baited in to joined a testing group of maniacs. This, along with many other procedures turns him into Deadpool, who now has super strength and regeneration powers. Deadpool is now on a search for the man who put him through this, AJAX and other of his accomplices. If you were expecting the original "merc with a mouth", your gonna get him with varying degrees of success. I genuinely enjoyed the movies humor, action, acting and sets, though however at the end, even though it might be parodying other superhero movies at the end, does get a bit bloated. Its a very funny movie that made me laugh a lot, especially the fight scenes.Some people may be a little turned off by the love story plot, but after awhile you get over it very quickly. I really think this an average movie at best. It did what it needed to do with average success and it should be commended for that.</fullReview>

The movie was full of hilarious references of pop- culture and classic movies. But the best ones was self-references of Ryan Reynolds. They implemented Deadpool's breaking of the 4th wall masterfully.The movie was both an origin story and a revenge/rescue story at the same time. It had a unique telling and it was effective. Ryan Reynolds was great, Ed Skrein was great all the cast felt genuine and they had great synergy.There was some tweaks and some characters were different than their comic book counter-parts but as a fan of Deadpool's comic's more than being fine with it I loved the said tweaks.http://www.vashikaransadhna.com/genuine-vashikaran-specialist/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The goofy R-rated superhero story has a very cool opening sequence that has been shown repeatedly in the trailers then a lot of talking, after all this is an origin tale. Ryan Reynolds pushes the limit of his comedic ability working to get jokes, some hit, some are just over the top. The fourth wall breaking was fun every once in a while and the awareness of the complications of reboots, spinoffs, and production company franchise struggle over these money machines will land with the movie nerds who paid attention and go over the head of the regular movie goer.The action was top notch though I always want more fighting and explosions and car chases. The fact that there were only really two scenes reflects the limited budget this superhero got as he isn't one of the most popular heroes. I do think the Deadpool stock will rise especially if this movie is a smash at the box office. The final fight scene had some cool action beats but was interrupted often by the silly banter of the protagonist. There was an unfortunate montage of action that would have benefited from another actual scene of Deadpool hunting. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds, thank you. 'Deadpool' was everything I could hope for and love. The comedy is grade A for my taste. Every quip that Deadpool made had me laughing even in the midst of an action scene. Speaking of; the action was beautifully done and more than satisfying in terms of brutality and being epic. As much of a fan as I am of the Marvel PG- 13 movies, this is one of my favorites in regards to the pure realness of the interactions. I am a vulgar humor kind of guy and Deadpool just happens to be exactly that. Aside from the action and humor, the story line I felt was well done especially in the means of how it has phases of flashbacks and flash-forwards, all while Deadpool keeps the audience entertained by his direct interaction with the crowd as we all know and love him to do. A+ goes to Fox for knocking this out of the park or maybe A+ goes to Ryan Reynolds for pouring his heart into making this film happen for us, the fans, who wanted a real Deadpool film and not Baraka from Mortal Kombat. Catch this film, ladies and gentleman? Unless you do not like vulgar humor and blood and brutality and? Well? Just go see it, you will love it.</fullReview>

I loved almost every joke in this film, except for 3. There is a masturbation scene and 2 references to the act. The sex montage is done to the theme of various national holidays.Depending on what screening of the film you see, during Wade's first fight with Ajax, you can see his genitals. There is violent gore in this film, the opening credits will tell you that. Great MARVEL film for an adult targeted audience. 9/10 for some unnecessary sexual moments.</fullReview>

But this movie was as fresh as the morning dew and the action is so well interwoven in the story, that one does not get any time to focus on anything but the movie. The past &amp; the present are both well presented and the action scenes are pretty vicious &amp; funny with Deadpool's snide comments. The story telling is truly refreshing. The villain could have been more lethal but in hindsight, more lethal villains result in unnecessary action scenes unduly prolonging the movie or procrastination of the story, so I am glad with the short roles of the villains. Please Marvel, this is the right recipe for success, keep it up. Highly recommended for viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the outstanding opening credits to the hilarious post-credit scene, Deadpool breathes life into the superhero genre by essentially making fun of it. Ryan Reynolds is the perfect voice of this mockery, as he has experienced failure in the genre firsthand, twice. He might just be the finest casting choice for a superhero ever. He captures the humor perfectly. The film handles the origin story well by depicting Wade as Deadpool at the beginning and then switching back and forth between his origin and his current fight. The action sequences are very well done and not repetitive. Deadpool is a reminder that superhero movies can bring new things to the table without trying to set up a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arguably on the most anticipated films of the year and what has been years in the making, Ryan Reynoild's Deadpool has FINALLY arrived tot eh big screen - but does it live up to the hype? Yes, mostly.Let's not beat around the bush, Deadpool is bloody funny. The jokes are always a hit, and when they really land, they manage to produce some gut busting laughs along the way. Ryan Reynolds demeanor and staggering charisma as the titular character is brilliant - it seems the Reynolds was always destined to play Deadpool.The story however, is not great. it is very by the numbers, very predictable, and not particularly interesting. It works for the most part - but a little scratch at the surface reveals a very simplistic storyline lacking in substance. However, this reasonably minor aspect is largely forgivable thanks to the great performances and brilliant comedic timing and genuinely hilarious gags.Deadpool is a lot of fun - great from start to finish, despite being rather simplistic - and acts as proof to Marvel that making an R-Rated superhero movie does not mean bust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Deadpool' is a breath of fresh air to the genre of comic-book movies. It's one of the few R-Rated MARVEL films (apart from the 'Blade' trilogy) that pushes the limit of violent action and breaks the fourth wall.1. Ryan Reynolds was born to play the 'Merc with a Mouth' (not just the fact that he's also Canadian) with his natural humorous charm and his (always) in shape physique. He is the focal point to everything even when the movie hits it's lows at times. Casting anyone else would be a huge injustice to the character of Wade Wilson/Deadpool. 2. Ryan has a decent amount of chemistry with his love interest in the film Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) although you don't get much of them together for a majority of the film. Things are balanced just right between them seeing as this is mainly a superhero flick and not a whole-hearted love-story which the film-makers are fully aware of.3. The effects are surprisingly good (especially on the mutant Colossus) for a film on a modest 30 million dollar budget. Most of the stunts and fight scenes are practical until the third act where the CGI tricks are pulled out of the bag and into the mix. The only thing that's animated about Deadpool (aside from his personality) are his eyes, if you look closely...you'll notice.4. Taking into consideration the events of 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', you'll clearly know that the future (our present) has been reset. So Deadpool's storyline in this film doesn't follow his traditional product of Wolverine/Weapon-X Experimentation. The one main thing that carries over from his comic-book adaption is the fact that he's dying from stage-4 cancer. This doesn't at all hurt the film despite what hardcore comic-book geeks may think. The fact that Wade is betrayed and experimented on to the point where his mutation is triggered through stress, desperation and sheer torture, makes you feel more sympathy for a character like Deadpool.5. Ed Skrein plays 'Ajax' (Deadpool's sworn enemy and tormentor), another self-experimented mutant who's abilities garner him super-human strength and invulnerability to pain. He's an interesting addition and opposition of Deadpool, yet he feels more one- dimensional than anything else, only there to serve the purpose of acting and looking menacing until his final showdown with Deadpool at the film's climax. Gina Carano (Angel Dust) plays Ajax's partner/sidekick, who carries the same mutant powers as he (minus the severed nerve endings). She has little to do and barely any dialogue, but just to aid Ajax in the final battle and take on Colossus.6. T.J Miller and some other side characters fill out the rest of the comedic cast that add to the graphic humor. His character of Weasel fits in well and plays off Ryan naturally whenever they interact. Take it, this film is not for everyone. It's super violent, super bloody and super awesome! Not a good idea to take your kids to see this, cause I can't stress enough that 'Deadpool' isn't your average superhero flick. A sequel is undoubtedly on it's way, and needless to say, I only have three word in response to that; "Bring it on!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years Marvel have released films that are aimed at either kids... or big kids. It's weird that we finally have an adult marvel film. First of all let me say that the usual juvenile marvel humour we all know and love isn't lost on this film, but it has all the sex and violence of an adult film. Ryan Reynolds is much more at home then in the Green Lantern film that flopped 5 years ago. His performance is complimented brilliantly by the breaking down of the fourth wall. I was sceptical of a super hero that spoke directly to the audience but something about it just works. Deadpool is one of the best films Marvel have released in recent years and yet another example of why Marvel are leaps and bounds ahead of DC. While DC rely heavily on Batman and Superman, Marvel just seem to throw up more and more great super hero's straight from the comic books. Perhaps the two reasons I gave the film an 8 and not a 10 are as follows. 1. I would have liked to see better additional characters as I felt deadpool was the only enjoyable character 2. It was very obvious that this was a start up film for a much longer story, perhaps the sequel will offer more in the way of an epic battle between deadpool and an iconic villain.All in all the film was a credit to Marvel's great run of form perhaps one upping Ant Man which was also a very impressive film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breath of fresh air in the superhero genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following on from his brief and unpleasant appearance in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Deadpool has been given a new lease of life on the big screen with his first solo film. The 'merc with a mouth' may have had it sewn shut in his previous outing, but Fox have finally delivered the Deadpool film that fans have been crying out for, making up for their past mistakes in the process. In a market over-saturated with superhero films, it's clear from the moment the hilarious opening title sequence begins that Deadpool is a breath of fresh air in the genre. This is his film, he's going to do things his way.Make no mistake, this could have gone very wrong. With a director whose previous experience exists only in FX work and the same actor that portrayed the character in the god-awful X-Men Origins, Deadpool's first feature film could have been a disaster. Thankfully, both Tim Miller and Ryan Reynolds hold a special place in their heart for the wise-cracking anti-hero, and this is evident from the minute the film starts right until the post-credits scene fades to black. Miller proves himself to be a more than capable director, ensuring his action set pieces are stylish, brutal, and easy to follow. The opening battle on a Detroit freeway is like a freight train crashing through a ballet theatre, each of Deadpool's movements being executed almost gracefully as he plows his way through a team of hired guns. Elsewhere, the appearance of the X-Men's Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead leads to a final showdown which is thrilling to watch at it escalates to levels of destruction which rival some of the studio's bigger productions. With many action directors choosing to take the Michael Bay approach when it comes to putting together a fight sequence, it's nice to see Miller place so much focus on his characters during these scenes of ultimate destruction, ensuring they are never lost in the mayhem. It's not just the action sequences which pay off either, the romantic sub-plot ? over the top sex montage and all ? is handled with care, and no matter how ridiculous some scenes may be, the relationship between Wade and girlfriend Vanessa have a lot of heart.Even with solid directing, however, Deadpool could still have failed if the casting wasn't up to scratch, but thankfully, Reynolds is on fine form throughout, bringing every aspect of the character that fans know and love to life. Having strongly campaigned for the film to receive the green light from Fox, Reynolds brings all of his energy as an actor to the role in order for it to succeed. His love for the character shines through each scene as he quips his way through fight sequences and delivers not so tongue-in-cheek references to Bryan Singer's X-Men franchise ? amongst other things, proving that no matter how much of a disaster X-Men Origins was, he was born to play Deadpool. The supporting cast also impress, with Ed Skrein seeming to enjoy playing typical British villain Ajax, T.J. Miller managing to provide plenty of laughs as Deadpool's friend, Weasel, and Morena Baccarin matching the energy that Reynolds brings to each scene. It's also impressive how faithful to the comic books this version of Colossus is compared to any of his previous appearances in the X-Men films, the character's good nature and kind heart being showcased in many scenes he features in. Daniel Cudmore is replaced by Andre Tricoteux, who performs motion capture which ensures the mutant's organic steel frame is physically imposing, while Serbian actor Stefan Kapi&#x10d;i&#x107; provides the character's voice in what is at least an attempt to honour the Russian giant's nationality. Even more impressive, however, is the strength of the script that Miller and Reynolds had to work with. While many superhero films are bogged down by excessive run times and moments of tranquillity which are often dull, Deadpool is fast paced and simple, mixing an origin story in with a wholly recognised version of the character while never taking it's foot off the brakes. It's because of this, the films weaker moments can be forgiven, because no matter what flaws it may have each scene feels necessary to the simple story being told which involves Deadpool tracking down his torturers and saving his girlfriend.As mentioned, there are flaws to be found. One well known aspect of Deadpool is his ability to break the fourth wall, and though it's effectively used in some scenes, there are several in which it does not. At one point, Deadpool breaks the fourth wall in a flashback while breaking the fourth wall to recap the story, and this is one example of the concept being used too often in order to try and gain laughs. Similarly, while many of the jokes within the film are genuinely funny, there is an overabundance of them at times, leading to several of them falling flat. Nevertheless, jokes and quips are a staple of the character, and even those that fail to land seem much more natural than some of those that appeared in last years Avengers: Age of Ultron.With Deadpool, Miller, Reynolds, and co. have managed to craft an extremely fun and thrilling addition to the superhero genre. It may not have the budget of the films within the MCU or the upcoming DCEU, but it certainly makes up for it thanks to strong direction, great casting, and a simple yet effective script. If you like your superhero films to be violent and filled with crude humour, this is one you simply cannot miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Executed to an incredible standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool (2016) is a movie that is 10 years in the making and it was worth the wait. Unlike other superhero movies of this nature, 'Deadpool' is unique in the way that it was able to hold its own despite having an enormous weight of expectation placed upon it. 'Deadpool' did not crumble under this pressure and I can honestly say that I can happily go through the rest of 2016 knowing that 'Deadpool' was a complete success in every sense of the word. Not only was use of breaking the fourth wall executed perfectly, it was done in just the right amount. The "rated-R" style of comedy and violence could not have worked better in any other movie and it is safe to say that Ryan Reynolds is as much Deadpool as he is himself. My only negative opinion on the movie is that it did not contain as many fight scenes or fight scenes of large scale that I would have liked, but in retrospect it did not harm the overall experience of the film.Thanks For Reading!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool has redeemed himself from the not so impressive X-Men origins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the witty one liners to the gory death scenes Deadpool is a movie that proves that comic book movies are still a must see. This movie not only redeems the character of Deadpool from the not so impressive X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie, it also introduces new characters like Negasonic Teenage Warhead (played by Brianna Hidebrand) and Weasel (played by T.J. Miller).From the minute I saw the opening credits I knew this movie wasn't going to be the typical superhero movie. The fact that the opening credits didn't actually credit anyone shows that this movie will be different. First of all the movie is structured differently compared to other superhero movies. Normally you have the origin story, then a problem of some sort, followed by a solution and ending on the big finale. This movie starts off introducing character but then almost immediately goes straight to a fight between the main characters with the origin story being shown in flashbacks. The movie constantly jumps between past and present which is a unique way of telling a story but still manages to work. Another thing that makes this movie different is that this is more of an anti hero movie then a superhero movie. Yes Deadpool fights bad guys but the fact that he kills all his enemies with extreme overkill suggests he is more anti hero then superhero.This movie does a lot of things that are good. If you like blood and gore then you will find the fight scenes very appealing. There are some clever jokes and a lot of references to other movies outside the marvel universe. Ryan Reynolds was the perfect actor to play Deadpool. If you're not a fan of Deadpool you will be after watching this movie and if you're already a fan of Deadpool then I can confidently say you will not be disappointed. The only real problems I have is that some of the visual effects look unrealistic but that's only because this isn't a big budget movie. Also the movie is short for a superhero movie being only 1 hour 48 minutes long. They should have made the movie at least 2 hours long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rated R for good reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The raunchy potty-mouth smashes into the big screen like Miley Cyrus on a wrecking ball, we can't help but watch.The film follows a nonlinear plot line for the first half of the movie, incorporating flashbacks with the current dilemma that the film opens with. This gets us right into the action, while simultaneously educating the audience on the hero's back story.Perhaps what makes Deadpool so good is that it doesn't take itself seriously. In fact, the movie makes fun of the standard superhero genre that seems to be popular in Hollywood. From the opening credits to the raunchy love story our protagonist falls into, the film gives us that typical hero tale but with a spin. Deadpool isn't your hero for your little boy Timmy to look up to. From outright killing his foes, to his inexplicable horniness, to his over-the- top wit, Deadpool is the hero the grownups need. In fact, you could say he is the XXX version of what a Spiderman would be like.What makes the movie so fun is Deadpool himself. He's a character who has been through a lot, some of which we witness, and still keeps his humorous side shining throughout it all. His quick wit and debauchery makes the audience want more of the man in the red suit's antics. We watch an act of redemption playing out through the movie. Deadpool explicitly states he doesn't want to be a superhero, yet wants to "fight for the little guy" at the same time. This is evident when he is introduced prior to being mutated. He works as a muscle for higher to help people with problems, i.e. stalkers, etc? Deadpool is both the devil on one shoulder and the angel on the other, combined with a smart mouth and twisted sense of humor. Put this all together and we are delivered with a raunchy superhero movie filled with action from start to finish. This makes the red suit wearing mercenary worthy of 7/10 in his debut film. I think the comedy is the redeeming factor in the film that would make the film watch worthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny alright, but hyped way too much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a strange experience watching this movie, because it is neither a purebred comedy, action flick or superhero movie. By creating a movie like Deadpool, filmmakers merge these three genres into one, for me at least undefinable genre. The movie is funny alright, no question about it. From the very first shot of the opening scene we are introduced to Deadpool who is a fast mouthing mercenary on a quest for personal vengeance.Mixed in between the countless snappy comebacks, hilarious one-liners or downright retarded comments, Deadpool's quest is a violent one, and still within the opening scene of the movie he shoots, stabs, crushes, decapitates, and in general just kills a bunch of other mercenaries. While on his quest, Deadpool is in an open dialogue with the audience, narrating his own origin story. Many times he refuses the idea of this being anything related to a superhero movie, but the attentive watcher will notice countless references to different parts of both the DC &amp; Marvel universes. At some points during the movie, it feels like we are supposed the feel bad, or feel sorry for some of the movies protagonists, but when the same scene is presented with a goofy one-liner, the whole empathy thing is dropped to the ground. For a brief moment I loose complete track of what feelings the scene is supposed to create, and it's mostly because of these scenes I cannot rate Deadpool higher that I do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another "Marvel" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before walking into the theater, I was told this movie was hilarious, deserving of an R rating, and one of the best marvel movies of all time. After watching it however, I can safely say that they got 2 of the 3 descriptions correct. The movie definitely deserves the R rating because of all of the nudity, most of the jokes hit their mark, to say it's the best marvel movie is a far cry from the truth.What made this an average movie boils down to two things, the first being the action, and the second being the CG. When you think of modern action movies, there are a lot of jump cuts of cars exploding, swords flying, guns shooting, and fists punching. Often it will happen so fast that you won't be able to quite make out what's happening half of the time, unfortunately, this has become par for the course. It wouldn't quite be a Deadpool movie without all of that action, it just seems really "caned" and boring where it should have been the opposite because of the character they were working with.The special effects and CG characters are incredibly disappointing and look as though they were made some time in the early 2000's. This becomes an even greater shame when you think back to the first "Iron Man" movie where the suit still looks really good, and that movie came out in 2008.At the end of the day, it was an OK watch, I wouldn't recommend seeing it in theaters even though it seems like it would be a perfect "theater movie". I also don't have the slightest drive to see this movie a second time which is becoming a reoccurring theme with most Marvel movies</fullReview>

You can also feel the chemistry between Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) and Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and you instinctively root for them.

		<fullReview>Merc with a Mouth clowns in his own movie after his cameo appearance in X-Men: Origins as mercenary Wade Wilson which also rather contradicts this film.Ryan Reynolds finally has a monster hit in Deadpool, wisecracking his way through and breaking the fourth wall multiple times. The film also serves as a origins tale which disguises the fact that this revenge saga has a thin story. Deadpool wants Ajax (Ed Skrein), the British villain responsible for leaving him with a deformed face after experimenting on him to unleash his hidden X genes and who has now kidnapped his girlfriend. Deadpool pursues him with the help of a few X-Men that Fox's budget allows.The film was made by first time director Tim Miller who sets his stall and tone of the movie with the flippant opening titles. As Marvel films go, this one is rude, the violence more visceral, the comedy a bit hit and miss as Reynolds makes fun of the X-Men and Marvel in general including the Disney Marvel films. Deadpool even finds time to make fun of a handsome actor called Ryan Reynolds.I found the film amusing but the plot was weak and the budget was low which the director was disguising with his own slicing and dicing. Reynolds though found the right tone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool (2016): Dir: Tim Miller / Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano: Wayward comic book superhero film that is extremely violent and avoids the innocence of other films of its kind. Deadpool is out for revenge and answers. Dressed in red with facial scars in an experiment gone wrong when cancer threatens his life. He takes to the street killing villains and making a mess. Director Tim Miller helms the first big R rated superhero film since Kick-Ass. This is raw and sometimes graphic but Ryan Reynolds delivers deadpan sarcasm addressing viewers without concern for the massive destruction in the wake. He has been tortured into mutant like powers and he seeks deliverance. Ed Skrein plays Ajax, the experimental villain whose methods land Wilson in his condition. He is out to create mutant slaves but Deadpool becomes one subject crossing the other side. Morena Baccarin plays Wilson's stripper girlfriend Vanessa Carlyle who becomes a target for Ajax. She is concerned when Wilson is stricken with cancer but disappointed when he disappears. T.J. Miller adds further comic relief as a bar tender who bats sarcasm back and forth with Deadpool. Gia Carano plays Angel Dust, a female mutant of Ajax who can pack a punch. There is also the appearance of X-Men heroes Colossus and Negasonic who both attempt to bring Deadpool in and become targets for his punch lines. This film divides the line in terms of audience. Some will protest its violence and vulgar sense of humour while others may find Deadpool's dead charm and sarcasm to be dead on. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good adaption of the character but not really as good as what people are saying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a fan favourite character for reasons that either work with people or don't. For me Deadpool is a fun character for his complete insanity, one-liners and other such things that I'm sure others may find annoying. However, doing a movie on this character would be a little tricky but not impossible. For me, while the character is pretty much spot on there are a few things that drag it.The plot is that Wade Wilson is a mercenary who after finding the girl of his dreams and having a relationship that eventually leads to an engagement. Things however take a really dark turn when Wade is diagnosed with cancer. Someone manages to find him and offer him the chance to have his cancer cured, with... science-y things. He is injected with the mutant gene by someone named Ajax and put to various forms of torture. One works but permanently damages his skin. He breaks out after a weekend of the form of torture that did this and pretty much makes him more indestructible then Wolverine. Going back to his hometown he tries to get back with his girlfriend but decides not to go through with it because of the issues he has with image. He decides to suit up and start killing off everyone who was involved in order to get to Ajax or Francis.Onto what I didn't like. The fourth wall jokes are something. Everyone in the opening credits is credited down as something like "Written by the real heroes here" or "Directed by an Overpaid tool". There are other things like Deadpool throwing a toy of Weapon XI from X-Men Origins Wolverine saying he hates it or him saying "Please don't make the super-suit green or animated!". There are quite a few of them but they're not even chuckle-worthy, the rest of them are good but these just stand out for being bad.Oh and the non-linear structure frustrated me. The movie starts with Deadpool in costume shooting up cars and causing massive highway damage, then it cuts to his past, then it cuts to the highway damage, then it cuts to his past, then more highway damage. You may have already seen it in the trailer a lot because to tell all of that one action scene takes the movie an entire hour. I get they're trying to balance out the whole "I have cancer!" thing with some of what makes Deadpool Deadpool because... Honestly having this be a cancer drama for the first half would be WEIRD when for the time he's a superhero he's foul-mouthed, one-liner cracking, shooting, stabbing and all of that would probably have audiences think they're in a completely different movie, but couldn't they have more action scenes then just that one? That's where my complaint lies.As a side note stuff here are other things. I don't believe Wade and Vanessa are in love throughout the movie considering that's the only dramatic plot line towards the end that's a huge problem, I have no idea of the purpose of the roommate Deadpool has because all she does in the entire length of the movie is give him guns and speaking of I don't like the cab driver character popping up for the second time. He wasn't really that funny in the first scene he was in either, the funniest part of that scene was the thought of Deadpool using a taxi, whether it's from the angle of accepting a heavily armed weirdo's request to get in or comparing it to other superheroes means of transportation.Onto what I liked. Well, for those like me that thought Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool was a miscasting in X-Men Wolverine be pleasantly surprised. The one-liners are pretty funny whether it's from Deadpool or some of the other characters. I will say it, unlike some of the superhero movies that get praised made today - was able to keep my attention from beginning to end. So while I have ripped into this movie a bit I will say it's probably one of the better superhero movies made today. Oh and I haven't read that much of the comics for a while but everyone seems to be perfectly cast in their roles. I'd say that if what you're looking for is a very good comedy/action movie then I would suggest this but not walk in with the expectation that it maybe something more.I'd say watch it but it to me is nowhere near as good as the almost 9.0 rating it currently has. I'd say that it is worthwhile, it's probably more worthwhile then anything else on. I'll say it is instant redemption for another representation of the character made 7 years ago (although, does anyone aside from comic book fans really remember that? Aside from extreme Hugh Jackman fans) and for that I think it unequivocally proves that they know how to represent the character, at least now anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Redemption of Ryan Reynolds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The roots of this film were very convoluted, weren't they? 20th Century Fox had overseen a literally butchered version of Deadpool back in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (sew shut the wisecracking merc with a mouth's sasshole, really?) and Reynolds himself didn't do so well with Green Lantern either. From what I've read it seems like Fox themselves didn't have much faith in the idea of a proper Deadpool outing so Reynolds and co had to lobby like crazy for years to get this thing made, only to have several million slashed from the budget late into project. Fox have a history of derailing projects so it's to be expected (Baccarin was previously involved in cult favourite Firefly which had similar things happen so she'd know better than anyone) and it does lead to a wonderful biting-the-hand joke where they ask why Xavier's mansion is so huge when there's only two X-Men in the story, but I digress...Despite these many speed bumps, delays and other issues, the movie succeeds on a number of levels - story, acting, directing, humour - all present and correct, and it hits the target so consistently you can't help but wonder what all the fuss was about.My favourite Ryan Reynolds character before this was the overgrown college boy Van Wilder, and here he channels that sense of manic energy and fast-talking perfectly into Wade Wilson, amping it up further when the famous red and black suit goes on. The guy can't help but crack wise at every opportunity, even when he's putting his last 12 bullets into the perps he's still mocking them to amuse himself. Me personally, I found this hilarious throughout the whole film. Almost all the jokes work, there's maybe three or four amongst the hundreds of puns, putdowns and pop culture references that miss so I'm clocking that as maybe 3% that didn't make me smile, laugh or groan at the right times - that for me is a high hit rate and a sign of great writing.More than just being a comedy, though, I was surprised to find that the love story between Reynolds and Baccarin is actually pretty compelling. I figured maybe it'd be thrown in to link with the Valentine's Day release but no, this has proper roots in the story. The chemistry between the two leads is clear to see - they obviously enjoyed working together on this.I suppose what's also quite exciting is that isn't yet another bloodless, cuss free "fun for all the family" superhero flick either. There's actually a reasonable amount of gore where appropriate, which is something the others just don't have, and bad language/vulgar jokes at every turn. This makes it a little shocking in a good way because a) that's what the character needs and b) when you're used to every super flick being cleaned up to earn a UK PG rating, the one that doesn't has more drama/humour as a result, a sign that it was clearly targeted at an adult audience. People have voted with their wallets so the sequel (and potentially other superhero franchises too, we'd hope) should continue this trend. Deadpool himself is an interesting, complex character who is more of an anti-hero but not in the same broody way Batman is (he's too fun and silly for that) so there's definitely a place for this style of film.The origin story is told very skillfully, I wouldn't have guessed that it was Tim Miller's first effort as a film director due to the careful use of camera tricks and attention paid to the editing to show us how Deadpool came to be through flashbacks that are never short and vague or long and boring. The pacing keeps the energy up to the point where there's never a dull moment and the action scenes never overshadow the drama of the others, it's quite impressive. As another reviewer noted, at points it feels like a comic book has flown off the page and come to life, and I can't say that about any other superhero movie I've seen so far, even the top quality Joss Whedon Avengers monoliths.I would say I went into this movie with reasonable expectations and found them exceeded at every turn. Deadpool is a hugely entertaining character, the other leads are well chosen (I love Negasonic Teenage Warhead as the careful jab at teenage cynicism), the main villain is a little underdeveloped perhaps but that's a minor criticism when the movie overall has such great enthusiasm and is just hugely entertaining from the first frame to the last. Even the credits animations and closing stinger (another quality pop culture pull; spot the John Hughes film reference) reflect the tone perfectly.This movie truly is the redemption of Ryan Reynolds. It's the movie he worked hard for and he has not wasted the opportunity - a strong introduction to what we hope will become one of Marvel's best and most popular superhero movie franchises.Would I see this again? Absolutely. I want to try and work out exactly what Wade was doing with that stuffed unicorn, for one thing...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I had never heard of Deadpool in the comics, so I had no idea what to expect. Saw the trailers and thought it looked interesting and decided to take a shot and see it.Before you consider watching this movie - keep in mind that it is irreverent (to Marvel), very violent, has non-stop profanity, WAY over the top in everything it does, and was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. The movie should never be taken seriously and the viewer should not expect realism - this is an action packed thrill ride that is also very funny - watch it for what it is and you will enjoy it. Deadpool is no Batman, that's for sure.The movie wastes no time in bringing action into play and the sequences are choreographed very well. If you are familiar with the comic version of Deadpool, I was told he talks to the reader and this is what he does several times throughout the movie - turns his head and talks to the audience - no super hero has ever done that before.If you want to watch a high action movie with lots of violence, language, and hilarious one liners and insults, then this is the movie for you. DO NOT BRING YOUR LITTLE KIDS TO THIS FILM.I give this movie a 9/10 for its originality, script (brilliant), action, and irreverence toward Marvel (cannot believe Marvel actually can laugh at itself for once). This movie took a huge chance and it works - on almost every level.Highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best superhero movie since "Guardians of the Galaxy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The superhero movie has become stale as of late. 2015 didn't do much for the genre, as its most notable entry was "Avengers: Age of Ultron," which was a serviceable film at best. The genre suffers because of its formulaic core. Marvel can make a billion dollars off of pretty much anything these days, so they have little incentive to mix it up. The mold has been perfected in terms of box office success, and with it, originality has taken a fatal blow. "Deadpool," however, doesn't fit into this mold, or any other for that matter, and that's why it's the best superhero movie to be released since "Guardians of the Galaxy" (2014). "Deadpool" follows Wade Wilson (played by Ryan Reynolds), a mercenary-for-hire that kicks the mess out of people for a living. After being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Wilson signs on to an experimental program that will cure his cancer and allow him to happily live out his days with his girlfriend. This program isn't what it seems, however, and Wilson emerges from the torturous experimentation mutated, disfigured and super powered. With his newfound abilities, Wilson christens himself Deadpool and goes on the path of revenge. From the first frame of the opening credits, it's clear that "Deadpool" is unlike every other superhero movie that came before it. Its "hero" isn't really much of a hero at all. He's prone to profanity, innuendo and brutal violence, most of which is done with relative taste. Anyone who's been on the Internet in the last month has surely seen some trace of the film's pervasive marketing campaign, most of which asserts the obnoxious humor characteristic of Deadpool himself. Initially, this worried me. I was afraid I'd be subjected to several hours of lowbrow, pre-pubescent humor, and although there was certainly plenty of that strewn throughout, it wasn't nearly as idiotic as I anticipated. Certainly not all of the ridiculous one-liners connect, but a surprising number of them stick the landing.In fact, most of "Deadpool" is genuinely hilarious. The film is insanely self-aware and, much like the comic books from which it came, it often breaks the fourth wall, addressing the audience directly just for the laughs. It plays off the absurdity of its genre's formula with refreshing effectiveness, using the tired tropes of superhero flicks to its advantage. However, much of this breaks down into a matter of taste regardless. For some people, "Deadpool" with be a humorless excursion into immaturity. But for those unburdened by seriousness, this film is a riot. However violent it may be, there's an honesty to be found amidst the carnage. Films like "The Avengers" (2012) deal with apocalyptic destruction that surely leaves hundreds of thousands dead, but the audience is never exposed to any of that. We've seen Iron Man save the day countless times, blasting his enemies to bits with his array of billion-dollar technology, but we're never shown the reality of his actions. Sure, he saved New York from an alien invasion, but half the city was destroyed in the process. Almost all superhero movies deal in this kind of flashy, soft-core violence."Deadpool," on the other hand, shows us exactly what its hero is all about. Wielding twin katanas, Wilson cuts through swathes of his enemies, separating limb from torso, head from spine and ego from spirit. He's a killer, like most superheroes, but at least he's sincere about it. Characters like Wolverine have power sets that are entirely based in visceral dismemberment, and yet they're dressed up on screen as if the kills are somehow clean. "Deadpool" and its title character are much more honest.Any complaints made about the film's lack of plot or original characters are based in misunderstanding. The villain, for example, is an intentional cliché that's carefully crafted to reflect the tiresome habits of action movies everywhere right back into Hollywood's face. The plot is bare bones, lacking in any global-scale destruction or international crises, which is refreshing when considering the fact that the earth has come close to annihilation in nearly every other superhero movie. "Deadpool" knows precisely what it's doing with its own elements. It's all very intentional; it's just a matter of whether or not you like its intention.But this film has done more than provide us with an entertaining way to spend two hours. "Deadpool" has proved that there's a place for R-rated superhero movies in today's market. It's taken what "Guardians of the Galaxy" started and expanded on it, proving that the mold isn't the only way for studios to make money. Hopefully, this film's success will inspire future installments in the superhero genre to think outside the box.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous, Funny...Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool (2016)We can all agree that the topic of Superheroes embodies a WIDE spectrum. We have seen our flawed, yet noble heroes (Iron Man, Ant-Man, Thor). And we have also seen our dark, gritty, rough-around-the-edges anti-heroes (Batman and Wolverine). And then we have...DEADPOOL!This is a somewhat different sort of heroic character who cannot fall into any particular category as he consistently breaks free from such standard bonds and rules. This would possibly be quite difficult to lay out cleanly for general audiences to fully grasp, let alone enjoy. But this movie, without a doubt, NAILED IT!Much like the title character, rather than go with the standard storyline structure (beginning, middle, and end), this film takes you on a roller-coaster ride of ups and downs as we witness the genesis of the so-called "Merc with a Mouth". The films starts us off in the middle with wild, crazy, and even hilarious action sequences...goes back to our hero's humble beginnings...back to the crazy, funny, rising action middle...the compelling beginnings again...then back to the middle allowing us to better comprehend and even appreciate why Deadpool is the way he is. It should be of no surprise to us moviegoers that this is not an appropriate-for- children superhero movie. Even if you don't know anything about the character Deadpool, the trailers, movie posters, and teasers would've been clues enough. For mature, adult, superhero fans this movie really does have it all: action, rude language, gratuitous violence, crude humor, sexuality, a compelling story, and most important of all...ENTERTAINMENT! Of course, it can be argued that the story seems simplistic in its telling: a wronged protagonist seeking out revenge in the name of love, etc. etc. But what more does a superhero origin story really require? Most superhero movies these days become royally screwed, what with their overly convoluted story lines, multiple villains popping out of the wood-works, and even unnecessary visual effects. All the while expecting the audiences to take the plot seriously and just go with it (i.e. The Amazing Spider- Man 2). Deadpool works so well as a movie simply because the audience knows right-off-the- bat that it is not meant to be taken seriously. The opening credits are proof enough of that. The title character actually takes us on this personal ride of his, talks to us, and literally expresses how ridiculous the whole situation really is. Take note; this is exactly what Deadpool as a character is meant to be and do. Granting the movie major points for loyalty to source material. However, when all is said and done, this film would've been impossible to make without Ryan Reynolds, the heart and soul of the whole project. People tend to throw the term "perfect casting" around a lot, but in this particular case there was truly No One better to play the role of Deadpool. Reynolds was born for this role. He perfectly embodied the character's vulgar and charmingly sarcastic nature. In fact, it would be fair to say that the film's well-shot and seamlessly choreographed fight sequences made up about 10% of what made the movie so great. The other 90% was pure, raw ATTITUDE. All of it originating from Ryan Reynolds himself. All in all, this was a fantastic movie. Great for all to enjoy, providing they are mature enough to handle all of the wild, generally inappropriate shenanigans it had to offer. Speaking for the fans, we can't wait to see what else Deadpool will have in store in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally! A film that met, and exceeded, my expectations! NOT FOR KIDS! Hilarious and action packed from credits to post credits scene! Innovative in the way it gives us the origin story and fabulous in the breaking of the "4th wall". Reynolds is the natural choice for our hero. The supporting cast is strong and the writing and direction are spot on. The special effects were grand, yet understated. The villain was not "run of the mill" nor "over the top". The story stayed true to the source as well as it possibly could. This is one film that could have been longer but I'd rather be left wanting more than to have dry spots. Well done, gang! Bring on the sequels!!! I hope this opens the door for more "R" rated comic book films! They're not just for kids! KUDOS!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool not so dead on arrival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now as this is my first review I may be a bit rough around the edges but j felt so strongly about this subject matter I felt I needed to at least put my voice out there and add my two cents to the mix. Firstly, anyone who sees this will laugh, there isn't a joke on any level both crass and base or high brow that won't raise at least a giggle. I've been following deadpool since his 1997 comic run until the early 2000's and this movie follows along some of these parallels and it does them well while still in keeping with its own thing. Secondly. Ryan Reynolds is a huge fan of the character and it shows, in every way, every line, every frame, every movement. Bryan Singer who created the movie world of the Xmen should watch this and hang his head in shame. Not full of allegories of homosexuality and discrimination with a few fights and comic names thrown into the mix to make you think "oh it's an Xmen movie" no! This is the real deal. There's only 2 count them 2 Xmen at all in the movie and not only does the film get one spot on (colossus) but the other is actually improved upon and given real character and a sure on fan base for the future. Yes there are some details wrong and I could pick apart every small issue like the emotional scenes aren't as good as they could be or the villains not really fleshed out hell even T.j Miller could have used more screen time he was perfect in this. Really from start to finish it is what it says on the tin Deadpool. It's a labor of love and it shows (unlike those OTHER Xmen movies not including the most recent ones) right from the choice of music and the little in jokes like fighting over ikea furniture of all things is hilariously glorious. As also the point of do not bring kids to see this. A family left the movie theater shortly after the film started and I do wonder the logic of parents. Just because he appeared in ultimate Spider-Man does not mean THIS is for kids, far from it. Pick up the comics, see the movie and I am sure you'll be a Deadpool fan yet. Let's hope and pray Xmen apocalypse even comes close to this, also yes end credits scene so stick around true believers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came back from saw it 2-3 hours ago. It was a good movie and I had really a lot of fun. But it's premise was too simple for me. A 'hero' is born, his love is kidnapped, he saves her from the villain. Obviously it twisted that format and made it it's own and the jokes were spot on but yet I felt it had something missing. having read the comics the 4th Wall breaking felt really not good to me. I did loved the side characters especially Colossus and Dopindar (The Indian Guy). The romance was unique for a superhero movie and I loved it. Ryan Renolds was born to play Deadpool and I am very excited for the sequel now that the origin story is out of the way which is boring most of the times. In conclusion, I had a lot of fun however it did not impact me in any way and I will forget it in 2-3 days completely.&#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Merc with a Mouth delivers maximum effort and will want to touch himself tonight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time to own up, I'm a comic-book fan and also massive Deadpool nerd. If my review is slightly excited I apologise. This film nearly didn't happen, Deadpool isn't a conventional hero by a long way, he's not even a hero, the characters traits he shows make him something that Hollywood feared making because they thought it wouldn't sell and feared it would be a legal nightmare - let alone the difficulties anticipated getting clearance by the censors! Leaked test footage in 2012 &amp; 2014 combined with fan power gave this project wheels and the film is enjoyable to both fans and newcomers. It helped that Reynolds was such a fan of comics too; he championed the conversion from comic to film from 2005 on social media. Directed by Tim Miller this comes out exactly 25 years after DeadPool's first appearance in Marvel -New Mutants #98. In one comic I read writers joked at Reynolds to star as Deadpool if ever a film was made - granted there was one story arc where DeadPool gained Tom Cruises face, but that's a whole different story and it was always suggested Reynolds was the man for the job. Here we are in 2016 and that joke is reality as Ryan Reynolds delivers a great performance as the Merc with a mouth. He does much better job here than in his previous incarnation of the assassin in the "X-Men Origins -Wolverine" movie, and so much better than he does as the green lantern which is even joked about within this film. Relatively true to the comics the cast portray the characters in the Deadpool world with T.J. Miller playing Weasel and Leslie Uggams as Blind Al amongst others (even Hydra- Bob makes an appearance!!). It's an origins story showing how Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, gets his regenerative powers and what he had to go through to save his lover Vanessa played by Morena Baccarin from Ajax, Ed Skrein. The action and humour in the film starts from the very moment the Marvel badge dissolves from screen and there is a great pace for the duration of the film all the way through the film and passed the end credits (you certainly get value for your tickets). Lots of camera and editing techniques used throughout to give the film a great look and feel, both modern with classic techniques too. While the main story unfolds flashbacks and flash-forwards act as additional narration to help the audience learn about the anti-hero's journey. I enjoyed the ride and that surprised me, being such a fan I expected Hollywood to ruin this film; this doubt was further reserved with all the great reviews that were coming in since the film was released, I really didn't want to be disappointed and I wasn't. Here I am after the film writing a review to confirm that I actually liked it a damn lot. The acting is convincing, the script is littered with humour and drama which worked well with the expected insanity and violence which was due. As well as the humour in the script there were visual jokes hidden in a beautiful crafted world, typically DeadPool broke the 4th wall with the character as well his surroundings talking to the audience. There were jokes and nods to the previous Deadpool character to feature a the below par "X-Men Origins - Wolverine" movie like the action figure and the suggestion of sewing Wilson's mouth shut; a "Green Lantern" (another role played by Reynolds) card was seen and Wilson even begs not to get a green or animated suit while being treated by the Weapon X programme; talking to the camera DeadPool refers to the previous X-Men films and asks Colossus if Stewart or McAvoy was the current professor at the institute; and at one point the merc even breaks the 16th wall by talking to the audience in a flashback already talking to the audience - typical DeadPool insanity. If you are familiar with DeadPool you'll already be aware of him constantly breaking the 4th wall, and you'll no doubt be aware that he got his "Merc with a Mouth" nickname due to his constant talking and wise cracking. The film portrays that really well without ever getting confusing or boring. Sometimes the joke may not land but that's OK, it's DeadPool and he can't help himself. The minor negatives in the film for me, and let me be clear, these are teeny tiny negatives and didn't ruin the film for me; were Colossus and Ajax. I could have happily seen a different X-Man rather than the metal Russian. I imagine the CGI to create Colossus wasn't easy and maybe a simpler character could have fitted the film better - although the 'fight' scene with DeadPool on the bridge was really amusing. Ajax was a little forgettable and judging by the villains that DeadPool has fought in the comic's film-makers could have opted for somebody else - but then it wouldn't necessarily be an origins based film. I enjoyed this although I didn't think the film was as bat sh*t crazy as it could have been, it actually had as much of a heart as it did blood shed. I enjoyed it more than other movies in the Marvel Universe. The film doesn't take itself seriously and in doing so has a great mix of emotions at different times. Combine that with great action and you have a top notch film that's well worthy of a 9 out of 10 from me. I was more content than I thought I would be being an established fan and an over critical one at that. If you want a crude rude hard paced film with lots of bloodshed action but with a soft romantic side step up and buy a ticket. In fact buy two or three tickets to help fund a follow up movie which might have Cable and or Nick Fury in it!!!</fullReview>

The movie was astonishing with a tangled love story and a revenge saga. Deadpool was intense, funny, violent enough to make the audiences go for it. A well made story and good character played by Ryan Reynolds. Deadpool brings Reynolds back again after a series of failures. Action were timed very well and jokes in between the scenes were funny too. I got what I expected from Deadpool and Marvels continues to surprise with new projects.

I hope he directs the sequel as well.This is such an amazing movie and i had really good time watching it. My only flaw with the movie is that it was too short! Deadpool is going to change the comic book movie genre. Now the film-makers see that even if comic book movies are rated-r, it can make money. I hope they make more rated-r comic book movies in the future. I recommend you to go watch Deadpool as soon as possible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember X-Men Origins:Wolverine(2009), well this movie tells you totally forget that and watch this instead, cause it tells the origins of Deadpool has it meant to be told. The Merck with a mouth named Wade Wilson(Ryan Reynolds) discovers he has terminal cancer, but is offered by someone to be apart of an experiment, is told that it would cure is cancer and give him superhuman abilities, but after it horribly disfigures him. Wade soon embarks on revenge with his newfound skills has Deadpool.I believe that fans of the character, will not be disappointed. Deadpool is supposed to be an incredible over the top cocky character. And if you have seen Blade: Trinity(2004), you know Ryan Reynolds can play that to a tease. Not only a marvel movie but a satire of a marvel movie, pokes fun at all those superhero cliques. Ryan Reynolds is clearly having fun here, so is the rest of the cast, it's not hard to imagine that was a lot of laughing during the filming, you clearly see it in the acting. The effects are incredible, and the action is over the top, but this is a Deadpool movie, expect nothing more or less. It has hard R violence, just by saying this is not a kid friendly marvel film. I was very entertained by this.But if you are easily offended, you should probably stay away from this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-Deadpool is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is the eighth installment in the X-Men film series. The film is directed by Tim Miller, with a screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, and stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano, Brianna Hildebrand, Stefan Kapi&#x10d;i&#x107;, and Leslie Uggams. The film follows Wade Wilson who, after being subjected to an experiment that leaves him with new abilities, hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life.-In February 2004, development for the film began with New Line Cinema. However, in March 2005, New Line Cinema put the film in turnaround and 20th Century Fox became interested. In May 2009, 20th Century Fox lent the film to writers, and in April 2011, Miller was hired to direct. Principal photography commenced in Vancouver, Canada, in March 2015 and ended in May.-Deadpool premiered in Paris on February 8, 2016, and was released on February 12, 2016 in North America in IMAX, DLP, D-Box and premium large formats.--Critical response: -Deadpool has received positive reviews from critics and audiences. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 84%, based on 187 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Fast, funny, and gleefully profane, the fourth-wall-busting Deadpool subverts the superhero film formula with wildly entertaining ? and decidedly non-family-friendly ? results." Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.-Richard Roeper gave the film 2.5 out 4 stars, praising Reynolds' performance but saying the film gets bogged down by its origin story, and all too often becomes like the films it spoofs.-- Sequel: -In September 2015, Kinberg commented on the possibility of a sequel for Deadpool: "we were talking about the sequel while we were making the movie just because when you make a film like this that's from a serialized source material, you hope that it's the first of many". By the release of Deadpool, Fox had already greenlit the sequel, with Rheese and Wernick returning to write, and Miller being looked at to return as director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest Comic Book Movie in a Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing Deadpool does, it is entertaining the audience. It breaks the fourth wall constantly, which any how-to-write-a- screenplay book would surely suggest not to do as it defeats the illusion of the movie to do this. But this is not just any movie. This is Deadpool.Ryan Reynolds is the perfect choice of casting to play the titular character. His quip constantly hits the audience blow after blow to prove for a very likable superhero (though he wouldn't call himself a hero). He may be in the suit, but it is his voice acting which really captures the essence of Deadpool. You can undoubtedly hear the sarcasm or the attitude that comes with all of his one liners.The movie is balanced in the sense that it flips back and forth between chronology, rather than have all the exposition packed into the first half hour and follow the character on a linear path to him becoming the super human he becomes. Instead we have to ask questions as an audience, and Deadpool promises he will reveal the answers in flashbacks, or rather with inter-cutting within the film.Sadly, pretty much all of the cool action is revealed in the red band trailers of the film, which has us wanting more surprises which we never get. Overall, the film seems to only have 2 key action sequences on top of that, meaning this film is more about the origin story than it is about delivering theatrics, although that is probably the point since is the first Deadpool film (please let there be sequels!) Another disappointing aspect is the fact that the CGI for the character Colossus is not that great.Deadpool is a fun experience, and it will have you asking whether all the fourth-wall-breaking makes it a more enjoyable experience as a Marvel movie.3.0/4.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surreal, comedic and insane masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sprinkle of 'Smart-Assery,' some very cool camera work and a wacky- overly comic book styled tone, the opening credits had me in awe. And the movie didn't let up these elements. It kept up with the feel from start to finish. This film was clearly a passion project and it shows, the people behind this film have a love for Deadpool, the fans that came to see it opening day have love for Deadpool, and now, the movie will introduce new people and welcome them to have love for Deadpool. Filled with clever meta-humour and wit. This is the definition of a Comic-Book movie; future Marvel and DC projects should pay attention here. The action is insanely fantastic. I sat there simply impressed by what they accomplished in a movie that at first, was probably considered something to not take seriously. But this film holds up just as well against the other Avengers films in terms of action and special effects. From over the top physics which result in goons and bad guys being taken out on a whim by The Merc with the Mouth himself (As well as a few X-men friends) to the comedic (As well as non-comedic) brutality present throughout. The movie isn't afraid to be violent, which is actually quite an amazing thing. Henchmen kicked and punched, sliced and diced, shot and blown up, and generally murdered in all sorts of creative ways throughout. Deadpool never restrains from violence ? It Embraces it. Wilson is portrayed with quick-fire wit, a sense of silliness, but also a dark side. Wilson is quite a tragic character and the film should be praised for presenting this. The comedy behind Deadpool comes from misfortune and sadness, he is a tortured soul, a broken clown if you will. The characters' motivations are actually quite realistic, and we see that this is a determined character with purpose. This film is a revenge story and an action film as much as it is a superhero based comedy. And there are some real moments to feel for Deadpool. Which brings me to the love story, which I found to actually be quite compelling. There are certainly quite a few crass jokes here, there and in-between however to the core of the film Deadpool portrays genuine heart, and I think that's what really makes the film; Yes, it's a comedy, yes it's satirical of other superhero films and yes, it's wacky, but it's also a genuinely good film on its own. The movie never drags, at just under two hours, I wanted it to keep going! The pacing is absolutely perfect, never once slowing down too much or becoming dull or uninteresting. Deadpool holds your attention and makes you care, even when he is decapitating dudes left, right and centre. I do have one Subjective flaw that I should probably mention though. Some of the jokes just fall completely flat, and some feel like they're just being gross and tasteless simply for the sake of it and due to the film makers' freedom. Yes, the film gained its' (American) R rating, but? relax! However, I went in expecting this, and most of it did its job well. Deadpool is a human being, rather than a cartoon, (Despite his personality.) The film was also so fast paced and quick cut that by the time one joke was said, another was about to be. And there was a fair share of fantastic jokes and humour throughout. The tone of the film and titular character was pretty spot on.The real great thing about the movie is that it portrays Deadpool correctly. At this point Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. Renyolds fits into his role as a superhero icon among Hugh Jackmans' Wolverine and Robert Downey Juniors' Ironman. His comedic timing, dedication to the role and faithful performance result in perfection. The other characters set in this oddly dark as well as cartoon like world come in forms of different relationships to Deadpool. There is his love interest, Venessa, whom matches Wilson's personality. She is much more of a normal person though, so it's toned down as she isn't a super human or anything, however the characters' compatibility is believable, as they are both wise-ass people who joke around with each other, have vague and unhappy pasts and both feel strongly for each other. Ajax, his nemesis of the film, who is played very straight. He is not an amazing character with lots of depth of personality, however he is what the film needs out of a villain, and gets the job done. You dislike him in the way that you are supposed to, and you do want to see Deadpool reign victory over him. Deadpool is a character that you root for, and a movie that you sit in astonishment at. Though at parts it may be silly, Deadpool never strives from admirable. You care about him as much as you laugh with him, and the film manages to maintain an extremely interesting and difficult balance. Deadpool is the definition of an unbalanced character, Deadpool could have easily gone wrong. The minds behind the film have earned a well-deserved praise. First time director Tim Miller knocked this one out of the park, as well as writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. The film is vibrant and energetic. It's pure fun and doesn't take itself too seriously, but manages to be able to when needed. The film is Stylish, and oddly (In a good way) Personal. It's deserving of praise, fast paced and anything but conventional. It's far from boring, funny and contains some really well done action and set pieces. I enjoyed it from start to finish, I finally got to see my hero done right on the big screen, and I very much look forward to future instalments involving Deadpool 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Super Hero like we've never seen before.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An R rated super hero movie. Our prayers have been answered.That is because the people at 20th Century Fox, home of the X-Men franchise, have decided to kick things up a notch and then kick them sideways. In the process, they've given us a super hero movie heavy with violence, very, very, vulgar language and sexual situations. In short, every thing the Spider Man movies were not. We get a movie with attitude to spare, right from the opening credits, which is a joke too good to spoil. Give the writers, Rob Liefield and Fabian Nicieza, along with director Tim Miller great credit; they get the Marvel character of Deadpool right and then some, perfectly capturing the Merc with the Mouth we've all come to know in the comic book. One the best things about this movie as that it does not try and do too much, giving a compact origin and revenge story without shoehorning in too many other Marvel Universe characters from the X-Men books. Unlike Spidey, Superman and Batman, Deadpool does not have a legendary origin story for screenwriters ruin by tweaking it for the big screen. We just get douche bag Wade Wilson diagnosed with terminal cancer and then mutated by risky "treatment" run by Ajax (aka Francis), the villain of the piece whose only motive is to create super powered slaves. Wade, his body now a mass of scare tissue courtesy of Ajax, fashions the now familiar red spandex costume, adopts the name Deadpool, and goes to get some payback. A simple plot that makes sense, unlike some other comic book franchises that believe big is better.DEADPOOL finally gives Ryan Reynolds a part truly equal to his talent, and should make him the super star he should have become a decade ago. He's been a dependable actor in rom-coms and bad comedies, while often proving himself a very capable action hero. Deadpool is makes good use of his physical attributes and great comic timing; the jokes and one liners he gets off are funny enough on the page, but coming out of Reynolds mouth is what really makes them funny. And proving he is a very good sport, the script takes very funny pokes at GREEN LANTERN and BLADE II.There is a good supporting cast, starting with TJ Miller, whose character should simply be called Comic Relief. Ed Skrein makes for a good bad guy with requisite British accent. Morina Baccarin is Wade's tough talking girlfriend, a love interest most worthy of the hero. Stefan Kapicic is the Colossus we've known from the X-books, while Briana Hildenbrandt is his sidekick, Teenage Nagasonic Warhead. Leslie Uggams turns up in a small, but very funny, part as the blind woman Deadpool rooms with a one point. Karin Soni is quite funny as cabbie who chauffeurs heroes to a couple of big showdowns. Stan Lee has his gratuitous cameo, but it really is one of the funnier ones-the man is a great sport.The violence is bloody, and the there is a car chase that doesn't look like every one we've ever seen in a movie before. Many of the jokes are very dirty and in really bad taste-way beyond anything heard on Family Guy. Some of them will make you laugh just because of how awful they are-nobody who sees this movie will never again not giggle at the mention of Meredith Baxter Birney.And there is a great soundtrack featuring Chicago and Neil Sedaka among others.Though this is a super hero movie, it's not one for the kids, and its raunchy attitude breaks new ground for the super hero genre. Let's hope the guys over at Disney/Marvel are paying attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Gonna Be One Twisted Valentine's Day Gift</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Confession: I have a very limited comic book experience. I just learn about these Marvel or D.C. characters from either my 17-year-old uncle or my knowledge from traditional comic-book movies and animated T.V. shows. The best comic-book movies I always connected with the most are the X-Men saga. I've been a fan ever since the first movie directed by Bryan Singer came out 16 years ago. (Currently waiting for "X-Men: Apocalypse" to come out this Memorial Day.) But this is quite new to me when I heard that there is a "Deadpool" movie actually happening. Last time I heard about "Deadpool", I first saw him in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine", which I liked but it was the rotten apple of the series. He was, of course, played by Ryan Reynolds, who made the most of his very small role until... (see the movie or not and see why all of us were so disappointed.) Anyway, me being the reluctant one, I didn't think a "Deadpool" movie would work. Guess what, it's the one all of us comic- book or non-comic-book nerds are waiting for. So why did I warm up to "Deadpool"? Well, for one thing, this guy who dresses up in a red suit is the kind of hero we haven't seen in a while. A man who shoots first and says a few wise-ass things after that. He's also known to break all types of walls (first, second, third, fourth and I'm pretty sure there's a fifth one) and he doesn't give a *bleep* about everything. As played by Reynolds, he seems to be the perfect choice for an R-rated and unbelievably unconventional Marvel character. So, how does this movie work? Well, it starts off with the ridiculously inventive opening titles done in Deadpool's way plus a killer action sequence on a highway. Then it's the origin story of "Deadpool" which is quite a surprising one. We get to meet Wade T. Wilson (Reynolds), also known as "The Merc with the Mouth" and maximum brute force. He also finds his "Pretty Woman" (see what I did there?) in Vanessa (Morena Baccarin from "Spy", "Gotham" and "Homeland"). There is a massive flaw in this system, in which he has cancer. Making sure he doesn't lose her, he signs for a experiment that should help him be cured of cancer. Turns out poor Wade made a deal with the devil, or in this case, Ajax (a stunning Ed Skrein who is obviously a doppelganger for Nicholas Hoult, also known as "Beast" from the "X-Men" series) for an experiment that goes horribly wrong leaving his whole body scarred. Now, all Wade needs to do is get revenge on Ajax and once he puts on the Deadpool outfit, it's all good to go. But standing in his way though are two members of the X-Men: Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (feisty Brianna Hildebrand). "Deadpool" is (and has to be) the best R- Rated unconventional superhero movie of its kind since the original "Kick-Ass". It has the right to make fun of the superhero genre and be super cheeky, clever, dark, funny and incredibly bloody. It even wears its heart and the R-Rating on its sleeve, for example, there's a sex scene with Deadpool and Vanessa, set to Neil Sedaka's "Calendar Girl" that pushes the boundaries to anything I've ever seen. Plus, the bone- breaking, blood-spurting action is about as inventive as one could possibly ask for. Plus, Deadpool also has a tendency to talk smack about everything from the studio that's releasing the film to the X-Men to Wolverine and the actor playing him and even the actor that's playing Deadpool. Although I wasn't a fan of "Van Wilder" and I only warmed to him when he was in great movies like "Definitely, Maybe", "The Proposal", "Smokin' Aces" and "The Change-Up", I like Ryan Reynolds and he's very good here. Scratch the "very good", he's electric in the role of Deadpool. His foul-mouthed, fast-paced and earnest deliveries of certain lines are sure to be quite memorable. And even though there are times when we just want him to shut up, you can't put him down because we like Deadpool and we certainly want him to get the girl. He's also helped by a really cool cast including Morena Baccarin who provides the heart and soul of gold in the love story part, T.J. Miller, who I also like, is pitch-perfect as "the comic relief" (in Deadpool's terms, not mine) Weasel, Leslie Uggams as Uncle Al, who is wise, blind and caring (not in the traditional sense) and M.M.A fighter turned movie star Gina Carano is lethally badass as Angel Dust, who is more stronger than Mr. Pool and Colossus all combined. Props has to go to first-time director Tim Miller (from the world of visual effects) and screenwriters Rhett Reese &amp; Paul Wernick of "Zombieland" for letting this animal go loose in wild, big and cool ways that breaks the usual types of stuff we usually see in most superhero movies and for giving Reynolds an opportunity to get comically crazy and go out blazing with a high chord, like he always does. Deadpool is actually the first movie of 2016 that unabashedly lives up to the hype, mainly because we weren't expecting something quite like this. I don't know if we will have something like this again, but hey, at least it was awesome, right? You'll have a blast, trust me and bring some chimichangas while you're at it. It's the perfect and most twisted Valentine's Day gift you'll give to your significant other. Oh, and one more thing, this movie is not for the faint of heart, the squeamish and certainly not for kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching Deadpool. It is not exactly the typical marvel movie since it had lots if cursing, blood, fourth wall references, and nudity which doesn't really bother me but it feels different. Ryan Reynolds returns as the chatter box wade Wilson who manages to charm himself with his witty humor and given the chance to explore hid origins. Wade is a mercenary that falls in love with a hooked named Vanessa but finds out the tragic news that he has cancer and goes to Francis as a way of fibbing a cure for his illness. While he does findeed a cure for his condition but it also mutates him. One of the aspects I liked was giving colissus a decent role who has been underused in the x men films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is a movie that i was extremely anticipating because i loved the character. I'd played the 2013 Deadpool game which i enjoyed very much, and i quite enjoy the comic of Deadpool as well. I was skeptical about this movie because of the earlier fox box office bomb Fantastic Four which was a huge disappointment, and with a first time director you can never know. But when i walked out of the theater for the first time i knew that i had seen my second favorite comic book movie ever. Tim Miller and Ryan Reynolds captured everything good about Deadpool and added more, Ryan Reynolds give his best performance in his career because he was so passionate about playing this character that he channeled everything he had. There was not a single thing i disliked about this movie, Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead were both fantastic in the movie and actually very funny, T.J Miller proves that he is a master of comedy with the funniest role iv'e personally seen from him also being the case for Ryan Reynolds. Ajax i thought was a compelling villain for a first time Deadpool movie and i thought was played well by Ed Skrein, Gina Carano i thought was good in this movie, and was a good actor for the character she's playing for the comics Angel Dust. Morena Baccarin was also good in this movie portraying Wade Wilson/Deadpool's girlfriend/wife.Overall this movie was fantastic, the movie that Fantastic Four should have been but ironically was not. Overall this movie was Deadpool more than anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I was excited to see this film. I was expecting so much from a movie rated 8.5 on IMDb. After seeing it I am confused how this movie could be rated as highly as others like The Matrix for instance which was an incredible and original film. This film was nothing like it was touted to be, its your basic violent revenge story. I kept hoping for the novelty to show up. It never did.Here is the idea in a nutshell: You have been wronged and have no power to do anything about it. But now, thanks to Hollywood, you are invincible and getting your revenge using unlimited power and killing without remorse. The "smart" dialog made me groan. The predictable storyline bored me. Eventually, to make the film more interesting, I started making bets with myself: could I guess the next cute line? Being in the same room/theater with an actor who has a cute remark every few seconds for two hours straight was mind numbing. When a film is rated R, you expect it to be targeted to adults. This had it's violent content, yes, but violence and cuteness only go so far, eventually you need an interesting story. With that R rating comes an obligation to elevate the material. Watching this movie was like watching a video game, and video games are for children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the few movies I can say a child should not see at all. Ryan said he wanted to do this movie, making it rated R was a big thing. I give him that much.The only thing I hope for in the next film is to calm down on the cursing. I get it, it's Deadpool, he's meant to but at the same time, he curses too much. I think almost every other sentence has the F Word in it. Aside from that, this movie was excellent. If you're not a fan of Deadpool, or Marvel, se­x, violence, misogynistic themes, don't watch this. Do us all a favor and keep your terrible comments to yourself. No one wants to read them. I saw a handful of people calling the movie bad and giving it 1 star.

		<fullReview>I saw Deadpool a couple of weeks ago after finally giving in to all the hype. As I figured, I was not terribly impressed. This movie is about the caliber of the mid-2000 Marvel movies, e.g. "The Punisher", "Daredevil", etc. I think a lot of people are buying into it because they like the character. I'm not a fan of the character or the movie. Yes, it was reasonably well made, but it just wasn't interesting and it had an extremely predictable plot. I suppose one can argue that Ryan Reynolds was good in this movie. As such, perhaps he's the redeeming element. But it still just wasn't a very enjoyable film for me.5/10 Stars.....and definitely don't take the kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd hate to say this but Deadpool was overrated. Yes it was a fun movie but it's hardly as good as what the other reviewers have said. Ryan Reynolds does suit the role but I feel that the story was lacking. It seemed like the story was written simply for the sake of having the opportunity to make a movie and have some wise cracks. A movie should tell a story (even if it is a comedy) rather than writing a lame story so that they can make a movie and sell some merchandise. Dealpool is an assassin but I think he could make his kills more stealthy and less gory. The main villain was not really a "boss" I couldn't work out whether this "Ajax" was the head honcho - he really seemed to be a second in command type. Funnily enough Deadpool himself remarked that the studio could only afford to X- men. If the X-men were interested in recruiting him I am sure that they could have spared a couple more of the younger x-men to help him out. It just seemed lame. So in conclusion I am not saying it is a bad movie, but please stop giving it 9s and 10s, that kind of score should only be reserved for the Dark Knight trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of the Marvel universe but honestly Deadpool was never my favorite character. More and more recent blockbuster filmography is becoming something a friend of mine calls "a product". That movie was one big joke with the audience and its intrinsic property of influencing or contaminating the one next to you. It illustrated what we usually witness around elections and how you can pump up mediocrity. Ryan Reynolds did his best to save the movie from itself being both a hero and a hooligan. Humor seemed so insipid and worn off to the point it was probably boring even at the time the comic book came out. I guess that contributed to the Deadpool persona, he was meant to be annoying and he really was. The thing that really struck me was the brilliant drama that was very cleverly hinted. It never reached a tipping point and that left me with the impression of a real potential. I sympathized with Wade and his childish cynicism as Deadpool who despite being invincible was fragile and disgusted with the way his life ultimately turned out to be. I really hope there will be no second movie because it will surely lack the drama and will be stripped off its controversy. It is interesting how sometimes bad movies uncover the real potential and talent of the lead actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Movies Will Never Be The Same!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen "Deadpool" four times, and I could watch it another four times. Freshman director Tim Miller, "Zombieland" scenarists Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, along with funny man Ryan Reynolds have forged a Marvel superhero origin epic like none you've ever seen. If you've got a skewered, perhaps even morbid, sense of humor, you may enjoy this swiftly-paced, slickly-made, scrambled-up saga about a guy who shares something in common with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine of "X-Men" fame. Mind you, Deadpool is not a run-of-the-mill superhero with role model potential. He has a foul mouth, a perverse sense of humor, and his body heals itself rather quickly, because--like his fellow X-Men, he is a mutant. He wears a red, Spider-man style hood with patches over his eyes. Everything about "Deadpool" qualifies as not only refreshing but also uproarious. "Deadpool" slaughters sacred cows. Instead of the typical opening credits that identify the actors and technicians behind the scenes, we see brief descriptions. For example, director Tim Miller, who has only made two short films, is referred to as 'An Overpaid Tool.' Deadpool jokes about others: "127 Hours," Liam Neeson's "Taken" trilogy, and the "X-Men" franchise. Twentieth Century Fox owns both "Deadpool" and "X-Men," so they can get away with poking fun at their own properties. Ryan Reynolds ridicules himself, too. The former "Green Lantern" star cracks jokes about shunning a green superhero suit after he submits himself to a passel of unscrupulous people to cure him of multiple forms of cancer. Furthermore, he entreats them not to make the superhero suit animated like the "Green Lantern" superhero suit. I thought "Green Lantern" was tolerable, but I hated the CGI villain. Meantime, despite its predictable, formulaic narrative, "Deadpool" suffers from little else. Reynolds was born to play Wade Williams. Let's not forget Reynolds played a milder incarnation of Deadpool in 2009's "X-Men Origins: Wolverine." The "Deadpool" character dishes up deliciously funny lines. As much as I would love to quote those clever quips, the profanity in them prohibits me, so you'll have to hear them for yourself. Deadpool is loquacious to a fault, but everything he utters is hilarious. Comparatively, the villain gets in only one clever line. A lot of moviegoers are going to be quoting "Deadpool," and some of those witticisms may eventually wind up in everyday conversation.Now, let me pause and provide a pithy plot synopsis before I resume my praise in the third paragraph. Wade Williams (Ryan Reynolds of "R.I.P.D.") is a former Special Forces Commando with 41 confirmed kills to his record. He lives in New York City and hires himself out to resolve other people's problems kind of like a sort of "Equalizer." Wade discourages a pizza delivery man, Jeremy (Style Dayne of "Words and Pictures") from stalking a girl. When he isn't working, Wade hangs out with other low-life mercenaries at an obscure bar--Sister Margaret's Home for Wayward Girls-- run by his best friend, Weasel (comedian T. J. Miller of "Our Idiot Brother"), who doubles as the bartender. Later, he meets a girl at a bar, Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin of "Serenity"), who works as a server at a strip club, and they realize that they are made for each other. They share a similar sense of humor, enjoy kinky sex, and seem inseparable until Wade collapses mysteriously. Afterward, they learn to their horror that Wade is afflicted with terminal cancer. No sooner has Wade been diagnosed than a well-dressed little guy in a suit and tie (Jed Rees of "Galaxy Quest") approaches him with a business card and an alternative form of medical treatment that will enable him to survive and emerge as better than better. Wade accepts this nebulous offer against Vanessa's wishes. At the clinic, our hero encounters two unsavory characters, a tall, shady gent posing as a doctor, Ajax (Ed Skrien of "The Transporter Refueled"), and his female assistant, Angel Dust (Gina Carano of "Haywire"), who looks like a linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys. Ajax explains that they will expose Wade to a cocktail of serums and torturous treatments that will prompt his mutant powers to appear and destroy his cancer. Of course, they cherish no such illusions about helping Wade out. Miraculously, the treatment succeeds in curing Wade, and he emerges from this hideous obstacle course of treatments as literally indestructible. The downside is that he looks just as hideous. He looks like a walking, talking pizza with a shaven head, but he is incredibly strong, resilient, and heals in light seconds after succumbing to the worse wounds. Eventually, he adopts a suit to conceal his hideous appearance and searches for Ajax so that the dastard can help him recover his good looks.If you walk into "Deadpool" expecting to see "X-Men," "Captain America," "Iron Man," or "Thor," you're going to be severely surprised. Indeed, "Deadpool" inhabits that outlandish universe, but director Tim Miller and Ryan Reynolds have concocted a subversive saga that is not only R-rated but also not suitable for teenagers. The montage of pansexual practices that Wade and Vanessa indulge in may alienate prudish spectators, and Wade rhapsodizes about the joys of masturbation. After he makes the transition to indestructible, Wade tracks down evil Ajax and kills each of the villain's accomplices when they fail to inform on him. Now, we're talking body count galore with Deadpool slicing up his many adversaries when he isn't riddling them with gunfire. You can take your kids "Captain America" and "Batman," but you should draw the line at "Deadpool" or they will be asking you interesting questions that may challenge your responses. Ryan Reynolds was made to play "Deadpool" and Ed Skrien as 'the British villain' is truly heinous. Naturally, Deadpool's girlfriend Vanessa is a damsel-in-distress, but there is nothing remotely innocent about this dame with a tattoo on her breast. T.J. Miller has some of the best lines in "Deadpool" that discretion prevents me from quoting. After "Deadpool," superhero movies will never be the same!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit that I was skeptical at first about going to see Deadpool, but man am I glad I did! This was by far the best movie I have seen in a very long time. And I watch a LOT of movies.Unlike most movies out there, Deadpool perfectly combined action and comedy. And I will say both are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Great fight scenes and choreography, not too gimmicky, and definitely not too serious! And yes there's blood, but it's not overdone like most movies these days. And as for the comedy, it's actually funny! No, hilarious! Regardless of your sense of humor.Deadpool keeps your attention throughout the entire film, and will have you begging for more! You are surely in for an exciting and wickedly awesome ride! Truly, a must see! Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. No other actor could have done it better! But definitely leave your kids at home, and be sure to stay after the credits. The post credits scene isn't too important, but still.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Deeadpool' is hands down the BEST Marvel (comic) film to date. This time they got it right. Everything you've ever wanted in a comic to live action film is in 'Deadpool'. So many hilarious scenes throughout the film, with one in particular in which Deadpool jokes about the (Marvel) studio couldn't afford more than two X-Men, which include Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. There's an abundant amount of violent scenes with many that were hilarious (bullet in the a$$...literally). Ryan Reynolds was awesome as Deadpool, he can now be forgiven for 'Green Lantern'. There's no doubt in my mind there will be a sequel but how they will top this (instant) classic is beyond me. I just hope they don't rush to do so. Deadpool feels like a breath of fresh air in the genre, let's hope other studios take heed and began to create future films that supplement us die-hard fans which Deadpool has done with ease. I'm may be stretching it a bit by saying this but...Deadpool was absolute Perfection. A Marvel achievement!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun ride especially for guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of rough wisecracking in this fast moving film. I saw this movie with my wife who liked it to my surprise though not as much as the young crowd we saw it with. They apparently knew a lot more about the story than we did.I'm not familiar with the comic but I recognize the style and it's pretty raucous and bawdy, the kind of thing I would have especially liked when I was younger. Ryan Reynolds is a great choice for the lead as he handles the fast talk as if he might have come up with the dialog himself. More of a surprise is Morena Baccarin who plays Deadpool's love interest, Vanessa. I've seen her elsewhere but didn't recognize she could be so lively a sex partner and love object. I thought she was miscast but I was wrong.Speaking of casting, like all good heroic tales, there has to be a good villain and Ed Skrein, someone I don't recognize, fits the bill nicely as Ajax a mad scientist of sorts.But for me the best part of all were the action scenes where Deadpool's moves are a thing of beauty. Assuming a real person executed them, that guy deserves to be recognized and honored.All in all a fun, entertaining time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Redemption: Deadpool gets the restart we all deserve, despite the limitations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally we have a decent X-Men origin story with plenty of heart, spirit, chemistry, and good connections with the original source. The baffling thing is that we receive this gift in the form of the most incoherent and random Marvel character in the entire universe. The character that least requires an explanation gets the most structured and most engaging Fox Marvel film since X-Men 2. But of course, the behind-the-scenes licensing drama and the infuriatingly small budget (compared to what the storyline demands) entangle the film quite a bit.Ryan Reynolds might be the only man in the history of film to totally mess up a cinematic character, and then get a second chance at getting it right by starting entirely from scratch. With the rated R guaranteed and a looser approach to Deadpool, Reynolds knocks it out of the park with a much more accurate performance, and one with plenty of depth and sympathetic pull. His chemistry with the rest of the cast reminds you why he's much better unhinged and uncut (Waiting, Adventureland).Reynolds has actually been the main catalyst at making sure that he helped right the wrongs caused by X-Men Origins. He helped fight to keep the R rating, helped increase the (already small) budget to make this a reality, and has helped craft the flood of social media hype. The hard R rating was the biggest requirement in making this film work; the story and mannerisms of Deadpool are not for the faint of heart. Deadpool is far more in the realm of Spawn as opposed to Fantastic Four in terms of adult content.The script is formulaic in nature, but fresh with crisp dialogue, great one-liners, constant shifts in timeline, and plenty of fun sidekicks to be entertained by. Sadly, because of obvious budget constraints, we are treated to only two major action sequences (the first one overshadows the finale by a long shot), not a single major X-Men cameo, throwaway villains, and most of the time being spent on the creating of Deadpool as opposed to the anarchy that follows. 10 years of production hell and dozens of re-writes could doom most screenplays, but Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick do a great job saving whatever was left.The biggest achievement of Deadpool is how closely it resembles the source material and personality despite getting less money. If you enjoy Deadpool in the comics, you'll enjoy him here as well---even if the eccentricity is toned down just slightly enough to keep the plot structured. The action is intense, the injuries are gruesome, the humor is dark and crude, and the movie never really takes itself seriously. Fourth walls go down, it reveals its own production setbacks within the film, and it has this kinetic comic book flavored energy that hardly ever slows.It might be a case of less money = more freedom, but the lack of funding really tarnishes the movie. Part of the glee of Deadpool in the Marvel universe is his wild interactions with other characters, especially the X-Men. But to put Deadpool in the same supposed Marvel universe as the X-Men and then refuse to have any of the popular characters join in on the fun is baffling and infuriating. Even worse is that we have long-unused X-Men like Gambit (especially) and Cable available. In a tragic case of the production team having more faith than the studio itself, the limitations aren't obvious but become apparent once the final act rolls in and you are left desiring more Deadpool chaos.As a risqué, adult version of The Little Engine That Could, this was a comic book film that was supposedly doomed, expected to fail, and was released with minimal hope---only to be saved because of the strength of the Marvel brand, the incredible online/Reynolds marketing campaign, and a legitimate effort to stay true to the source. Great cast, great energy, and great humor is restricted because of Fox and the ridiculous guidelines everyone has been forced to follow since Disney purchased the property. Deadpool can become a successful franchise as long as they are willing to tie him closer to the rest of the X-Men and Marvel movies---and as long as we keep the same dedicated staff. Don't expect pure unadulterated crazy here; but do expect a great blend of crazy, heart, and entertainment---wrapped together in a limited budget.Most importantly, this is much, much better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious movie with a weak climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There, I summed it up pretty much perfectly I think.Deadpool was refreshingly funny and entertaining and Ryan Reynolds serves as a fantastic driving force. Most of the cinema I was in couldn't stop laughing even from the first few seconds.It's also a movie that will pretty much make you feel every emotion at one point, happiness, sadness, excitement etc. however that also unfortunately includes 'disappointment'. For me I found that the ending was really weak and unsatisfying. After everything that lead up to the final point, there really wasn't much of a 'finish'.In addition to that, the whole plot of the movie was also really one-dimensional and you were expected to look past that entirely and focus on the humour. I think 99% of us can do that and are actually quite happy to but it still left a small residual feeling of discontent with the movie.Would I rate it higher if it had not been advertised and hyped to death, and thus cost me a whopping ?14.50 per ticket? Yes. For what it was, it wasn't worth the price of the ticket. I'm sorry, but I reserve my ?14.50 for movies like Starwars VII. It's the price I'd expect for a 3D movie.Anyway, let's not focus on the bad. Let's focus on the good. It was a great movie, with quite a bit of re-watch value and almost all of the jokes were perfectly on point.Final message, I don't think that this movie should be shown to people under 16. There's a reason for 18+ 'R' ratings. This movie is a perfect example of that reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Deadpool Movie, but Not a Perfect Action-Comedy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll get this out of the way, I know very little about the character Deadpool and what I do know, doesn't really interest me all that much. I admire that he is different from the majority of comic book characters, but I personally don't enjoy him or his stories. That being said, I'm in the middle of the pack on this one, I certainly didn't love it as much as most people, but I didn't hate it. If you go into Deadpool as a Deadpool fan you will come out a bigger Deadpool fan, it's that simple.My biggest gripe is with the generic action story, it's your typical revenge movie from a story standpoint. Deadpool slices through henchmen climbing his way up the latter to the head honcho who kidnapped his girlfriend. We've seen this before and it seemed comic-book movie fatigue was setting in as he was dismembering henchmen left and right. Yes, the killings were more graphic than normal and Deadpool basically narrated while fighting, but that didn't really hit home with me. Maybe had the movie had more interesting villains and raised stakes the movie could have been great. It all felt a bit too simplistic at times, but luckily this is Deadpool we are talking about and he spices things up as he goes.Obviously, the comedy is the high point of the movie, one-liners, jabs at other superheroes, fourth wall breaks, meta-humor, etc. This is what will make the movie so popular and memorable. I found a lot of amusement with the comedy aspect of the movie, opposed to the action and actual story. Not every single joke lands (it's always rough knowing a scene was supposed to be funny but it wasn't), but based on the amount of them in the movie, there are bound to be plenty that hit home. The jabs at Reynold's past roles were great and so were the jokes involving The X-Men. It was a little refreshing getting a different movie than most comic-book based movies (even if this did have some minor similarities). And the meta humor only made things better.I would be shocked to see a comic book fan not like Deadpool. Everything I know about the character (which isn't much) seemed to be full on display. If you think the trailers to this movie looks funny, then it's almost a guarantee you will find the movie a riot. If you are on the fence like me, you could do much worse. It might not be the perfect action or comedy movie, but it's the perfect Deadpool movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling Subversion of the Comic Book Movie Format</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review may be incredibly biased, as I am a massive fan of comics (both Marvel and DC). I watched Deadpool on its opening night at the midnight showing. Being among the elite movie fans who stayed up late to see a movie on a weeknight, I had high expectations for this film. put quite simply, this movie blew my mind. Its humor worked every time and I, along with the rest of the audience, laughed to the point of tears consistently. The action was well shot and kept me interested and the movie finally does respect to the Deadpool character. The acting is good-enough, but Ryan Reynolds really shines through. You can clearly tell everyone was having fun the whole time during filming, and that made the film even more enjoyable. It should be known that this movie IS about Deadpool, so it really does earn its "R" rating. the language in this movie is consistently crude and the violence is as gratuitous as one may expect. Overall, if you know what you're walking into, you will love this movie. (Stay for the 2 after-credit scenes).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a movie makes the entire audience laugh from the opening credits until the very last post-credits scene, you know it's definitely deserving of some awards.The sarcasm and rapid fire witty comments that are strategically placed through the entire movie in sometimes unexpected but still very natural ways, coupled with the "been there done that" vibe of clearly trying to poke fun at other action and hero movies is done exactly right. The non-linear story line coupled with a level of violence and sexual material we're not used to from the pg-13 hero movies and a huge amount of sarcasm and wit gives it almost a Quentin Tarantino meets Ben Stiller feel and it's absolutely awesome. There is nothing quite like this movie and it'll probably open up a whole new door for copycats. Considering this is the directing debut for Tim Miller, I think he hasquite the future ahead of him in directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a different kind of Superhero movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a disastrous outing in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Deadpool is back with a bang in this insanely funny &amp; violent entry. The tone is set right from the word go with opening credits like 'a British villain', 'a hot chick', 'a moody teen' &amp; we are introduced to Deadpool right during the action sequence on highway which we have been seeing in trailers. After slaying goons &amp; blowing a few heads we jump back in time &amp; get to know how Wade Wilson was transformed to Deadpool. After the origin story, we return for more chases and fights. Deadpool is a foul mouthed jerk, a rude crude fighting machine breaking the fourth wall constantly. There's plenty of gory violence with heads blowing &amp; hands chopping. Deadpool is funny ? frequently hilarious with fun poked at his previous Green Lantern role, Wolverine &amp; even a jab at studio for not providing enough budget. As far as story is concerned it's predictable &amp; there aren't any surprises but surely it's very much entertaining &amp; fun to watch. As for nudity &amp; sex scenes, it was censored here in India so can't say much about it but there is a scene where naked Deadpool is fighting Ajax &amp; we can see his p***s. Also some hilarious moments in sex scene montage between Venessa &amp; Wade. In the end it's a different kind of superhero story &amp; exactly the kind of Deadpool movie we wanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is EXACTLY what superhero movies needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into the film, I was not sure, because of average critic reviews. But boy were they wrong. This was the most awesome, gruesome, brilliantly funny and clever superhero movie I have seen in a long time. There is no one on earth that could play Pool better than Ryan Reynolds, and I'm not sure where the stories going to go, but I can smell a quick sequel. Be careful to watch out for the many references to pop culture as well as many other movies. Oh and by the way, for your own sake, stay after the credits, it is brilliant. With a hilarious cameo as a DJ in a strip club/brothel, Stan Lee steals the scene. As well as the references to other movies, it is also jam-packed with X-Men and other Marvel movie gags, so re-watch them so you can get full enjoyment. Although you could argue, that besides Deadpool, there is no other real back-story or character development for any other characters, which is partly true. But this movie is a hilarious splatter-fest, filled with gags, and multiple forth-wall breaks, that is not meant to be taken too seriously. And for a movie that comes out the same time Zoolander 2, it blows it out of the water. Oh and just to add, this had some of the best advertising and trailers leading up to the film that I have ever ever seen. Yeah so go see it ASAP.P.S. This is not your ordinary date movie, just to let you know</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the brilliant marketing this movie had, I had unreal expectations. I was afraid I will be disappointed like with so many other movies. This didn't meet my expectations, it was way bigger than that. I loved every minute. It is action packed. It has a love story. I cried from laughter. I absolutely loved the references Deadpool was making throughout the whole movie. I loved the X-men mutants and I loved the villains. And I definitely loved the craziness of this antihero. I must confess, I haven't heard of Deadpool before the marketing team made their magic, but after this brilliance of a movie, I am definitely starting to read the comics.And the after credits scenes.. so awesome. Way better than any other after credits scenes from other Marvel movies. All in all, it deserves to be watched. More than once.

		<fullReview>First of all I love comic book movies so I'm pretty biased to begin with, but that been said I really enjoyed this. A lot!! I've always thought Ryan Reynolds was a great choice for ol dp. He started out great in wolverine origins then some genius had to "improve " on an already great character by making him unrecognisable from his comic book counterpart. I mean whoever thought the merc with the (sown up) mouth was a good idea should seriously get their had checked. Thankfully deadpool does what he does best in this movie. Run his mouth and kick ass spectacularly. It's pretty much nonstop action and laughs from the get go. Reynolds has redeemed himself with this as far as I'm concerned his motormouth fits deadpool perfectly. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. The villain is nothing special but not terrible either. The costume is spot on as is the humour and I would enjoy sitting through it again I'm sure. Only bad things I can think of is the movie is a little short or feels like it anyway and as I would have liked a little longer and would've liked his healing factor showcased a bit more. When All's said and done though It's the best non pg 13 comic book movie I've seen by far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazingly true adaption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool truly is the role that Ryan Reynolds was born to play and this movie is an utterly phenomenal adaption of the property.The movie remains remarkably true to it's source material. There are fourth wall breaks within fourth wall breaks. Jokes at the expense of the actors playing the characters, at the expense of the cast and crew, the movie and comic book industries in general, comic book movies in particular, the history of the star in comic book movies, and more. The movie was clearly made for adults, although possibly not oriented towards our most mature and adult sides. It is utterly unsuitable for children, both in terms of graphic violence, sexual innuendo, graphic male nudity and hilariously scarring depictions of self affection. Even the end credit stick figure graphics include content that that is hilariously unsuitable for children.As a long time fan of the comic books, I was immensely happy with the movie. It was everything I could have hoped for from a Deadpool movie. It was low brow, offensive, violent, adult humor done extremely well. I think however that even for someone who is not an existing fan of the comics - the movie stands alone well as a brilliantly funny and irreverent spin on the comic book adaption genre. And in light of the news that a sequel has been green lit - it seems like a fantastic launch platform for a phenomenal franchise.I highly recommend that every adult who has ever appreciated super hero violence or laughed at a penis watch this movie at the first opportunity. I can't wait to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is directed by first time director Tim Miller and stars Ryan Reynolds, Ed Skrein, Morena Baccarin and Stefan Kapicic, and tells the story of a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary, who is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers. Therefore adopting the alter ego "Deadpool".It's unbelievable to say, but Fox did it. They made the Deadpool movie I could only dream of. Everything was perfect to the last detail. From the opening credits all the way to the ending. I was surprised to see that they took extra effort in putting in all these small, but hilarious details. It really is a relief that I can say that Deadpool succeeded. I just had so much fun watching this film and the audience in my theater loved it too. Even the six year old in my theater loved it! He just kept on laughing and cheering. It was amazing!Ryan Reynolds is amazing as Deadpool. The guy nailed it. From the jokes, all the way to the famous Deadpool characteristics. It was spot on. And the banter between him and Colossus was just perfect! I'm glad to hear that Reynolds is returning to play Deadpool in future installments. As far as I'm concerned, he wants to play Deadpool forever.The directing by Tim Miller was phenomenal! Very impressive for a first time director. He inserted all the fourth wall breaks in brilliant ways. The action scenes were filmed stunningly and they were breath taking. I'm eager to see what he does next. Rather it be another Deadpool film or something complete different.The biggest praise I can give this movie is that I wanted it to keep on going. I just didn't want it to stop! I actually felt sad when the credits started rolling. Well, I'm definitely going to see it again and my rating might go up a notch. Witch would make it a perfect 10/10.Deadpool is a hilarious, action packed and most of all an entertaining film. You won't be disappointed. Also! Be on the lookout for a very hilarious end credits scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is the 7th film in the X-Men franchise released in 2016. Its the first R-rated X-Men movie. Technically Deadpool was a low-budget movie; its budget was lower than any MCU film. Well, I went to see the movie with high expectations following all the promotional campaign and trailers. And it didn't disappoint me. Right from the opening credits scene, it showed its biggest weapon: humor and violence. Deadpool was hilarious, foul-mouthed, fun, 4th-wall breaker and Amaaziing. It was really fun to watch. The action scenes were great considering the film's low budget. Ryan Reynolds is perfect as Deadpool and the film addresses many things too. The romantic aspect of the film is better than many superhero movies and the storytelling is inventive. The film did the right thing: stick to the source. But it wasn't perfect; The villain could have been more memorable in this revenge story from both sides film. Thus, Deadpool is a pretty damn good entry, a humorous, violent and a breath of fresh air in superhero genre. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

The direction is fresh, and complete. The editor deserves accolades for the exciting way the film was put together. I was skeptical about Ryan Reynolds (especially after Green Lantern), but he was perfect for the role. Reynolds was athletic, genuine, and hilarious. I appreciate breaking the fourth wall in an interesting way, and I love the references to Canada. Morena Baccarin is fantastic as Vanessa, and pulls of some great action scenes. The rest of the cast including: Karan Soni, Taylor Hickson, Kyle Cassie, and Michael Benyaer elevate this film to a must-see for Marvel fans! - Aaron Rothermund.</fullReview>

I actually thought he looked a bit similar to Spiderman because of it's whole red costume and especially the white eyes.

		<shortDescription>"Cabin in the Woods" of Superhero Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Deadpool" joyfully and audaciously pokes fun at other superhero flicks while being one in itself. The film's rapid-fire humor, self referential gags, and ballsiness satirize not only superhero movie clichés but also movie clichés as well. Yet what holds it back from greatness is its superficially structured story, unimpressive CGI action, ineffective resonance and bland one-dimensional characters excluding the titular character."Deadpool" tries desperately to stand out, and to not be seen as just another superhero movie. Well outside of the self referential humor, pop culture references, and the always funny Deadpool, the film becomes exactly what it is so afraid of being labeled as: just another over-the-top, oversaturated, and superficial action extravaganza. The only thing that saved "Deadpool" from being another mediocre excursion into the marvel canon was its non-stop jokes and compelling freedom to do whatever it wanted."Deadpool" could have been great if the writers put the same amount of time, effort, and creativity into the plot, and characters as they put into their jokes. The characters were just same old same old clichés particularly the forgettable villain. The character motivations behind Deadpool getting revenge were silly and almost absurd. Like seriously, he signed up for what happened to him. Also the movie does not suffer from the occasional 'save the world' plot, but maybe just as unoriginal, it suffers from the 'save the girl, kill the bad guy' plot. The worst sin of all is that even though the movie pokes fun at these clichés, it still ends up being guilty of them. With all this said "Deadpool" is still an enjoyably funny fast pace superhero flick that most will like for its new and refreshing humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Another Nostalgic, Family-Friendly Super Hero Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get rid of the dandy, family-friendly superhero who flits across the screen already. My biggest problem with super hero movies today is that they are too family-friendly and largely unoriginal.Given that you are a superhero, you are most likely fighting the most evil men on the planet, and fighting the most evil men on the planet on a daily basis has got to take a toll on your psychology and you world outlook. It makes me cringe every time I see a superhero movie where you have got a guy who is just dancing around happily on screen without a care in the world. Yes I understand, "but Deadpool isn't really a superhero he's just a terrible person who gets paid stop even worse people." Oh you are so right. Simply making the winking suggestion at how bad ass and full of yourself you are makes you a terrible person. I mean seriously, there has to be more to being a hero or a villain than simply thinking about how bad ass you are, because its old news and I don't find it even remotely clever or daring for this glamor boy to break the fourth wall.Deadpools humor is not original. Simply winking at the fact that there are cameras that are supposed to play "the invisible narrator" is a concept that has been overdone in Comedy and Advertising today, and people love it for whatever reason like its never been done before.If you would like an example of non-family-friendly superheroes, go Check out Blade. Go check out the Watchmen. Go see the Dark Knight. All the superheroes here are largely affected by what they have seen on a daily basis. They have real questions about humanity and real questions about saving the planet. They are not simply some attractive looking superhero who wears spandex and dances across the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, rude and very, very good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a comic geek. Until Deadpool appeared in the Wolverine Origins film, I'd never heard of him. Apparently fans were incredibly outraged at that portrayal, and frankly, as the new Deadpool is supposed to be almost identical to the comic version, I can now see why. Reynolds is supposed to be a big Deadpool fan, and it really shows. The humour starts right at the beginning with a brilliant title sequence that sets the scene. The audience is almost a participating player in the film, such is the level of breaking the fourth wall. It's not so much broken as reduced to rubble and crunched under Deadpool's feet! I wasn't sure if I'd take to that but it was just brilliant. This is the superhero film for adults that we've been waiting on. Yes, there's a lot of swearing, but it's really very in context. Yes there are hints at DP's supposed sexual interests but that's presumably for later films. I loved the referencing of the other X-men films. I loved the poking fun at other superheroes. I loved the humour and even the violence was so well choreographed that it was fun rather than horrific, and it was very tongue in cheek. Which is probably a sexual reference somewhere as well... I loved remarks like 'smells like a franchise...' it was just so OTT and funny that the audience was laughing out loud as indeed was I a couple of times. I now know the backstory to Deadpool and am looking forward to him taking his rightful place among the best of the superheroes. I will definitely get it on Blu-ray when it comes out (I expect it will break a whole new set of records when it comes out) and I look forward to the second instalment. My only fear is that any follow-ups can't possibly maintain the humour, the insanity and the sheer pace of the jokes and one-liners that this film brought. Reynolds brings his A-game and blows the X men out of the water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect combination of action and comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'DEADPOOL': Five Stars (Out of Five)A raunchy, and excessively violent, superhero comedy flick; based on the Marvel Comics character (of the same name). The film stars Ryan Reynolds; playing a very different version of the role, than he previously did (in 2009's 'X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE'). Reynolds plays a mercenary, named Wade Wilson, who's subjected to a secret experiment (to cure his cancer); which gives him superhuman healing powers, but it also leaves him severely scarred. The movie also stars Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T.J. Miller, Gina Carano, Brianna Hildebrand and the voice of Stefan Kapicic (as Colossus). It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Tim Miller; and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (based on the comic book character, created by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza). The film scored the biggest R-rated opening of all-time, at the Box-Office (grossing $150 million, in 4 days); making it (also) one of the largest superhero film debuts, ever (beating the likes of 'SPIDER-MAN', 'BATMAN', 'SUPERMAN', 'IRON MAN' and more)!Wade Wilson (Reynolds) is a former Special Forces operative, turned mercenary for hire, who suddenly falls in love with a beautiful escort, named Vanessa Carlysle (Baccarin); after meeting her at a local New York City bar. Then he's tragically diagnosed with terminal cancer. A mysterious recruiter (Jed Rees), for a special program, approaches Wade (at the bar he frequents); and offers him a cure for cancer (in exchange for his involvement in the program). Wislon reluctantly accepts his proposal; but the program not only cures him of his deadly disease, but it mutates him into a scarred, and somewhat psychotic, superhero, as well (with the nickname Deadpool). Deadpool will stop at nothing to get revenge, on the people that mutated him, and (hopefully) fix his disfigured face; so he can go home to Vanessa, again.The movie is the perfect combination of action and comedy; It's a hilarious (fourth wall breaking) spoof, and the action scenes are spectacular (and thrilling) as well. The special effects aren't bad either. I'd give it 5 stars, in both genres; which I never really thought was possible, before now. Reynolds is perfect, as the popular antihero; and it's such a redeeming, faithful adaptation (this time around). The writing is brilliant, and the directing is equally impressive (from a debut filmmaker even). The movie also has great social commentary, on most people's obsession with looks, in our society (Deadpool is insanely driven by this motivation). The film is also one of my new all-time favorite superhero flicks; and I hope they make a lot more R-rated comic book movies, like it, due to it's success!

		<shortDescription>A modern action-comedy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie I've been waiting for for years. I have never picked up a Deadpool comic but I know the character, and I feel like he is just so relateable for me. He's super minus the hero. He's the everyman, a mutant free of the restrictions of morality, politeness, and other such pretentiousness. Wade Wilson starts off as a cocky type, and after becoming virtually unkillable, he becomes the cockiest, most asshole-ish let's annoy the hell out of everybody before killing them mercenary ever. He is juxtaposed perfectly in this film by Colossus, played here as a hilarious goody two-shoes, endlessly annoyed and disgusted by Deadpool's ways, and the charmingly deadpan and sarcastic Negasonic Teenage Warhead. And he faces off against a 200 pound sack of assholes called Ajax who is virtually unkillable as well. It's pretty typical sounding, but the execution is where this movie really hits home. Deadpool for days. God does this movie rule. Let's get down to brass tacks. The plot consists of his backstory and his mission of revenge against the people who turned him into a mutant. A former special forces soldier turned mercenary, he finds true love with a beautiful barfly named Vanessa. But soon their life together turns dark when he is diagnosed with cancer. Out of options, he turns to a shadowy organization with promises of not only health, but something beyond being human. It's here that things turn horrific, but it's only to further the plot really. The real draw of this movie is the comedy and hilariously raunchy one-liners from our hero. And his whole persona in general is so goofy and off the wall that he's impossible not to like. Ryan Reynolds owns this role inside and outside of the suit, almost every joke in this movie hits, only maybe one or two fall flat but this is a minor quibble.The odd thing is, with the offbeat type of humor that it has, this almost feels like a cult classic because of it's quotability, not unlike Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. But this is the rare type of cult film that has actually scored HUGE at the box office as well. Maybe some people were expecting another typical Marvel movie, and boy were they wrong. This is something very different and definitely not for everyone. Personally I think this is one of the funniest films EVER MADE though. Zamboni guy? It's me Margaret? That Liam Neeson nightmare again? This screenplay is AMAZING. Maybe even Oscar worthy. The script is also full of heart and has the ability to SURPRISE. With so many comic book movies these days you know pretty much what you're getting before you enter the theatre, not so with Deadpool. It's absolutely unique in it's offbeat tone and the story is also very compelling, despite some characters being a little one-dimensional, but I think the director made good choices of which characters to humanize to fit the tone of the film. Tim Miller keeps things energized from start to finish, the comic momentum almost never quits and the action scenes are brilliantly shot and edited in this very kinetic and visceral style. The musical score also hits some really funny notes, with some nicely placed hits by DMX, Wham and Neil Sedaka amongst others. How much do I love this movie?? I've already seen it twice and I'm seeing it again later this week. Never before has there been such a perfect blend of raunchy comedy, romance, action, comic booky goodness and endless self-referentialism. This movie doesn't care what the masses think. It exists to give a severed-hand middle finger to the glut of overly serious, often mediocre comic book movies from recent years. It even makes fun of it's own budget cuts by Fox studios and makes endless jokes about that terrible first Wolverine movie and Hugh Jackman, who was in fact a big part of getting this movie made. This movie is so much fun. See it. See it right now. Or you'll be on Deadpool's naughty list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, it's not a superhero movie, it's the most hated movie ever turn into an awesome antihero movie, to start with, nobody wanted to make this movie until someone grew some balls to, and it came out fantastic, the only part i disliked was when it ended because it was too short for me, i couldn't get enough, it fulfill all my expectations and more, they did everything so amazing and detailed that i felt i was reading the comic once more, and for all those little ball sacks, lifeless and Twilight lovers (the ones that reviewed this movie as bad) Obviously didn't read the comic or ever heard about it, are all those little kids that went to the cinema because it was popular, sad kids. you cannot rate this movie as bad if you have a little brain. It had everything in it. Plus the insanity. So kids, stay away from this movie, if you can't appreciate it you might want to watch Twilight again. thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could give this 100/100. I went to see it with my friends yesterday and we couldn't stop laughing. I first heard about Deadpool when I was 9 and I first heard about a deadpool movie in 2009 and have been looking forward to it ever since. Was it worth the wait? Yes it was. The action was perfect. We finally got to see Colussus with a Russian accent. Ryan Reynolds was perfect as deadpool. The sinead o'connor jokes were hilarious and the Limp Bizkit joke. Even the opening credits were hilarious. I really liked Francis the bad guy. I would go see this movie again. I really liked the first scene where he's in the taxi with the Indian driver. The 4th wall scenes were brilliant and I love the low budget jokes. The after credits scene is just amazing and very funny. I am very excited for the sequel where we get to see Cable. We finally got to see Deadpool on the big screen for the first time. The very first time. The first time ever. We have never ever ever seen him on the big screen DO YOU HEAR THAT GAVIN HOOD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NO spoilers in this review. I loved it and would like people who see it to not have it ruined by some guy blabbing about what happens in it. Go see it for yourself. If you're not the kind of person who can enjoy a hard "R" movie, though, be warned - it is on the edge of NC17. Language, nudity, sex, violence, immorality, torture, check, check, check. It really earns the R. Ryan Reynolds is perfect in this part. He nails the character. Deadpool is fast-paced, funny, ultraviolent and incredibly crude. Also clever, archly satiric, and possibly the best comic book movie ever made... at least it's right up there among the best. that completely delivers on the essence of Deadpool. The pacing is also very tight with the exception of a few slower scenes which seem to be there to allow the audience to rest up a bit. The self-referential stuff was brilliant, just brilliant. They even took some potshots at star Ryan Reynolds, a couple delivered by Ryan himself. If you enjoyed "Kickass", this is Kickass on steroids and too much caffeine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is here with a movie he totally deserves!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, for me, 2016 is probably my most sceptical year in a very long time. Even though there are some big movies coming out like Batman V Superman, Finding Dory and Fantastic Beasts, I'm not sure they will turn be the best movies of the year. And Deadpool was one of them for me.I don't know much about Deadpool but all I know that he's immortal (like Wolverine), he has a dark, twisted sense of humor and he constantly break the 4th wall. I think I've heard enough to enjoy this film. At first, I was worried about this movie. Why? Because of Fox's last superhero film being the biggest trainwreck in many years. (You know what movie I'm talking about? Yeah, you do.) But after hearing all the buzz from critics and audiences, I finally managed to watch this movie. And all I can say is... pure perfection!Honestly, this is probably THE best superhero film since Iron Man 1! This is a really different superhero movie with a lot of brutal and crazy action and gut busting moments. Ryan Reynolds is the right actor to play as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. He was brilliant. The rest of the cast is also brilliant! Ed Skrein, T.J. Miller, Brianna Hildebrand, they're just great. This also has a lot of fantastic movie references that I just laugh my head throughout. The plot is highly different, fast- paced and original. Honestly, I surprisingly didn't find any flaws with this movie. This is one of those flawless movies that just came out of thin air like Gravity.If you're a big fan of superhero films, please don't miss Deadpool. It really is the best superhero film since Iron Man 1. I never thought can be as good as any other superhero films can be. And as for the score...*Not sure what score I should give this film. Even though I don't have any flaws with this movie.*Oh well. Deadpool gets a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is with so much hype? Deadpool is a decent movie but it ain't any earth shattering epic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given so much hype had been garnered for this movie, it built so much enthusiasm in me that got me in theater with high expectations. However, as the movie progressed, the anticipation, the enthusiasm started fading away and gave way to restlessness to finish the relentless ordeal.Deadpool in parts is a good movie, it has neatly done action sequences, good cgi and nice humour thrown in between along the way. Reynolds looks fab when within the suit (pun intended). However, everything to do with real guy outta suit is too tad dragging, especially for a superhero movie, I have never witnessed such a dragging back story which did not hold any interest for even a tiny second.Further, the story overall is totally lackluster. Sequencing of the movie is non linear which kinds of takes away the fun sometimes. Antihero played by another mutant is a damp squib with snore worthy ending. After a certain point, all the humor which was holding the movie in first few minutes of the movie starts becoming drab.I have seen reviewers even comparing this movie with TDK and other superhero flicks. Its sad to see the herd mentality over so much hype for the movie which at best deserves a mediocre praising for its cgi, fight sequences, actress and overall attempt to bring out a kickass-as-an-adult comic book caper movie.</fullReview>

(17+ and maybe very mature 16 year-old teens, but please nothing younger) I loved the total disregard of the fourth wall. Had great physical comedy elements, especially when they were used hand-in-hand with the action sequences. Never thought I would laugh so hard even during gory sections on the combat scenes. The male actors are super-studs, the women are super babes, and the action and humor are non-stop. Warning, full frontal nudity (male and female). I plan on watching it again and buying the DVD. As much fun as Blazing Saddles! A must see!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest to goodness comic book superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I don't think there are any spoilers in what I'm writing, but just in case I ticked the box.I'd just like to start by saying, that as much of a sci-fi/superhero movie fan I am, I am NOT a comic book reader and never have been. So I've gone into this movie with no preconceptions about what the movie should be in order for it to do justice to the comics.One thing it is worth noting, although I would be surprised if anyone didn't already know this, but if you are expecting a regular superhero movie with mega set pieces and CGI effects that are cutting edge then you are going to be disappointed.The film has clearly been made on a tight budget, the effects are in some areas less than what you'd expect from a run of the mill action/hero movie. Also some of the action is less elaborate than what you might come to expect from a Marvel production.This being said, thats not a criticism, in fact it only makes the movie more appealing to audiences who are a little fed up of big budget movies that wow you with effects only to leave the story somewhat lacking.Of late, a fair number of these kinds of movies fail to meet the mark. They've clearly had millions spent, been years in the making and are visually stunning but they often lack a certain quality. If like me this has been your opinion of a large number of movies like this over the last 10 years then you'll be pleased when you see Deadpool.Ryan Reynolds couldn't be any more perfect for the role, combining his Van Wilder style humour with that of a guy who would do anything for the one he loves.What I loved most about Deadpool is the fact that it's blatantly not taking itself serious, the raft of in-jokes is enough to tell you that the people making this movie care more about entertaining the audience than appeasing studio executives. This probably explains the movies birth and the time taken for Reynolds to get the backing to make the movie.I am personally a fan of Reynolds sense of humour, for some I imagine it could be a little over the top. While I can see why this might make some of his roles a little love/hate it's the perfect tone for this movie.It's been a long time coming for a superhero movie that just does what it says on the tin, entertains, makes you laugh and generally ticks all the boxes. The one liners and quips are perfectly executed and the action manages to stay at a level to keep everyone happy.As I've already mentioned the budget constraints do show in places, but despite this the team behind this movie make do with what they have and manage to make a film that will be a classic and a much loved addition to peoples collection.There is likely to be a sequel but I can't really see the chance of Deadpool appearing in an ensemble X-Men film due to the tone of this film and his character. To be honest though I'm not sure that's a bad thing.I for one can't wait to buy the blu-ray and see the outtakes and blooper reel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A absolutely necessary refresh of the Marvel's movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After painfully regretted wasting my money on the mediocre (to put it mildly) Age of Ultron (or Avengers 2); basically a carbon copy of the first Avengers minus the humor, any kind of emotion or coherence; I decided to dedicate my resources to serious creators, not to studios only dedicated to squeeze a cash cow far beyond dead. I caught ANT- MAN in a long flight and just because there was really anything else to watch so I gave it a try; and enjoyed almost two hours of decent fun time. The movie was not good but at least it wasn't taking itself too serious and Paul Rudd did a good job.When I heard about DEADPOOL; perhaps the funnier character in Wolverine; played by Ryan Reynolds a guy who can take sarcasm to the next level and without the constrains of the PG-13 rating; I decided to give the movie an opportunity and I was not disappointed.Without the limitations of kids oriented movies (but still restrained in my opinion); DEADPOOL can say and show things any other movie of this kind would not dare. There is some nudity (nothing erotic), a sex scene (not too erotic either but played for laughs), strong bloody violence and continuous F-bombs and cruel one-liners that might not be appropriate for kids (I doubt many kids will understand most of the jokes). Could the movie have been better; perhaps a more developed villain could have helped (however this is the kind of movie where the main character is interesting) or perhaps less restraint in images side not only the verbals. MARVEL's made a bet with this movie; but it was not huge one. The production values are fine but there is no extra money for cameo or big names (Reynolds break the fourth wall a few times and joke about the money constrains).In brief; it is the funniest Marvel yet and really deserves a public with brains)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is perfect. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is suited to the role perfectly, and I really can't imagine anyone better playing the merc with a mouth. Not only that this movie is absolutely hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing throughout. From the opening credits to the end, this movie new what it was and made many jokes about the x-men universe and Ryan Reynolds in general. It also made a bunch of other jokes about films, celebrity's and the like. They also broke the fourth wall on many occasions. Saying that I think they got the balance just right between comedy, actually telling the story and action. Also, I thought that the love story may have just been tagged on to get Deadpool to do something but it actually fitted the story perfectly. The villain was also fine for a film like this and I thought that the actor played him well. Therefore, I absolutely loved Deadpool and think this is one of my favourite Marvel movies. However I urge you not to let your small child watch this, as there are quite a few graphic sex scenes and a lot of swearing. The jokes are also very rude, and it is extremely gory at times.</fullReview>

Ryan Reynolds really was born to play Deadpool and his timings was perfect. The action sequences so violent and unflinching, and the humour so crude and twisted. The real superheros in this film was the writers. Even though its bit ridiculous I am dreaming about the fight between Deadpool and Wolverin (sad about Hugh Jackman) or joke fight between Deadpool and Spiderman (he he). Nothing about the film just go and watch with your lover (its pretty romantic too....). Thanks to whole crew for this and we really love you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A super hero with a bad mouth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a Deadpool movie was first announced, it sent the fans into a frenzy but things were little pessimistic considering the content would be too mature and too ugly for a comic book super hero and a possible R rating could actually be cutting off a large section of the target audience, this resulted in a development hell for over 10 years.Finally the reins were transferred to Tim Miller and Ryan Reynolds was roped in to play the eponymous role. Deadpool was the first of its kind superhero who comes in with an inbuilt sarcasm trigger and knows how to use his superpowers both selfishly and irresponsibly. Well! You can say therein lies the charm of it all.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a kind of mercenary who helps teenage girls get rid of their stalkers. He runs into Vanessa Carlysle (Moreanna Bacairn) an escort and they both hit it off instantly. They move in together and start making love as much as they can and finally year later, Wade proposes to her, which Vanessa readily accepts. Their joy is short-lived as Wade is diagnosed with terminal cancer, he chooses to break up with Vanessa as he cannot bear the thought of her being stuck with him, Vanessa refuses. Wade is soon approached by a recruiter (Jed Rees) of a top-secret private program which promises Wade to cure him of his cancer but also give him super powers as a bonus. Wade brushes of it as a joke, but then one night leaves a Sleeping Vanessa and enters the program.The program is run by Ajax (Ed Skerin) and assisted by Angel Dust (Gina Carano) who run a series of tests on Wade bordering on gruesome tortures and finally insulted in a verbal battle Ajax reprograms things in such a way Wade's cancer is pushed to go as far as it can go triggering the mutant factor, leaving Wade with a disfigured face and strong super powers.Faking his death, Wade goes in search of Vanessa, but comes to a conclusion with his disfigured she may not accept him, he stays clear of her.He soon dons the red costumes names himself Deadpool based on a death guess game which his friend runs in the bar. Deadpool goes after Ajax aka Francis as the latter had once commented he has the power to change the former's face back to normal.Meanwhile on deadpool's tracks are Collossus (Stephen Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Gina Carino) who want him to join the x- men team.The movie is one hell of a laugh riot and a roller coaster ride of gruesome violence and curse words. Ryan Reynolds is a wow as Deadpool, and brings the character to life.Morena Baccairn is enchanting with her trademark smile and It is Gina Carino as the teenage warhead who gives the movie's most funniest moments, her dead pan expressions are a riot.Tom Holkenberg's music complements the movie's theme as does the crazy credit sequence in the beginning of the movieTim Miller has been successful in getting the comic superhero to life and at the same time should have opted for a more dangerous villain than Francis (Ajax), all in all the movie delivers what it promises.I was just a tad disappointed because of the weak villain, but yes I would recommend it to anyone who would want their superheroes delivered a bit differently</fullReview>

The flashbacks are funny scenes, but they break a bit of the movie rhythm, break the excitement of the previous scene when you were seeing Wade Wilson as Deadpool (mentioning that Gina Carano is a bad actress, she has no charisma at all and in all of her scenes, she has a " little smile " on the face , breaking the climate of acting). Another downside is that, because of this simple story, the film seems vague, as if it needed something else to fill like more action scenes or character's delusions. After all, Deadpool is full of iconic scenes and good actors (especially the Brazilian actress Morena Baccarin, who is great), it has great special effects and CGI, and an excellent edition. Great film with explicit violence and bad taste jokes. A good Tim Miller work which I will probably watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly....great?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess i went into Deadpool with low expectations. I like the character, and felt like Ryan Reynolds was good casting, but the February release date had me a bit nervous..... tack on the lackluster commercial campaign with what seemed like forced-laughs and i have to admit i was a bit nervous...After seeing the movie you totally get WHY the commercials were so iffy: All of the best stuff was completely inappropriate for a commercial. This one goes all out, full throttle for that R-rating, and thank goodness it did! What a tremendously fun film with a surprising amount of heart.. The love story is quite touching.Also, i think this may be Stan Lee's best cameo yet. Very good movie. Look forward to the sequel!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So i went to see this with my brother and his girlfriend tonight, i was extremely impressed! I was honestly looking forward to seeing this for months! I never had heard of Deadpool before in until it was announced that Ryan Reynolds will play as Deadpool. However i found out last night, he was playing as Deadpool in a X-Men movie way before the character was the main lead in his own movie! He also played the Green Lantern (who i don't really have interest in) so hes right to back away from getting a third role as another superhero figure!I really loved the humour, it was so cheesy, yet it can be pretty rough at the same time! I think Deadpool in my opinion, would be the best role model for people with cancer because, he is super confident and would make you laugh. It proves all the individuals who have the disease, are superheros and fight it like legends they really are!:)Hands down, this is the best marvel movie that i have seen in a long time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just seen Deadpool last night and I have to say it was pretty entertaining. First and foremost the "you should be a shamed of yourself, this is crude and disgusting humor" type of people only have themselves to blame for their poor experience. This IS who Deadpool is. I'm 100% sure those people had NO idea who Deadpool was and thought "honey let's go see a lovely super hero movie tonight!" They should be the ones ashamed of themselves for not doing research on a character they had no prior knowledge of...not to mention the "R" rating should have sent up some sort of red flag. P.S. Marvel Studios, the guys who have a hand in the Captain America, Thor, Iron Man movies... weren't the ones who made this film. Again, it just shows the ignorance of some of the reviewers reviewing this film.So moving past all of that and focusing on the positives of the film I'd like to start off by saying this movie does the Deadpool character justice. It's funny, violent, off the wall, and downright entertaining. My theater and I were laughing at just about every wise crack and joke made in the movie. My buddy who had no idea who Deadpool was even said that he thoroughly enjoyed it.There were a lot of subtle jokes in the movie as well that require you to have previous knowledge of past Ryan Reynolds films.Take the movie for what it is, entertainment. Personally I got exactly what I paid for and I couldn't have been happier. If you're a fan of Deadpool then I'm more than confident that you'll be a fan of this film as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to make the chimichungas!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superhero movies always navigate a very narrow furrow that can easily slip into self- parody or unintentional laughs. What is impressive about 'Deadpool' is that it tests the edges of both mainstream superhero movie franchises and the validity of comic book sacred cows. Marvel was ever the more fun comic house than DC and as a comic book Deadpool was a melange of underground comic humour and coolly wrought ultraviolence from British comic books. All of this is present and correct in a film that absolutely knows it is a reboot - and tells you - breaks the fourth wall into jokes about the fact it knows it is a movie and contains genuinely funny and poignant moments. That the film plays ultra fast and ultra loose with the medium yet makes you care about and want to see further adventures of this Deadpool on the big screen is testament to what Hollywood long thought a risk. For year the most profitable comic-book adaptation was 'The Mask'. More films should have been made like it and here us why. Go see it with a big crowd and enjoy. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want chimichungas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect Valentine's Day (Massacre) film - some spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't know who Deadpool is, then why are you reading this? Go find a comic or two and read up on who this anti-hero with the mouth that just won't quit really is. THEN go see the movie and read some of the reviews.Having said that, this actually turned into a Valentine's weekend date for my wife and I. We needed to get out of the house for a bit, and I said that I'd like to go see Deadpool, but I wasn't sure she'd like it. I mentioned it had Ryan Reynolds in it, and showed her the trailer. So SHE said, sure, let's go for it.Note that my wife likes the Marvel comic movies as well as action movies, and language doesn't offend her. We both LOVED the movie - she kept trying to remember all the one-liners from the movie, there were so many of them. Morena Baccarin was perfect as the girlfriend. And when Wade proposed to her with the ring pop - and pulled it from where ... way too funny. Also using the head chopped off from one of the guy's he'd killed AS the weapon to take out another bad guy - and then using it as the dot on the i in Francis ... Yet at the same time, this never really felt like it went too over the top. This was more like how real world people would end up being in a world with super heroes and mutants. Of course, Deadpool breaking the fourth wall all the time was good, too.One thing we discussed afterwards is that the humor was paced out well. You knew you could laugh, and NOT miss something else. Was there a huge amount of violence, with blood and brains splattered? And was there an assortment of nudity? Yeah - you don't go into this movie thinking you're going to see Captain America. This is Deadpool - probably what She-Hulk would be without the comic censor code.Oh, and like I said, my wife and I both loved the movie, and it's one we wouldn't mind seeing again for the action, the humor, and the sheer fun of it. And of course, you do get Stan Lee as well - I think he probably enjoyed this cameo most of all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable. The best unexpectedly funny movie since Kick Ass.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING, CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!)2015, to be honest, had some underwhelming-ass movies (e.g. Spy, Kingsman and Age of Ultron). Not that any of them were terrible in the least, but just didn't have an edge or personality in terms of strong comedy and characters that made them memorable for the amount of time it takes to fap to the latest Suicide Squad trailer (which looks to be mindless fun). Spectre and Fantastic 4 I found myself not seeing, but instead the inside of my closed eyelids. So, yeah, I had mixed thoughts on what this movie would really be like and what it would provide outside of some genuinely well-thought-out gags and CGI stunts.So there me and my Step-dad (a addict for what I prefer to call "crack comedy" on steroids and gritty violence) sitting amid a growing crowd in the cinema, having last week watched the hypnotising 'The Revenant', and about to see a hilarious satire of not just superhero movies, but a film to go down in history as the Kick Ass of this decade. The opening 30 seconds had several in the audience choking on popcorn kernels in their fits of laughter, and also shows amazing choreography. The action is obviously the best part of the film, adding in great physical and, well, physical gags into the mix. The story is kinda already been done (a 'cure' for a disease for our main hero only to be put through something equally harrowing); in fact, though it doesn't directly show it, it definitely comes off of the Kick Ass films with Deadpool loosing his sense of pain and wielding two sabre- like swords.OK, so let's get down to why I love this movie to death: for example, there's a scene very later on in the film where the villain, Francis, asks Deadpool to spell out his name. It plays out throughout the film and you think it's just going to build to nothing. But the he looks down off a building after Deadpool says he'll "spell it out for ya" only to see he literally has spelling Francis's name out -- in dead bodies. That had me laughing on the floor. And that kind of stuff, along with the jaw-achingly funny dialogue, is all through the movie. Little touches here and there. It's this that can lead to dozens of rewatches. Every single second the film's trying to throw a joke at you, and the majority of them hit bullseyes. What can I say that probably hasn't been or is going to be said about this movie already? The actors in this film are beyond great. The scenes where the majority hero is dealing with cancer are taken pretty well, with his actual transition into becoming "mutated" a pretty few scene. But what really shines in Deadpool's quirky remarks; we've all seen this kind of not-too-taken-seriously setup before, but the jokes given and the way the characters work off of each other keeps you entertained from beginning to end. Gore, sex, humour, gags, reference and, of course, quick and bloody action from a gritty superhero film, I couldn't love his film more. My best advice to anyone who's reading this is to see this film in a large cinema with a packed audience. The reactions will be almost as funny as the film.Nitpicks: Villain was pretentious and not very intimidating (though the stereotypical treatment was probably intentional)Ending was anticlimactic - could have just used more gags and better pacingWhatever did happen to that dufflebag?9/10 - if you like Hot Fuzz or Kick Ass (the first one) you'll adore this one. Most inventive and memorable film I've seen in a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*almost no spoilers*With one of the best marketing strategies ever, the movie paid off. The intro is one of the best, like, ever, man. It's weird that this movie has been in development hell for almost decade and a half and needed that leaked test footage to gain interest by people and being noted by the producers. OK ... the movie is totally heavy R with lots of gore and nude. Lots of dirty jokes, a few fourth wall breaking. Gina Carano was great in the role. Can't say the same for Ed Skrein though. The guy is just forgettable. Really, the time when the sequel comes out people won't remember him. And a little bit other thing that I didn't like was the WAY TOO MUCH references for movies. WAY TOO MUCH. There is even an reference for an old 1986 action classic movie that most people would not even understand that it is for.Highly recommend it to go see it at the theater! It is worth it. 9/10 .. for now. Could go higher after a few more viewings in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is the movie we were desperately asking for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds is back in the one role he was meant to play all this time. I cannot state enough the positive impression he made in the otherwise awful Origins movie, despite his extremely limited screen time. He was just perfect for it, unbelievably perfect for it. I never imagined there would be any semblance of a meaningful romance or emotion, and yet here it is. Somehow through Wade and Vanessa's sex scene montage through the year's holidays, you get a real sense of two people loving each other. Even at it's most gratuitous, the sex in Deadpool is more soulful than the vast majority of other movies, even if it's not particularly romantic sex. When they find out about Wade's illness as well, there is a little exchange that genuinely broke my heart (by exchange, I mean he narrates over it, but it's hugely telling).Unconventional storytelling, surprisingly relatable romance, check and check. Two things I never expected to find in a Deadpool movie. But what about what I did expect? Humour. I expected a lot of humour. You know what I got? I got a lot of humour. I don't watch a huge amount of trailers, and rarely ever more than one per movie, but while many studios like to parade the best jokes in the trailers, Deadpool managed to get away with just teasing the worst ones. There's a whole lot more in the movie, and they're a whole lot better too. Yes, it's very crude. Very, very crude. And yet it's more than just laughing at dicks because dicks are funny hurr hurr hurr. There's some genuine wit and thought put into these jokes. It's far from the only source of laughs as well. Some of the biggest laughs it got out of me were from it's self-awareness. The movie knows what it is, knows what it's a part of, and pokes a lot of fun at it. There's a number of jokes poking fun at the Origins movie, the X-Men, Wolverine himself, but also Hugh Jackman, the fact Xavier has been played by two actors, Reynold's stint as Green Lantern. It's hugely aware not only of the universe Deadpool resides in, but also the universe in which the movie resides. It's inescapable with Deadpool's trademark of breaking the fourth wall and addressing the audience directly ("Breaking the fourth wall inside a fourth wall? That's like...sixteen walls!").The other thing you expect from Deadpool is gore. Completely over-the-top, gratuitous gore. Deadpool certainly does not shy away from blood and gruesomeness. It's the blood-splatting R- rated affair everyone hoped and dreamed of for all this time. And yet, I can understand why, on the gore front at least, it didn't get a full-blown 18 on this side of the pond. It's definitely no Tarantino flick. There's beheadings, broken bones, headshots, as well as Wade's own gruesome transformation, but there's no spraying of blood, or guts hanging over the floor, or any of that kind of gore you'd expect in a Saw movie. In fact, when it does get bad, Deadpool tells the camera to look away, leaving only the power of suggestion to fill in the blanks. Is it a gory movie? Yes. Is it gratuitous? I wouldn't say so, no.Finally I'll just touch on the acting a moment. Mainly to lay unbridled praise upon Ryan Reynolds shoulders. He has been completely dedicated to making sure this movie happens, and that he remains in the role. His small appearance in Origins as Wade Wilson was probably his best performance, and he's managed to tap into it again effortlessly for Deadpool. He's just an effortlessly funny guy. The jokes come tumbling from his mouth as if he's spitting them out, one after the other. He never stutters or stumbles. The only downside to Deadpool is that he has a mask over his face, so his facial expressions get lost, but let's be honest, that was never Reynold's strong point. The supporting cast are pretty great as well, especially Morena Baccarin as Wade's girlfriend Vanessa. They share perfect chemistry together, and she never drifts into damsel in distress mode. So there we go. After all these years, Deadpool finally got his own movie, and he was actually done justice. It's gory, it's crude, and it's completely hilarious. I am so glad that I was wrong about this movie (although, no matter how bad the previews made it look, I would still have watched it either way). I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes dark or crude humour, or superhero flicks, but I would definitely not recommend it to anyone under the age of fifteen. Blood, crude language, and full nudity are commonplace. I mean like seriously, why do I feel I have to write that? If it's a 15, you shouldn't have to ask whether it's appropriate for a twelve year old, the answer is obviously no, otherwise it wouldn't be a 15. Anyway, I give Deadpool a very good 8/10. Bring on the sequel.</fullReview>

We have to admit DEADPOOL IS BATMAN and SUPERMAN and X-MEN . Deadpool has the singular virtue of being funnier than we've been led to believe a superhero film can be.Deadpool's irreverence and DGAF attitude is admirable. Deadpool isn't the Avengers.

		<fullReview>So I just got out of my second viewing of Deadpool, when Marvel studios first kicked off I prayed to god this would happen one day, a Deadpool movie as has been my favorite character since the early 90's with his appearance in New Mutants! So the movie made me very excited and very terrified because this could have just been the biggest fail. Well, it wasn't, everything by Ryan was perfect and I mean perfect, Deadpool is Ryan Reynolds, he nailed it. The costumes where great, they really bought him to life with the Animated eyes, really awesome. The humor was perfect, perfect for an R Rated movie, in Deadpool style well timed and extremely witty! The movie is very very very violent, which I kind of gathered it would be, but even so you found most of it funny. . . The jumper punches at DC and everything else through it where amazing, it's very rare these days you sit in a cinema and everyone is laughing! This movie is violent, funny, smart and exciting, everything you expect from Deadpool when you read the comic and now it's on the big screen. 10/10 Can't wait for the second!</fullReview>

Moreover, it's rated R for all the good reasons !Ryan Reynolds was epic in his role of Wade Wilson AKA Deadpool. Morena Baccarin plays his ravish girlfriend, Vanessa. TJ Miller is there for some comic relief. But..it's all about Deadpool. It's all him. Not the villains, not the guest stars, it's all him and his crude, vulgar yet, hilarious humor. The timings are impeccable.Villains and Guest stars, Gina Carano AKA Angel was pretty cool and sexy. Stefan Kapicic AKA Colossus was there for some impressive CGI showdown, and comic relief. Brianna Hildebrand AKA Negasonic Teenage Warhead, solely picked because of the name, was impressive. Specially her powers. The best guest star was not there in body, you'll find out.Overall, if you want great laughter, enjoy epic fights and a simple story, Deadpool is the movie.

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie apology ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool, if you casually dip in and out of the comic genre, is a superhero. You may have heard the name somewhere on screen before, but probably forgotten. However, if you know your comics then you probably salivated at the prospect of seeing the 'merc with a mouth' going toe to toe with Wolverine in the X-man's 'origins' movie. Then you watched it and uttered words that no self-respecting spell checker should let me type.Basically, the makers of Wolverine: Origins completely messed up (putting it mildly) and the fans were not amused. Yes, Ryan Reynolds was actually a pretty good choice for the gobby anti-hero, but then they pretty much cellotaped his mouth shut and completely reinvented his character in the worst way possible. It actually makes a nice change to see a studio admit they totally got it wrong and do something about it (even if the decision is largely governed by money!).And that could have been that. However, luckily Mr Reynolds himself campaigned to bring a truer representation of the source material to the big screen. And, amazingly, it happened. And I'm so glad it did.Deadpool, is a superhero movie. You probably guessed that ? you have the man in a mask who you pretty much know is going to go out there and beat the baddies and save the girl, yadder, yadder, yadder... However, what Deadpool also is, is a comedy. That being said ? it's NOT a spoof. It's a tongue-in-cheek little number which has better action scenes than most action films and better comedy than most comedy films.I'm almost tempted to say that it's a film that anyone can enjoy. I can certainly see both men and women having a good time watching it. However, it definitely is a film for MEN and WOMEN. Whereas Marvel's current cinematic universe is kind of geared at kids (and us kids who never grew up) there is plenty in Deadpool that no parent will want to explain to their little darling. Again, don't let that fool you into thinking that it's all toilet humour ? let's just call it 'adult' humour and leave it at that.Basically, Deadpool is great. Ryan Reynolds is mouthy, but never annoying and totally owns the role (as it should be when he plays the titular character). The supporting cast all do their bit, but it's Deadpool himself all the way. Please let this be the start of a franchise. It's probably a little too much to expect to see him crossing studio picket lines and ending up in the Marvel universe where he ? truly ? belongs, but we can always hope. If nothing else, I'm well up for a 'Deadpool 2' outing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny but corny and juvenile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many of today's "action" movies, millions of dollars are spent on CGI explosions, people beating each other up, and highly realistic renditions of bullets and swords ripping apart human flesh and bone. If these are the kinds of movies you like, you might like Deadpool since there is PLENTY of that going on. Many Hollywood movies today also have a highly simplistic moral plot which boils down to getting the audience to sympathize with "good people" hurting "bad people" in horrific ways because the bad people hurt the good people first in equally horrific ways. Essentially it is all about justified violence and hatred, or an eye for an eye if you will. Beneath this simplistic moralism, the writers usually try to throw in a love story to make you feel good about killing all those bad people because there is romance going on. In this sense Deadpool is exactly like every other big budget action movie coming out of Hollywood these days, especially the Marvel comic variety - endless fights, brutal killings, non-stop explosions and car crashes all done in hyper-realistic fashion with the audience rooting to kill the evil-doers.Where Deadpool differs somewhat from this formula is that it seems more like it was written by the cast of Mad magazine, with more clever, if still childish jokes that do make you laugh more than a few times. In fact virtually every line delivered in this movie is either a hyper-sarcastic joke or a clever put down. While often funny, the dialog is too contrived for me and polished to give it any soul or sense of believability, despite the many laughs.You can probably tell that I am not a big fan of these kinds of action movies, and that is true. Many people will probably like this movie but I found it totally formulaic and it seemed like the writers were trying too hard. On top of that, too much CGI and too little soul. Still it was a fun movie to watch even if I kept rolling my eyes throughout most of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment for Deadpool fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit, I'm not a huge Deadpool fan, with only passing knowledge of the character. So my rating is just based on the movie experience overall.**WARNING - MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**The opening sequence sets the tone for the film. It's well executed action and CGI with lots of graphic violence, sex and crude slapstick humour. It doesn't take itself seriously from the get go and neither should you. The comedy is often forced and lines fall flat as there is no comedic timing. The story line is predictable and ho-hum. The acting leaves much on the table. I love Ryan Reynolds (and he refers to this to the audience directly in a self depreciating way), but I just don't find his portrayal of a mentally unbalanced, anti- hero believable. I expected the character to be darker, edgier,just a little bit dangerous and unpredictable, but with a quirky likability. A tall order for someone who is very good in RomComs. Think Jim Carrey in 'The Mask' with a bit of Cranston from 'Breaking Bad'. These short comings are markedly evident when minor characters are able to steal scenes, such as the Cabbie 'Dopinder', the Recruiter and the Blind Al.The film gets a solid 5 for bringing it to fruition despite many odds and obstacles in production; it gets a '+1' for CGI, for a total rating of 6.It's not a flick for chicks or children (I saw many kids in the theater - wildly inappropriate!!). Otherwise it's good entertainment for fans, who are already looking forward to Round 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The X-men universe expands a step wider thanks to the unusual mutated tones of storytelling compared to other Marvel's superheroes that surprisingly turns out very effective and brilliant. Despite a formulaic yet expected superhero plot, the non-linear narrative by slipping the several action sequences together with flashbacks added with the heavy adult-related hilarious jokes throughout the film are wildly entertaining. The film stays faithfully to the characteristics of Deadpool - both humors and violence, which are perfectly portrayed by Ryan Reynolds, who is definitely the right actor to suit the character. The romantic chemistry between Wilson and Vanessa is emotionally engaging and convincing compared to Wolverine, making it a great option for Valentine outing. Changing his suit from green to red, Reynolds certainly has a lot of fun time in this non-family-friendly superhero adventure and the overall outcome has made the classic Deadpool shines among the other superheroes from the same studio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All you could want from a Deadpool movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is going to be short. Because words cannot describe what this movie is. From the opening credits, to the post-credits scene (if you could call it that), this movie was brilliant.Any reader of the Deadpool comic will agree that this is what a Deadpool movie should be. Characters are handled in a Deadpool way, the romantic subplot is handled in a Deadpool way, the action, you name it.Also, the camera-work was good. They held the darn thing still, so you could actually see what was going on. More action movies should do that. Have you ever noticed from my reviews that I hate shaky cam? Well I do.As for this movie. I can't describe what it is, but I love it! It is unlike anyy movie ever made. And it's great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wickedly funny and relentless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is the third of Marvel's recent comedic superhero movies (the previous two being Ant Man and Guardians of the Galaxy) and it's the funniest one yet. they might be on to something here...The humor is crude, vulgar, and sophomoric (think Family Guy or Superbad), but it's mostly hilarious and all of the meta and Fourth Wall jokes are pretty awesome.That's not the only thing this fantastic movie has going for it. the action's good, the banter between Deadpool and other characters is top-notch, and the pacing is silky smooth. The movie's less than 2 hours, doesn't have any dull or slow moments, and it grabs your attention from beginning to the end. They flawlessly incorporated Deadpool's fourth wall antics, and from a storytelling perspective the plot moves along smoothly and flashbacks work well when this character's interacting with and guiding the audience throughout.and finally, we'd be remiss if we didn't talk about Ryan Reynolds. It's tough to overstate how challenging this role is. The whole flick is good, but it's success relies heavily on a protagonist who's in 95+% of the scenes and and spends a large bulk of that time rambling and talking to the audience. And Reynolds kills it. He's so convincing it's hard to see anyone else doing this role.So go see this movie! They put maximum effort into it, and it's very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really nice to see that studios listen to what the people ask for.The test footage that came out a while back showed the potential of a movie like this. Seeing how people reacted and made videos online the studio actually took notice and put it into production. This is the only movie that nails the Deadpool comics. The characters in this movie all work well, they have chemistry. They redeemed themselves from that horrible x-men origins story. All in all great movie, never a dull moment. Go out and watch it if you haven't. Buy it on blu-ray, show support so that a super hero movie having R rating can still do well in sales.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me introduce you to the ingredients of this here action here flick "Deadpool"It has:(you should know these top ten facts, a la David Letterman if he were still on TV) 1. CGI character (the credits promise this) 2. A moody teen 3. Open credits that which promise these and others 4. A fourth wall breaking hero played by Ryan Reynolds 5. Ryan Reynolds was also a producer 6. A very creditable job by the entire cast is in the film 7. Ryan puts in a very telling amusing after credits scene. 8. It has sex and sick things 9. It has songs on the soundtrack (though with all due respect to Juice Newton, whose 1981 remake of "Angel of the Morning" (written by Chip Taylor, who also wrote "Wold Thing" by The Troggs (1966)!0is heard, the earlier though not original 1968 Merilee Rush and the Turnabouts version owns to me) Oh yeah 10. It has an R rating, superhero comic world's worst.All of these mean a very well rounded movie with a fourth wall, wisecracking superhero with an unusual message from getting the girl (relatively unknown MORENA BACCARIN, who raiseth the relationship with RYAN REYNOLDS way about SACCHARIN). We get a lot of surprise abilities of Deadpool sitting on precarious, acrophobia-causing high level places and calm admitting it to us, the audience.All of this, and the announcement by the character of a sequel, makes this a film waiting in a long line, still in its first weekend, for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We need more super hero movies like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna start out by saying I'm not a usual fan of super hero movies, I can watch and enjoy the avengers like most but personally lately I've been getting fed up and sick of the abundance of super hero films on TV and movies released in theaters. A lot of them are extremely similar and lack originality or something to set them selves apart. As far as Deadpool goes I'm glad to say it most certainly sets itself in a league of its own. Not only does it annihilate the 4th wall in many hilarious meta jokes, it keeps the pace consistent and engaging by making non stop quality jokes and intense action. Unlike others I'm not very informed on many things in the X men world or the character of Deadpool but it didn't take away from my enjoyment much. If you are more informed you will probably enjoy it that much more.To give perspective on one of the reasons I liked it so much here ya go, one of my favorite action/comic book movies is Kick-ass, a brutally violent, foul mouthed super hero movie and I loved every second of it. From that same director Kingsman was made, a very good comic book adaptation with awesome action and great humor and even more coincidentally released exactly one year before Deadpool by the same film company. See the trend? If you liked those two movies than this movie is more than likely up your alley or as Deadpool would say "right up Main Street".Wanna watch a movie funnier than most comedies now a days here you go, wanna watch a movie with better action than most movies now a days here you go. There isn't much else I can say without spoilers. Make no mistake this a rated R film, if you don't like violence, language, sex and what not than obviously this film isn't for you, if you want to see an un conventional super hero film that did exactly what it needed to do then this is for you. This film has already received insane amounts of hype, not saying it doesn't deserve it but don't let it get to you too much. The film isn't for everyone but maybe for more people than one would think. There's a lot to love in Deadpool and not much if anything I can complain about. If it seems like your cup of tea don't hesitate and slam it back with everything it has to offer. Thanks for reading and enjoy the flick as much as you can because by the time it ends you'll be wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comic book movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the negative, hateful reactions X-Men Origins: Wolverine got for what it did to the awesome character of Deadpool, who is very loved by the fans. At the time I basically knew nothing about the character, so I decided to look into him. What I found was one of the coolest, funniest and most entertaining characters I had ever seen. After so many years, I am happy to say, we finally got the Deadpool movie we deserved.First of all, Ryan Reynolds is perfect for playing the role of Deadpool and he owns every second he's on screen. The thing I like about it is you can actually tell he loves the character and most importantly he UNDERSTANDS the character he is playing. Watching him in interviews just lets you know how much he enjoyed playing the Merc with a Mouth.This is an R-Rated comic book film and it doesn't hold anything back, literally. It is violent, funny, meta. Basically everything I love in a movie. And I mean it probably doesn't get any more meta than this and that's why Deadpool works perfectly because it knows exactly what it is and what it needs to be and it expresses that.The movie is told in a nonlinear way, which absolutely works to its advantage because the plot is very simple, especially as a comic book film, so the nonlinear way of telling makes it feel original. The thing I knew some people were worried about was if the love story was gonna work or not. The answer to that is yes, because everything that happens between Deadpool and his girl feels real, especially knowing her background and who she is and especially because it actually advances the plot of the movie, building our main character.Sure, like most movies, Deadpool has flaws, but they are minimal, and I mean minimal. It did NOT take me out of the experience for the most part. The only two things that kinda bothered me were that they never really explain exactly what his powers are (and considering he jumps abnormally high and does super inhuman back flips, I think it should have been explained more), although it is implied and it doesn't make any sense at all that the eyes of the costume show emotions and that he himself made a suit that is absolutely perfectly made and tactical, but it's so awesome. And who the hell cares anyway? The movie surely doesn't. have to emphasize I am looking at this through a microscope, because I loved every minute of Deadpool. Moshe of the humor works, but upon a second viewing, it seemed to me that they were trying a little too hard to be funny at times.But Deadpool blew me away with its humor, violence and especially the meta. The scenes I loved the most were when they referenced something real or when it made fun of itself. There are some clichés in the movie, like the evil British bad guy and the comic relief character, but the movie makes fun of those clichés. I had a blast with Deadpool, from the opening credits to the post-credits scene, I had a big smile on my face 96% of the time. It's a movie that understands exactly what it is and it executes the things it has to do perfectly. Deadpool is not only one of the greatest comic book movies ever made, it is one of the funniest movies I have seen in awhile.9.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not one to bring a youngster along with or for anyone that is offended by offensive language. It is funny and quite adventurous and like all Marvel films, Stan Lee has a short cameo. It It is worth watching the credits cuz there are many cartoon like items while they run, and like so many films these days, there is a short scene after all the credits end. They just want to keep you there but it is very cute. Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarat are great in it, (they all are), But I especially liked her. I watched her in so much in Homeland that it's tough to lose when she is in the film. I also really like the quick reference to one of the short little mutants as Ripley in "Alien 3". When you see it you will know what I mean. Work the time and money to see and enjoy and laugh at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>worldwide and for years as well it has taken so long to get a film adaptation made for the big screen. Though the character was featured in the weak X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the appearance of him wasn't considered worth it as his appearance had been altered and wasn't given the proper character treatment to win over the fans. Finally, after years of development hell. Ryan Reynolds reprises Deadpool in the way that sticks true to it's source material and the results are worth the ticket price and time to watch.I won't give away too much on plot details but it does play out as both an origin story and a revenge plot that breaks away from the traditional 'superhero' movie. It charts the beginning of Deadpool as a wise-cracking, foul-mouthed and really abstracted anti-hero, showcasing how he had earned his powers and what made him become this figure. I think the plot itself is great and it doesn't drag itself once in the film and best of all it doesn't take a whole movie to establish the main character's origin unlike a certain film from last year (coughing "Fantastic Four").In terms of acting, there are solid performances throughout but the best of the bunch would definitely be Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. This is possibly his best performance in film to date, though I have watched Reynolds in other great films such as The Change Up, Safe House, The Voices and even Buried but this role in particular is often seen and considered a 'redeeming role' as previously he had played the role of Deadpool before in XMO: Wolverine and of course the cheesy but bad Green Lantern for DC. His delivery on humour is present throughout and when things get slightly serious he does what he does best and lightens the moment. The supporting cast handle themselves as well as Reynolds, with 'Game of Thrones' actor Ed Skein, 'comic refief' T.J. Miller, 'the more tougher female than Ronda Rousey' Gina Carano and the lovely Morena Baccarin giving their best to keep the story's characters great. Only minor negative to say was the film's villain wasn't given enough polish as to show why he was bad (though we are shown why he's a threat to Deadpool and was just as powerful as he was) but we aren't given a true purpose villain that wants to dominate the world but thankfully Skein does give his best throughout in both terms of acting and stunt work.Direction is strong from first time director Tim Miller, he keeps the film moving along in a decent pace that's not rushed and the production value set for the film is quality assured as costume design, visual effects and make up are all worthwhile and it's script is pretty polished throughout with humour, exciting action set-pieces and the best 4th wall breaks/ meta humour I've seen in years (the knocks at both Wolverine, GL and even the trouble to get a Deadpool movie made are hilarious in particular) .Overall, Deadpool is a blast of a movie that packs action, comedy and superhero cliché's into one and even pokes fun of not only itself but breaks the 4th wall in wonderful ways. Only a fault with its villain in terms of character development, Deadpool will leave you leaving the cinema in the most awesome way possible and stick around after the credits for a cool surprise.</fullReview>

Deadpool has vaulted itself to the top of my list of best adapted comic book to move adaptations. Ryan Reynolds could not have delivered Wade Wilson to the screen more than what he did. Everything about Deadpool was awesomely funny with a side of twisted and perverted. Definitely not a movie for children and if you did let your child watch this movie, you should be evaluated for common sense. Deadpool is for adults. So please get off it should be kid friendly. We have enough of those, let the adults have some sick twisted fun.</fullReview>

For me it's easily already the movie of the year. 2-3 years ago, i absolutely didn't know anything about Deadpool. Now, especially because of this movie, he's my favorite superhero without doubt. It's hilarious, violent, dirty, fresh, unique and maybe even offensive for someone. So yes, it's something like a live-action "South Park", where Cartman is the main character... :D It reminded me as well parody movies from 80's and 90's. You had to be always alert, have a eye on everything on the screen, because you never knew where the next spoof will "hide himself".Also, you definitely can't ignore the soundtrack. Which had many nostalgic-retro songs for me. This was like cherry on top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew a lot about Deadpool before going to the movie, my dad and sister are avid comic book readers and Deadpool is a family favorite comic to read.Going into the movie you are automatically brought in by the gore and humor. At first, it was a little too gory but then it became so exaggerated that it seemed more humorous then gory. Stan Lee's cameo in the strip club made it all the better. Ryan Reynolds was the perfect person to play this odd Marvel character, he was funny, smart, and quick witted.I definitely left the theater happy, and wait till after the credits for a special message from Deadpool. In the car home, my sister ranked it as the best superhero movie. My dad put it in his top 3 while I agree with my sister.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most unique &amp; best superhero movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool tells the story of ex-Special Forces operative turned mercenary, Wade Wilson(Ryan Reynolds). After Wade is diagnosed with a terminal illness, he volunteers to be a part of a rogue experiment. This experiment imbues Wade with accelerated healing abilities. However, this experiment has a few deadly side effects. Now, Wade goes after the people who wronged him under the moniker, Deadpool. Armed with an array of weapons &amp; a twisted sense of humor, Deadpool goes about unleashing his unique brand of justice. Deadpool is a mind blowing film! The Merc With A Mouth, as Deadpool is fondly called, does everything in his power, to make sure that this movie is a truly interactive experience. Deadpool's antics puts the audience, right in the middle of the action on screen. This film truly shatters the fourth wall(for those of you who don't know, the fourth wall is the barrier between the viewers &amp; the movie). Our superhero in the skin tight red &amp; black suit, is well aware that he has an audience. Deadpool constantly looks right into the camera &amp; begins with his hysterical narration &amp; pop-culture references or, rants about his past. Deadpool's wisecracks &amp; one-liners are some of the wittiest dialogs ever uttered by a superhero. This movie will have you laughing till your sides hurt. Deadpool is the funniest superhero to have ever graced the big screen(yes, he's even more hilarious than Iron Man &amp; Spider-Man). His constant use of the f- word &amp; the s-word makes him funnier &amp; lets the audience know that, this guy is not just your average, generic superhero. Kids, this film is not for you! The action sequences are pulse pounding &amp; gory, just like how the action in a Deadpool movie should be. The visual effects are brilliant &amp; are only utilized, when absolutely necessary. The opening credits are one of the highlights of the movie. It is so freaking different! The performances are another highlight of the film. Ryan Reynolds is outstanding as Wade/Deadpool. Reynolds gives the performance of a lifetime &amp; he clearly is a huge fan of the source material. Morena Baccarin is amazing as Vanessa. The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds &amp; Morena Baccarin is electrifying. Ed Skrein is great as Ajax. T.J. Miller is spectacular as Weasel. Gina Carano is brilliant as Angel Dust. Stefan Kapicic is impressive as the voice of Colossus. Brianna Hildebrand is awesome as Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Leslie Uggams is good as Blind Al. Last but not the least, Karan Soni is hysterical as Dopinder. Director Tim Miller &amp; the rest of the crew &amp; cast, have definitely done right by Deadpool after his outrageous portrayal in X-Men Origins: Wolverine(2009). Deadpool is a must watch for fans of superhero movies &amp; everyone thinking that superhero films should head in a different direction, once in a while. I have not had this much fun at the movies, for the longest time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hood Review: DeadPoolQuick Hits:- It is rated R for a good reason. - Comedy, Sex, Violence, Bad language, and Wham!! The laughs roll in right from the opening credits, which themselves are HEE-LARIOUS. Ryan Reynolds did his thug thang in this one, great performance and perfect casting. I really didn't expect to like Deadpool as much as I did. The trailers and media blitz was starting to irritate the hell out of ya boy. But this movie was downright enjoyable on all levels. There were times I grimaced at a Deadpool finishing move, times I literally LOL'd, times I could not turn away from the action, and times I was like "WTF"? The overall story was a little lacking as it was pretty obvious that Deadpool's, and Francis's (the bad guy) backstory took a backseat to the slapstick humor and assholistic nature of Deadpool. But, you know what? Not only was that aaight with me, it actually was refreshing. The producers gave us a lil bit then just hit the gas on the action and humor. Which came in very abundant flurries. The movie moves very fast and straightforward all the time, no pause and or detours. Also featured the BEST Stan Lee cameo to date. The computer graphics were definitely on point, though Colossus looked waaaay different than in the other Marvel/Fox joints.Something I noticed and not sure if this was done on purpose but Deadpool had that Sharknado, B-movie feel to it. The violence and comedy mixed together were so over the top. That normally would have me like "What"?, "Man GTFOH". But some how it just works in this movie. This is a definite must see. Deadpool is a genius mix of elements that normally do not go together. Like the soundtrack for example. Wham!! and DMX!? Nuff said.I give Deadpool 5 EBTs.</fullReview>

The biggest hero of the film is its screenplay. The director exactly knew the pulse of the audience and did justice to it.Ryan Reynolds is of course the show stealer and Morena Baccarin looks gorgeous especially in the last 1 hour.

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of superheroes and I didn't enjoy other Marvel movies very much, but Deadpool is another story. This movie has a bit of everything: comedy (more like sexual related comedy, but hey, I think that's what you're here for), action, a VERY good story and last but not least: love (yes, Deadpool is also about love, I know). The movie felt kind of short though and that's just because I simply wanted more. This is not the kind of movie that lets you hanging for nothing, like other movies (imagine a plot like: the good guy is about to shoot the bad guy; the good guy: "So we've come to an end. One of us must die...blah blah". Then he eventually shoots the guy or he escapes. In most of the cases. Well this does not happen in Deadpool), it's just constant action, story telling and comedy, all of them combined. Oh,and I've also seen boobs. 10/10 (equivalent to 5/7)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is definitely a comedy worth seeing. I saw a packed screening and the people in the theater laughed almost non-stop, and my dad admitted that it was a film worth watching again. The action and special effects are loads of fun, but beware that there's a lot of blood and gore invested. Same goes for the humor-the gags are often juvenile and crass(such as sexual activity on a holiday or hinting at "touching" oneself's), so this is FAR from a family film. Deadpool is a great time at the movies, but just expect more adult material from the typical average Marvel film. If there's one thing the movie does often, it frequently breaks the 4th wall, and it's one of the really great things about Deadpool. This movie has everything you could ever ask from a Deadpool movie, and this is a strong recommendation for Marvel fans and adults everywhere. Also, stay after the credits AND during the credits-it will make you laugh your head off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HI GUYS! I Don't want to spoil a thing, so im going to talk about some aspects of the movie and rate them.THE Cinematography: Beautiful! This movie had a budget consisting of 56 million dollars. In comparison to for example that horribleness called "wolverine origins" had 150million... and the same runtime. OR EVEN funnier.. ride along 2 had a budget of 40 million. Deadpool looked a lot better.. had good cgi(especially considering the budget), had some cool slomo shots(the opening credits was a complete freeze shot and incredibly well done).. This movie looked great. 9.5/10THE ACTION: Yes sir. THIS R-rated action was amazing. Guys got shot, knived and slammed onto billboards and every bit of blood that left their body was seen on screen. The action was also smart! in one scene *kind of spoiler if you have not seen the trailers* the guy severes somebody's head and kicks it against another guys head! No "we needed a stuntman to do everything so we're gonna use a lot jumpcuts" bullshit. Wide-shots of beautifully made action. 10/10THE ROMANCE/DRAMA: You're not gonna believe this, but it wasn't cheesy.. The love between him and rachel was amazing.. They were both crazy in their own ways and that's what made them have a connection.. *again kind of spoiler if you don't know anything about deadpool* When he finds out he has cancer... You can see him in pain.. not because he's going to die, but because he will lose HER. 10/10THE HUMOR: Guys.. I have not had so many genuine laughs as i had in this movie. Im a kevin hart fan and went to see ride along 2 first.. I laughed chuckled once and laughed, because my friend was laughing more so than the thing itself. Deadpool had me laughing from the first MINUTE till the last minute. The opening credits, im telling you, were the funniest opening credits since the beginning of film. 2010's Sexiest man alive is also 2016's funniest man alive. I loved the humor, which was improvised and also sometimes written by ryan renolds. It was witty and not just toilet, poop-joke, humor. The references to his old *shitty* work he has done, but also the fourth wall breaking and... DOPINDER&lt;--FUNNY FUNNY DUDE, It was all hilarious. 20 out of 10. Don't know how to rate it differentlyAll in all, it was funny, it gave deadpool the movie it deserved and more, it was gripping, sad, scary in different ways(the torture the character had to go through, but also i was scared i would laugh so hard that i would cough up my pancreas. 10 out of 10 for this movie. I saw a lot of people complaining it wasn't as good as mad max yet it was a lot higher in the top 250 IMDb.well: 1. Their aren't as many votes yet 2. My girlfriend hated mad max because it was so focused on the action, it forget to be anything else. DEADPOOL was perfect in every way11/10, but since my rating is restricted by the great limitations of mathematics and stuff.. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True it isn't "Batman" or even "Superman" still this new hero that I just discovered and watched named "Deadpool" or AKA Wade Wilson is still an entertaining and fun character to cheer for and like! Actually based on a Marvel comics character the film rolls the dice and brings fun as seeing how one can be redeemed and fight evil while having feel good fun and joy. The backdrop is really simple a former special forces guy named Wade Wilson(Ryan Reynolds) is the victim of a bad experiment and in the meantime he's transformed into "Deadpool" and to go along with it he has obtained special powers and a very funny sense of humor while his alter ego has healing powers. Plus to spice things up on the side "Deadpool" has a very sexy and raw aggressive girlfriend named Vanessa(the attractive Morena Baccarin)who's a sexy lingerie wearing lady who's good in bed to bad she has to become a damsel in distress by being held by bad guys and even having her mouth taped, never fear "Deadpool" is to the rescue! Overall not the greatest film of a hero still it's fun, odd and different all bringing for a good watching experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually went to see the opening premiere at midnight this morning and it was awesome. The movie is first of all a treat for the fans but I think it will also appeal to the people that are getting tired of the superhero genre or dislike it. Ryan Reynolds shines as Deadpool and has really redeemed himself from his other superhero outing on screen. From the opening credits to the very end, the movie fires off jokes and oneliners at the rate of a machine gun. It is a very good homage to the comic book series and the breaking of the fourth wall only disrupted the flow of the movie once for me, then again it was in a way that was also done in the comics, so I cannot actually fault it. If you're worried about sex scenes or the violence, well, it is in there, but honestly most of the stuff you see in the trailer is in the first 20 minutes of the movie, after that it's a lot less. Kudos to Ryan Reynolds and Tim Miller for bringing this adaptation to the big screen, because I loved it (and I'm not even a fanboy for the the comics either).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an amazingly brilliant load of fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>11 February 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed this part. The witty one liners and pop culture references had everyone chuckling throughout. The plot, to put it bluntly was average, but you almost didn't notice as it was completely overshadowed by the superbly shot action scenes complete with blood, gore and lots of humour. Reynolds plays Wade Wilson, an ex special forces soldier who has turned to mercenary work to make a living. When up he is finally settled in a flourishing relationship and life seems perfect. He is diagnosed with a terminal illness. As a last resort he turns to a shady underground organisation that offers him a life changing way out. What follows is a tale of desperation and revenge as he tries to reverse the effects of the operation. The whole film was a complete load of fluff, but with lots of humour, action and a killer soundtrack....... and I absolutely loved it....my favourite Marvel film to date!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely off the chain - one of my favourite superhero movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is completely mad. Thanks to the brilliantly funny, no- holds-barred brand of comedy that is absolutely everywhere from start to finish, Deadpool is a consistently hilarious comedy, made even better by a very well-written plot, excellent performances, and amazingly-directed action.Deadpool is a movie made first and foremost for the fans. In comic book lore, he's the ultimate foul-mouthed, wise-cracking rogue superhero, and the movie takes that character and places him on screen in exactly the same form. Therefore, rather than the more family-friendly, action-oriented superhero movies that dominate the box office nowadays, prepare for something completely different.Although the story and action are great, and I'll talk about that in a second, it's the humour that's the real stand-out of this movie. There's so much bad language, and so much adult humour, but in this movie, it works like magic.I didn't think Deadpool was the funniest movie ever, but I was laughing on a consistent basis right the way through this movie. The shock value of the swearing, extreme violence, self-referential humour and countless fourth wall breaks didn't wear off at all, which is testament to just how brilliant a script this film has. Even if you're not into the world of superheroes, Deadpool can still be a fantastically enjoyable movie just because it's so funny.That leads me into talking about Ryan Reynolds, who was amazing in the lead role. He pulls off the chatterbox superhero so well, delivering on the comedic front time and time again, whilst also managing to make a character that really won't shut up hugely likable, which again meant that you could keep enjoying the mad comedy right up to the end of the film, because everything that came out of Deadpool's mouth was just hilarious.But don't think that this is just a comedy, because it does shine on the story and action front too. Whilst tying into the X-Men Universe, Deadpool is a very unique superhero movie. It's not all about saving the world, it's just a story of a guy who wants to get revenge on a man who completely ruined his life. And because of that, you can actually relate to this guy more so than any other big blockbuster superhero because his determination is so simple and real.As well as being a revenge story, Deadpool is also a bit of a love story. It's the revenge that drives the film, but the relationship between Wade Wilson and his old girlfriend is a genuinely believable one (helped by the fact that Reynolds and Morena Baccarin work so well together), and is yet another brilliantly-written plot point that allows you to get more invested in what is a hugely entertaining film.Finally, let's talk about Tim Miller's directing. Despite being his feature debut, Miller has done an absolutely stunning job with Deadpool. Whilst the comedy is the driving force, one of my main takeaways from the film was how brilliant the action was. There could definitely have been less CGI, but when we see Deadpool either in gunfights or hand-to-hand combat, it's thrilling to watch, getting better and better until the excellent final act, which I absolutely loved, making this one of my favourite superhero movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Right!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Deadpool made child's play out of every Tony Stark exploit there ever was. The lascivious transformation of Wade Wilson into Deadpool was intertwined with flashback scenes from Wade's past. Romances, encounters with civilian low-life, and rouge organized crime organizations were all prey for Deadpool's non-chalant wrath. Knives, swords, and a repertoire of martial arts moves would present the ingredients of a quintessential hero ordinarily. Deadpool's na?ve style was a mixture of aggression, romantic confidence, slapstick, and koi quick-wittedness. Not only his fists and flying kicks but also his jeering patois fended off enemies who had disturbed the hero and his girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay but could have been so much more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been looking forward to this movie for a long time, and I really want to love it but I just can't. They could have done so much more with the movie that I can't help but feel disappointed. The origin story takes up too much time while adding almost nothing. The movie failed to make me care about Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and the only good the love story really added was a joke about pegging. The origin story also failed to make me think Ajax was a bad ass mercenary on par with Deadpool, he just never feels like much of a threat. It also fails to show us that Wade Wilson was an extremely skilled mercenary before he became Deadpool (which is what allows him to become Deadpool). They could have just skipped the origin story and done another story arc or explained his origin in another way that would still make us want him to kick Ajax's ass. The jokes are hit-and-miss and in my opinion they failed to show Deadpool's wittiness and truly give us the merc with a mouth. They also failed to show what a deeply disturbed individual Deadpool actually is, and he doesn't have the same depth as he does in the comics. I guess the love story was there to show that he's more than just a wacky character but it, in my opinion, just doesn't work.The upside to this movie is that when it gets things right, it truly does get things right. There are plenty of funny moments and some great action scenes and I guess it's worth watching, but as a fan of Deadpool I'm left unsatisfied. At least Cable will be in the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, Marvel's anti-conventional hero Deadpool has been a huge following for comic book fans worldwide and for years as well it has taken so long to get a film adaptation made for the big screen. Though the character was featured in the weak X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the appearance of him wasn't considered worth it as his appearance had been altered and wasn't given the proper character treatment to win over the fans. Finally, after years of development hell. Ryan Reynolds reprises Deadpool in the way that sticks true to its source material and the results are worth the ticket price and time to watch.I won't give away too much on plot details but it does play out as both an origin story and a revenge plot that breaks away from the traditional 'superhero' movie. It charts the beginning of Deadpool as a wise-cracking, foul-mouthed and really abstracted anti-hero, showcasing how he had earned his powers and what made him become this figure. I think the plot itself is great and it doesn't drag itself once in the film and best of all it doesn't take a whole movie to establish the main character's origin unlike a certain film from last year (coughing "Fantastic Four").In terms of acting, there are solid performances throughout but the best of the bunch would definitely be Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. This is possibly his best performance in film to date, though I have watched Reynolds in other great films such as The Change Up, Safe House, The Voices and even Buried but this role in particular is often seen and considered a 'redeeming role' as previously he had played the role of Deadpool before in XMO: Wolverine and of course the cheesy but bad Green Lantern for DC. His delivery on humour is present throughout and when things get slightly serious he does what he does best and lightens the moment. The supporting cast handle themselves as well as Reynolds, with 'Game of Thrones' actor Ed Skein, 'comic relief' T.J. Miller, 'the more tougher female than Ronda Rousey' Gina Carano and the lovely Morena Baccarin giving their best to keep the story's characters great. Only minor negative to say was the film's villain wasn't given enough polish as to show why he was bad (though we are shown why he's a threat to Deadpool and was just as powerful as he was) but we aren't given a true purpose villain that wants to dominate the world but thankfully Skein does give his best throughout in both terms of acting and stunt work.Direction is strong from first time director Tim Miller, he keeps the film moving along in a decent pace that's not rushed and the production value set for the film is quality assured as costume design, visual effects and make up are all worthwhile and it's script is pretty polished throughout with humour, exciting action set-pieces and the best 4th wall breaks/ meta humour I've seen in years (the knocks at both Wolverine, GL and even the trouble to get a Deadpool movie made are hilarious in particular) .Overall, Deadpool is a blast of a movie that packs action, comedy and superhero cliché's into one and even pokes fun of not only itself but breaks the 4th wall in wonderful ways. Only a fault with its villain in terms of character development, Deadpool will leave you leaving the cinema in the most awesome way possible and stick around after the credits for a cool surprise.</fullReview>

Just from the opening scene I was hooked to this movie, great action scenes and great comedy, And on top of that great violence. This movie really did deserve a R-rating. If you are a fan of comics or just a person who is looking for a kick-ass movie going experience then this is for you. There is so much stuff to love. I mean hey its DeadPool what is not to love. So parents keep your kids away from this one and have you a night out. Most to some it up, yes this movie is good. But it will not be for everyone, if you are easily offended then go see Norm of the north or something. But if you want to have a great time well look no further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Deadpool Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For 10 long years, fans have been anticipating the possibility of seeing one of the fan- favorite Deadpool on the big screen. There were even times when it seemed like there wouldn't ever bee a Deadpool movie (X-Men Origins Wolverine). However, our prayers have finally been answered, with the arrival of this near perfect Deadpool movie. Let's start with Deadpool himself. In Origins, the couple of scenes that actually featured Ryan Reynolds playing the wise-cracking Deadpool, not the taped mouthed crap, showed that there was definitely potential for the character. Now we finally get to see him in all of his glory, and Ryan Reynolds does an absolute fantastic job of making that happen. Everything about Deadpool from his voice to his reactions, and especially his jokes makes it feel like him and Reynolds are one in the same. This is honestly the best casting of a superhero since Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man. Deadpool also receives a great supporting cast, with Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead being particular standouts. The scenes with these two are honestly some of the funniest, and also poke fun at the X-Men franchise in the best way possible. I don't care what others might say, but Ajax was a great villain. Early on, he proved to be much more lethal than expected, and honestly felt like a threat to Deadpool. The addition of Angel Dust was also a huge plus, as her fight with Colossus was very well done. Finally the best aspect of the movie, the comedy. There might have only been 10 minutes during the whole movie where I was not laughing. Pretty much every joke is spot on with perfect timing, and better yet, the jokes never felt overabundant . The 4th wall breaks were also very effective and well done. I mean by now you must get the point, Deadpool is a hilarious movie. For its budget, production value, and overall objective, Deadpool is literally the perfect movie. It may not have all the flashyness of the other big-budget superhero movies, but it sure matches up to them. It feels even better for the fans, especially considering FOX's last attempt at a superhero movie. Deadpool truly feels like a movie made by and for the fans, and we, the fans, thank you!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reynolds Wraps It Up Nicely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Ryan Reynolds makes us care about this violent superhero and that's the better half of the fun.GRADE: B-PLOT SUMMARY: After a scientific experiment renders him disfigured but endowed with superhuman strength and powers, Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool, an anti-hero who wants revenge. JIM'S REVIEW: The Marvel Superhero Factory unleashes another action figure from its assembly line of comic book personalities, a hip but crazed vigilante who goes by the name Deadpool. Coming from the second tier of players, instead of its popular A-Team of Avengers, this brand of superhero has some interesting traits unlike his predecessors. Besides loving to kick ass and destroy his foes, this character lobs double entendres and curses to anyone in his vicinity, beats everyone to the bloodiest of pulp (hence, the film's adult rating), and breaks down any walls in his way, especially the fourth one with his pithy and snide asides to our movie-going audience.&#xfffc;The plot is a typical revenge / action movie. Wade Wilson (a wonderfully charming Ryan Reynolds, who uses his sex appeal most appealingly) takes the form of our favorite mercenary, Deadpool, ready to do battle with his maker, Francis Freeman a.k.a. Ajax (a menacing Ed Skrein), a sadistic scientist and his lovely Igor named Angel Dust (Gina Carano). Of course, Deadpool has help from a supporting group of friends that include his girlfriend, Vanessa (a winning Morcena Baccarin), loyal sidekick, Weasel (a wise-cracking T.J. Miller), and some other X-Men crusaders, Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The action is non-stop and so are the jokes, which land most of the time. Deadpool's foul mouth works overtime to entertain his adult followers between the blood spatter and it all surprisingly works, excluding the over indulgence of too much slow-mo and CGI effects, frenetic editing, and shaky hand-held camera-work. &#xfffc;But the filmmakers never take the character or his plight so seriously as in other films of this ilk and are more obsessed with the dark humor aspects in their story. Credit goes to the screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick with their zingy one-liners and director Tim Miller, who gives the film the needed jolt of energy which allows this hero some distinctive qualities that other superheroes in the Marvel universe lack, primarily a underlying sadness that define the human character inside the superhuman. But it is Mr. Reynolds who contributes the most to the film's success. The role fits him like a suit. His anti-charm is the real thing and the actor uses his physical presence to the nth degree, frontal nude scene notwithstanding. Deadpool is far from dead. This avenger has legs (and muscle) with just the right amount of appeal. The movie will make a killing at the box office with a sequel on its way as we speak. So, fans of this comic book genre (and many new devotees) can enjoy the start of a beautiful friendship with a new adult action hero and all of his profanity and insights.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfect casting choice for Deadpool and a perfect comic book adaptation. Ryan Reynolds was incredible as Deadpool and this is his role. We rarely see this but it happens. Deadpool belongs to Ryan Reynolds! We've seen this a few times where an actor becomes a role with Robert Downey Jnr, Hugh Jackman, and now, Ryan Reynolds. This film was everything I expected and more. Childish but hilarious jokes. Breaking the fourth wall also worked incredibly for this film. The action sequences were fun and enjoyable. The only thing I felt this lacked was a stronger villain which is why I have hesitated to give it a 10. Other than that, this is a brilliant film and I definitely recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Superhero Movie That Will Shake Thing Things Up, As A Fan I Couldn't Have Asked For More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been following this movie intently since the test footage. I loved the video game and I've read a decent percentage of the comics. I knew ahead of time that this movie would be for me. So I can't give a completely unbiased opinion. I can say though, as a fan of the character, this movie was everything I wanted it to be. It was just short of perfect but it is by far one of the most faithful adaptations of a comic book I have ever seen.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Our hero Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is picked up in a cab by Dopinder (Karan Soni). It's Christmas Day for Deadpool and he's more than a little excited to dole out the presents (death and destruction). After fiddling around in the back seat, he climbs through the glass barrier and sits up front. He tells Dopinder that he's going to deal with someone on his naughty list. He sees the picture of a beautiful girl on the dash and Dopinder tells him about her, saying he cannot steal her away from another suitor. Deadpool gives him some advice and requests to be let out on a bridge. Instead of paying, Deadpool gives Dopinder a high five and sits on the bridge guard rail. It is here where we launch into the famous test footage of Deadpool describing the plot, launching into a monologue about him having his own movie and the events leading up to this.I'm going to keep the plot description short and I'll start with the plot. One of the criticisms of this movie is that it still sticks with the same old super hero plot. I will admit that in the big picture sense, the plot isn't as revolutionary as the rest of the movie. It's still about a guy getting revenge on his adversary while he chases the love that he lost. But that criticism isn't accurate. A lot of this movie is flashing back and forth between the present and the past and it's not done in a way that's been seen before. It keeps the movie from getting stale at any point (not that it does) and it keeps Deadpool moving along at a quick pace. It never really slows down and that's a compliment considering Wade's origin as a character is pretty dark at points. Another aspect that makes this movie special is that there's actually a decent romantic angle in a comic book movie. I'll talk more about the characters later but the movie spends enough time with Wade and Vanessa that you actually care about them staying together. I was pretty wrapped up in it and it's a credit to the creative team and the actors for making that possible. This story that this movie has to tell is far from boring or being a retread even if it doesn't completely break the mold.When it comes to the acting, I'm going to have to echo what a lot of people have already said. This is the role Ryan Reynolds was meant to play. He's definitely had a scatter-shot career with comic book movies but if you check out his more indie geared movies, he shows that he's a great actor. He has the dramatic chops (Buried and Chaos Theory) and he's always had the comedic touch (Waiting.. and Just Friends), he's never really got his due. Deadpool is perfect for him and he deserves all the credit he's been getting for his success. I really liked Morena Baccarin as Vanessa. She worked really well with Ryan, she was very funny in her own right and she made you care what happened to her character. Even though the villains weren't the most in-depth characters, I thought Ed Skrein did a pretty good job. He was a lot better in this than he was in The Transporter Refueled. I really liked Stefan Kapicic vocal performance as Colossus and Briana Hildebrand gave a good debut performance as Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Of the main cast, I felt bad for Gina Carano as Angel Dust. Her screen presence is pretty intimidating and her fight with Colossus was pretty intense too. But she's in another role where she gets almost no dialogue, I get she's not classically trained as an actress but she's got a unique skill set (she's good looking too) and I would like to see her get a chance to expand her range. I though Jed Rees and Karan Soni did good jobs in small parts too.You can't talk about Deadpool the movie without going into it's harder aspects. The movie features some well filmed, dirty action scenes that were pretty impressive for Tim Miller as a first time director. You also get some pretty filthy jokes which were hilarious. It doesn't go to any extremes but it wasn't child friendly material. It could be considered too crude for some people but it's truly faithful to Deadpool's roots. You can't fault an adaptation for sticking to the source material and I was killing myself laughing. It's one of the funniest comedies I have seen in years bar none. They also show Deadpool the character for what he is, an @$$&amp;^%!. This is bold because we're used to boy scouts waging war against evil. They made the correct one staying faithful to the comics, Deadpool even says in the movie "I'm the bad guy you get to hunt the worse guys." Deadpool is a riot and a quality action movie wrapped in one. I loved it from start to finish. It wasn't perfect, the jokes don't land 100% (more like 80-90) and I wouldn't be able to recommend it to everyone. I would describe it as this year's Kingsman: The Secret Service. It has good action scenes, interesting characters, truly funny jokes and an involving plot. I left extremely happy as a Deadpool fan and I'll start counting the days till the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is Marvel's take on Kill Bill. There's graphic violence, close shots of deadly injuries and a quest for revenge. It's the tone that sets Deadpool apart from your average action movie. The guy's nuts and we love him for it.Right from the opening credits (you will regret skipping them) it's clear Deadpool's not just another superhero movie. It could be argued it's not a superhero movie at all. Deadpool isn't the first anti-hero Marvel's ever produced, but he's certainly the first they've put no filter on. The shooting, stabbing, slashing and ass-kicking is balanced by his absolute determination not to give a f*** and ability to come up with a new sexual innuendo in every scene, making the movie super entertaining. Maybe don't watch it with your in-laws, though.</fullReview>

Ryan Reynolds couldn't have been a better a choice for Deadpool. Well, maybe if you dunked Jim Carrey into the fountain of youth, he would've probably been able to blow everyone else away. Speaking of, that's what this whole thing kind of reminded me of. Deadpool is the Ace Ventura of superheroes. He wins any battle by being a total clown. Not only is Deadpool a joker, but this whole movie throws a pie at the Superhero renaissance of this decade. Every cliché and plot device gets their ass handed to them. I would say it breaks the fourth wall, but that would mean that there is a wall here to begin with, and there is none.

Someone remembered that Marvel movies were supposed to be FUN, not whatever political drama Captain America's going on about these days. The humor starts from the opening credits (do not miss the opening credits) and then Deadpool makes fun of Xmen, superheroes in general, movies, himself, Marvel, and all the other silly things that usually happen in action movies. I was worried it would get to be too self-referential, but the pace was perfect and most every thing worked perfectly.If you want more, interesting, fun movies made, go see it.

		<shortDescription>A barrage of hilarity, profanity and gore kept in check by a strong script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superhero movie has never been funnier than "Deadpool." Or more outlandish ? or obscene. That should come as quite a relief to fans of Marvel Comics' foul-mouthed anti-hero and especially Ryan Reynolds, who labored a long time to get Deadpool's his own solo adventure on the big screen, a process that entailed ? according to Deadpool, at least ? fondling 20th Century Fox's prized asset whose name "rhymes with Pullverine."Reynolds and Deadpool are truly the perfect actor-character marriage they've long purported to be. The showy, insult-driven and vulgar humor of the part recalls the "Van Wilder" days that launched Reynolds to stardom, and even though audiences are familiar with his shtick, there's a whole other degree of wit applied to make "Deadpool" funny in an original way. But "Deadpool" would be nothing but a crass cult film if it weren't for strong bones from Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick's script holding it together and giving the humor (and the entire movie, frankly) purpose. The "Zombieland" duo builds a clever and engaging story structure that serves as both effective origin story and a big showcase for Reynolds and the film's panache-heavy approach.First-time director Tim Miller succeeds with the flair, which is saying something given how clear it is that the visual effects budget for this one isn't as high as it is for your typical superhero film, but the film is a little bumpy and chaotic at times, visually at least. Action, however, is not the film's primary export, so much as cartoonish gore and comedy-driven sequences.Yet the wit is where "Deadpool" really exceeds expectation. Fourth wall-breaking humor (and jokes about breaking the fourth wall) is a hallmark of the Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza comic and the script really uses this technique appropriately, along with a litany of self-aware meta-humor that will elicit chuckles from superhero movies fans, from references to Hugh Jackman to jabs at Reynolds' previous superhero failures. These jokes help keep the barrage of foul- mouthed humor from feeling too grating, though with any comedy that goes for the quantity approach, it has noticeable misfires.You should know if you're into movies like "Deadpool" before you even set foot in a theater, and if you are, your expectations will likely be met. If you're not as into the genre, you still might be surprised. Either way you're likely to laugh harder than you ever have watching heroes in spandex, and that includes "Kick-Ass." "Deadpool" doesn't succeed in all phases, but you'll be surprised at the level of investment you feel in the story and the outcome thanks to the Reese and Wernick. That's not an easy feat for a film that also knows it can't take itself too seriously either. "Deadpool" finds that balance just long enough to hold the viewer through its more than reasonable runtime and deliver an enjoyable rump (sic) at the movies.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>So impressed by how amazing Deadpool is and how dead on they got him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the first really good movie of 2016, and the perfect film to knock Star Wars out of the IMAX theaters. An Action Comedy like no other, though it's not the first superhero movie to be given an R Rating (Blade) it does take the concept to a new level. This is not a soft R rating, it's a hard R Rating filled with everything I love: vulgar humor, gory action and unnecessary (but always enjoined) nudity. Disney will never give you a flick like this in their version of the Marvel cinematic Universe, it's a XXX-Men event going on here.Ryan Reynolds reprises his extended cameo from X-Men Origins: Wolverine as Wade Wilson, an talkative mercenary diagnosed with terminal cancer, who becomes a lab rat to get a cure, that instead triggers his dormant mutant abilities to repair any part of his body that gets damaged, but left his body looking like crap.The movie starts with a bang, opening up with awesome crazy credits that make fun of superhero movie stereotypes (the movie stars a Hollywood Asshat, a hot chick, a British villain and a CGI character and directed by a guy getting paid too much). Then goes into one of the most fast pace action sequences I've seen in a while, and the whole time, Deadpool is shelling out some of the most hilarious one- liners.The momentum never stops, even when they do the flashbacks that tell Wade Wilson's origin story and the love story between him and Vanessa, the girl he has to save from the British villain (and never uses her mutant abilities from the comic). Deadpool is so funny, that I have to go back and see it again cause The audience was laughing so hard I missed a joke or two. It's so action packed with mindless bloody violence too. You don't get to see stuff like this anymore.I knew I would like this movie, but I impressed with how much I loved it. It's everything you ever wanted from a Deadpool starring superhero movie. They pulled nothing back.X gonna give it ya!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Demands your money and rewards your obedience with a nearly two hour cacophony of violence, language, and debauchery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if you downright despise Tim Miller's "Deadpool," Marvel's R-rated, vulgar and violent superhero film, you almost have to admire the lengths to which this film was marketed. "Deadpool"'s colorful and eclectic marketing campaigns, which featured interactive theater standees, a multitude of different posters and banners with tongue-in-cheek lines, bold and self- referential Television spots, professional interviews with the cast in character, and a release over Valentine's Day weekend to further its lack of boundaries, is among one of the best of the new decade in terms of getting people excited about what was predicted by many to be a tough film to market.The fact of the matter is something like "Deadpool" is what the Marvel brand needs. Even amongst superhero fans, the recent influx and market-saturation of heroes getting their first origins story on film or sequels furthering another hero's saga, the genre is breeding familiarity and contempt at the same time (I've spoken about this on a personal level many times). Superhero films often bear a PG-13 rating for strong violence, sporadic language, and sexual innuendos. Meanwhile, here's a film of the genre that earns its R-rating like most Judd Apatow comedies do; comparatively, with all the four-letter words tossed around like sentence articles, it would the events on Saturday night at a city bar look worthy of a PG-13 rating. Finally, its bloody, often wince-inducing violence reminds us that, even in the modern day, superhero films aren't nearly as rough and ugly as they could be. The film is less Marvel's red-headed step- child amongst superheroes than it is an unearthly, oversized meteor that has just crashlanded in a multiplex near you, demanding your money and attention for nearly two hours in return for some of the most cacophonous violence, language, and debauchery you're likely to see from a mainstream film all year.The film revolves around Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a mercenary who now spends his days in New York City protecting teenage girls from stalkers and ex-boyfriends by working for a company that specializes in taunting and assaulting them. Wade winds up becoming romantically entangled with a prostitute named Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin) with plans to marry her until he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. As a response, he leaves Vanessa and undergoes an underground procedure to kill his cancer, only to be injected with a serum that leaves him horribly disfigured. Upon escaping from Francis Freeman's (Ed Skrein), the man who has surgically altered him and his body, Wade learns that he now has the ability to rapidly heal, as well as maneuver and contort his body in inhuman ways.In effort to mask his horrid appearance, Wade "squeezes his ass" into red and black spandex, attaches two machetes to his back, protects himself with an endless supply of guns and ammo, and becomes the violent and unpredictable Deadpool. He plans on taking out Francis for ruining his physical appearance, rescue his girlfriend from her captivity by Francis, and continue to assure both Colossus (Stefan Kapi&#x10d;i&#x107;) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead's (Brianna Hildebrand), two individuals that are part of X-Men, that he doesn't need to join X-Men in order to become a more competent, proved superhero."Deadpool"'s approach to humor is much like that of "Dirty Grandpa"'s, a film I saw about two weeks ago that has already faded from the minds of most consumers; it's a film that throws numerous lines, jokes, and concepts at a wall in order to see what sticks. Throughout the course of this film, Reynolds' Deadpool probably has a good one-hundred and fifty lines rooted in jokes, and while less than half produce a laugh, they help articulate that this is a character none of us have really seen before. Deadpool's unapologetic lack of political incorrectness is what makes him such a monumental, albeit exhausting, presence. His unwillingness to cater to the tendencies of the mainstream or the ordinary are precisely why we watch superhero films in the first place; it's only recently that we, along with the core themes of the films, have lost sight of this in favor of quantity over quality.The consistent pestering of Deadpool by Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead works to illustrate a nice metaphor of how Deadpool's inception on-screen came to be. Some studio executives probably wanted to neuter or clean up his attitude and story to make him a more marketable character rather than an outspoken anti- hero; perhaps make him a dark, but not too dark, X-Men character that at least had some semblance of discipline. Through Reynolds', Miller's, and screenwriters Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese's respect and loyalty to the character and his brand, they've created a film that will satisfy, or at least entertain, almost all who choose to see it. While its humor is a bit infrequent, its ability to entertain is quite prolific, merging meaningful drama with raunchy comedy and gratuitous bloodshed to create the Quentin Tarantino of superhero films from the ground up.Marvel needed a superhero that the wearying audience could look unto and smile and through the fourth-wall breaking, crude and careless, unapologetically ruthless Deadpool, they've crafted a hero that is worthy of your attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wisecracking smart*rse Wade Wilson, ex-Special Forces, and currently engaged in small-time "enforcement for pay", falls in love with hooker Vanessa, and her with him. Shortly after this idyllic state of affairs begins, Wade is diagnosed with terminal cancer. All is not lost, however, as he is offered a treatment which will not only cure his cancer but also kick-start his mutant gene, giving him superpowers. Wade opts in, not realising that the people doing this have nefarious intentions: he is cured and enhanced, but (not-very-)hideously scarred. How can he show his face to Vanessa before he has got villain Ajax to cure him? So, masked up and using the name Deadpool...Ryan Reynolds, having played Wilson/Deadpool in X-Men: Wolverine ? Origins, has a second pass at the character, this time somewhat outside the control of the X-Men franchise (although this movie is firmly within the X-Men movie universe). And this time, they get the character right. They get everything else right, too, including the fact that Deadpool makes it very clear, directly to the audience, that he knows he is a character in a comic book movie.This film is very funny, from the opening credits onwards. It is also very violent, very foul-mouthed, and fairly rude. It is not a kids' super-hero movie ? far from it. Wilson is not so much morally compromised, as completely amoral from head to toe: this is clear throughout, but made explicit by his response to a speech from Colossus which explains to him what makes a hero. There is bags of super-hero action, mostly very well staged although it sometimes goes so fast that it can be a bit difficult to follow (some of the slo-mo is therefore very welcome). I think non-comic fans will enjoy it but, for comic fans, it is full of gags drawn from comics, movies, and Reynolds' own super-hero screen career.It's not without flaws ? how come his mutation/treatment heals everything except his face? ? but it is hugely enjoyable, and completely vindicates Reynolds' lengthy efforts to get it made. I'm looking forward to the sequel, greenlit a couple of days ago, already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a (very good) Deadpool movie needed to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I left the theater I told my wife, 'you know, Deadpool is kind of like the Muppets of comic book-superhero movies'. It wasn't the wisest comparison (maybe filthy f***ing Bugs Bunny is far more accurate, but I digress), in large part since the Muppets are family entertainment with an edge that can appeal to adults and yet still be good fun for kids, while Deadpool is hard-R action carnage with sometimes (ok, a good lot of the time) lines that will make many, many, many teenagers laugh (and some folks who get a few key references to things outside of this decade). I think I was just responding to the total irreverence of the whole thing, not to mention the constant breaking of the fourth wall - it's not something completely groundbreaking on its own (Spider-Man talks to the audience, for example), but here it's aware of many of the faults that have come up on comic book and super-hero movies, including its own franchise. For me one of the most cathartic moments of this or any recent movie is seeing a short but noticeable image of an action figure of Deadpool from the 2009 Wolverine movie. Which sucked.Why it did is for reasons outside of the 'not getting the character' right thing (though that's part of it), but suffice it to say what director Tim Miller (first timer! impressive that) and the writers (previously of the also super-self-conscious/meta Zombieland), needed to do was to take the p*** out of the genre while also delivering a story that had some heart to it... wait, heart, in a movie that has the "Merc with the Mouth" Wade Wilson,, the guy who goes through Weapon-X-program-stuff and comes out with the skin of insert-TJ-Miller-Joke-Here appearance? Sure, why not? If I can take it back to the Muppets one last time those movies had heart to them underneath as well. With this Deadpool movie, there's only a couple of scenes where there's no sarcastic lines or quips or just outright 'I'll talk s*** till the cows come home' stuff, but they do help to give the movie some grounding and keep things moving along well.When I say it's hard-R, I mean it - if you take your kids, make sure they know what they're in for and that despite the appearance of the Xavier School, this is very violent and bloody and with limbs flying and heads rolling and little tiny hands regenerating and... too much said. But for me, at least in the first half of the movie before it got to the climax (which I'll get to in a moment), it was refreshing to see how violent it got. I'm not completely sure if it was Miller and the filmmaers' intentions but I suspected all of bodies laid to waste in sometimes horrifying ways is some kind of comment on how bloodless many of the comic book movies and other X-Men films can get. Sure people die and get stabbed by Wolverine and so on, but there's no consequences. Deadpool is the kind of movie where Colossus (that one big Russian metal guy who was in the other X-Men movie that I don't remember the name of) tries to tell Wade not to hurt any people on a highway where a big gun-sword-battle has happened, Wade says nobody got hurt... and then a guy just falls from up above in the background from his wounds. Oops.It's a big comic spectacle that works better as a comedy, and somewhat as a love story, than as an action film. I say this despite a relatively coolly shot and choreographed opening sequence on a highway - which gets sort of cut back to in time during Wade's introduction in flashback - since when it gets back the fights and stunt work later on, the big climax included, it's just acceptable. The real skill of Miller and his team is in letting Ryan Reynolds take this character where it needs to, which is being a constant talking-s*** badass; by the time it comes down to Deadpool facing down the man who made him who he is, "Ajax", the tension isn't fully there just for the reason that Wilson has the ability to regenerate from his injuries (it's one of those they-worked-on-him sort of things).But what's further surprising is that the romantic side of the story works more than I expected thanks to a wonderful set up between Reynolds and Monica Baccarin as Vanessa. They trade barbs in such a way that you wonder if they'll run out of steam; some of their lines are crude, a lot of them very nasty and sex-related, and yet that made it endearing to me when things do get serious between them (the conflict of course that Wilson gets cancer, and all his troubles flow from there). If these actors didn't have good timing and chemistry it would falter, but they don't and so it doesn't, and by the time that the characters get reunited near the end the same spark is still there as are the real levels of sorrow about why they've been apart and what's kept it that way (some of it is Wilson's own doing, the sort of 'look a way I'm a hideous beast' cliché, which I forget if it's even a cliché).Could it have been less low-brow? Maybe. But it's smart enough to be exactly the kind of self-reflexive comic book movie that goes after all of the bulls*** with these movies, from the budgets to Jackman and beyond, and makes its own identity. I found it a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The role that Ryan Reynolds was born to play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a superhero comedy film based on the Marvel comic of the same name. As an adaptation of a crude, violent and hilarious comic book, it is very successful. For me, it has dethroned Kick-Ass as the funniest comic book film I have ever seen.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a wise-cracking mercenary who protects his clients from unwanted associates. One day, Wade is diagnosed with cancer in most of his important internal organs. In an attempt to cure the cancer, Wade undergoes a top secret experiment which leaves him with accelerated healing powers and a sick, twisted sense of humour. As a result, he becomes Deadpool, the "Merc With A Mouth".Filled with all the meta-humour and action one would expect to see, Deadpool is one of the best comic book adaptations to date. You know a movie is off to a good start when even the opening credits have you laughing. There's no denying that this is the role that Ryan Reynolds was born to play. He embodies Deadpool so perfectly, that it is impossible for me to see any other actor portraying the character. There's rarely a dull moment.I rate it 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Never thought FOX will win my heart back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a disappointing experience from fantastic four, I really couldn't see myself to watch any FOX movie comfortably. But Deadpool was AMAZING. Hands down this is the best Marvel comic movie made by a non-marvel studio and probably among the best ever marvel comic movie. The humour was amazing, the movie was serious at some points the random joke at of nowhere will pit a smile on your face. Moments when they make jokes about other marvel characters and movies like when Deadpool said how the X-men school seemed so empty its as if the studio couldn't afford to have any other characters is just amazing. It shows the writers ready to take anything into the movie.The best thing about the jokes is that they are realistic jokes, they were the jokes you would say in your mind but just couldn't say out. I also couldn't think of anyone better to act Deadpool other than Ryan Reynolds. Its like he was born to play deadpool, definitely one of his best ever performances. And might i also say, this movie has the best opening credits I have ever seen. Only downside to this movie was how long it was other than that it was perfect!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went for this movie with high expectations after watching the trailers and the mini trailers plus the trust in Ryan Reynolds Well the movie opened with title credits which is very new to me and was very much impressive. Then continues with an amazing stunt which was totally good. Well, then i thought, WoW Marvel is not going to follow their typical chick flick superhuman movies. Story revolves around a navy returned wade Wilson who works as a mercenary in New York city. He founds his love interest from a bar and started to live peacefully. But fate struck him in the form of cancer. An agent approaches him to recruit for his secret organization that will give mutant abilities and he accepts the offer. But during the process he was disfigured and he calls himself as dead pool and takes the revenge on the organization forms the crux of the story. Dialogues, action sequences, comedy, one liner punches, scenes, background score, Ryan Reynolds of course with an ensemble cast are the positives of the movie. A wonderful entertainer which is not to be missed in theater without much negatives. All in whole a wonderful movie and i will go out with 9 on 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first reaction watching this movie, from quite early on, is "where did they get the movie to make it?!". Deadpool is a niche movie: it is for aging super hero fans, who like their violence and their geekie references. It can't by definition for everyone. If you are a in the targeted audience, then it's really fun: the jokes work, the violence is enjoyable and Ryan Reynolds delivers. You can tell he's passionate.It is not a GREAT movie either: you can feel some budget constraints + honestly the villains aren't that bad. I was however giggling the whole way and liked this fresh (at least on the silver screen) take on Marvel. Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, just what I've been waiting for!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I write this review as a hardcore fan of deadpool, having read a ridiculous amount of stories involved with this character. I have waited years for this movie to be made and leading up to the entire production of this film I always pictured Ryan Reynolds as deadpool. I was not wrong in believing he can pull it off. At this moment I believe that he is the only person who can play this character. Looking passed the amazing casting of the title character, I believe this movie was faithful to fans and funny enough for the newcomers. This was clearly a testing the waters project for 20th century fox. The lack of budget I believe held back a truly motivated group of people who wanted to push the limits and basically hit the line that cannot be crossed. The dreaded R rating. They have put together a film that essentially has almost no plot, but gives a look at the origin of a character that people may not have heard of. As a fan of the comics I know that the story is not exactly canon to the comics but as a fan of Deadpool, I know that nothing is ever clear in any story he's involved with. This movie feels like a collection of 4 comics put together in a soft cover book. The story starts and ends just like any deadpool story you would read. Loved it but maybe I have a conflict of interest because of the history I have with the character. Either way I think anyone can find some humor with this movie unless you're a complete hard ass. If so, stay home and read the bible cause this movie will make you question where the human race spends it's time thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many other people who read Deadpool's (mis)adventures on a monthly basis, this film had a lot to live up to to make me happy. Getting the right blend of over the top violence and gore, crude jokes and 4th wall breaking references was never going to be easy, but it has been achieved with great success! The film is consistently funny from start to finish as long as you have the right level of maturity or aren't prudish.Ryan Renyolds is perfect as the regeneratin' degenerate, delivering gags as fast the the bullets are coming from the various guns, and DP's wingman Weasel is not short of wit either. One of the best things here was Colossus and Negasonic teenage warhead appearance, which gives not only more options for characters for Deadpool to mock, but also gives the movie the feeling of being a part of a bigger universe in the same way as the Marvel studios movies do.If there is one thing that I must criticise about this film, its that sometimes, the switch between the action to the origin flashbacks don't feel fluid, leaving the audience wanting more of the action, but instead just jumping back in time in what feels like the worst time. This could be to highlight how disjointed Wade's mind is though so I'll let it slide. Bring on the sequel! 9/10 for pure entertainment, I mean, why else would you watch a film if not to be entertained?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool.After a BRILLIANT marketing campaign that set some pretty high expectations, the wait is finally over. The timing of things is perfect, especially with the superheroes overload we are getting lately. I'm not complaining. We like comic book movies, they're fun, but even the most hard core comic book fan can tell you that right now we are oversaturated . Some of them are really good and then we have the Fantastic Four. I was blown away by this film, I loved every minute of it. Coming from someone who didn't know much about Deadpool character, it surprised me in so many ways. It sure as hell beats Kick-Ass and is many, many cuts above Green Lantern. This offshoot of the X-Men series feels like a nasty child next to the shiny delegations of the MCU, as represented by Disney's Avengers franchise and Sony's not-so-amazing Spider Man. This wholesome "reboot" pulls off that postmodern trick of getting away with formulas and clichés simply by pointing them out. Deadpool knows what world its in and since it exists within this world, the movie is fully aware of it: self-aware in every way and self-referential. It completely breaks the fourth wall, with its main character looking at the audience and stating something that we are already thinking about in today state of comic book films, this is beautiful. Let's talk about this, as it's easy - especially nowadays - to watch a comic book film and just go like "OMG! There's so much action and cool stuff, him punching things really hard, I loved it!" Thats' not what I loved the most about. It's the script. The script is extremely funny. It's a smart structure, one that really sidesteps the major issue with origin stories: the suited up main attraction being mostly absent for the first hour or so. Plus, Wolverine or Superman require something interesting to do - for the most part - but what Deadpool is up to here is less important than the fuss he makes about it and the film still is quite entertaining (a fight, a kidnapping, a rescue attempt and roll credits). For years, Hollywood hasn't known what to do with this "Sexiest Man Alive" and his caustic charm. At least in this film they new exactly how to use Ryan Reynolds: an actor whose smooth leading good looking man roles have long disguised one of the sharpest funnyman in the business; as fans of The Proposal, Definitely, Maybe and Just Friends attest. Here he truly has his role of a lifetime, with his mad energy fuelling the film and his likable almost Clooneyesque goofiness. It's not the kind of star profile that immediately screams "blockbuster" and Reynolds first appearance as Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) offered sadly little hint of what he could do with the role. Indeed, this film function as a star vehicle for him, demolishing his physical beauty - a small price to pay when an actor's tongue is this gloriously sharp. Though, even with a face that's been horrifically shattered into what his friend likens to the "offspring of an avocado that had sex with an older avocado", Ryan Reynolds and his character are a blast of laughing. Giving all these self-referential potty talk a delirious comic momentum. He's at his best as Deadpool, nailing snappy jokes and slaying one liners; weirdly similar to his cousin Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man but with more sugar in the mix. Reynolds genuinely is fun and he seems to enjoy giving the chance to his chimichanga-loving hero the main stage he deserves. His love story with Vanessa (starring Morena Baccarin) doesn't appear like a plot devices at all. They have good chemistry that sells the love story even more, they feel like a real couple who really enjoys each other. Though Ed Skrein does a far better imitation of Jason Statham as this British badass than he managed in The Transporter Refueled, he doesn't look or sound like a proper villain. He looks more like the villain henchman. In fact, that "British villain" joke in the opening titles is misleading. The Brit in question ... &gt; More on my blog</fullReview>

Reynolds perfectly portrayed the character of Deadpool and i am so happy they gave him a second chance because he is the perfect choice.I can't really find any negatives to this movie except maybe the simple plot and the bland villain but then i would say that it was just so we could focus on Deadpool so in my opinion a good choice.Overall this not just a great superhero movie but a great movie and with the huge amount of superhero movies being released this year Deadpool has set the bar high and all the others will have hard work to do to follow it up !9/10 Awesome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I'd never seen it. CRAP! Very very disappointing. I can't believe it got an 8.3 rating??? I was really looking forward to seeing this and after watching it I'm pretty disappointed. I can't believe it got such good reviews, definitely undeserving. Crappy, dark, twisted humour. Definitely took everything way too far. Don't bother watching it. I wish someone had given me this advice before sitting through it, I want 1.48mins of my life back! They could have made a great movie so upsetting that this is what they managed to come up with. Pretty gratuitous violence lasting the entire length of the movie, lost count of the number of decapitations. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could just be a situation where this film isn't meant to be for people like me, but I can honestly say that this is one of the most forgettable films I have ever seen.I can't fault the technical aspects of this film. The CGI was pretty good at points and Didn't look terrible compared to other films I have seen. However, this doesn't carry the film. 90% of this film relies on its humour, and it wasn't very good. The jokes where pretty copy paste, trying to be raunchy and edgy, and were quite pandering. I genuinely didn't laugh or even smirk for any of the jokes. The "Shit. Did I leave the stove on?" is such a easy and overused joke, and for a film that is meant to be the best thing since sliced bread, I honestly hoped for better. There is also only about 20 mins of actual story that seems to get mixed in with the flashbacks and action sequences. I Wasn't expecting to be blown away by the story, but I feel that they could of tried a little harder. The flash back scenes really disrupted the flow of the film and made it hard for me to get into the movie as I was just waiting for another flash back at any moment. Now, To be fair, I have only read little segments of the Deadpool comics, but what I did read made me laugh. I had heard from friends and others that this is THE Deadpool that is in the comics and not some film that completely screws up the character. If that is the case, then I am not sure if I want to read the comics. I could go on and nit pick little things and scenes that I didn't like but not many people are going to read this. Overall I would say that fans of Comic book movies will most likely enjoy this. If sex, LOLrandom, and darker humour are your type of thing, you might enjoy this, however the jokes aren't original enough or executed well enough to be hysterical. This isn't going to be a classic, but it's not bad enough to fully hate it either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest comic book movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a new comic book movie and its the story of how the anti-hero gets his identity and his name, and also how he sets in a path of revenge against Ed Skerin. This has to be the best Marvel comic book movie I've ever seen (its debatable with The avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy). The script is very funny, clever and aware of the mistakes Marvel has done of the past about Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds portraits again Deadpool and does a great job doing so. The love interest with Wade Wilson and Vanessa its handled very well and gives the story some weight because you want Deadpool to succeed, you want him to get his girlfriend. The action is done masterfully well blending CGI with practical effects. T.J Miller was also hilariously funny with a lot of great lines, and Colossus is there because he wants to use Deadpool's powers for good, and he wants Deadpool to join the X-men, so it gives a reason for Deadpool to decide who he really wants to be in the future. The name Wade gives himself its amazingly clever and unexpected. The end credit scene was hilarious and its aware of what marvel has done in the past, as the general audience expects information about the sequel or future installments. The music is very well incorporated, the R rating finally gives the movie freedom of doing what they want, the villain is very hateful, and the first credit scene is gut- bustlingly funny. This has to be the funniest movie I've seen in quite some time. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Freshest Comic Books Movie in a Some Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I had a feeling this movie would be awesome but I really was not prepared for what I just saw. I knew the film would be raunchy and irreverent but I had no idea just how far they would go to make fun of both themselves and the entire genre while still making a badass comic book movie. I'm sort of familiar with the character of Deadpool from the comic books but I had no idea this kind of craziness was in store for me. I've never even heard of the director before, a guy named Tim Miller, but I'm already excited to see more from him and I'm hoping it will come in the form of another Deadpool movie. The story is insanity but let's try and talk about it.Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), otherwise known as Wade Wilson, is an antihero hunting down a man named Ajax (Ed Skrein), otherwise known as Francis. We start to learn why Wade wants to get to Francis thanks to a number of flashbacks and a heavy dose of fourth wall breaking from Wade himself. You see, Deadpool knows that he's in a movie and he knows that we're watching him. He even knows about the other X-Men films and the somewhat strange continuity problems they've been having. Anyway, the reason Deadpool wants Ajax is because he was tricked into signing up for a military program to give him mutant powers and cure the cancer that was eating away at his body. He didn't know that Ajax would basically be torturing him and turn him into a freak. On top of this, Wade was forced to leave the love of his life, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), when he joined the program. Now Wade is out for revenge against the people that scarred him so that he can get back together with Vanessa and live happily ever after.I've never been a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds in the past but he absolutely nailed it with this role. Wade is basically insane, ridiculously hyper, and an all around prick. Reynolds not only gives us all of this but seems to be really enjoying himself while he does it. Reynolds can also pull off the more dramatic moments with ease so no complaints there. Honestly, it seem like everyone is really enjoying themselves in this film. Baccarin's Vanessa is almost as messed up as Wade and comes off as genuinely caring for him. Skrein is the prototypical bad guy but it seems to work really well in this story. He's a prick and he knows he's a prick. There really isn't a weak link in this one.The general look of this movie is very different from other films of the same genre. It's a bit dirtier looking than the common Manhattan or Metropolis type area but not as romanticized as say Gotham City. It really gives the film a unique look that the others don't have. I'm not sure if that was intentional or if it's a result of a low budget, something that Deadpool jokes about during the movie itself. Just compare the general look of the city to Xavier's Mansion, which does show up a few times in the film.I was blown away by the number of jokes that are thrown around in this movie. Everyone in the theater was laughing every few minutes just because of how genuinely funny a lot of these scenes are. Not all of them come off as comedy gold but the good ones are really damn good and easily make up for the lackluster ones. I'm also surprised how far they took the comedy at times. They definitely don't shy away from offensive material but it actually helps to show what kind of a character Deadpool is. If you're offended by material that isn't politically correct then this movie definitely isn't for you.I straight up adored this film and I came out of the theater wanting to see another one right away. The world really does need more Deadpool. I can't express enough just how fresh this movie feels when compared to a lot of other films in the same genre. I don't know if a sequel can top the madness in this one but I would love to see them try. I can't recommend this movie strongly enough. Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glad to see they finally made the Deadpool movie. I have been looking forward to this release since production was first announced. I was glad to see that they cast Ryan Renold's as Deadpool, he is the perfect choice for this role, it was a much better fit for him than his role in Green Lantern. I really enjoyed the story and the way it was told. It was a refreshing change from some of the PG rated super hero films that try to appeal to a larger market by going for the lower rating. The film moved along at a brisk pace, and was filled with a lot of humour and shots at other action films. I am looking forward to the sequel! I don'It have anything negative to say about the film, as all of the character choices were good, and I like how Stan Lee inserts into all his films. I found myself laughing all the way through the film. Great Job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Adaptation of a Superhero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what has probably been the greatest and most outrageous marketing campaign for any film, Deadpool finally made it to the big screen. No X-Men Origins Wolverine doesn't count, because there is absolutely no way we can call that character Deadpool, and luckily, this film takes a few stabs at that. Nonetheless, it has been a long road for the 'Merc with a Mouth' but I think now is the right time. With the abundance of comic book films pouring out every year, Deadpool brings a refreshing take on the genre. Much thanks to his daring comic creators in the 90's, he's an uncompromising, foul mouthed, anti-hero that has fun doing what he's doing. That's a great way to describe this film, insane fun.The film tells the relatively paint by the numbers narrative of Wade Wilson falling in love with Vanessa, played by Morena Baccarin, and then having to look for a cure to his terminal cancer. Enter a Weapon X like program run by Ajax, played by Ed Skrein, who offers Wilson the chance to become cured from his cancer and also gain special abilities. The film is told in a non-linear structure for the first hour or so which can feel a little strange at first, but after a few scenes you grow comfortable with it knowing the chaotic and absurd nature of the character of Deadpool himself, thus a non- linear structure fits the bill.Ryan Reynolds was absolutely born to play Wade Wilson/Deadpool. Over the last year or so seeing all the marketing material, we have gotten plenty of reasons why he was the perfect fit for him, but I still went in with reasonable expectations. There are a lot of great characters in the film that have fun playing alongside Deadpool, but make no mistake, Reynolds is the star of this film in more ways than one. Reynolds has had difficulties in the past with picking the right roles to fit his strengths, but this is the role that will define his career, and I sure hope he sticks around for awhile.Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead provide us and Deadpool with the extra heroes and X-Men characters that help Pool against Ajax and crew, but also confirm to the audience that he does have the potential to crossover with the X-Men at some point. Deadpool's banter with them two makes for some of the best comedic relief of the entire script. Not only that, but they served a purpose for the character of Deadpool in his emotional arc of the story and also the physical arc as well.First time feature film director Tim Miller does a brilliant job bringing a lot of people's favorite comic character to life and Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese do an impeccable job writing the screenplay. I came out of this thoroughly entertained and with a giant smile on my face. Surprisingly, it didn't have anything to do with the well choreographed action sequences, the hilariously placed cameos, or the perfect after credits sequences, but the fact that the writers, producers, director and everyone involved, got this character right. It's only been a few months since Fox messed up another one of their comic book properties but the fact that this film started of the 2016 superhero slate with a bang just makes me happy. For all intents and purposes, this film is made for nerds, myself being one of them. It's made for those who begged Fox to make a Deadpool film all these years even after Ryan Reynolds got stuck in Green Lantern Hell, another area in which Deadpool enjoyed poking fun at. In reality though, I think everyone can at least enjoy themselves watching the film. They pitched it as a love story for Valentine's Day weekend and you definitely get that. Vanessa and Wade worked well together and a love story that you care about in a superhero film is usually tough to come by. There's something for everyone here, but those who truly care about this character will appreciate it the most. Whether it was presence of the X-mansion, ripping Hugh Jackman/Wolverine, surprising Batman and even Marvel universe nods, the amount of easter eggs are endless. This was the Deadpool film we all wanted to see, and boy did we get it.+Reynolds is perfect+Dirty, brutal, and hilarious+Spot on interpretation of Deadpool+So many easter eggs+Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead fit in well9.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Reynolds was born to play this role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I start...Well, this is complete redemption for Fox. After the awful introduction in X-Men Origins: Wolverine(less said the better), this movie was an apology to the fans. Now, I'll be honest, the plot is a pretty straight-forward revenge story. It's very simple and easy to follow. It doesn't do anything new in that department as it is an origin story, but it's told with more flare. You would think jumping from place to place, flashback to flashback would confuse you and many other people, but it doesn't. So kudos to director Tim Miller, Ryan Reynolds, and writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick for a sharp clear vision of the movie. They knew what they were going for and executed it very well. The origin told through flashbacks was a breath of fresh air. Something I admired about Man of Steel. I feel superhero origin stories are best told through flashbacks. The visuals are solid, and the action sequences are pretty stellar. Small in scale(cause of their budget) but nevertheless, very fun. There's no PG-13 compromise here, the filmmakers absolutely do not hold back. This is hard R, with nudity, including Ryan Reynolds's bare ass, hyper-stylized violence, blood, gore, foul language, and dirty jokes. So if you're someone who gets easily offended by this, I would advise you to stay away. But even with that being said, one must admit, this brings something new to the superhero genre, and it's a film made for comic fans such as myself. The cast is great. In typical fashion the villains are not too fleshed out, they do present a threat, but it's nothing special. Ed Skrein as Ajax and Gina Carano as Angel Dust do their job at being evil. T.J. Miller as Deadpool's sidekick is hysterical with quippy and crude lines. Leslie Uggams is Blind Al. She and Deadpool share some nice and funny banter with each other. Colossus is voiced by Stefan Kapicic, played by Andre Tricoteux, and his young trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead is played by Brianna Hildebrand and they have their fun moments with Deadpool as well. Colossus certainly does a lot more than he ever did in the previous X-Men films, although I am a bit annoyed Daniel Cudmore did not return for the role for continuity's sake, this Colossus is a more faithful interpretation to the comics. I'd also like to mention I'm not big on superhero romance. On occasion they do work, like Captain America and Peggy Carter, Spider-Man and Gwen or Mary Jane, and I guess Tony Stark and Pepper Potts, but outside of that I never really buy into them, they just seem like an afterthought, but here in this film the chemistry works. Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin have fabulous chemistry between each other. I know it sounds like a broken record, but chemistry really counts in all type of films, so it was pleasantly shocking to see it work on screen, especially from a movie like Deadpool. Now lets talk about Ryan. Man, from now on, every time I read a Deadpool comic, I'm going to hear his voice. Like the title of my review, he was born to play this role. Even in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, prior to the abysmal transformation, when he was just Wade Wilson, Reynolds killed it. He carries the film very well and he does a great job making him almost sympathetic. You know for a fact Wade Wilson is not a great person, but what he goes through in the somewhat difficult torture sequences, you come to care and personally want to see him get his revenge on Ajax. Again, Deadpool's jokes are hilarious and Ryan definitely knows how to deliver it effectively. Deadpool isn't a perfect film, it does have some minor problems, but it's a hell of a fun ride. It's face paced, never boring, consistently funny, and filled with clever fourth wall breaking moments. Deadpool himself even pokes fun at Ryan's career, other superheroes and even Fox, the studio itself. Deadpool subverts the superhero formula resulting in a hilarious and violent thrill ride all in it's non-family friendly glory, and if you weren't sold on the marketing of this film already, then I don't know what to tell you. I have no doubt that this will be successful and I'm only anticipating the sequel even more. I hope this film will un-retire Hugh Jackman so I can see a proper Wolverine and Deadpool fight in a future installment or even X-Force.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's maximum effort to deliver wet dream about super anti-hero. Yes, it's as delightful and vulgar as it sounds, especially delivered by the Merc with a Mouth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first minute you'll know what to expect from Deadpool, this is a movie which bluntly admits the director is overpaid and one of the characters is CG, then using Ryan Reynolds in the cover of magazine while random henchmen is burning as introduction. Aside from all the silliness, its love story manages to establish connection better than Wolverine ever had with his unhealthy obsession with Jean Grey and that one girl from his origin story.Ryan Reynolds works as the titular character Deadpool in the same manner Robert Downey Jr. worked as Iron-Man, he's already half the character he's playing. He does not shy from self-deprecation, in fact most of the jokes are in expense of the man, mainly about how ugly he is. A healthy dose of pop culture references also helps in making him more amiable even though he's made out of profanity and vulgarity.Ed Skrein finds a better success as the villain here than he did as the new Transporter. He's the fine opposite of Deadpool with almost the same physical built and quite the charisma, though more on the grim side. Morena Baccarin as Vanessa is looking like normal lovely brunette, yet she's humorous enough to set her character apart. Apparently, the experience as love interest in Gotham might help in that.Deadpool live and die, or perhaps regenerate, by its comedy, it's his thing, breaking the fourth wall with real life references and talking with audience. This is an advantage other superheroes are deprived of, he's already more enjoyable due to his ability to mock practically everything. Between all its galore of decapitation and cursing, this is a legitimate comedy for not all ages, certainly not for kids.Action is pretty solid, presentable CG and choreography make it a visual treat. Its chase scene has high resemblance from another blockbuster and even animation from video game. This is not the world's end type of crisis from Avengers, Deadpool is not that selfless, yet it's a proper visual one might expect from Marvel. Selection of soundtrack is also commendable, using a more direct and classic approach for the tunes from Deadpool himself.Deadpool delivers what other superheroes, lacking figurative regenerating balls or guts, won't even attempt; crude jokes, brutal display and heavy set of sarcasm. This might not be for everyone, but it's every bit orgasmically fun as one expects from Merc with a Mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hm why did I like it so much? First of all I liked it so much because it was a different kind of super hero movie compared to the others I have seen.I liked it so much because I was more interested in the crazy funny scenes and words that came out of Deadpool's &amp; W. Wilson's mouth than in the plot &amp; story of the movie. Or in other words, I went to the movie to laugh and didn't expect an amazing plot. And, I didn't get disappointed. I loved how they made fun about a lot of other superhero movies. Surely, not every joke belonged to my kind of humor, but some jokes &amp; scenes were just done brilliantly &amp; funny. If you do not take this movie's story, plot, and maybe some jokes too seriously than you will definitely like it. But the plot isn't that bad, better than a lot of other super hero movies I have seen.I've read that some people are complaining that there is nudity and a sex scene in this movie... So? Come on people we are living in the 21. Century where almost everyone has access to the internet and not in the middle ages...! While I was watching the movie there was never a second where I felt bored. You always wanted to know what Deadpool/ Wade was going to do or say next.Ryan R. and the rest of the cast did a great job, Ryan is definitely billion times better in portraying Deadpool than the other super hero with the green suit :).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, where to start with this one??? It was my favorite movie I've seen in a long time...(yes that includes Star Wars the Force Awakens). I'm used to taking my two sons to every Marvel release, and although it's rated R and my kids wouldn't be allowed in anyway, I still blush at the thought of it. This one is definitely a mashup of Jackass and the X- Men.Deadpool is as deprecating of a film as you're ever likely to see. It also skewers the entire superhero genre, as well as the acting talents of many of Hollywood's biggest stars, including it's own leading man. Much has been made of it demolishing the "Fourth Wall" of Hollywood as well...but it also destroys "Walls 5-10" as well. Ridiculously profane, heaps of gratuitous violence, nudity, and sex..and yes grandfatherly Stan Lee, in a cameo as a DJ at an all nude strip club...what's not to love??Deadpool breaks all of the non-existent rules of superhero movies, because no one said that all superheroes have to strictly adhere to an unwritten code of conduct. There's not much to the movie we haven't seen in other superhero/mutant films. Guy turned into a mutant by some bad guys. Guy wants revenge against those bad guys. Guy gains revenge on these bad guys using his mutant powers.Yeah it's a formula we have seen before, but not in this over the top way. This movie is big and bold, and not afraid to take shots at everyone, and everything within its genre and beyond. I haven't laughed so hard at a movie since I saw Bad Grandpa, and its no mistake that I mentioned that particular movie, while providing my two "cents" on Deadpool.Somewhere Captain America is shaking his head right now, and Johnny Knoxville and his band of puerile mischief makers are laughing their butts off.Decidedly different, and hilariously funny this is something you HAVEN'T seen before...just make sure you leave the kiddos behind for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Celebrate Valentine's Day with Deadpool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of development hell we finally have a version of Deadpool that comic book fans were asking for. Ryan Reynolds returns once again as Wade Wilson (he played the character in X-Men Origins Wolverine) and delivers a performance that is one of the highlights of his career.Minor spoilers of the movies plot. Deadpool follows a mercenary turned good guy (one could argue) who finds a girl who's "crazy matches his crazy"; everything seems perfect until our "hero" gets diagnosed with terminal cancer. A mysterious organisation that promises to cure his cancer and give him powers beyond his imagination contacts him. In a not so shocking twist they turn out to be using people with serious health conditions to experiment on and use them as "super slaves". I was a bit worried that the backstory of how Wade Wilson became Deadpool would take half of the movie. That is not the case the blend between action and story development makes this movie one of marvel's best.The main thing everyone wants to know is the movie actually any good, and the short answer is yes. At the beginning of the production there were talks of making the movie PG-13 (American equivalent of 12A), fortunately it was announced that the movie would indeed be rated R (American equivalent of 15 rating). Of course because the movie is rated 15 the budget was not as big as it could have been and it shows. The whole scale is smaller compared to other superhero movies, but I think that makes the movie stand out even more. Even with the rating everyone was hoping for, there were doubts if the violence, swearing and the nudity would not be toned down. I can gladly say that there is no need to worry. We were promised a movie for the fans and that is exactly what we got. The main reason why Deadpool is so popular as a character is because of his personality and wisecracking attitude, the movie is great at showing that. There are numerous 4th wall breaks, dirty jokes and surprisingly a lot of swearing. Even the opening credits make fun of the cast and the director of the movie. If you are familiar with the X-Men movie universe you might catch few more inside jokes jokes, but if you are not, that does not make the film less fun to watch. The movie even makes fun of the budget of the movie by saying that the only two X-Men that we ever see are Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (in my opinion the greatest superhero name ever) Lets talk about the supporting cast. Morena Baccarin plays Vannesa, Wade Wilsons love interest, which automatically makes her the damsel in distress, that our "hero" has to save. Her character is not really developed enough to form an opinion, but the few scenes she is in Baccarin does the best she can with the character. Next I want to talk about my favourite character in the movie (excluding Deadpool) Weasel. Played by T.J. Miller Weasel is Wade's best friend I have to say he is not given a lot of screen time, but when he is on the screen he does a marvellous job. You have to remember that the movie is short and the supporting cast suffers from that quite a bit. Ed Skrein and Gina Carano play Ajax and Angel dust respectively. Their characters are a bit one-dimensional. They are evil just for the sake of being evil. There is no back-story for both of them. There are rumours of an extended cut, so we can hope to learn more of them in that. The two X-Men in the film are great especially Brianna Hildebrand who plays Negasonic Teenage Warhead. She acts like a typical teenager would, some of the best jokes involve her and Deadpool talking. All in all even with a small budget the action is still great, the violence is oven the top and while the special effects are not perfect they are still good. Even if you are not a fan of superhero genre but you like fun action movies you should at least give this movie a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie from the studio who totally ruined Fantastic Four for me and did a Baraka from Mortal Kombat kinda version of Deadpool in X-Men Origins Wolverine, comes a movie that totally takes any doubt about if FOX can make a proper movie and delivers one of the best straight outta comic book to movie adaptation ever. I am impressed to the way Deadpool has made transition to the big screen in a total funny, violent and unexpected turn of events, the movie literally makes you wanna see it again and again, until your wallet remains out of money.By the way I am not a Deadpool fan, but after I saw the movie I become one. I laughed so hard at some scenes that totally annoyed the all movie theatre and confirmed the fact that Marvel fanboys think if Stan Lee makes a cameo in the movie , the movie will be good, well they were not too wrong about this fact, but I don't think this always works. The fact that Hugh Jackman gets dissed and the FOX studio itself a couple of times was quite hilarious and the inside joke about Colossus and Teenage Negasonic Warhead we're the only characters they can afford was just too much. The action scenes and constant rewind scenes are great, the villains Ajax Amsterdam, I mean Francis and Angel "not so much" Dust we're fine. In the end (not the Linkin Park song), the movie was fun to watch, got great action scenes and if you don't like swearing and curse words to much, this movie is not the one you should go at, unless you take your children (just kidding , wait till your children get a proper age or not)or just go watch it because you like comic book movie adaptations like me, more or less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool Review by Deadpool himself: Breaking the fourth wall!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You saw a bullet create a hole on my body in those trailers, though Indian censor had some culture supporting cuts, my movie is worth watching. Oh wait, you may be wondering why the Deadpool narrative review, that's because reviewers don't make me bleed! What do they usually start a review with? The storyline right, my movie doesn't have a great story to deal with; like those Marvel films, yes the Wolverine film, I hunt the ones who gave me super powers and get back my girl ?but stop, I got a better love story here, Indian audience won't get to feel the 'love' completely. The plot isn't that twisting or philosophical uh...oh, I saw some of them complaining my lukewarm plot, were you expecting Nolan or what? You can actually relate my film to Guardians of the Galaxy, well, the whole pack wasn't as abusive as me indeed, but the fun factor resonates. May be, I could have coffee with those guys in some crossover film.Yeah, I know that you all saw my Red band trailer, so you might've got an idea of what kinda superhero I'm- I'm of the rambunctious sort, thanks to my creators they have allowed me break the fourth wall and even re generate my body parts. I know that this thing interested you guys, you wanna see blood spurt in slow motion and the sharp blade take a full view on the screen, don't worry, though debutant, Tim Miller has packed stuff to keep you guys appealing, but nerds stay away. I'm not the type of superhero who protects the city; I'm neither a watchful guardian, nor a genius, billionaire, whatever. When you step into theaters, right from the opening credits, you stay entertained, even after the end credits. That's more important for me, when you get to see a sarcastic anti-hero like me, which is what matters more. I troll almost everyone I know, right from all those superheroes to that once-failed super hero guy, Ryan Reynolds. Uh oh, time to enter performance side, this guy is the show stealer of my film, he portrayed me in the most lovable manner, thanks man ? hope you guys are reading this in his voice! Without his narration, my film wouldn't have been so effective, well, this role will patch is career. So cool he was. Ed Skrein too did his part well, he was sleek, and so were the ones who did the supportive mutants. Morenna Baccarin was sexy while TJ Miller had a couple of extra scenes than what you have seen in all the trailers combined. I did even spot Marvel's chairman, maybe he was being cautious of me breaking the fourth wall.At the making part, as I've already said, Miller packed things together to make my movie as engaging and entertaining as possible, you won't feel even the slightest trace of bore. The action sequences are of top class, they appeal both visually and violently. Another factor that pumps energy is the music by Junkie XL, I know most of you've fallen in love with 'X Gon Give it to Ya', I saw the theater go crazy when I walked in slow motion for that song. Is there anything remaining to mention? Yes, editing was crisp with those sharp cuts and the film is technically brilliant.You guys are still reading this? Aah, got it, the tail piece right? These days people make a statistical analysis of money spent on watching the film, I'm not gonna do that! If you wanna really see the different kinda superhero, I mean, anti-hero, go get your tickets, don't gather reasons to watch the torrent print. Though Indian censor tried to make me cultural, I'm still entertaining cause I'm Dead-f**king-pool! I hired this Sooraj Pattazhy to write this review as he was watching the film while I was slicing the baddies! I promised him that my fans are gonna shower this post with likes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rude, crude and wonderfully entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it last night and thought it a wonderful, hilarious and entertaining film. So many different and clever humour to laugh at and Deadpool's character was magnetic.I thought the bad guy was very well played and liked that the story was a simple origin/revenge tale rather than some over the top/end of the world/buildings being sucked into the air extravaganza.It meant they concentrated on the characters more and were less worried about achieving the killer money shot for the trailers. Maybe having less budget is not such a hindrance.I loved all the interactions, the romance was wonderfully refreshing and the action top notch. There was laughing and gasping out loud.I really hope the film does well as I've been impressed with Ryan's efforts to get this made, loved the novel marketing and respect the studio's courage to sink some dollar into an r-rated Superhero film. I'd love to see the making of features on this as I think they would be fascinating.I'd put this up with Kick Ass and Kingsman for providing all round adult entertainment.Great work Ryan and Tim, can't wait for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool = big disappointment &amp; too much hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guess I was suckered by all the super-slick promotional hype pushed onto social media by the studio. The movie really fails to provide anything more than what is in the trailers. It left me feeling I wasted my time and money. Even if it went straight to DVD, I don't know if it would be a worthwhile watch. Deadpool does not provide any kind of character development. Even the comic book offered more. The movie characters are flat and two-dimensional. Often using strained dialog and weak humor to explain major characteristics of the characters' personae. They should have stuck with the video game. Do yourself a favor. Watch the trailer a couple times and save your time and money. It is becoming apparent that the studios have a very good understanding of what kind of hype and promotion it takes to get audiences to open their wallets. Even if they leave disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irreverent, hilarious and ballsy. Just awesome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kick-starting 2016's superhero season with a bang, this adults-only comic book adaptation is ballsy, irreverent and hilariously cheeky. Think a Kick-Ass flavoured X-men movie, but even filthier. Wisely opting to forgo the typical U.S. PG-13 rating the vast majority of blockbusters aim for (in order to widen their audience reach), Deadpool doubles down on its brain-splattering violence, vulgar jokes and disgusting potty mouth, all to great effect. There's also the unique tone to separate it from other comic-book flicks; not only is it subversive and amusingly juvenile, but it whole heartedly embraces its fourth-wall-breaking and meta humour roots. Wolverine and Hugh Jackman: beware. Screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick earn praise for more than just the snappy dialogue and pitch-perfect gags though, for they have crafted a franchise starter that evades the usual origin story pitfalls by messing with timelines and genre tropes. Working with a relatively low budget of $58m, debutant director Tim Miller puts every dollar to work to ensure the action sequences are inventive, exhilarating and high calibre, augmented with CGI as good as anything you'll see in the MCU or DCCU. None of this would be possible, however, if it wasn't for Ryan Reynolds. Having pushed for this film incessantly over the last seven years, Reynolds finally gets his wish to properly portray the smart-alec character he was born to play. After the debacle that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine ? where his Merc with the Mouth was idiotically sidelined and silenced ? Reynolds relishes the opportunity to finally give the titular antihero, and alter-ego Wade Wilson, the spotlight he deserves. The support is top notch too: Morena Baccarin is game for anything as Wilson's tough-as-nails fiancé, T.J. Miller gives good comedy relief, and Ed Skrein and Gina Carano are suitably nasty as the merciless villains. Holding absolutely nothing back, Deadpool is a rip-roaring movie that will have you squirming, cheering and laughing? possibly all at once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring language and basically unpleasant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what all the fuss is about with this unpleasant film. I find it peculiar and not very interesting. For me, it's not funny, with the humour being crass and boring (unlike the humour in Guardians of the Galaxy). The constant use of swear words (mostly the same ones over and over again) is boring and irritating. The violence is OTT and unnecessary (maybe it is felt by the money makers that films need to be increasingly violent to attract audiences, which are perhaps becoming inured to violence both on and off the screen?). It seems that film companies are looking for different ways of making money with the Marvel franchise, since the standard formulaic super-hero films with their celebrity personalities lost their interest to many after the first few, being 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'.The only thing that is reasonably good about Deadpool, IMHO, is the visual effects, so for that it could have a 3 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This changes everything.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ten out of ten doesn't even do justice. Ryan Reynolds and Deadpool have torn apart what you expect from a superhero movie and now offer you a comic book franchise that no other studio can, they have given you a superhero film for strictly adults only. There were 10-12 year olds in the theater, if you let anyone under 16 see this then you are a horrible parent. Deadpool earns its R rating the hard way, lots of brutal violence, lots of nudity and excessive language. Does anyone else miss the old days when our action heroes were in your face brutal, unforgiving and not afraid to use bad language? Take the original Blade for example, it worked brilliantly. Now imagine that with five times the language, more stylized action and a boatload of laughs. I literally laughed from start to finish with this movie, but still found our hero incredibly badass. What do I mean by this changes everything? Fox now has the one thing no other studio does, an over the top hero not only worthy, but demanding of an R rating. Now Warner Bros, Sony and even Marvel Studios will guarantee follow suit. I believe we could now get R rated Wolverine, maybe R rated Batman even. Point is that it is now proved that you can go true to your comic, aim for adults and not just succeed, but bring me back. I'm going tomorrow to make twice in 2 days. If your over 18 and don't like it, then hang yourself, cuz you'll never be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for everyone, despite the high scores</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather than tell you whether I liked this movie or not, I'll try to tell you what to expect, and you can make up your own mind if you want to see it.Story-wise it's really not that interesting: Punk gets super-powers but because of how he acquired them he holds a huge grudge against the person responsible for giving them to him. Revenge ensues. This is the introduction of a new Super-character, Deadpool, from the Marvel Universe. There's plenty of action, much of it gratuitous and with ridiculously violent and cruel one sided slaughter scenes of people with no super powers.The most entertaining action of course is when adversaries are evenly matched, and whilst there is plenty of this too, the villains are ultimately hopelessly outgunned and that puts a cap on the potential for a nail-biting climax. The dialogue: Deadpool wise-cracks his way through the 108 minutes. Sometimes he's genuinely funny, but mostly he talks fast to keep things from slowing down. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, and equally there were others that were just embarrassing in their vulgarity.What makes this film different is that Deadpool knows he's in a movie and takes time out to joke with the audience. It's an interesting move for such a high budget film and generally it worked out pretty well.The target audience is undoubtedly male, from 16 to 25. Teens are going to love it but there's probably not enough story there for everyone else and it's just too violent for anyone under 16.This is a movie of our time, violent with a wayward moral compass. Heros are out of style and instead we are treated to a dose of narcissism. This doesn't mean the film is unwatchable, but don't expect to leave the cinema uplifted and inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie that did no wrong..except for maybe the dirty, dirty, dirty stuff....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but then if you had any clue, you expected that, whether you appreciate the dirty or not. I will not not go so far as to say it is a perfect movie and I don't know why. Somehow I feel Deadpool, if real, would not appreciate it being called a perfect movie. He would care less what I think as long as I shelled out the money to go see it, although I did cheat and went matinée. I asked my son on his birthday LAST YEAR if there was a movie he wanted to go see. He replied,"Deadpool", which was 4 months later. I am not a geek or a comic book man and most of my Super Hero knowledge comes from TV and movies. Obviously, I had no idea who Deadpool was. I decided to let the movie introduce me to him and whatever my son was telling. Deadpool is a favorite of his. He would rate the movie at 8.5.Fittingly enough,it has B movie feel, but the CGI is top rate. It is easily the perfect format for Deadpool. BTW - don't be late, the opening credits set the tone for the entire movie and perhaps all you need to know about the movie. Everybody is so afraid that Ryan Reynolds would ruin Deadpool like he ruined Green Lantern or like everyone was afraid that Jack Black would ruin King Kong, but as I understand it, Ryan inserted himself into the creative writing process, which made the words his words. Like a song a singer writes, it is always better and Ryan Reynolds was awesome. Morena Baccarin is perfectly in sync with Ryan in a love and romance for the ageless and immature. Her training in Firefly/Serenity as a high price "escort" with Nathan Fillion as love interest was very helpful. Ed Skrein is great as the bad guy. This maybe the only drawback. I imagine that it is Dead Pool's style to focus on the problem in front and not go for the bigger boss or the money behind the bad guy. Of course, that is probably in Dead Pool 2.Like I said in the beginning somewhere, they did no wrong, which is helpful when you are telling a lot of jokes. All of them hit at the right time with the right tenor/tone, which is really difficult to keep it fresh and keep it from being a one joke movie, especially when all the material is irreverent.My recommendation is if you want to see a Super Anti-Hero Action Comedy movie, where most of the jokes were created by the cartoonists of Playboy, Penthouse, High Society and so far way down the sewer and approved by Drunk Frat Boys who whose humor never grew age 12(redundant, I know), then you should sell everything you have and sprint to the best theater near you and plan to live there until Deadpool hit Blue Ray.BTW ? I called the ending at the end of the credits. On the way, I told my son that what I want to see is (not going to be a spoiler sport) and they did it. My son thinks I am a Super Hero now and true he thinks I am like Gleek from the Wonder Twins than Thor, but I will take it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing, but with very low ambitions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not aware over how popular this movie was before I went to see it, and I usually do not like being the dissenting opinion on films like these. But I really did not like Deadpool. While it might seem daring for movie studios to make an R-rated superhero movie that doesn't take anything serious, it ends up being completely uninspiring. Pleasing the teenage "meme-generation" is easy, and basing a movie around their mentality is the same as going for the lowest common denominator - only here it is within this target audience. I have heard people calling this movie "intelligent" because it does not feel it has to explain anything to the audience. I would argue that is not the case. This movie is targeted at such a specific (but large) audience that it can easily skip explaining a lot. I'm not saying the movie would have been better if it did, but rather that it does not make for a clever movie.The non-caring attitude of the movie is not a flaw by itself, but rather the fact that this seem to be the only sort of ambition the movie has (in addition to trying to be an entertaining movie, which it obviously succeeded in, based in the general consensus). But the over the top action, the juvenile humor and the constant references to popular culture mostly ends up being lazy and cheap. There are some good gags, and even some great ones, but they drown in the rest of it. I do like that it makes fun of the superhero genre, and that it is not afraid to completely abolish the fourth wall - but it does it while still making the same mistakes other superhero movies are making, which kind of invalidates the points it might(?) be trying to make. As I seem to be in the minority here, I am open to giving it another chance - but most likely it's just not a movie for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie We Have Been Waiting For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie all Deadpool fans have been waiting for. Crude, rude, and anything but subdued, Deadpool at times plays too much like fan service than a movie, but what better character to finally get his moment in the spotlight.Everyone, behind and in front of the camera, did a phenomenal job bringing the merc with a mouth to life. Tim Miller did a great job with Deadpool's origin, and the way it is handled is brilliant. Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. He is perfect in the role, no one else could possibly play Deadpool. The cast around him is great as well, with Morena Baccarin playing a very believable love interest and T.J. Miller supplying some nice back-and-forth scenes. Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead are also great additions, and I hope more X-Men characters interact with Deadpool in the future.As far as pure entertainment goes, this is as good as it can get. 90% of the jokes hit, and the ones that don't were in the trailer. The humor is raunchy and juvenile, working perfectly with the awesome action scenes. There are countless bad ass moments in this film, and the R rating allows them to have these moments. They don't abuse the R rating, but it serves it's purpose.The only "flaw" I have with this film is at times it kind of gets lost in its fan service. There are a few scenes that are definitely funny, but serve no purpose but to please fans of the comics. I still enjoyed the moments as a fan of the character, and I get why they did it was to make sure hardcore Deadpool fans were satisfied after the long wait for their character to hit the big screen.Overall, Deadpool gives its character the movie he deserves. It's consistently hilarious, and the action scenes will leave you with plenty to discuss with your buddies. It's more fan service than a complete film, but I am definitely OK with that.</fullReview>

There is a brief scene of sex and nudity, a few swear words but nothing too serious. Its got lots of killing but even more jokes. And jokes that work on every level. If the Martian can win a comedy award, this should take every award at the next Golden Globes and Oscars by miles. There is an after-credit scene, and its worth sticking around for. From the hilarious opening credits, to the references to both X-Men and Avengers films, its perfect. Colossus is finally given some okay CGI and actual has a decent role in the story. Its nice to see his character used properly for once. The girl has her uses, but is best used to bounce jokes off, just like the villains. But its ll good.

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is low &amp; dirty &amp; full of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who knew when Wade Wilson first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1991, created by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld as an answer to DC Comics' character Slade Wilson, that his wise- cracking antics would become media gold. Deadpool, the new movie based on the character, solidifies the Marvel anti-hero as a big hitter and a money maker, able to stand on his own. That may not be so surprising with such a long-time fan base eagerly waiting for any and every fourth wall the character will break. What is surprising is that along with all the quips and punches that are expected of Deadpool, his movie brings actual weight and story that grounds the craziness.Deadpool is debauchery. The film rides low and dirty on filthy humor and over the top fights, guns a-blasting and swords at the ready. It cashes in on just about every stereotype that comes with the machismo action genre, but pokes fun at it and at itself. More than that, it oddly turns much of it on its head in various circumstances. Everyone, including Deadpool himself, is a sex object here, and rightfully so. This is a very sexy movie. At the same time, all of the major women of the movie hold more than their own strength, in their own way. These are nice rules to break.While the film is unrelenting in its one-liners, puns and references to pop culture, most of which are spot on and hilarious, there is actually a lot of heart here. The story has a depth that is shocking, and the editing helps to balance that flow in and out of the sane and the loony. It somehow is a cathartic film, not only getting out all that naughtiness and aggression, but also finding ways to connect its characters through heart, love, trust and companionship. So that's why it was released Valentine's Day weekend! It's even a great date movie.Deadpool is a sweetheart, and the role that Ryan Reynolds was born to play. For as silly as it is, Reynolds takes the character seriously, able to deliver the most absurd jokes and the most ridiculous lines of dialogue with complete feeling and gravity. He also shows the most range that I believe I've ever seen him do. This is a flamboyant and spastic character, which is hard enough to make believable and not campy on its own, but to have to run through everything that this film's plot throws at you on top of that is a feat. Reynolds has really found a great performance in the Merc with a Mouth.You come to a movie like Deadpool for the comedy and action, but you get swept up in the love, the horror and the drama, ending up with quite a well rounded flick. In fact, it's one of the heftiest superhero origin stories told on film in recent years. This is a dessert with something for everyone to enjoy, including nuts and a great big banana, topped off with cherry popping childishness. But please, do not bring your children to see this movie. It's a great date movie, remember, but for perverted, consenting adults, like us!</fullReview>

Date movie, sure (if she likes that kinda of thing), family movie/kids movie... not so much. Deadpool will make waves in this industry with it being a lower budget comic book movie that was a hit in my eyes. With a lot of promise for future movies, 20th Century fox, just might have redeemed its self from the fantastic four.....Well maybe not, but this was definitely a step in the right direction.</fullReview>

My bad.The target audience for this film appears to be teenagers and young adults who were raised on the values that foul language is funny, even when it is not, and any violence in films is entertaining, even when it is not.In other words, young adults who have lost the ability to discern.Actually (if you are still reading this review and have not pounded the NOT USEFUL button into oblivion) there are parts of the film (notably the romantic arc) which almost maybe just-for-a-moment resonate with the viewer. But then the moment passes, and the force-feeding of the allegedly funny dialog starts all over.Feel really sorry for parents who accidentally take toddlers to this thinking hey, it is a comic book movie, what can possibly go wrong?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marvel film like no other. An astounding achievement in humor and action!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They said it couldn't be done. They said "Deadpool" will never be made and I, as well as others, almost agreed. After his abysmal performance in X-crement Origins: Wimperine, the potential of The Merc With A Mouth, was almost terminated without fanfare. Good ol Wade Wilson just couldn't get a break.Well, after so many trials and tribulations, Deadpool was finally given the green light and lo and behold, he bursts out of the comics and onto the silver screen with spectacular results so vulgar, so violent, so crude, yet so refreshingly simple, that it set the bar for R-rated comic book movies; quite possible for years to come. This film proved that violent superheroes...actually...make that anti-heroes can be immensely profitable; judging be the film's juggernaut box-office success. As an origin story, Deadpool is great, showing us a side to the Merc With A Mouth with a violent, vulgar side to the character, but also surprisingly, with human depth; something Origins failed to achieve. Character development and human pathos combine to make a troubled and flawed jerk with a heart of gold, a very likable and relate-table jerk with a heart of gold.Yes, the action is bloody, yet great with slo-mo effects and yes the humor is vulgar and narcissistic, but it fits the character very well. But most importantly, is the acting and Ryan Reynolds NAILS it perfectly. I can think of no other actor that is much suited for the role and he is simply perfect; with his manic personality and spot on wisecracks. The film simply wouldn't work without a hard R rating. Thankfully, the studio let the filmmakers run wild in high octane adventure and explosive gravitas.Props to all involved in Deadpool. It's smart, stylish, and refreshingly original. I'm glad they had the balls to make a R-rated Marvel comic book movie and they achieved it. One of the best films of the year and I can't wait for the inevitable sequel. A second and third viewing is definitely not out of the question. Great film, great cast, great direction. Simply put. Great R-rated comic book movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of comic book hero movies. When I saw Avengers: Age of Ultron last year in downtown LA, I fell asleep half-way through. The thing is that these movies are all pretty much the same film, made from exactly the same mold. Same story, same characters, same plot devices, etc. That in itself is not a major crime, it shouldn't keep a movie from being entertaining. The original The Avengers is still a favorite of mine, with all of its sharpness and spectacular action set pieces. Anyway, that's where I'm coming from.I saw Deadpool today and it really is a mess. It's a comedy film and while it does have a few funny scenes, most jokes fall flat. This is a movie that does not take itself too seriously, a movie that acknowledges the silliness of the genre, but does not have the quality jokes to make that cynicism stand. The story, the least interesting part of this mess of a whole, is typical comic book hero stuff. The action set pieces are weak too. This is not great film making at all. Not even for a silly big budget spoof. Remember, silly spoofs can be intelligent and fun to watch too, Mel Brooks proved that decades ago. And yeah, Kick-Ass was much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Slump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, Fox and Marvel are going to need a little more than strippers and Ryan Reynolds to get out of their slump. I understand this movie is an acquired taste, but I feel as if it was missing a good story. I will admit the comedy did make me grin at some points, but did seem a bit inane for most of the movie. If you're going to do a comedy film, make the jokes witty and clever rather than just having the lead actor cuss every 2 seconds. I honestly thought T.J. Miller's minor role as Weasel was funnier than all of Dead Pool's one-liners combined. I also felt the story jumped around too much. Yes, I understand the beginning of the movie mostly consisted of flashbacks, but when they returned to the main storyline I almost forgot what all had previously happened. The writers wasted a lot of time and ended up focusing more on making the movie "funny" than making the movie worthy of a sequel. I do really hope that Fox and Marvel will improve in their upcoming ventures, but for right now they need to focus on writing a good story. Making the main protagonist indestructible without any weakness kind of eliminates the drama a little bit. *Cough cough*?Man of Steel. Once again, I really do hope that Fox and Marvel can get back to telling the great stories that they were meant to tell instead of just making every comic book they've ever written into a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie was one of the best comic book adaptations that I've seen in years. I'm a huge comic book geek, and I have to say, there's no possible way they could've made this movie any better! It's violent, funny, and action-packed! That's everything people would expect from a Deadpool movie. I loved the fourth-wall breaks and the comic relief that was provided by Deadpool. I loved Colossus in this movie, not only was he really cool looking, but he was very funny in many scenes. This movie was practically flawless, but I do have one complaint: it wasn't long enough. It wasn't even two hours long and that's pretty unusual for a major comic book movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, funny, foul mouthed, and plenty of sex jokes. There's something you don't see in a lot of superhero movies as Deadpool is brought to life on the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest I had never heard of Deadpool before. I briefly was introduced to his character in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and save a lot of internet rumours that Deadpool was going to be made into a movie. Finally we can fast forward to 2016 and Team Marvel brings the titular Deadpool to the big screen with Ryan Reynolds anointed as the character. I was expecting it to be another superhero movie watered down to attract a wide audience, however upon viewing the red band trailer on YouTube, I found myself excited at the prospect that Deadpool was not going to pander to family friendly audiences. There's plenty of graphic violence, profanity, a strong sex scene, and plenty of sex jokes which is certainly not something I was expecting to see. Deadpool kicks all goals as a funny and exciting movie.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a former special forces operative turned mercenary who spends his time protecting teenage girls from stalkers. Upon meeting Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), his life starts to look very bright until he collapses one night and is later diagnosed with terminal cancer. In fear of losing Vanessa, Wade starts to explore alternatives for a cure until he meets a mysterious recruiter (Jed Rees) who offers Wade to join his organisation as well as enticing him with a cure for his cancer. Wade reluctantly accepts but later finds himself horrifically mutated at the hands of Ajax aka Francis Freeman (Ed Skrein) and Angel Dust (Gina Carano) and later left for dead. Upon his advice from his friend Weasel (T.J. Miller) Wade Wilson adopts his new identity as masked vigilante Deadpool and swears vengeance upon Ajax and his organisation. Along the way the X-Men Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) join Deadpool in bringing down Ajax.Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. The comical timing, everything is just perfect. The rest of the cast also support the movie well but the focus is more on the hilarious jokes and breaking of the fourth wall. Even during the opening credits Deadpool was never going to take itself seriously and it does so with style. In what could have easily just been an action-packed adventure turns out to be an adult humoured action comedy with perfectly placed comical moments throughout the movie that did not look out of place one slight bit. The soundtrack also has taken a cue from Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and has added some old gems from the past in the movie along with composer Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL (Max Max: Fury Road) ensuring the film is kept at an crackling, energetic pace. Director Tim Miller has done a superb job bringing Deadpool to life.There have been warnings that Deadpool is certainly not a movie for very young children and I highly concur. It is strongly recommended that parents use their discretion when letting their children watch this movie. The easily offended won't like Deadpool anyway. It's only February and Deadpool deserves to be one of the biggest movies of 2016. There's plenty of more movies to be released this year but without a doubt Deadpool deserves to be one of the biggest movies of 2016.Think of Deadpool as having your favourite dessert and you're finding yourself in a dilemma when you ask yourself it is healthy or is it bad for you? It doesn't really matter, you just can't resist it and that's what exactly what Deadpool feels like when you watch it. It's violent, foul mouthed, and lots of sex jokes but you just can't help but like it. Don't take Deadpool seriously and just sit back and have an awesome time. There's never a dull moment throughout the movie.I'm looking forward to seeing Deadpool return with a sequel but until then, I'll be re-watching this movie once it is released on Blu-ray and DVD.Stay tuned until the end of the credits for a surprise post-credits scene. Ensure you don't leave early.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best comic book movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My most anticipated movie of the year, I went nuts for it, I had a hard time sleeping because I was too excited.So was all the excitement and marketing worth it? Yes, yes, yes, it's so great, I had so much fun, this movie will be for everyone and has you entertained from start to finish. Wait, not everyone, because it's a hard R. Seriously, anyone under the age of 17 should not by any means see this because it's very violent, has bad language, graphic nudity, drugs, has some "love" scenes and has a lot of overall jokes that kids won't understand.For the ones who don't know who Deadpool is, he is someone from the X-men universe which is made by the comic book company Marvel. If right now you're thinking "so it's a superhero movie and I don't like those" don't worry, it makes fun of superhero movies a lot.The story is about a man called Wade Wilson who is a mercenary that get's diagnosed with cancer one day. The only way he can survive is to make him a mutant so that his body can fight the cancer. So when he does become Deadpool he appears to have made an enemy that goes after his girlfriend.That's what you need to know about the movie, now everything that is awesome about this movie. First off the genre, it is everything, seriously it has aspects from every genre. It has a love story that actually makes a lot of sense so it has romance. It also is a superhero movie because it involves the X-men but it also makes fun of all the superhero movies.So it is also a satire, but not only a satire on superhero movies but also on pop-culture today and on movies in general. It's also definitely a comedy, I laughed so hard during this movie that I had issues catching my breath for laughing uncontrollably. The jokes are varying and everything in it is so funny.It also of course is an action movie because the action in it is very good and very violent and this movie definitely couldn't be done without an R-rating. It also has some horror things in it, when Wade is made into Deadpool it's actually horrifying.Then I will say that every actor portraying a character in the movie works perfectly, Ryan Reynolds is born to be Deadpool. He was exactly what the character of Deadpool should be: A kid in a man's body that breaks the 4th wall and has fun throughout the entire movie.Also his girlfriend works perfectly and their relation is totally weird but believable. The villain Ajax, played by Ed Skrein, is a very good villain and you understand why Deadpool wants to get him. And in my personal opinion, this is by far the best portrayal of Colossus in a movie to date. Then we have TJ Miller as the best friend of Wade who is hilarious and even the taxi-driver Dopinder who they also managed to make funny.I have one single issue with the movie and that's that it is too short. The movie was so brilliantly put together that when they got to the 3rd act of the movie I thought: "it's almost over but I don't want it to". Luckily there has already been an announcement for a sequel, so I'm happy. Also if you haven't seen it yet, stay in the theater to the end of the credits because there is a great end-credit scene.Deadpool is the most entertaining experience in a movie theater I had in a very long time and it's a brilliant movie, go see it if you haven't already. Definitely a 10/10 which is my 10th actual 10/10 I ever gave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, you read that right... Hi, I'm Review Pool, and want to give the casual Marvel enthusiast or the curious party wanting to see this movie the skinny. Here's the thing, and forgive me for being so blunt, but if you do not know this character, you will not understand this movie. You probably won't like it. It'll confuse you more than how the Kardashians are still famous. More than how the 'Real Housewives' are still a thing, and even more than how the Danish word for 'poop' (bae) became an endearing term for your boo. But I digress... Yes, this movie was created for the fans. The 4th wall breaking, wise-cracking, ultra-violent, and gratuitous dirty mind that makes up this character is completely embodied throughout this film. That being said, do not take your kids! If they are under the age of sixteen and haven't been exposed to the internet, or the characteristics previously mentioned, you will have CPS called on you. Doesn't matter how much they whine, how much they beg, do not EVER, EVER, feed them after midnight...oh wait... This movie takes a lot of elements through Deadpool's comic history, and blends them I together as best as a 1hr and 40 min movie could. Even for a fan of the character since '92, can appreciate the things that were overlooked and condensed for the sake that it graced the big screen at all. I enjoyed the elements from some of the smaller issue Deadpool comics that were thrown in there (Pizza boy scene, thank you RR, I recognized it immediately). Yes, it was raunchy. Yes, it was violent. Yes, it was full of f-bombs! But that's what makes this character so wonderful, is that it doesn't stick to the traditional do-gooder rhetoric. And fans will not be disappointed with the Stan Lee cameo...pay attention to everything in this movie, including the opening credits. And don't forget to stay through the ending credits...</fullReview>

The only catch is that he becomes disfigured from head to toe."Deadpool" is really funny because it makes fun of himself and of all superhero films. It is almost like a parody of superhero films, but in a good way. The jokes are super funny, I loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house. The 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions. When the film ended, people even clapped, which is the first time I see it happening in Hong Kong. People loved it loads! And the after credit scenes made people shout with excitement. When people exited the cinema, it was almost like everyone was under the effect of laughing gas!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the studio that inexplicably sewed his *beep* mouth shut the first time, comes Deadpool. Yeah Deadpool, that sounds like a *beep* franchise. Absolutely amazing movie by Marvel. Now I can say that I forgive Marvel for messing Avengers 2. Deadpool is the first "R- Rated" movie that I have ever seen in cinema and I enjoyed every second of it, thanks to the censor board that they didn't ban it in our country otherwise my weekend would've been ruined if I hadn't got to watch Deadpool. Deadpool is not a typical superhero movie, so even if you don't like to watch superhero movies, you will love Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds was a perfect choice for Deadpool who did a fantastic job in his role and the script was very original, funny and well written. It has multiple elements including action, comedy, romance and most of all emotions. Moreover, this is not just a superhero movie, this is a love story that's why it's being released on Valentine's day. So, go on see it, enjoy it and have a laugh later. Especially for single people who do not have any date on V's day, Deadpool is the best gift that they will ever get *haha*. No doubt it is and will be one of the best movies ever produced by Marvel along with The Avengers. I'd recommend this movie for everyone who is allowed to watch it in their jurisdiction. Have a great weekend!</fullReview>

Doesn't even make sense.One last thing, the Stan Lee cameo was OK-OK. I don't know why people are saying it is the best cameo but I have seen better Stan Lee cameo.

		<shortDescription>as far as comic book movies go.. perfection!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2008 (or 2009, who cares?) We got our first glimpse of Deadpool on the big screen. What we got took away everything decent about the character, he is the merc with the mouth, yet his mouth was sewn together! Ryan Reynolds seemed perfect for the role, how did it all go so wrong? Well now, in 2016 Reynolds returns and we get our first official Deadpool movie. In that we get the world's greatest apology for one of the most abysmal films in the superhero genre, and a highly original film that does 100% justice to one of the most lovable douchebags of all time!So, here we follow Wade Wilson, a former mercenary who is diagnosed with terminal cancer. He undergoes an experimental procedure and is transformed into Deadpool, a badass loudmouth with the ability to heal. One problem remains, he is now ugly as sin. We follow Deadpool on a revenge story, as well as a love story of sorts that really raises the bar for future comic book movies. What i absolutely love about this film is that the whole origin is told through flashbacks looking over Wade's life. Deadpool is a character who is well known for breaking the fourth wall and the way that is addressed in this film is both hilarious and amazingly true to it's source. It is also easily one of the funniest films for a very long time. The opening titles had me laughing out loud alone and if they don't peak your interest right away then I'm afraid you're in the wrong film! I love self aware jokes like that and there are a fair few of them scattered around. The supporting cast do amazingly well as well. Colossus and Negasonic TeenageWarhead from the Xmen are just the greatest additions to this film. This is easily the best incarnation of Colossus we have ever seen and with such a low budget he looked beautiful. Of course, with them on board there are some very funny Xmen jokes to look out for. Morenna Baccarin (did i spell that right?) Is the perfect love interest for Ryan Reynolds. Her character is a lot better than other 2-Dimensional females in comic book films. When she is introduced and the way that happens shows how much of an impact she makes and it is great. As for villains, Ed Skerin was so unlikeable, which is great because with a character like Deadpool it is important to hate our main villain and the inclusion of Angel Dust was also a good decision. And lastly, TJ Miller acts almost as Wade's second in command, Weasel. He stole quite a few scenes, but in the end this is Ryan Reynold's show and nobody tries to take that from him.So do i recommend? Hell yeah i do! Its the perfect comic book film for the fact it really sticks to it's awesome source material and i could not imagine a better film for Deadpool. Stick around for after the credits because we get a great little surprise. Definitely not for the faint of heart because as well as being very violent in an over the top way, there are also some pretty dark and shocking scenes that can even be a little hard to watch, but they don't last long. Anyway, go and support Deadpool because we need more superhero films like this. Now i have the sudden urge to listen to 80's music and eat chimi changas...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is a perfectly serviceable superhero film that collapses into a puddle of mediocrity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a Perfectly Serviceable Superhero Film"Deadpool" tries hard to be unique with its clever voice-overs and dialogue, its flash backs and foreshadowing. But the harder it tries to be different, the more it is the same. There are damsels in distress, a revenge tale, a face off between the damaged superhero and the deranged supervillain and on and on. They even tell you in the credits about all the typical elements of a superhero movie that will be present. The credits are, to their credit, very funny. There is an origin story that is quite interesting, but there is also the too long courting ritual and the overly long bar scene (what the hell, directors, bars aren't that interesting!) showing us where the hero gets his name. While the romantic coupling in the film is extremely unlikely and it is a boring plot device that takes us away from the real action. The fight scene at the beginning of the film is very entertaining and well choreographed; however, they seemed to have run out of ideas by the time of the great, and predictable, final showdown. I know it is hard to come up with new ideas for a superhero movie, and "Deadpool" does a fairly good job of presenting a different kind of tale. However, the film gets a case of the "box office flu" and puts in a lot of standard and unfortunately predictable elements in the film. Sure, Deadpool's origin story is well done if not original. And his living situation is unique, to say the least. But the romance falls flat and is out of place. The times when the movie is more entertaining is during the conflict with the cruel villain, "Francis" and during the development of Deadpool's powers. The bar scene is too long, the sex scene it superfluous and not clever, and much of the film is filler for the action scenes. Perhaps I have seen too many superhero films and I am too critical to sit through them and accept the genre's failings. Dead Pool gives me little hope that this will change. The film looks okay, but after the original fight scene, its visuals are nothing spectacular. The acting is average, at best, and Morena Baccarin seems out of place in many of the scenes. She's not sure how to play the role of the victim or how to be overly sexual and in love. To be fair, she's not known for nuance and her role is terribly written. The writing in general is too clever by five-eighths; it's dull and after a while, tiresome. The film's humour and sentimentality don't mix well at all. In fact, the film is best and most powerful when it eschews sentimentality. If the film had ended after thirty minutes, I would have given it high marks. However, it collapsed into a puddle of mediocrity. This does not bode well for the upcoming, supposedly genre bending superhero film, "Suicide Squad." A better version of the "Deadpool" would have had the 'hero' in a cab all day going from one villain's hideout to the next and causing a ruckus. Ratings: MatinéeThere are clever bits interspersed in the film like a sketch comedy show, and that kept me entertained for some the show. If you really like this genre, then by all means, see "Deadpool." If you don't enjoy superhero films, there is nothing in this film to change that. Stan Lee's cameo is a bonus, however.

		<shortDescription>Wild, irreverently funny and unique. Don't miss "Deadpool"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a movie's very first scene perfectly sets the tone ? and serves notice that you're about to have a unique cinematic experience. Allow me to illustrate by describing the opening sequence to the big-screen adaptation of Marvel Comics' "Deadpool" (R, 1:48). We see a single moment frozen in time ? the inside of an SUV as it flips over on a busy highway. In slow motion, the camera travels through the vehicle documenting the precarious (and humorous) positions of various bad guys who have gone airborne because of the crash. As we journey through this increasingly bizarre montage, the only sound we hear is Juice Newton's 1981 hit song "Angel of the Morning". We also see the movie's opening credits ? not names, but tongue-in-cheek references to the actors and filmmakers, employing phrases like "The British Villain", "The Comic Relief" and "Overpaid Hack". Wild. Irreverently funny. Unique.Before he was the violent, wise-cracking anti-superhero Deadpool, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) was just a violent, wise-cracking neighborhood tough guy for hire. (He's the kind of person you'd go to if you wanted to intimidate someone else into doing something for you ? or just leave you alone.) Wade seems to have only one friend, a bartender called Weasel (T.J. Miller) until Wade meets hooker/waitress Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). They each have an acerbic wit, an irreverent personality and a messy life. In other words, they're perfect together. They fall in love, start living together and even discuss marriage. It seems like they're each as happy as they've ever been before until the other shoe drops. Wade suddenly falls ill and is diagnosed with cancer, which has taken hold in different parts of his body.A mysterious "recruiter" meets Wade at Weasel's bar and tells Wade that he can cure that cancer ? and make him better than he was before. With no other options, Wade enters a secretive and ominous-looking facility where he is subjected to torturous pseudo-medical treatments designed to force his body to mutate. Wade emerges cancer-free, and with impressive strength and athletic abilities, as well as the ability to rapidly self-heal, but also with a face which Weasel says looks like "a topographical map of Utah" among other things. To hide his disfigurement, Wade makes himself a red and black suit and mask and adopts the name Deadpool, after the dead pool that Weasel runs for the patrons at his bar.Deadpool may look and move like a superhero, but the man behind the mask rejects that label. He's an anti-hero on a mission. Deadpool is out to find Ajax (Ed Skrein), the man who, along with his assistant, Angel Dust (Gina Carano), ruined Wade's good looks ? and force Ajax to fix what he messed up. With a decidedly anti-superhero attitude, Deadpool (gruesomely) kills anyone who comes after him and tries to stop him. Two other mutants (a large metallic man and a teenager who can release powerful bursts of energy from her body) try to get Deadpool to join them and their fellow X-Men. No dice. Deadpool is a solo act ? only interested in getting his complexion fixed so he can reunite with Vanessa and (besides Weasel) only associating with his old lady roommate, Blind Al (Leslie Uggams)."Deadpool" is not your father's superhero movie (or your son's, for that matter). As much as we all enjoy a good superhero flick, the whole R-rated anti-hero/superhero thing is a refreshing change of pace. The script (by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick) is witty, hilariously self-referential, and the conceit of Deadpool breaking the fourth wall works surprisingly well. Under the guidance of visual effects guy ? turned director (FIRST TIME feature director - !) Tim Miller, we get some great action sequences and visuals (despite the production's incredible shrinking budget), a story that's fairly simple and easy to follow (despite its non-linear presentation) and a main character that's faithful to the source material.Although you may have your doubts just reading through the list of actors in this film, it's actually perfectly cast. Skrein and Carano make a great villain and henchman (henchwoman), respectively, Miller is a terrific weasley friend, it's wonderful to see Uggams back on screen (especially since I kinda thought she had died) and Brianna Hildebrand (as Negasonic Teenage Warhead) as well as Stefan Kapi&#x10d;i&#x107; / Andre Tricoteux / Greg LaSalle (who, respectively, provided the voice, body motion-capture performance and facial motion-capture performance for Colossus) brought a lot to their mutant roles and left me wanting more. Maybe most surprising of all, Baccarin made me forget her many famous well-dressed small-screen characters, like the stressed-out former POW's wife in "Homeland" and the devious otherworldly leader, Anna, in "V". Then, of course, there's our star. Reynolds plays his character like a combination of Bill Murray (in "Ghostbusters" or "Groundhog Day"), Daniel Craig (in "Casino Royale") and Bruce Willis (not as the incredulous superhero in "Unbreakable", but more like his heroic but mortal somewhat heroic anti-heroes in "Die Hard" and "Hudson Hawk"). That all may sound like kind of a mess, but the sensibilities of those characters joined with Reynold's natural charm make for a winning combination.But don't just take my word for it. Let the data be your guide. This film started breaking box office records (albeit very specific and obscure records) as early as its Thursday night previews and Friday opening day. Still not convinced? Here's an idea ? see the movie! Even if you don't like it, at least you'll know what everyone else is talking about. You'll also be ready if you get dragged to the sequel, which Reynolds/Deadpool announces in a post-credits scene. Of course, no one can guarantee you'll like "Deadpool". After all, it's "only" a superhero flick and it isn't exactly Oscar material, but I, for one, can't remember the last time I had so much fun at a movie. And, after all, isn't that the point?

		<fullReview>Deadpool is directed by Tim Miller and stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller and Ed Skrein.Finally, after 11 years of kissing the 'behinds' of 20th Century Fox, and the 'private area' of Wolverine, Reynolds' Deadpool has landed, hard. Which is a bit impractical on the knees. (Yes, that was a reference.) But nevertheless, completely and utterly brilliant. This is Tim Miller's directional debut and an incredible one at that. The pacing is quick and sharp, the screenplay by Rhett Reese &amp; Paul Wernick is fantastic, the explicitly violent and gory sequences are, well, gory, and the on-screen chemistry between characters and we, us... the audience, is genius. Breaking multiple fourth walls and walls within walls, Reynolds has given us the 'Merc with a mouth' we all deserve. This is an origin story, but it realises this and drifts completely from the usual formula or story arc used in superhero movies. Instead it kicks off with Wade Wilson as Deadpool, in a taxi, with a mission. To find the guy that messed him up. Then, as the film progresses, Deadpool tells us how he became who he is. It's very unique, and it's one of the things I really appreciated about this film.The original music score by Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL is perfect. The synthesisers incorporated fit the character of Deadpool with absolute ease. It's not used to extremes, but you notice its presence. More notably, the soundtrack is brilliant. It has some classic tracks intertwined into the story, reminiscent of Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy back in 2014. This just adds to the chaos of Deadpool on his road of rampage, quite literally.The visual effects and set designs are substantial, I felt the main CG characters were nicely handled, and rendered into the surroundings really well. But I felt a lot of the overall CG versions of set pieces could have been worked on a little more, just to smoothen it out. The opening credits are perfect. Very fun, unique and amusing. The animation is spot-on.I really had a lot of fun with this film, and I believe it's the best Marvel has offered, period. Everyone involved has done a terrific job bringing the beloved Deadpool to life, and it has paid off big time. Bring on the (now confirmed) sequel!One more thing I'd like to praise is the editing. I feel with a lot of action films these days, there are way too many sharp cuts that pull you from what's happening. Editor Julian Clarke has handled this outstandingly, with longer shots so you can really focus on everything that's progressing on-screen. This is a good thing, but I really wish the overall cut was longer. Maybe they'll be a special cut for the home release.You're probably wondering if there's the usual 'Marvel post-credits scene' and of course, there is. It's a little different, as you'd expect from Deadpool, but it's just as brilliant as the film itself. You have to wait until the very end of the credit roll to see it, so sit tight. It's worth it. Also, there is a Stan Lee cameo, and it's hilariously planned. My verdict; Deadpool is now my favourite on-screen Marvel character, taking over from Ant-Man. I believe Reynolds and Miller will have pleased the many fans that have been wishing this day would come... Come? (Oh, you're naughty.)Deadpool, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreverent, twisted comic book hero (or antihero): check. Self- deprecating humor with references to actors&nbsp;and other movies: check. Action-packed scenes filled with blood-splattered violence: check. Ryan Reynolds at his wisecracking best: check.&nbsp;Gratuitous nudity with Marvel comic book writer Stan Lee as the strip club MC: check. Booming sound effects and amazing visual effects that make this a movie to be seen on the big screen: check. Customary comic book movie after credits scene: check. Unconventional comic book movie that is bound to annoy and frustrate&nbsp;tame, unadventurous viewers: check.&nbsp;Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a&nbsp;former Special Forces operative turned mercenary who protects women from would-be stalkers. One night he meets female escort Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) in a strip club and they become romantically involved for about one year. His life is shattered when he discovers that he has multiple organ cancer. He&nbsp;undergoes an experimental procedure to cure his cancer but the serum injected by Francis aka Ajax (Ed Skrein) proves to be torturous and life changing, leaving him with special healing powers and a disfigured face. Not wanting to upset Vanessa, Wade leaves her and lives with a blind woman named Al (Leslie Uggams). With the help of X- Men&nbsp;Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) and&nbsp;Colossus (voice of&nbsp;Stefan Kapicic), the masked vigilante Deadpool as he is now known, seeks revenge and will stop at nothing to acquire a cure for his disfigurement.The opening credits such as 'Directed by an overpaid tool"&nbsp;played over the song "Angel of the Morning" by Juice Newton are a precursor for the unconventional comic book antics to come. There's flashbacks, flashbacks within flashbacks, the protagonist talking to the camera,&nbsp;raunchy sex scenes, nudity, excessive profanity and extreme violence including severed body parts, all features that you don't expect from a comic book superhero.&nbsp;People expecting the 'normal' movie based on a comic book will be disappointed. Let yourself go and you're going to have some fun.Ryan Reynolds makes up for the atrocities of his previous portrayal of a comic book character in The Green Lantern. He's in excellent form here, showcasing his comedic talents which even include poking fun at himself. He lives and breathes the part of Deadpool and is sure to please fans of this 'superhero'. The in-jokes involving the X-Men characters are just one of the many highlights of the unorthodox comedy strategy employed by the writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wenick. Credit must also go to the director. This is Tim Miller's first feature length film. He is better known as a visual effects artist and it's evident in his direction how much he knows about this field. Even the CGI creation in Colossus is a character you have to admire.&nbsp;Ryan Reynolds gets most of the best lines. The other human characters are adequate more than exceptional. They are merely pawns to Ryan Reynold's King. There are a few flat moments when the over- the-top humor doesn't always work and the violence becomes gratuitous. And of course&nbsp;if you're a prude, you won't be feeling comfortable during some of the scenes.This is unlike any superhero movie seen before. It's definitely not for the faint-hearted and those who are easily offended. It's a fresh take on the comic book movie genre, breathing life and vigor, and most importantly, making up for the disappointment of the previous Marvel movie in "Fantastic Four". http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anarchic and hilarious: Introducing Mr Pool, Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How the hell do you review a film like Deadpool? It's almost in a category of its own.Ryan Reynolds is no stranger to superhero pics: he played the disappointingly limp "Green Lantern" in 2011 and before that he played this character - Wade Wilson - in "Wolverine: Origins" with Hugh Jackman (who is the butt of one of the many in-jokes in this film). Reynolds, as heir to Bradley Cooper as the pretty boy of Hollywood, has never really found a break-out role but here, hiding behind a face that looks like "an avocado had sex with another, older, avocado", he achieves true stardom: a franchise that looks like it could run and run. And he is very good in it too.In this 'origins' story, told partially in flashback, Wade Wilson, a fairly unpleasant mercenary bad guy "who gets paid to f*** over worse guys", has some bad news from his doctor. He tries to do the honorable thing by up and leaving tart-with-a-heart Morena Baccarin (Brody's wife from the first series of "Homeland") to go in search of a way forward. The superhero cure is offered by semi-super Ajax (Ed Skrein) but comes at a price (cue the guacamole) making it difficult for him to return to his lover. (Erm, so not a great morale boosting story for any burn-victims then?) Let's start with the script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick - two of the guys behind the highly entertaining and anarchic "Zombieland". "Deadpool" sticks its tongue firmly in its cheek from the spectacular opening titles (the Director is described as an "overpaid tool") and the script bounces from great comic line to great comic line almost without a pause. As an example, Ryan says he wants to live until 103 and then die... "just like Detroit". LOL.Stan Lee cameos aside, some of the Marvel films can be quite po-faced and serious but this one comes from the more comic "Ant-Man" end of the stables. In general the script is highly disrespectful of the Marvel world it inhabits, with shots being fired at various sacred lambs, particularly the X-Men. As such, I'm not quite sure how some of the true fan-boys, (those who wear spandex under their day clothes), might react to this. The film makers are pissing on their 'reality' - albeit with love - from a great height here! In mood it is like the bastard child of a genetic experiment combining the genes of Spider-man, X-Men, Kick-Ass and Kingsman. As a viewing guide, if you really didn't care for the anarchic and violence-laced humour of these last two films then in all probability you really won't like Deadpool.I personally thought it was great fun, and a blast from beginning to post-credit end. The movie breaks the fourth wall shamelessly - something I often hate in a film - but gets away with it and even has the kahunas to have Reynolds address the fourth wall by making a joke about breaking the fourth wall! Audacious! However, my positive feelings are tinged with a feeling that we, as the audience, are all being 'had' to a degree. The whole thing is a bit overly smug. If Blackadder was writing this he'd describe it as being directed by Smug McSmuggerson, the king of Smugland. A recurring joke is the low budget afforded the movie, and we get hit over the head with that multiple times. It's all a little bit too knowing. The director is actually Tim Miller, and this - extraordinarily - is his feature film debut. But the guy clearly has class - this is off the back of him winning an Oscar no less for his animated short film "Gopher Broke".In summary, with curious timing, a surprise summer blockbuster while there is still ice scraping of windshield required.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

I thought that it rated in the best movies released lately, but it was in a list of the best movies of all times!!!I just adore his WTF humor. But the vulgarity might be trying to hide a sensitive heart~ Murderers and w***** can love too, you know!!!Ryan Reynolds, thank you for fighting to have this movie come to life, and the way it should be this time.

		<shortDescription>Not very funny, or exciting, or interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited to see this film given the hype over how funny it was, irreverent to super hero movies, and interestingly adult (love story) it was. It was none of these. The characters were annoying, the plot was not suspenseful, and the dialog was mostly child like potty and sex humor. The only love story was between a lustful superhero and a stripper. They only reason they loved each other was because no one else would or could since they are despicable. Some of the scenes were so disrespecting to human life I had to close my eyes and turn my head to stop from getting sick. I noticed that some people left the movie. Perhaps this movie was not made for people like me. What I found most disappointing and confusing was how disconnected the story was. The super hero and the villains were so powerful at some times and then at other times they were killed with one measly bullet or punch. I will give it some credit for the graphics, sound effects, costumes, and animation. I kept wanting to like it but in the end I left unsatisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A One-Time Watch That is Ultimately Hollow and Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is alright as a one-time watch. It is different, fun for a short while and smart when it wants to be. It's biggest asset, a double entendre for those who've seen the film, is Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. The role fits him like a glove. He is awesome. The character rocks and has multiple facets to his personality. Reynolds's comedic timing is perfect and I guess he saves the film, perhaps that was the point.The humor showcased is what makes Deadpool different. The wit, comedic elements, breaking the fourth wall, being very referential and parodying the X-Men all the while being R-rated give it an amusing edge. My qualms with this film are that they took the term "R-rated" too literally. He may be the merc with the mouth but the foul language feels forced as if trying too hard to satisfy the kind of audience appetites that come with such a rating. It got annoying eventually as things became very repetitive. I am no prude but the language got to a point of overkill. In addition, humor and 'language' can only so much make up for a lack of story and substance. Eventually even if it is a parody of an X-Men film or an origin story, it is still filled with clichés. If it was trying to highlight the cliché-ridden origin stories and make fun of them, the wolverine films in particular, it did so but to it's detriment as it fell into the same trap. There is practically no story, substance or depth, even originality in the story to save the film, nothing memorable. It ultimately is an amusing but empty ride when you watch it the first time. The film is quite stylized and that fits the humor. They go very well together but sooner or later it becomes a case of style over substance. The film becomes too reliant on humor, stylized violence and profanity, while hilarious and pretty darn good the first time, it gets old.The characters aside from Deadpool weren't given much layering especially characters like Negasonic. I expected much more.I enjoyed the humor the first time but after I watched the film again, it didn't have the same impact. It becomes a strictly one-time watch with an interesting anti-hero but nothing else of note. The humor doesn't hold up on multiple watches, the characters are bland, the story non-existent, the action sequences unmemorable and the villains nothing of note. Even as a parody of an origins film making fun of the clichés, it sinks because it doesn't shatter them rather it falls into the same category and embraces them.The nods to Ferris Bueller were okay, for those who've seen the end credits, but even that and breaking the fourth wall eventually became stale, overkill and banality equal disappointment after all even when paying tribute or parodying. I'm shocked that this film became so big, I mean the emperor has no clothes! You may enjoy it once, it isn't awful but after all the hype dies down, it becomes just another mediocre movie that had potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fan of the "Deadpool" comics, I think you'll be pleased with this long-awaited film. It is the Marvel comic faithfully adapted to the big screen, just with a lot more profanity and nudity. Few superhero movies are as faithful to the original source material as Deadpool is. From the chats with the audience through the fourth wall to the cartoon character hijinks, director Tim Miller really nails it. And even if you're not a fan of the comic, this is an entertaining addition to the superhero film genre. If you combined The Mask with Watchmen,you start to get a sense of what to expect. It's a raunchy comedy mixed with a superhero movie, yet somehow the two work well together and are unlike anything we've seen on the screen before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpectedly lousy movie, full of lowbrow "humor"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Deadpool with high hopes, particularly since I like Ryan Reynolds and had heard several good reviews. I was not expecting the kind of juvenile humor that I was subjected to for the next 108 minutes. It's the kind of garbage you would find in a bad Jim Carrey movie. I only laughed once during the entire show. Admittedly, I appeared to be in the minority, since other people laughed throughout the movie. I just don't get it.I've seen and enjoyed most of the super hero movies, so I like the genre. However, I don't see the need for an R rated Marvel Comics movie. I found it especially painful to watch Stan Lee's cameo in a strip club with nude women. I would have thought he had better sense.Finally, as most viewers of Marvel Comic adaptations are aware, there is always a snip-it after the credits, to give you a hint of what's coming. This movie has one, but it's not like any of the others, and definitely not worth sitting through the extensive roll of credits to see. Save yourself the aggravation and just leave when the main feature is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool: Early review. Kicking off the 2016 superhero flicks in a big bad way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is the movie equivalent of the parents going out of town for the weekend while the high school throws a party, gets drunk, has sex in the backseat of the car and then pukes in the driveway, and in a good way. It appears as though Fox has turned a blind eye while director Tim Miller, star Ryan Reynolds and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick run amok, having the time of their lives and thankfully bringing us along for the ride.Deadpool stars Reynolds as the mentally unhinged hit-man, Wade Wilson. This is not a story where the upstanding protagonist is flung into the throes of an extraordinary situation. No, this superhero tale about an unstable bad guy who gets superpowers, and it's refreshing as hell. Without getting into spoiler territory, this is a revenge movie masquerading as a superhero origin story.Following what may be the most creative opening credits sequence in the history of film, we are flung mercilessly into the maelstrom of Deadpool. Once the light turns green, all bets are off as Deadpool takes us through his journey, explaining his origin, his revenge mission and even his unconventional, if at times endearing relationship with his girlfriend, Vanessa, who may be as, or more, damaged than Wade himself. There really isn't anything bad I can say about the movie, except that I was sad when it ended, but they were able to cram just enough crazy into this 107 minutes that it just works perfectly.I plan on watching movie at least three more times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Merc With A Mouth Comes To Cinematic Life In Unrestrained, Unadulterated &amp; Undiluted Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring God's perfect idiot in the role he was born to play, jam-packed with R-rated naughtiness from beginning to end, and riding high on the strength of its raunchy humour, self-referential winks &amp; pop culture references, Deadpool tells the story of the odd, unpredictable, loud-mouthed, sarcastic &amp; delightfully deranged antihero in an unabashedly freewheeling manner, is continually refreshing on more levels than one, and is the funniest superhero flick to surface on the silver screen since Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. But I can't help but feel slightly dissatisfied, for this film could have been so much more than what it settles for in the final print.The story of Deadpool follows Wade Wilson, a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary whose plan of settling down and spending the rest of his life with the girl he loves goes outside the window when he learns that he has terminal cancer. After being approached by a mysterious recruiter who offers a cure to his diagnosis, he takes part in a human experimentation program that bestows him with accelerated healing capabilities but also leaves him severely disfigured. Managing to survive the ordeal, Wilson adopts the persona of a masked vigilante and, with his self- healing powers &amp; twisted sense of humour, starts looking for the people who nearly destroyed his life.Directed by an overpaid tool in what is actually his directional debut, the film's wicked opening credits clearly indicate the kind of movie it aspires to be, and then follows it up with an ingeniously choreographed, gleefully violent &amp; exuberantly witted first act that also turns out to be its self- defeating moment, for the film is never able to attain that same height again for the remainder of its runtime. Tim Miller's direction is quite impressive for a first feature but his inexperience also shows up when he allows the film to go into the overkill mode, and is clueless about when &amp; where to draw the line. And although the story hurls one witty line after another, not all of them work out in the film's favour.The first act introduces the eponymous character to the audience in flamboyant style and effectively establishes his origins, eccentric wit &amp; modus operandi but the rest of the narrative is simply a downhill journey. The writers stay faithful to the sardonic tone of its source material, the screenplay brims with playful, profane &amp; parodic remarks, there is sufficient meat on the titular character's arc, and it follows an interesting trajectory as well but its middle &amp; final acts fail to duplicate the effervescent zest of its opening segment and apart from Deadpool, there are no compelling characters in the movie. Many of its one-liners are hilarious &amp; inventive, but a few of them become repetitive &amp; wearisome after a while.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Ryan Reynolds, a hot chick, a British villain, the comic relief, the moody teen &amp; a CGI character, with only Reynolds leaving a lasting impression. Reynolds' rendition of Wade Wilson both in &amp; out of the suit makes it one of those perfect actor-character marriages, and it is actually difficult to imagine someone else playing this role with such remarkable finesse. Morena Baccarin &amp; T.J. Miller play Wilson's girlfriend &amp; best friend, respectively, and are runners-up in the acting department but their work is still no match to Reynold's input, for the latter carries the entire film on his own. Ed Skrein does well with what he's given, while the character of Colossus is plainly annoying.On an overall scale, Deadpool is an endlessly enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining &amp; downright rambunctious roller-coaster ride that delivers on its promise of bringing the "Merc with a Mouth" to cinematic life in his unrestrained, unadulterated &amp; undiluted form, makes blatant use of adult humour throughout its runtime, and even manages to subvert the superhero formula to an extent. But its attempt to defy the norm &amp; follow an unorthodox route only happens on a superficial level, for beneath its surface lies the same predictable &amp; formulaic narrative that we've seen many times before. Opening on an extremely promising note but losing its way in the middle, Deadpool works only because of Ryan Reynolds' swashbuckling, show-stealing &amp; effortlessly charismatic performance and while it had the ingredients to separate itself from the pack, it isn't as unconventional as it appears to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Deadpool Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was fantastic. The plot was ingenious and I was rooting for Deadpool, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead as they kicked Ajax's A word. The film explores Deadpool's origin and his anger at Francis aka Ajax. It also explores Wade Wilson's anger toward Ajax when his girlfriend Vanessa is kidnapped. Ryan Reynolds was the perfect Deadpool and emitted such a positive vibe that I can't get over the fact that he had the role of Deadpool. The 4th Wall was obliterated and the jokes were very funny. I was impressed with the cast as they knew their character and could, in one way or another, relate to him/her. The references to pop culture and the jokes in general were hysterical. For example, Deadpool is having sex with his girlfriend around Chinese New Year and she asks Wade what he wants and he says "Year of the Dog",. The action was at Marvel's best, trumping that of even Avengers: Age of Ultron. There was so much going on that you couldn't look away from the screen. The movie kept me fully entertained and I was not bored for a nanosecond. I especially liked the song played prior to the main fight, X Gon Give It To Ya, as it radiated Deadpool within it and was the best choice for part of the Deadpool soundtrack. The best part by far is the final showdown between Deadpool and Ajax as it wasn't only a hero vs. villain fight but also a fight to prove who was the better person with the better power (Ajax couldn't feel pain at all). This film was a perfect homage to the character of Deadpool/Wade Wilson. Although this is a comic book movie, this movie is rated a minimal R, so don't take anyone younger than 14 and even then, consider the choice deeply. In conclusion, this film was, as the title says, the ultimate Deadpool experience. The cast was well thought out and the film was treated with love and effort. Despite a budget of $58 million, the film was excellent and made $150 million on opening weekend alone. This film also has a lesson - no matter how much you suffer, you can do great things in life. Despite the torturous pain Wilson went through to become Deadpool, he defeated Ajax and saved his fiancé. This triumph over tragedy lesson will always stay with me in my heart. This movie was the best comic book movie and I would definitely recommend this to anyone over 14 years of age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What if I told you that 20th Century Fox made a good superhero movie? And not ONLY that,but a good superhero origin movie? You would be surprised, right? Yeah, that's right: we are talking about Deadpool. We all know that origin movies are hard to be done... We are all tired about "power and responsibility", and nobody cares about Batman's parents anymore! That's all old news already. What fox made not only manages to capture the essence of Deadpool's story; all that he went through, all the suffering, but in an entertaining way, get it? It's not about "what" they made, it's about "how". They seem to give context about all the action, and even though flashbacks are nothing in the way of innovation; they presented it in a way that feels refreshing. Don't get me wrong, I know that it isn't a 100% accurate representation of the character, but it's not far from this. If you are a Deadpool's fan from comics and you were holding back for being afraid to get disappointed, you should definitely give it a shot and if you aren't yet a fan, but you are trying to get into the comics, this movie will get you an idea of what to expect. Besides, if you think you are ready for some gory, funny, fourth-wall-breaking action, go for it, it shouldn't disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I went in with low expectations as I do with all movies but I came out of this movie fully entertained and impressed. Ed Skrein did a good job as the "Villian".I do that in quotes as reference to the movie. The movie pokes fun at the typical superhero movie. Not only did it provide laughs but it had a very interesting story line. I wasn't too familiar with the Dead pool character but the movie did a good job building the character. Great acting, pacing, settings, and style. I kept rewinding just to hear the funny lines. You don't have to be a superhero fan or know about Dead pool to like this movie. Watch this movie if you want a good laugh and great story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is a great superhero comedy flick that stars of one of Marvel's popular character.This movie is good cause it doesn't setup a future sequel but does have so many references to x-men and pop culture through jokes from the merc with a mouth.Ryan Reynolds killed as Deadpool so thus the whole cast in the film who did a great job in their respective characters.The action scenes is very awesome and it is really funny.The story is plain and simple but because of the main character,you will still love this movie.I love to watch this movie cause it's awesome.funny end- credit scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie, One of the best marvel movie's there is. excellent acting of Ryan Reynolds. It's impossible to envision a sequel with pleasure, this kind of lightning wouldn't strike twice, but the first one could hardly be improved Loaded with sass, sex, and sadistic violence, Deadpool is not your youngster's comic-book origin story. Deadpool earns every bit of its excellent rating, a quality that's sure to appeal to fans weary of the macho, apple-pie-eating, altruistic superheroes who buck for attention in the comic-book stables. I didn't expect that I will enjoy watching this movie so much. Other movies about superheroes are usually made for kids and teenagers. Here we have bloody movie with dirty dialogues and some kind of specific black humour. All together is tasty</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sincere Comic Book Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read Deadpool comics. I have played the Deadpool game and I have seen him being adapted in some animated movies and series. I have done all this after X-men Origins:Wolverine. There was a severe outrage about the portrayal of Deadpool in that movie and I had to dig deeper to understand the reason for this outrage and I understood the character and Deadpool's bio in short is "Merc with a mouth", so why did they sow his mouth SHUT?Moving on, I think the movie is so perfect because the producers didn't restrain the director and writers from doing anything and the director and writer did a BANG on job in making this movie. The plot is simple that is why the narration is to and fro. Most of the references were understandable and extremely well placed within the movie. Me being an Indian, missed some so I had to Google some of them and I laughed after understanding them. The dialogues were bang on. Character development, unexpectedly, was there.Now to the acting. I suppose side characters are not even necessary because you have Ryan Reynolds playing Deadpool. It feels like he was born to be Deadpool and after knowing all the hard-work he has done to get this movie made and when you see his portrayal of the merc-with-a-mouth, satisfaction is guaranteed.All in all for me, this is the most perfect adaptation of a comic book character and every movie should be made like this. I am not saying every movie should be made r-rated but it should be made as the comic book writers had made them and as the readers had grown with the characters. One other plus point is that I think this movie was made as a stand-alone movie. After the success the sequels are being planned. Making a movie to support a franchise always ruins it as a movie itself(You know what I am talking about, chiki- chikaaaaaa)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Cure to Marvelophobia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate superhero movies. I used to liked them, until I outgrown them or, maybe, until they started to become a show of cheesy characters in some sort of idiotic pose trying to spout cool sentences as empty as their heads. A sign of what is also going outside the big screen. The new Spiderman, Thor, Batman vs Superman, The Avengers, Iron Man, X-Men Days of the Future Past (which ruined the memory of the first X-Men comic I ever read, by the way) and, in general, every single DC and Marvel production (particularly the latter, banging out films/series like there's no tomorrow) has been a nightmare for people who, like me, are adults with a brain fitting their age.That's why I love this movie. I can't get enough of the dark humour, of the jokes about X-Men and the whole clichéd superhero franchise so loved these days. I wish there were more movies making fun of superheroes and their stupid and silly behaviour. It's great to be able to watch something which one of its main purposes seems to be to laugh at everything, particularly at established and forced social patterns; and itself. So many people seem to miss that this movie, the whole thing, is a joke. Stop talking about a better plot and character development. You just want another clichéd superhero movie. Special mention to those claiming this to be the worst Marvel/superhero movie. Please, go watch Captain America profound psychological struggles and Avengers' heartfelt sacrifices and leave the rest of us with some serious (right!) fun.I'll end up this review by pointing you towards some funny and silly "contributions" I noticed before starting my review. Let us take our friend Joshhanks777, with his 1/10 rating, 16 April 2016. This guy seems to have been so bored with the movie that he felt asleep, because he enlightens us by letting us know that "The main character is very unlikeable [...] and the other characters are not memorable at all, particularly the bland villain and his girlfriend who is a stripper" Erm... Wait... What??? Was I, perchance, the one asleep? No, that couldn't be... But then... How can this individual, who comments on the movie like he watched it all, mistake the main character (who is supposed to be Deadpool) with the bland villain? Because I didn't see any other stripper girlfriend but Wade's, although she wasn't technically his girlfriend anymore... Or maybe he didn't realise what Deadpool looked like without the mask and thought that he stole the girlfriend from Wade the bland villain at the end???? Or, perhaps, he considered the plot of this simple movie so twisted and labyrinthine that he got lost in the deluge of deep, emotional characters with complicated relationships... It couldn't be that he doesn't have a clue about what he is talking about! That'd be impossible. Next, user mufcsince and his/her love for children's shows: "Barney the Dinosaur is more entertaining than this movie." There you have your mindset. And continues "if one wants to watch porn, they'd watch porn." You seem to be confused about the meaning of the word "porn". Check it out. Learning can be fun! Does Bernie not teach that? Moving along, you have to wonder what the francis a person is thinking when he/she writes a review that is, in fact, a summary of the plot, without even a single personal opinion (which is actually better, considering the shiny jewels people drop for opinions). Take the user GoodHandsomeLad, as an example. Review "Simply Excellent.", 13 February 2016. So much for brilliance, such genius and originality! Then we have muhammadwasim-40771 with his "Indecent movie" post entry (the title should say it all). I quote (untouched grammar): "Deadpool is a Marvel's super hero movie and is supposed to watch by more kids than adults [...]" This guy seems to be so sure of himself than he doesn't even care about reality! Superhero movie? Wake up! If kids watch R-rated movies, well, you are not doing a good job as a parent. "These kind of movies are destroying new generation morally and physically." Physically? Indirectly, or do kids hit themselves with new acquired Blu-Ray discs in a maelstrom of hilarity and decadent rapture of joy? Sure, they could not instead be destroyed by sending them to fight wars so the elite can have cheaper oil, or having to cope with irresponsible and alienating parenthood, or indoctrinating them with tales about some guy in the sky wanting to punish anyone who doesn't do as he commands. It must be, surely, this movie. Oh, and Marilyn Manson, of course. "[...] superhero movie should not be like this bcoz its a marvel character and kids don't understand why we r forbidding them to see the movie" Again with the superhero... Did you hear about the antihero archetype? Once more, you seem to be a lousy father, Muhammad. Perhaps you should have considered abstinence, particularly in light of human overpopulation and third world hunger.Anyway, I finish here this, my homage to Deadpool and his disappearing lot. I hope you enjoyed it and didn't find it abusive in any way. After all, my only wish is for all of us to get along. Until our politicians order us to go kill each other in some remote land for a made-up reason.Written by a Deadpool wannabe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Having Fun with the Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is said to be one of the most impossible material to put up on the big screen this soon. This hero is crass, the content is more vulgar and violent that may not be marketable for the mass. But the studio is smart enough to take risks, staying faithful with its nature and let things go wild. And as it goes, it's undeniably hilarious and really crazy fun. But for its ambitions of breaking new grounds for the superhero genre, Deadpool however falls short in that case. The tropes are kind of the same, except it's more self-aware and lurid. But this doesn't negate the joy the movie still provides.It begins with an opening credits that pretty much name calling however typically involves in major superhero films. The movie then cuts establishing what kind of a character Deadpool is; he's cold-blooded with a sense of humor. It also flashes back to his origin story and how he lost everything after the experiment that is supposed to cure his disease. The main plot is basically a simple revenge story, only filled with the otherworldly craziness and breaking the fourth wall jokes. And as the story go, it's not that fresh, but it's all about the personality of the hero must shine and it does deliver. He also keeps poking fun at the clichés of the superhero genre and the limitation in the production of the film. It's amusing all and all, and that's pretty much what we wanted to see here.Then again, it's nothing groundbreaking, but what we wanted to see here is just Deadpool playing around. Putting aside the playful stuff, the romantic subplot is actually kind of endearing. The villain is ought to seem like a stock one, but his petty weakness is what defined him. The action is pretty fun to watch, which mostly has headshots and decapitations. The CGI isn't always that impressive, but it doesn't keep the action from being watchable, as long as the velocity and clarity are good. The acting is a delight, Ryan Reynolds seems like he's having the time of his life playing this role and that shows in every scene he is in as Deadpool.Deadpool isn't quite that revolutionary, well maybe for the confidence of major studios making more R rated superheroes like this. As the plot goes, it's all familiar. Then again, the movie is all about the personality and it works delightfully. People may just brag that this is just Kick-Ass except with higher budget and a more known property and that can be true. The movie doesn't have too much of a novelty, but as it executes your expectations, Deadpool has that passion. And that alone may satisfy comic book fans, anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my first review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK first of I'm gonna start by stating this is my first review so if it's a bad review thats why. Anyways Deadpool does a lot of things right but also does a lot things bad. So for this review I'm gonna make a list of things it did right, and a list of things it did bad. Things it did right: - The jokes fit right in and were actually a lot more funny than i thought they were going to be - The action sequences were great and felt really comic book like, which is a good thing because of how well they were done- The fourth wall breaks (I know this technically would fit under "the jokes" section but the were so good it deserved its own category)OK now onto the bad: - There was only two major action sequences. I know this is because of the low budget but for the common movie goer who might not know this might be a little disappointed - The sad scenes and the comedy scenes. OK the only reason why i don't like these scenes is because of how they were done. It just didn't feel right when they switched from a sad scene to a comedic scene because it made the sad scenes less sad or made the comedy scenes less funny - Some of the best jokes were spoiled in the trailers which made them less funny - The main villains powers weren't very clear. For example when Deadpool makes Ajax crash his motorcycle, Ajax is able to make an escape even though his legs definitely should've been broken. Also when Deadpool stabs Ajax the shoulder he is able to still drive his bike. I know we find out Ajax doesn't feel pain but that still doesn't explain why he's able to do these things - The cliché super strong villain that doesn't talk much. I know this isn't worst thing ever but for a film thats so self aware it should've at least addressed this Overall I would give Deadpool a 7.5/10 but IMDb only allows whole numbers so I have to give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is pretty weird. In the entire movie, there are only 9 characters with more than 1 line. I think that made the movie feel very small scale and hollow. The humor is hit and miss, my salon laughed a few times, however the joke the crowd found the most entertaining was just a simple steal from the classic "Monty Python and the Holy Grail".Apart from Deadpool himself, the cast is bleak. Forgettable villain who never really felt threatening, and the rest are just generic and boring.It's just pretty mediocre, nothing great really. If you really like superhero movies, you will probably find this movie great, however it really brings nothing new to the table, just a basic superhero origins story with some added in humor and 4th wall breaking.Action scenes - 5/10 humor - 6/10 story - 3/10 predictability 3/10 very much so characters - 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Deadpool, I wasn't very impressed (hear me out before you throw rotten fruit at me). After watching the film, I now realise why. All the best parts are way too crude to include in the trailer. This isn't the first time I've felt this way about a movie. My initial reaction when I saw the trailer for The Hangover was "Stupid?" ? it's now one of my all-time favourite films.After following @vancityreynolds on Instagram, I was bombarded with marketing for the film. I excused it, because Ryan Reynolds is gorgeous so he clearly has a hall pass to do whatever the hell he wants in life (naturally). My turning point was when I saw his post regarding the billboard that Fox had ingeniously placed on some busy highway in the States.How can I dislike something which uses one of my favourite emojis ? the happy turd? Then, the rave reviews started flowing in. Rave reviews from some of my friends? friends who I seriously trusted regarding their taste in film. Okay, so I'm intrigued now. Consider my interest piqued.As soon as the opening titles begin, you know what you've gotten yourself into. They set the tone for the rest of the film, with its tongue-in-cheek script and consistent breaking of the fourth wall. The gore dial is switched up to high compared to its Marvel counterparts, which I actually find a little refreshing (I'm sick, I know).To me, the film is the mutant (ha! See what I did there?) love child of Ant-Man and Kick-Ass? so what's not to love? Oh, and Ryan Reynolds gets his kit off too? I know, gross.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Change - Something Original For Once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of 'Dead pool' and i'm certainly not a 'fan boy'of the super hero comics. I liked the look of the trailer so went to see it. It's very graphic, violent, bad language, sexual scenes etc A film not for prudes. But it does seem to work and I found it both funny and entertaining. Ryan Reynolds really excels in the role.Deadpool is a sort of self aware, antihero, cool bad guy who underneath is a sort of good guy. He's also aware he's a comic/film character and talks to the audience - which surprisingly works too. The general plot is pretty typical for the genre but Reynolds as deadpool is what makes it stand out and is virtually continuously funny.My only mild criticism is I think they could have made the plot stronger and enhanced the suffering/development of the Deadpool character. I'd give it 7.5/10 as an action packed unusual superhero romp, that will entertain and amuse for the entire 108minutes. I'd also give it a 9/10 for being original and different. A film that is worth paying to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crude, crass and controversial. Hilarious, creative, fresh and violent. 'Deadpool' goes to a place where other superhero films don't dare to go and the result is a total laugh-out-loud, beat-them-up calamity that sucks the audience right in and refuses to let go. It doesn't mind in the slightest to make fun of itself, relayed brilliantly through the anti-hero star of the show, Deadpool himself. It sarcastically points the finger at the whole Marvel superhero world but never forgets that it still must deliver the riotous impact that the viewer is expecting. Like many people, I had never heard of Deadpool and was unfamiliar with his whole world. Even with a cameo in the 'Wolverine Origins' film as motor mouth Wade Wilson, this off-the-wall character never made it in my comic book collection.'Deadpool's' debut on the silver screen coincides with first time Director, Tim Miller's virgin feature and what a way to announce your arrival. There is nothing safe about Miller's production and with an R rating, it couldn't have been anything less. 'Deadpool' simply needed to be let loose to see where this outrageous character would take the whole film and right from the very first scene the audience will know that they are in for one hell of a ride. Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and co had the very enviable task of being able to fabricate a narrative where the boundaries are not as constrained as its well known and famous rivals and the whole blasting spectacle benefits from the less conventional script.For the first part of the film we are treated to a story that goes from the present back to the past and then returning to the explosive present until we have all caught up with the crazy, fast paced narrative (and able to suck in some much needed oxygen). Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a mercenary of sorts. He makes his living as a thug and stand-over man for those that will pay the right sum. Wade is also a smartarse, quick witted and crude but then one evening he meets his match in the form of the very beautiful Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). She has the ability to in successfully dealing with Wade's ways resulting in an adventurous and active relationship. This all turns to sewerage when Wade is diagnosed with a terminal illness that directly leads him to becoming the anti-hero, Deadpool with the help of an experimental 'cure' that transforms him into an unstoppable force. There is a side effect that quickly becomes obvious leading to carnage as Deadpool, with the help of some minor X-men, goes about amusingly righting the wrongs that were thrust upon him by Ajax (Ed Skrein) and save the woman he loves.Ryan Reynolds is the only actor that could convincingly play this character. He has experience in the super hero genre when he jumped the fence and rode into DC world to strut around in green as the Lantern but it just didn't work out. Not to worry, he is known for his outlandish behaviour but it does seem as if 'Deadpool' was in some way auspiciously written for him. Reynolds doesn't disappoint, completely immersing himself in this performance that can only result in this very funny, action packed production. Everyone else that appears along side Ryan is there for the benefit of Deadpool's hilarious nature but by no means out of place. The characters come and go but all play their part, each providing moments of R rated controversy that will leave the audience in stitches. The narrative is simple but it drives the 'merc with a mouth' on a riotous journey to seek out his vengeance in typical Ryan Reynolds style. It is his film and he grabs it with both hands and feet. But remember.......he isn't a hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really really loved Deadpool, I went into the cinema with high expectations, and I came out with none of my expectations broken or exceeded, I left feeling content and happy knowing that this movie matched how awesome the trailer looked. Ryan Reynolds playing Deadpool had me from the beginning of it's inception, I don't think any other actor could play the role as well as he did. The storytelling was extremely inventive, given how long the run- time was (1hr 48min) it felt as though there was minimal plot to the movie, however it was the way it was told that grabbed me and kept me enthralled from start to finish, the protagonist is thrown right into the action from the word go and from then on it goes back and forth in it's storytelling of this insane yet charming character named Deadpool and how he came to be. Flashbacks in movies usually annoy the heck out of me, but in this one it was done right with no boring scenes only coming across as fresh and exciting. The action was such a beautiful creation in this movie, every scene beautifully showing off it's gloriously gory head-shots, the pacing is almost perfect in this movie as it never comes to a standstill or dull point, the story movies seamlessly. Underneath all of the action is the fantastic chemistry between Ryan and his co star Morena Baccarin, beneath all of the carnage shone a great love story which mixed well into the movie, it had a strong emotional core to it which I think is the best that has been seen in any Marvel movie yet. The humor was fantastic, whilst not all of the jokes hit well or even if some of the references were not understood, there was enough ingenious humour in the movie to keep the laughs rolling. Being Tim Millers directorial debut this has amazed me, watching this movie you would think it was from a Hollywood veteran from the way it was shot, to the pacing and to the amazing casting it was almost a perfect movie. Given that it took 10 years for this movie finally to be developed and released it was definitely a long time coming with Fox holding out on the release as they thought it would not gain any interest. Whilst I think that it was true back 10 years ago, now was the perfect time for it's release as all of the other superhero films are gaining momentum.The marketing of the film is probably the main contributor to it's success, the way it reached out to different countries is what made it so unique and the way it portrayed itself as a 'Valentines Day' film is what was interesting as it was released over that weekend. It had the biggest opening of any R rated movie and the studio can thank the marketing team for that effort.Despite all of it's extremely minor quips this movie takes the cake as my favorite Marvel movie yet.

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is a movie that thinks about its fan base while offering plenty of laughs and doing justice for the titular character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a mercenary who falls in love lives a happy life until he finds that he has cancer. A mysterious man offers help in a form of an experiment that will cure Wades cancer. The experiment turns out to be making super slaves instead. It makes him invulnerable but also scars his whole body so Wade takes a new identity: Deadpool and starts his quest for revenge. Along the way we meet supporting characters like blind Al and even a few X-Men, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus, and yes, the lack of X-Men is addressed in the film: "Wow, this is such a big house, but I only ever see the two of you here. It's like the studio didn't have enough money for any more X-Men...". The film has been in development since February 2004, so this is a very anticipated film for many (including me), and, I'm happy to say: it is very good. Deadpool is filled with crude humor from the opening credits that announce that the film is directed by an "overpaid tool" until the very end. The film is rated R (who even suggested that Deadpool should be pg-13?), and the thing contributing to this, aside the humor, is the over the top violence. Bones break, limbs get cut off and blood sprays and its awesome! This movie is a success so I hope other movies would have the courage to be R rated if appropriate (looking at you Suicide Squad). The fight scenes are all well choreographed especially the one opening the film that also establishes the tone of the film with jokes like this:" I never say this... but don't swallow" and people beaten to pulp. The film also constantly breaks the fourth wall and references other like when Wade comments:" Please don't make the super suit green. OR ANIMATED!" a jab to Green Lantern, also starring Reynolds. The music is also very good, with most of it being rap, which really fits this film, Deadpool even gets his own rap! Deadpool comics have always been as funny as they are gory, so I can imagine that the fans of Merc with a Mouth will be pleased. Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. He has showed great interest towards the character. His enthusiasm shows in his performance, he is funny, witty and a fast talker. All the cast members get at least one big funny moment as well and play their characters well. There are parts in Deadpool that left me wanting more. The plot is something that audiences have seen in a lot of movies , since there are a lot of films about revenge. A lot of the film is shot like this: there is a shot of someone saying a funny line, then cut to someone reaction to said joke. I felt like the filmmakers could have more added visual jokes or make the movie more interesting visually so the film would have been as funny visually as it was with its dialogue. The villain is also a bit boring with Ed Skrein playing him a bit too stoically for this kind of movie. Overall Deadpool is a fun time with a few flaws, but I still think it is a good start for a possible franchise and that fans will love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Superhero Films Since The Dark Knight Rises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is one of the best films so far of 2016 and one of the best superhero films since The Dark Knight Rises. The marketing for this film is some of the best but I was worried that the film wouldn't live up to the hype. So I went into this film with low expectations. When I came out of the film I LOVED this movie. Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool and he gave one of his best performances of his career. The film is directed very well from first time director Tim Miller. I honestly thought there would be shaky camera action but I was wrong. The action is quick, fast, and very brutal. One of the best things for this movie is the writing. The movie is very funny and it's one of the best comedies that came out in recent year. I do agree with the film being R rated because it fits with the character and if this film was PG-13 it wouldn't be good and the film would hardly have a story to tell and I do hope they start to make more superhero films R rated. Overall if your a fan of Deadpool this movie is for you and even if your not a fan of him or superhero films this is still a great movie to check out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew who Deadpool was but had never read much about him. I would have gone and seen it regardless but the marketing with the various ads and trailers convinced me to go sooner than later. Even if you don't like superhero movies, and Deadpool would be the first to tell you he isn't a superhero, this is still a fun movie to go see if you're not a kid. "Happy International Woman's Day". The injokes and pop culture references are almost non stop. I can't wait to see it on DVD just so I can make sure I caught them all. Even the appearance of Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead are great as they are different (aka minor) superheroes who are much more interesting than the heroes who have their own movies. You have to like some sophomoric humour to get through parts of this but it is worth it. While I didn't think there were gaps in the storyline, I think when we see the DVD version, I wouldn't be surprised if we flesh out some of the story. He was away for 2 years but it doesn't seem that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Kind of "Super Hero"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had zero knowledge about Deadpool going into this movie. I was expecting some dirty humor and comic relief based on the previews, but I wasn't expecting anything like this!Ryan Reynolds was absolutely hilarious. This will revitalize his career and turn him into a mega star for the foreseeable future. He plays the perfect antihero and delivers his performance fantastically. He really became his character and went all in on his deliveries. Besides Reynolds, the story was made in a way to make fun of other superhero movies and people who make those movies. There were plenty of jokes pointing out the annoying and repetitive parts of the billion super hero movies that have been made the last 10 years. They did this to take a shot at other movies, but also to still have these parts within this one too. This was an extremely interesting way to keep the classic superhero parts but in a new way.Deadpool is a great antihero, and this movie was hilarious, for most of the time. There were a thousand jokes that were constantly being spewed out of Reynolds. After a while, all of it was just over the top and too much. I got sick of the stupid, forced jokes toward the end. The first half of Deadpool was hilarious, but it just pushed its luck after a while.Reynolds is funny, the story is portrayed well, and the humor takes a new look at a super hero movie. This is a great, unique antihero movie that will hopefully continue into more in the future. Deadpool is a fun character that filmmakers could do a ton with. I hope they take this solid start and show us more of this antihero take. This is unlike any other superhero movie and worth a watch; 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definite watch for fans of some raunchy humor and some good violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a good watch, for those wanting a different flavor of superhero movie. Most of the jokes were on point and the movie didn't take itself too seriously. Ryan Reynolds really did well in the role and his co-comedian TJ Miller made the bar situations a lot more bearable. There were times when the ad-libbing did get noticeable, reminiscent of the table talk during Bridesmaids. Although the pacing of the film did help in alleviating the awkwardness. There were times the story felt a bit rushed, and seemed as if they were just going through a checklist, but the humor did carry a lot of it through well enough, which could become an issue if the jokes aren't your thing. Really enjoyable, but at the end of the day, aside from the humor, it really brings nothing new to the table. I don't plan on watching it again anytime soon, and I don't really see anyone other than big fans of the genre who would clamor for a second taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The name is Dead, DeadPool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the onset have to mention that though a fan of super heroes wasn't so well educated on the character of Deadpool. So kind of went to the movie blind in terms of back story. But that really didn't matter. The movie had me at the opening title sequence. Quirky, funny and satirical. Asshat sticked out for me and i came up with a whole new bad word but more on that later. This is an out and out Ryan Reynolds movie. And why not when he has been fighting for it for the last 11 years. When one is passionate and has the utmost belief in something it shows. The character wasn't just enacted, RR was DP. We have been used to seeing Superheroes always do good, kill only bad people out of sight, generally save the earth. Basically be all soft, nice and cuddly!! Well this one ain't going on that path. And am so glad it didn't. The path less traveled is what this movie took in quite a lot of T &amp; C's. There wasn't any political correctness and neither was there any qualms of making fun of one self. The self deprecation was the underlining all the way through. Wry and witty the scripting was tight. The jokes yes sometime a bit skewed only to the other gender but in today's gender agnostic world everyone can laugh about it. The only thing I wished we had more was that of the character Negasonic Teenage Warhead. She seemed interesting and wish there was some more meat and balls to that character beside only the fire thrust. The movie references made specifically that of the fourth wall and Mr smith were special. Though i know that there is a tug between marvel and fox but wouldn't it be just a treat to see how iron man and deadpool team up? Oh that would be a perfect universe where chaos is the new order and the language is pure poetry. That's a match made in heaven and romance will overshadow all evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Reynolds Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like most people, am so glad that Deadpool fondled Wolverines smooth criminals to get this movie made, ironically making a movie better than both stand alone Wolverine films. Deadpool is funny, exciting and meta as f, more than redeeming itself from X men Origins Wolverine... *shudder*From the opening title sequence of the film it is clear that we are in for a kick ass ride with a film that will take the mick of itself and everything else in pop culture with it.Van Wilder himself, Ryan Reynolds was great in this film, proving to everyone that he was born to play the merc with the mouth. Everyone's least favourite Transporter Ed Skrein plays the evil British villain Ajax really well in this film, gaining some redemption of his own.What I like about this film is how it is able to be funny but have heart as well. Wade Wilson isn't just a 4th wall breaking, sex and chimichanga joking loud mouth, he is also a guy dying of cancer who has fallen deeply in love. The film also has some rather dark and disturbing moments but also manages to blend back into the wise cracking ways of Wade Wilson.This film had to be rated 15 (R) as the film just simply would not have worked if it was commercialised for everyone with a 12A certificate or lower. Deadpool has to be the Merc with the mouth and a 15 certificate allowed Deadpool to be Deadpool rather than a bald mutant with his mouth sowed shut... oh wait.Deadpool is an absolute blast. The action is good, the jokes are hilarious and the film even has its emotional moments. It'll make you laugh, cry and both at the same time. Tim Miller's Directorial Debut is a good one with a good script and great acting throughout. My hopes for the future are that they stick true to the character with it's Rated R certificate and don't do to Deadpool what they did to John McClane..... Stick to 15 Fox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't believe that any so called industry expert, film fan or comic book loving super nerd could've or would've predicted the absolutely mind boggling success of Deadpool over the last week.Taking the world by storm, shattering box-office records and garnering both critical and audience acclaim, the red suit wearing Marvel anti-hero with a motor mouth like no other's journey to the big screen has therefore been a bigger event than anyone dared to have dreamed.At the time of writing Deadpool holds an 84% approval rating on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes and an incredible 8.7 rating on IMDb, good for #44 on the famed Top 250 movies of all time and the same rating as esteemed colleagues like Goodfellas, The Empire Strikes Back and Seven Samurai and higher than classics such as Se7en, Saving Private Ryan and Raiders of the Lost Ark.When this is considered, it's hard to agree with the amount of praise heaped upon a film that whilst highly entertaining, isn't even close to being worthy of sitting alongside genuine cinematic masterclasses like the few films mentioned above, as when you take away the veneer of 4th wall breaking, swear word laden and brain splattering violence, Deadpool isn't as original or ground-breaking as some would've had us believe.Opening with a fantastic opening montage of carnage (those who've seen the now legendary test footage will recognise this scene well) and hilariously listed credits, Deadpool certainly hits the ground running and seemingly forgoes the origin story tropes of old only to fall back into a plot line that feels utterly familiar to anyone that's laid witness to countless other such stories of everyday citizens turned into anything but ordinary hero's or in this case a hell bent on vengeance killer.Getting into a groove that is elevated by Deadpool's preference for addressing the audience and cracking wise every chance he gets, Deadpool ticks off the boxes towards a fairly disappointing finale that ends proceedings in a pedestrian manner but at the end of the day people weren't queuing up at ticket booths for a genre shaking narrative, they were queuing up for Ryan Reynolds, OTT violence and more jokes centred around body parts and bodily functions than a full season of The Inbetweeners and on these "important" fronts Deadpool certainly delivers.Playing the role he was so obviously born to play (as really he gets to play himself), Ryan Reynolds has a blast as tough guy for hire turned the nigh indestructible Wade Wilson/Deadpool.It's always made clear to an audience when an actor is having the time of their life and that's what we get from Reynolds. Delivering lines like only he can and bringing a swagger to proceedings, Reynolds is the films MVP and while not everything that spews out of his mouth lays a comedic smack down, more often than not you can't help but laugh at how far Reynolds takes the character. First time feature film director Tim Miller also deserves credit for his handling of the films action scenes and with a budget that would barely cover costs of catering on an Avengers film, Miller gives Deadpool a unique feel when it comes to dispatching of the cookie cutter bad guys.Highly entertaining and responsible for giving Ryan Reynolds his true star making moment we've all been waiting for, Deadpool is a quick-fire burst of fresh air in a world of kid friendly superhero films that upon closer inspection isn't much more than a fun time out at the movies.One can only hope that the success of this film doesn't mean the originality of our now beloved potty mouthed mercenary turned anti-hero gets overused by money hungry studio executives, as too much exposure of this good time could quickly wear out its welcome as the novelty value wears off on viewers, that have at present time, put on their rose tinted glasses.3 ? disgusting avocados out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may lack substance but the action, comedy aspect is flawless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't know who Deadpool is, he is an infamous anti hero who is known for not being bound to the rules of comic books or movies. He seems to be completely aware of who and where he is. Remarking on how this film may become a franchise or how he knows that the studio is tied to a budget. Listening to this character say exactly what you are thinking while still acknowledging the fact that he is in a movie is a blast. Of course, a movie is not a movie without a story. The films story may be quite thin and irregular but it is there, sometimes. Naturally we follow Wade Wilson (Deadpool) who becomes stricken with sever, late stage cancer.After he learns of this terrible disease he opts to take part in an experiment which would cure his illness but simultaneously make him invulnerable. With his new found powers he decides to pursue the man that gave him his awful butter face. Yep that's it, he goes on an hour and a half long man hunt because he was turned ugly.The films plot is ludicrously thin but it somehow works for this character. His utter disregard for basically everything may make it hard to create a meaningful story. Yet, they couldn't come up with anything a little more, you know, interesting? The only other fault worth mentioning is the villain.Do we learn anything at all about him? No. Are his motives and abilities defined and compelling? Nope. He is simply here to be the driving force for Deadpool. This coupled with the uninspired story can make for a rocky experience. There are one or two stretches where not a whole lot happens. I realize that the origin story needs to happen but it didn't seem necessary to make it near humorless at times.It was strange tonal shift that came as fast as it went. Thankfully so, as the rest of the film is incredibly fast paced and unflinching. This is what is so great about this movie. For once a Marvel film has held no punches. It's so crude and irreverent in its execution that even the new Pool fans will be abundantly pleased. The most impressive aspect though is the films humor.The movie walks a thin line with a character like this. It can easily go to far or vise versa. But 'Deadpool' straddles that line perfectly. It's ingenious use of fourth wall breaks, slapstick, and clever satire make for a timeless comedic effort. It very well could become the next 'Airplane' in terms of pure comedic ingenuity.Not to mention superb action sequences. They aren't overly edited or shaky to the point of nausea. No, they are crisp, clean, and use slow motion in the best way possible. This is again where its R rating comes in handy. It lets Deadpool be who is meant to be. Gritty and gruesome. Dismembering limps of both his enemies and himself. 'Deadpool' is exactly the movie fans of the character have wanted. It's gritty, brutal, and hilariously irreverent. Topped off with a pitch perfect Ryan Reynolds performance as the title character. 'Deadpool' IS the movie we have always wanted, but it isn't without flaws. Errors that should've been easy fixes that seemed to just be overlooked. That being said, if you like this character you will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your inner 17 year old will love it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My inner 17 year old self loved DEADPOOL. It had everything that any 17 year old boy would want in a movie - sex, violence and a smart-alec attitude, all wrapped up in an unapologetic package that reveled - and did not shy away from - these traits.At this point in the review, you are either saying "f#*$ yeah! this movie is for me!" or you have stopped reading, will never see this movie, so it doesn't really matter what I write.For the rest of you still reading, grab your raunchy comedy sense and head to the theaters to see DEADPOOL, you won't be sorry. Deadpool pokes fun at itself and the genre it represents right from the get- go. Get there early for the opening credits, they aren't quite like any opening credits you have seen before.First time director Tim Miller cut his teeth on animated short films (most notably, the Oscar nominated animated short, GOPHER BROKE) and it shows in this film. DEADPOOL plays like a 100 minute Road Runner cartoon with star Ryan Reynolds constant patter sounding more and more like the RoadRunner's "Beep, Beep" as the film progresses.Don't get me wrong, Reynolds does a nice job as the lead and brings humor and charm to the character, but after awhile it just didn't matter as it was just an excuse for fights, car chases, mayhem, violence and explosions - and I didn't mind one bit.There are some interesting characters in this film, most notably played by Morena Baccarin and T.J. MIller - two actors who I felt FINALLY got decent roles to play, but they, too, take a back seat to action and smart-assery in this film Even the great Leslie Uggams is brought in as an old, blind, smartass, and she acquits herself quite well.The smartest things the filmmakers did with this movie is that they did not back away from what they were trying to do - make a superhero movie that was a mash-up of THE AVENGERS and DIRTY GRANDPA, they didn't flinch from this mission, which is why it is successful. They accomplished what the set out to accomplish - make a Superhero movie that any teenage boy would love.7 (out of 10) stars - 10 out of 10, if you listen to my inner 17 year old - and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

Also I suggest this movie is not for kids, a lot of cussing unless you had raised your children to be like dead pool then good for you!

		<fullReview>Maybe it was because my expectations were too high, thanks to all the attention and praise the movie is receiving, or because of the plot that's maybe a bit too predictable. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. But I think the high expectations were the reason I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. I loved the humor in the movie, but sometimes it seemed a bit forced. Because the movie is full off humor, you know it's coming and you know it's there to stay. You are expecting a funny comment and it will be there. Maybe it's a bit too much for me.Now some positivity; I loved the CGI, it all looks amazing. I found the fourth wall breaking interesting and I think Deadpool did a great job with it. I think there were a load of great easter eggs, some pretty obvious, some more concealed, always fun! I'll watch this movie again and I'm definitely looking forward too the sequel. However, for the sequel I hope they will do a lot more with the plot, instead of focusing to much on the character. Cause I think that's what went a bit wrong here.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adds something else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is Deadpool, there is no other way to describe him. We have never see something like this character before in the superhero universe, the closest being Chris Pratts Star Lord. Deadpool is seen as a wise cracking all attention on him kind of guy with eye grabbing displays of action talent and charisma. The red suit anti hero provides a sprinkle of something a little different on a giant Marvel ice-cream. He doesn't try to be your everyday superhero and you need to love him for that, he manages to use any means necessary to take down his foes with creative and and sometimes questionable techniques, like who else would shove a car lighter down a man's throat, other than Deadpool of course. The use of NSFW jokes reinforced the youthfulness feeling of the film but can at sometimes feel a bit cringe and leave the viewer thinking that maybe the studio is trying just a tad too hard as I found myself sitting beside a friend who found every joke funny while I just sat there awkwardly laughing with him for his satisfaction. I didn't say there weren't funny jokes in the film don't get me wrong and the archetype for Deadpool is that of a humorous anti hero, though maybe they needed to tone down the humour a bit as I felt almost as if I was being spoon fed as many jokes as they could fit into the movie. The use of the X-Men took away from the high production value of the film as I felt it was a bit cheap during the scenes whenever we visit the college for mutants as it is as if colossus and whoever the hell the other x-woman is are the only occupants of the entire mansion. Like why were the X men even needed? It was clear that Deadpool didn't accept Collosus's ideologies at the end of the film so basically it was like we were being forced into the X men universe and Collosus's CGI was awful. We can see this movie is a step in the right direction for Ryan Reynolds after having two attempts at a superhero role, I suppose third time is the charm. I am now excited to see him in the next Deadpool and believe he can recreate his career around the success of him and this film. To get down to Deadpool himself, he does the job for me he is portrayed as the Deadpool I wanted to see on the big screen and is an ample display of Marvels talent and use of their base material to create a film, if you enjoyed Deadpool comics you will no doubt enjoy this.</fullReview>

Dead pool moral sense isn't like all superhero, as Superman, Batman or X-Men. His own goals are just to help herself and his girlfriend.Although the main point of this movies is about nothing, still has a secret message about how a man get so lost when meets a amazing girl. A eternal lesson, he still has heart, but is a kind eccentric in his own.Finally this movies has a great artist direction, he break the fourth wall in a gorgeous way and most of all, he has personality. A difficult characteristic in the current wave of superheroes. He is just insane and hilarious. I recommend this movie, and if possible, watch with your girlfriend it is really fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the promos promised us how the movie will be. In fact they kinda warned us. MARVEL always takes its movies to a whole new level. But here they have taken it to a parallel universe kind of level. Being the first R rated MARVEL movie, Deadpool is as vulgar as it can be. But it is all very well balanced in an entertaining way. Ryan Reynolds has gone beyond getting into the skin of the character to portray Deadpool. Deadpool is new age filmmaking at its best especially when looked in a sarcastic and satire way.There is not much to be concerned about the story here. It is merely an introduction of the character Deadpool along with his love story. In fact, the movie did surprise me as it revolves around the love story of the lead character. The best part of the movie are its opening credits and ending credits. Be sure not to miss them! It is a hilarious mockery of the movie and Hollywood in itself. But who cares when the movie was meant to be that. When you start finding the movie leaning towards the mainstream, boom comes a funny/sarcastic moment to elevate the scene. The dialogues are extremely well written and this is definitely not recommended for a family viewing even though if all are adults&#xf04a;. Action sequences though a little over the top, manage to keep up the pace of the movie. There are many X-Men references, in fact this might be a build up for the upcoming X-Men movies. The only flip side for the movie is not having such a strong story but it is hardly noticeable in all the chaos and comedy.Ryan Reynolds is so unclassicaly classic as Wade Wilson aka Deadpool. It is hard to forget his character in years to come. Morena Baccarin is hot and we know that ;-) Ed Skrein as the main antagonist Ajax looks menacing in fight sequences. Stefan Kapicic is unintentionally funny and Gina Carano looks hotter as Angel Dust. Other characters are hardly significant but they do bring some funny quotient into the movie. Deadpool is in-your-face new age cinema. You can love it or hate it. But it is here to stay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark humour with appreciable effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting is great overall, but what really makes the characters is the screenplay. Dialogues, comments, references, and conversations are superbly written and provides a light atmosphere to dark situations. I am not familiar with the Deadpool comics, but it seems that the film does follow closely to the comics. The humour is consistent throughout the film and brought something fresh to the abundance of superhero movies. This film is pretty explicit as there is quite a lot of (almost) nudity and a bit of swearing though it isn't totally overdone. I'm surprised that it is only rated as 15 and above, I would give it an 18 and above. There are quite a lot of adult jokes that young ones should not be exposed to. Additionally, I was not expecting the breaking of the fourth wall and was caught quite off guard. I generally do not like it because it triggers me out of the film, however after the initial shock it was used quite well. It adds to the character of Deadpool as someone very blunt and direct. The way that the screenplay explicitly mentions and refers to things that are not in the context of the film itself is what makes it unique. (A little teaser example: the beginning credits show a green lantern playing card) That is what primarily makes this film so entertaining to watch. Also, the visual effects and slow motion scenes are very well done. Right from the beginning, you get the sense that this a not a typical film. Not only is the film told from multiple points un- chronologically, but also slows down certain scenes, or even stops the time sometimes. I am very impressed with the beginning credits scene and how the camera moves through the different obstacles. A+ to the visual effects and editing team. The soundtrack also does great in complementing the mood and 'troll-like' humour of Deadpool. However there are certain ideologies at play in the film that I do not care for. For one, the girlfriend happens to be a stripper/prostitute -is that really the only profession that they could think of? Also, the cab driver, Dopinder, is Indian. Must we really depict all cab drivers as Indian? Other than that, I do not think there are other races portrayed in the film that get a significant part. Perhaps it was written in the comics, but that does not mean it has to be enforced in the film.Overall an entertaining film with excellent visuals, screenplay and great acting. It is just a little explicit at certain points and the stereotypes are a definite negative.</fullReview>

Having found some degree of stability in his violence-prone, unpredictable life, he receives some devastating news, but then undergoes a rogue experiment that grants him accelerating healing powers and the potential to become a superhero?that is if he can keep his thirst for vengeance and various other antihero qualities in check. Fans that've gotten tired of conventional origin stories will be surprised to find that this lacks any of the usual qualities of a traditional comic book tale; amusingly demented and unapologetically profane, with over-the-top violence and sexual underpinnings to boot, this earns its 'R' rating with a big smile on its face. Reynolds' ebulliently vulgar approach is perfectly suited to the material, and helps overcome any predictable story elements. Subversive, loud, flashy, and literally in-your-face this is certainly not for everyone, nor is it the most memorable film that the genre has ever produced, but it's a twisted guilty pleasure for sure. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the superheroes movie being one of the major blockbusters in the film industry. They were churning out a lot it every year, while trying to up the game with each new installment. Whether it be with more action, more explosions, more bigger and convoluted plot. A film like this shows that even a superhero movie doesn't need much of that to be a really good superhero movie. Of course I think "Deadpool" (2016) would have been better if it had a bit more budget to it. But it still gets the job done when it comes to the total package. I think one of the reasons why "Deadpool" was such a huge hit on it's opening week was because of it's refreshing take on it. Sure, it coming out on valentine's day might have played a part in that. But I personally didn't see a superhero or anti-hero movie such as this one. It literally breaks the 4th wall and goes all out. The makers of this movie really fought to get this movie to get greenlit especially the actor Ryan Reynolds. He fought for almost a decade to get this movie to be made, because he really liked the character Deadpool. The character Deadpool was born before the comic book came out and his name Ryan Reynolds. I can think of other actors that can play certain superheroes. However Ryan Reynolds is one of the few when it comes to no one being as fit for the role as him. He has been playing Wade Wilson in a lot of his movies, except now they gave him a costume and a healing factor and allowed him to have no restraints...And you have Deadpool. When it came to the plot and direction of this film, it did a really good job. Especially when trying to carry on the comic book style on screen and having the right balance of action, comedy and a bit of drama. However I wished they would have gotten more in depth in certain areas. It's sort of how I felt when watching the first "Iron Man" (2008) because it didn't show enough of Iron Man but that is only a small gripe. This movie does a lot of back and forth from the past to the present and for good reason. It's to keep the momentum going and keeping the story as fast-paced as it can be. It doesn't have a really well paced story but it's good enough and they did what they could with the resources they had in their arsenal. I mean they had nowhere near the budget of the "Green Lantern" movie which even Ryan Reynolds took shots at. However it's not really the story that makes this movie stand out, but it's the execution when it comes to the character "Deadpool" who is a fresh and very unique character that doesn't shy away from being wacky and fun when it comes to the Marvel universe on screen. While trying to stay true to the comic book source material a lot. And I thought they did a great job with that. I got the similar excitement, shock value and thrills from this almost to the level of "Kick-Ass". Except I liked "Kick-Ass" more when comparing to the first time I saw it in theaters. Overall, this is a balls to the wall, kickass superhero or anti-hero movie that I would recommend checking out. They really pull no punches when it comes to what they wanted to show with the R rating. "Deadpool" was a huge hit during opening week for different reasons.7.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Valentines Watch Deadpool A romance revenge storyIt's a surprise that a marvel movie is rated R and we should allow it because it restricts other movie like Guardians of the Galaxy from showing it's potential. Ryan Reynolds really loves Deadpool and totally becomes the anti-hero we love. It's about Wade Wilson having a sweet relationship with Vanessa but soon finds out that he has cancer. It gets better when he's recruited to "heal cancer" but turns out it's something darker. He does get to cure cancer his face is damaged because of Francis. Now society is disgusted with his face and cannot go back to Vanessa after fixing a messed up face. One solution, FIND FRANCISI like the constant 4th wall break and the adult humor but it could have been better. The director is a first time so some of the scenes aren't that memorable. Giggles and Laughs here, I guess it's hard to laugh at a cinema when you're the only one that get the joke. It's satisfying overall and I'm already for the upcoming sequel. It's the kind of movie that deserves multiple sequel. There's a message about heroes and anti-heroes here and Deadpool delivers it clearly.IT'S SELF-AWARENESS ACTS AS A SATIRE FoR The Superhero genre</fullReview>

There is some very adult humor so it's up to you if you want to bring the kiddies.Lots of great characters and one liners...loved the old school references, and the soundtrack was pretty cool! Great seeing Leslie Uggams as a wisecracking roommate!!! Great action scenes and then when it would start to get too serious, someone would say something to make us laugh...and we all laughed hard! I would definitely go see this again on the big screen! Can't wait for the blue ray and I wonder what kind of extras will be involved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So?it's not a remake of the Dirty Harry movie? I wondered where Jim Carrey was.If the incredible open credits for the "cast and crew," doesn't grab you, it's best you leave then. I couldn't stop laughing throughout the smart opening and never really stopped to the end. But, it wasn't just funny, it's brilliantly written, refreshingly crass in the goody two- shoe PG-13 superhero movie world and when there was action, it was extremely fun to watch.All thanks to Ryan Reynolds. A role he was born to play?uh, more than once, but definitely an improvement.The movie jumps all over the place with the origin and present day stories while telling the story of smartass Wade/Deadpool's journey from almost death to basically immortality. Oh, and despite his gift, he's destined to kill his creator and get the girl?back.I really can't wait to see this again. I know I was laughing so hard or marveling at some of the fantastic cuts to both this own studio (? la Family Guy jabs at Fox,) Reynolds' movies and himself and trying to watch both the action and humor to get everything in, in one viewing. And despite Reynolds playing this character before, I knew virtually nothing about him, so it was kinda nice going into this completely cold and leaving completely satisfied.It did help that the internet nearly blew up on the last portrayal of Deadpool. Personally, I didn't know any better when he showed up in X- Men Origins: Wolverine, and still didn't until this full-on origin story began here. I wasn't much of a fan of either the character back then or the movie, itself. I am now.Seriously hope they consider making more Rated-R superhero movies. This one was so great and will do so good at the box-office, maybe they will. See it!***Final thoughts: And speaking of Rated-R superhero movies, I rewatched another one of my favorite superhero movies of all-time last night, Kick-Ass. While I liked that one better than this one, both now are extremely high on my list of best superhero movies. Sadly, though, this one is gonna be tough to beat this year, especially with my personal favorite superhero, Superman, flying back into theatres next month. Unfortunately, I can't see myself liking that film more than this one? but who knows. Hopefully, I'm wrong and even though this one was excellent, it only goes up from here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why can't Deadpool get plastic surgery? It will solve his problem- normal face with super human abilities. In addition, he doesn't have to fight the bad guy; He can remain dead, get his girl, and live happily thereafter. But then there will be no Deadpool movie.Ryan Reynolds killed the movie. I don't think anyone can do a better job than him. The role comes naturally to him.The script is well written, and delivered even better. Soundtrack and songs are awesome. The idea of going back in past from time to time to tell the story doesn't make the movie monotonous. Well timed dialogs and some amazing action scenes make the movie enjoyable to watch.There is not much to the plot. The trailer pretty much sums it up.The car chase and bullet countdown scene are amazing. Add funny Ryan Reynolds to that. There is no shortage of jokes. The opening credits is different; And RR doesn't even spare the studio. Deadpool's friends, Negasonic Teenage Warhead; Dopinder; The Old Lady; and The BarGuy, compliment him well. My favourite scene is the trio walking to rescue the damsel in distress with DMX playing in the background score. Definitely a must watch.</fullReview>

His nature matches his colleagues nature at bar, both are excellent at par. Although deadpool rules. This role was meant for Ryan Reynolds. DeadPools girlfriend is gorgeous in every possible manner ;). The action sequences are exceptional. Villain is killed instead of getting imprisoned. A great movie in a budget little higher than 30 million dollars. Great work by the production studio, which is not marvel (to note).

The action is also quite well and literally kick ass. It has a love story in it. Dead Pool revolves around the concept of X-Men and it's also has two of them. Dead Pool the hero is an exact copy of The Mask of Jim Cherry, a funny yet stylish man with supernatural powers which are artificial in this case. Literally dead pool is a kick ass movie. just watch it and have fun. It will help you in forgetting the misery of daily life and teaches you to take life not so seriously.

		<fullReview>**POTENTIAL SPOILERS** A mercenary named Wade (Ryan Reynolds) is happily in love and just proposed to his girlfriend. However he finds out he has cancer. A mysterious man contacts him and says he can be cured of his cancer...but won't say how. Wade agrees to whatever treatment. He is tied down and tortured and pumped full of drugs by evil Ajax (Ed Skrein). It turns him ugly and into a mutant able to withstand any pain and a body that completely regenerates itself. He escapes and sets out to find Ajax and kill him. He wears a costume and calls himself Deadpool.Despite the synopsis this movie is actually quite funny. There are constant jokes by Reynolds and he's frequently breaking down the fourth wall and addressing the audience. There's also TONS of gratuitous violence but it's impossible to take it seriously with Reynolds constantly making jokes. It also has cameos by two of the X-Men and Stan Lee! However the sequence when we see Deadpool being tortured and shot full of drugs is not fun and Ajax is such a despicable villain the fun sort of drains out at times. However the final all out battle at the end makes up for it. So I liked it but it sometimes got too brutal. Still it is recommended. Also Reynolds is excellent in his role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It helps to bear in mind this movie's real purpose ? fan service for the infamous niche character's evident legions of followers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never read a single "Deadpool" comic book, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie. It's a fun, creative and ? unconventional entry into the "X-Men" film franchise that actually made me laugh out loud a few times. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.It isn't high art. It's got a thin story based on a rickety plot device, nearly no exposition, and it includes some cartoonish action that I thought was just too over the top, even by comic book movie standards. (Our hero dodges bullets and survives a stab to the brain.)It helps to bear in mind this movie's real purpose ? fan service for the infamous niche character's evident legions of followers. "Deadpool" isn't meant to be densely plotted, like "X2: X-Men United" (2003), or genuinely cinematic, like the Christopher Nolan "Batman" films. It's a long awaited, R-rated feature film to please loyal fans of this profane, adult-oriented antihero, who would be out of place and necessarily bowlderized in a mainstream superhero- teamup flick. (And I kinda get that ? I loved the "Wolverine" comics when I was a kid, and, trust me, his film incarnation is tame compared to its source material.)"Deadpool" is damn funny. The movie succeeds by making us laugh. And combining a raunchy comedy with an "X-Men" film gives it a weird, cool, subversive vibe. It makes you wonder if Stan Lee would approve of this sort of thing ? until you see Lee himself in a cameo at the story's strip bar. It's fun to know that dirty jokes indeed do exist within the "X-Men" movie universe.The lowbrow jokes made me cringe one or twice ("baby hand.") But you've got to give the movie credit for delivering its bathroom-wall humor if that's what the original character is about. (Are the comics like this?) Ryan Reynolds is genuinely funny, and his deadpan delivery is perfect. The film might not have even worked at all with out him.By the way, this movie actually reminded me a hell of a lot of a long-ago flick that I absolutely loved, but which I'm guessing is largely forgotten ? Andrew Dice Clay's "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane" (1990). That movie also had a foulmouthed, lone, maverick antihero who often broke the fourth wall, and that also made me laugh like hell. I know it sounds like a strange comparison, but they're very similar films.Finally, I'd like to think that the Wade Wilson we see here actually IS a version of the Wade Wilson that we first met in the widely lamented "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" (2009). (And how can he not be, if that movie is canon?) If "X-Men: Days of Future Past" (2014) rebooted the timeline, then the Deadpool we're rooting for here was never recruited, corrupted and experimented upon by William Stryker. So you can have your cake and eat it, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is a story about ex-special forces op Wade Wilson, now a mercenary, who contracts cancer and goes to a organization to have it cured. Unfortunately, the organization's goal is to make specialized soldier/slaves, and Wade turns into Deadpool, a man with incredible healing powers, and goes on a quest for vengeance on the man who mutated him/and to rescue his true love. The movie was first off hilarious. I was laughing practically the whole time. It was also a story with a good lesson about true love and never letting it go once you have found it. This is a good message. Sure the jokes feel strained once in a while, but Deadpool is a blast of laughing gas in a genre that sometimes takes itself too seriously. Deadpool may not be a perfect comedy, but it is a perfect Marvel movie. That's saying something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what I would want from a Deadpool movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I would like to start by saying that I was uneasy about this movie when I heard Ryan Reynolds was playing Deadpool. I was not really impressed by any of his superhero roles in the past, and bringing Deadpool is difficult to say the least . But thankfully I was so wrong about that, and Reynolds just proved that he was born for this. As for the movie, for the readers of the Marvel comics, there is not to much to say: it's the merc with a mouth in his beginnings. The movie will introduce some of the characters from the comics, while leaving some for the sequels. Maybe, from what I read, also for budget constraints. Also, we can make some assumptions on who will be the next villains based on the scene from the weapon X facility. There are a couple of minuses from my side: I would have like a few more X - men in the movie and also the insanity of the character is not fully exploited, but I hope that with the success of this movie the next one will have a bigger budget to include these things. I will not reduce the score for those though.For the non Marvel Universe readers, this movie is R rated for a reason. This movie is based on sex and violence. Also, I saw in previous that people had something about the 4th wall braking. This is one of the most important traits of the character, that he knows he is in a movie/comic and for our amusement. Please do not go to this movie if you are offended by nudity and F jokes, because you will hate every second of it, literally. And, if you decide to go to it, please do not take your child to it, hence R rate. This being said, for Deadpool fans, this is a must see movie. For other people, it will be a great movie if you are into pop culture and edgy jokes, otherwise, thread with care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five Word Review: Massively Enjoyable, Hilarious, Subversive, Disjointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even since before the character was mercilessly ruined in 2009's forgettable 'X- Men Origins: Wolverine', Ryan Reynolds (Buried, The Voices) has been passionate about bringing cult comic-book character Deadpool to the big screen, with all his profanity, violence, political incorrectness, fourth-wall breaking, and generally un-superhero-like behaviour. So here we finally are, with unknown director Tim Miller and the writers of Zombieland leading Reynolds along with Morena Baccarin (Firefly), Ed Skrein (Game of Thrones), TJ Miller (Cloverfield) and Gina Carano (Haywire) on his honourable quest to inject some variation into the superhero film market.Deadpool is a film that knows exactly what it is, which is evidence by the funny, tone-setting opening credits. It's far funnier than most comedies, more exciting than many superhero films, and just more plain enjoyable than most of today's cinema. Reynolds could not be more perfectly cast (other than, perhaps, H. Jon Benjamin, of Archer) in this role. Under the iconic mask his snarky, insulting tone mocks and swears, whilst his action-film-star look is highly appropriate. He even manages to lend some drama to the role. The writers - as acknowledged by the opening credits, the true heroes - have written a tight, quotable script that is bursting with one-lines that will be seen across a thousand internet comment chains for years to come. Alongside exciting action with some good violence - refreshing in increasingly kid-friendly superhero films - and glorious profanity, Deadpool is a welcome change and hopefully a gateway to more adult action films on the general market.It's obviously not perfect: it often feels disjointed due to its (admittedly admirable) desire to showcase all its talents at once, and not all of the jokes fully land. Nevertheless, Deadpool is one of the best superhero films I've seen in a while; remarkably enjoyable and a very good watch indeed. 80/100.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an age where comic book movies have taken the box office by storm, the genre had gotten to the point where it had gotten a little stale in terms of the modus operandi, when, thankfully for most of us, along comes "Deadpool". The character of Deadpool himself is a one-of-a- kind comic book character that not only subverts the genre, it goes balls-to-the-wall crazy in his portrayal that transcends its chosen medium and it is apparent to see how those ideals can be implemented in other forms of entertainment. These characters are treated seriously as they are a contemporary concept and perspective of what Greek mythology was in the past and it's understandable, but this does change the fact that these fantastic stories are meant to entertain and Deadpool embraces this ideal, not just to be unique, but as an entire embrace of the medium that can only be done if one does not stick to the guidelines set by the medium itself. As a fan of comic books, and a massive fan of Deadpool in general, this movie just made me so personally thankful that I am alive at a time when a franchise like this not only exists but is enormously successful while doing it.</fullReview>

So, as an individual movie it would be a 6/10.However, we are talking about a superhero movie and if I was judging every superhero movie based only to the above stuff, then every movie would be 5-6 stars. In a superhero movie you have to judge how true to the character and the origins it was. Deadpool was just as he was meant to be. It had violence, swearing and dirty jokes. His origins story was true to the comics. From that point I would give a 10/10.So, (6+10)/2=8 and that will be my final rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel's Greatest Movie So Far!! Deadpool arrives!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Fox Studios announced that it was making a Deadpool movie, the first thought that came to my mind was "Fox is going to destroy the movie, just like it did in Fantastic Four". Then the Red Band Trailer came out and my opinion changed completely. First I was skeptical and very negative, but after watching the trailer I started to think that Fox might actually pull it off. Ryan Reynalds already played Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and I have to say that the role suits him pretty well. But that was over 10 years ago, and nothing was done about it. The reason??? Deadpool's character is very violent, he uses swords to obliterate his enemies while simultaneously cursing them. In my opinion, a character like that just does not suit the PG-13 genre, so that movie will have to be R-rated. Unfortunately , R-rated movies do not generate high revenues as much as a PG-13 movie does, that's just the sad truth. So no studio decided it was worth the $60,000,000 (Comic adaptations usually cost around $150,000,000), and the production was put on a halt. Until Fox studios decided to take a leap of faith, and go ahead with production. Here's a summary for the plot, Wade Wilson (Played by Ryan Reynolds) is a former mercenary who is diagnosed by terminal cancer. Looking for a cure, an evil scientist"s experiment goes wrong leaving him disfigured with supernatural healing powers.This is Tim Miller directorial debut, and he definitely does not disappoint. However, the success is mostly down to Ryan Reynolds. What he did to the character Deadpool is equivalent to what Robert Downey Jr did to Iron Man. Sometimes a role is just made for you and sometimes it's not, and I simply don't think any actor could've done a better job. Highest opening weekend for a R-rated movie ever, and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes the highest grossing R-rated movie of all time. The record is currently held by "Fifty Shades of Grey" unfortunately ($571,000,000), and Deadpool has already surpassed $500,000,000 in 10 days since its release. This is a movie that works for comic fans and non-comic fans alike. It has everything, from action to comedy and most surprisingly romance. In this movie you'll find some of the most creative curses possible, and an action packed movie. Definitely exceeded expectations and seriously looking forward for a sequel if there ever is one. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anti-super hero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picture "Ted" as a superhero. That is how Ryan Reynolds plays it. He is a wise cracking foul mouth guy in a tight suit.The opening fake credits are great. The end credits and the "Ferris Bueller" after credit scene are worth staying for. Between the opening and end credits is a movie that can't decide on a genre. There is action, romance, comedy and science fiction. There is something for everybody but not enough for anybody. Morena Baccarin is interesting and easy to watch as the love interest.Leslie Uggams has more then a cameo as the blind side kick.There is an abundance of random violence that along with language justified the "R" rating. The construction of the timeline works and it isn't too long before you understand where Deadpool came from.The movie looks good on the big screen and should be seen in a theater. The abundance of violence mixed with comedy may not work for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Deadpool indeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all i would like to make a statement...this is the best movie i've ever seen in my entire life. It's got a whole bunch of elements related to comedy, drama, action, romance and much, much, more. This movie manage to bring one of the most hilarious fictional character from marvel's universe to life, in a terrific way. Ryan Reynolds is absolutely incredible as Deadpool, he just fits the character as if they were one. I went to the cinema without much of an expectation, and got out singing and laughing so hard. The soundtrack was amazing. The action scenes were incredible well done, with a lot of details. The comedy was just superb. The script there's no words to describe how good it was. Plus, this is the first time a character ever spoke to it's audience, at least in my "universe" of cinema experience, and it was just awesome. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys a good comedy or a good action movie or a good romance or a good drama or a good...well, this movie's got it all, just watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Comic Book Adaptation. And rated R for Humor not Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool was an amazing Adaptation. They did a great job keeping the source material correct while adding the flair to this movie. Just to be clear there is a ton of gore in this movie but the reason it is rated R is for Deadpool's foul sense of humor. So all these other wanna be superhero movies that are changing their rating to R don't understand why it means nothing. The Extra gore was nice in Deadpool but it was not the reason I went to see it. But back to our show. It is really amazing that Ryan Reynolds can play anyone else, because it seems like he was born to play this role and that comfort ability he has with Deadpool is one of the reasons this movie is amazing. It is full of vulgar humor, silly off the cuff one liners and amazing action. It meandering plot line keeps this movie fun the whole way through. Also there is a great adaption of Colossus in this movie. If you into action and vulgar humor this movie is for you. If they make a Deadpool sequel I hope the keep the entire team together- director, writers, Ryan Reynolds, and TJ Miller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool was just...WOW, when i walked out of the cinema i just couldn't believe how good it was as it had a small budget,was small scale and the movie was short for a superhero movie, but that's what made it good you can clearly see the director,producers and cast did great with the material they had. First off the humor..oh my gosh my humor was great,Ryan Reynolds is there perfect choice even before this movie we knew that(X-Men Origins Wolverine) and the dude brings the character to life with his portrayal .Even from the opening credits this movie starts to make you laugh and the first 10 minutes of this movie has the is best opening scene in a superhero origin story because origin stories are usually slow paced then improve to a faster pace, but this movie starts off with a fast pace and even when Deadpool isn't shown you never get bored because of the crude,rude humor,one-liners and characters in this movie. The rest of the cast's performances were good as well as the chemistry between Ryan's Wade Wilson and Morena Baccarin's Vanessa was great, you bought the romance these two characters had,cared for their relation as it was a weird and odd relationship.Wade's Friend Weasel was also decent comic relief and the two X-Men characters Colossus and Megasonic teenage warhead(yeah) fit perfectly into this movie.The villain Ajax portrayed by Ed Skrien was actually good, this guy was a generic bad guy, but worked for this movie as he was a threat to Deadpool and people around him(and the guy was an a**hole). What made this movie different from other superhero movies is the R-rating, at first i wasn't sure about it because from the trailers i thought they would go over the top with the R-rating, but i was wrong as this movie was better because of it, the gore,violence and of-course language was right for this movie even with some very EXPLICIT scenes it never feels out of place.The action was great, again the R-rating makes the action better and how can you not love a movie that opens up with an action sequence and one more thing to point out is even if this movie was part comedy it had some small scenes where the movie grew dark and i was really surprised by this because it fitted well and the intensity was amazing. Now the BAD, this movie had a few bad things about it like we all know Deadpool isn't a superhero more antihero because the man is a clear and there was this whole subplot in the movie where they tried to make Deadpool be a proper hero but you know it couldn't work as the subplot was just unnecessary and pretty obvious also i pointed out that the movie has good humor there are some scenes whereby the humor feels out of place at specially whereby the movie is supposed to feel intense it just doesn't work.Then there are some annoying filler moments whereby they tried to rub some humor but just felt unnecessary and of-course with a small budget comes some bad CGI at times, but rather than that this movie is perfect. Deadpool is the perfect origin story for the character as the movie is funny,action packed,weird and just fun,the studio made up for that monstrosity in X-Men Origins Wolverine(they shut his mouth),didn't go over the top with the R-rating and the movie was just fun despite the small budget.Superhero fans with love this movie and non-superhero fans will have a good time-BRING ON DEADPOOL 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing has ever prepared me for how awesome this movie turned out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Deadpool himself, I know that there are some portrayals that are not good as what Deadpool actually is, Deadpool in Hulk VS Wolverine is too serious, Deadpool in Ultimate Spider-Man was made immature and they messed up his back-story, Deadpool from Super Power Beat Down made him annoying and we all know what happened in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but in this movie, it's really awesome! Ryan Reynolds really does fit his role as Deadpool, going back on his other roles in movies, his humour fits well in here. I mean sure, this is just another revenge/origin plot, but in this movie, it makes it more interesting, the summary of the movie is. Title sequence, Deadpool in taxi. Meet Ajax, Deadpool leaked footage(only tweaked), Xavier's school for gifted youngsters, 12 Bullets, Origin part 1, Colossus meets up with Deadpool, Origin part 2, 127 hours spoiler alert, Origin part 3, continue. That is how most movies should be, normally it's like 40- 50 minutes until we see some proper action but in this, it makes it entertaining and to top it off the rated R thing really works so yeah, I'll be waiting for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a comic-geek (and longtime Deadpool fan): this movie gets it right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this movie. From the opening scene and credits to the films final climax, I laughed (mostly) throughout. I brought my wife with me to see this (she knows nothing about Deadpool) and she absolutely loved it as well - though she did have hard time with some of the violence.Parents be warned: this movie is rated R, it contains graphic violence, harsh language and nudity. If this is going to offend you (and especially your kids), THEN DON"T BRING THEM! I couldn't believe some parents were so dumb as to bring their 6-9 year olds to this - we saw about a dozen little kids in the theatre (and it was an 11:00pm show!)That being said, what made this movie so great is that everything was no-holds barred. The jokes were raunchy, the action was intense, and there were some VERY DARK and dramatic scenes where the villain and motives were established (his time with Weapon X), creating 10-15 minutes of quiet despair from the crowd.But this is why the movie is so great. As tough as those scenes were to watch, they weren't over-done like so many recent Tarantino films, and the humor came right back to wash away the bad taste. The fact that Deadpool is also constantly breaking the 4th wall makes for a very funny, intimate and entertaining film.The acting is top-notch. Ryan Reynolds is the perfect person to take on this role - he does the character proud, remaining faithful to the Deadpool comic character we know and love (throwing the tragic "Wolverine: Origins" Deadpool out the window). The supporting cast did an incredible job, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well Morena Baccarin played her role - I'm only used to seeing her in the "Firefly" series (VERY different characters).If you love the comic book, or are looking for an extreme action-comedy with some great drama thrown in - you will be wildly entertained by this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love this film, it was incredibly funny and a great movie. Ryan Reynolds played Deadpool spot on, at first I wasn't to sure about him playing that part but I was so wrong. This is the best movie I have seen this year up to now with out a doubt. Deadpool is not your everyday super hero he's just a sarcastic, hilarious powerful idiot and that is what makes him so different to any other super hero and is also why this films stands out too. The reason for only giving 8 stars is I think they flicked back and forth too much from past to present which I just think can be slightly annoying. Also I thought the main bad guy Ajax, played by Ed Skrein wasn't a good enough fight for Deadpool. The film did not show the full potential of the masked maniac. Overall I loved this film it was comical, full of action and had amazing graphics.This film is definitely worth the watch so go and get a big bag of popcorn and enjoy the film.Thank you for reading and I hope this helped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Blast! Most fun I've had with a Superhero film so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a superhero origin movie about Deadpool, who's more of an anti-hero. With all the great marketing and dedication by Ryan Reynolds and the team behind it, the movie had garnered immense hype and it was really pleasing to see the movie live up to it. Ryan Reynolds was born for this role. He personified Deadpool perfectly. He was simply amazing. Loved him. Aside from him, the secondary cast did a really good job as well. I loved Morena Baccarin as the love interest for Deadpool and very surprisingly, their romance subplot was handled very well, something that is very rare, especially considering I usually hate lovey dovey stuff. They had great chemistry and I would say they are probably the best superhero couple in my opinion after Spiderman and Gwen in The Amazing spiderman movies. T.J Miller as Deadpool's friend was great and had some really funny lines. Loved Colossus and the other teenage mutant, movie handled them very well. Hell, even the Indian cab driver guy was funny and good in his small role. From the awesome opening credits to the funny after credits scene, Deadpool was a blast. It was very tightly packed with little to no breathing room at all. The movie really flowed with jokes, action, romance etc, all interwoven very nicely. The movie was small in scale and I think it was a good thing. They focused on all the right points, mainly Deadpool, and it paid off. It had Deadpool's signature 4th wall breaks and humor and was perfectly crafted in the film. So many utterly hilarious moments in the film where I actually laughed out loud. I tell ya, I was having so much fun with this film that during half time, I could have sworn that only 15-20 mins have passed by. Seriously, the movie flew by me so fast, it was almost weird. It is almost 2 hours long and it felt like half that long. The movie is rated R, and it fully utilizes it. There is tons and tons of crude jokes and curses, Deadpool s*** talks here and there all the time. The action is bloody and gory. There is nudity and sex. I mean this is a Rated R movie through and through and it was just really refreshing to see a superhero movie like this. Plus, you can't do Deadpool justice in any other way. Relative to other superhero movies, Deadpool had a small budget, and it sometimes showed. CGI was a bit shoddy at times but the way they incorporated it in scenes and didn't made it a CGI fest, it looked mostly fine. The action scenes were great and entertaining. Villain was a bummer though. Ajax a.k.a Francis was just like the opening credits defined him, just some British villain guy. He was uninteresting, had little to no development and was evil for the sake of being evil. But funnily enough, he still worked for the movie cause all it really needed was a target for Deadpool and Ajax fitted that bill perfectly. So it's more of like a nitpick then a real negative but still I would have liked it if the villain was more fleshed out. All in all, this is easily the funniest superhero movie I have watched to date, beating Guardians of the Galaxy, and was also my funnest cinema experience so far. It's one of those rare movies that is made by fans for the fans but also caters to non-fans. I myself didn't know much about Deadpool but I still enjoyed the hell out of this film. It is great to see this film being successful cause now Fox, and hopefully other studios too, will take more chances and give the teams more freedom. I guess Fox redeemed themselves after that disaster of a film, Fant4stic. A must watch. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculously Entertaining Superhero Origin Story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is quite the time you can have well spent at the movies; an entertaining, funny, if somewhat dark first outing for a cult favourite Marvel Comics character. The movie isn't perfect, but really, what movie is completely flawless anyway? Deadpool kept me entertained from start to finish, and dare I say that I found this more enjoyable than Marvel's Age of Ultron? Well I'm sticking by that verdict.Deadpool is a breath of fresh air for superhero cinema and has a lot of blood to shed for newcomers to 20th century Fox's Xmen franchise. I didn't know exactly what to expect going in to the session, but boy oh boy does Deadpool deliver in terms of entertainment. It does get a little bumpy some of the time, but even after those little imperfect moments it never loses focus of its fourth-wall breaking and downright absurd take on the superhero origin setup story.Deadpool is worth the trip to the cinema: see it before he's all out of chimichangas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything hit home with Deadpool the story the action the comedy. I found myself going to IMAX to watch this film a second time and would enjoy many more viewings to really appreciate what the cast and crew were able to capture. I have started to purchase Deadpool movie swag and cannot wait for its release on Blu-Ray disk, I can't tell you that you will enjoy this movie, all I can really say is if you get a chance between work family and would enjoy a universe that functions with an R-rating see it. Deadpool is brought to life with the character staying true to what Wade Wilson / Deadpool is about. My only complaint is I don't own my very own personal IMAX. I would even type that I feel blessed being at the right age to see this movie, I would also caution younger viewers from see this film unless there with an adult. Thank you all the fans that supported this effort and the hard workers that put this on it has been without a doubt an enjoyable experience 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, violent, and irreverent superhero comedy that demands for your attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superhero films based on Marvel comics (as well as DC comics) are often subject for the most anticipated films of their years, and usually come out with impressively rich box office receipts. Although Marvel has came up with a few bad stinkers in the past, nearly any film that makes it way from Marvel Studios, or at least out of the Marvel comics are bound to be wide targets for box office galore. This superhero action comedy, directed by first-time director Tim Miller, stars Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson, an obnoxious New York City mercenary who meets the love of his life Vanessa (played by Morena Baccarin) and develops a strong relationship with her. His life with Vanessa becomes bumpy when he is diagnosed with cancer that is expected to end his life soon. However, he meets an artificially mutated scientist Francis Freeman a.k.a. Ajax (played by Ed Skrein) who proposes to perform an experiment on Wade to cure cancer, but ends up mutating him into a sickish red monster in the process. To matters worse, he kidnaps Vanessa with the intent on doing the same thing to her. So Wade slips into a wet suit and loads himself with abundance of firearms and ammunition to go after Francis and save the love of his life with the help of X-Men hero Collossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic) and his teenage trainee with mutant powers Negasonic Teenager Warhead (played by Brianna Hildebrand) at his side.Deadpool is a Marvel comics gun-totting, blade-wielding anti-hero known for his crass humor, and his tendency of breaking the fourth wall which he does in many scenes throughout the film. And just about everything this comic book character is notable is predominately present in the film. The film follows through the character's origin story like most of superhero flicks do nowadays, and before too long, pulls us in a series of hyper-kinetic action sequences full of bloody violence and crass (and profane) one-liners from the loud- mouth anti-hero. These scenes are utterly fun to watch and the hilarious dialogue this character brings leaves us with no choice but to laugh our heads off. Consisting of gleeful one-liners and clever pop culture references - - including Ryan Reynold's reference to his role in 'Green Lantern', the film never forgets to amuse the audiences with its silly off-the- walls humor while steering away from the mean-spirited nature brought from 'Kick-Ass', another comedic superhero known for its violent and profane material. In that case, this film is not the same child-friendly superhero flick like Spiderman or The Avengers children may expect; it is full of swearing and raunchy humor and definitely warrants parents not to take their children to see. Ryan Reynolds is surprisingly good as the titular character. He is astoundingly hilarious and charismatic on-screen, especially when he sports the Deadpool costume and breaking the fourth wall while in combat against the bad guys. His chemistry with Morena Barccarin who plays his lover is quite charming and works well. T.J Miller who plays Wade's bar tending best friend is also quite funny and delivers some hilarious lines in this scenes. Ed Skrein does quite a fantastic comedic performance as the main villains Francis along with Gina Carano as his sidekick Angel Dust. Its pretty safe to say that the film demonstrated an astonishingly well cast.Deadpool is a violent, crass, but wildly entertaining superhero action comedy that desperately deserves your attention, and is by far one of the best films this year so far. The movie is a big thrill ride for Marvel comic fans and an impressive achievement for a first-time director like Tim Miller. And it is worth mentioning, there is a post-credits scene, so you may not want to leave the theaters too early.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for superhero movies' fans, and for non-fans even more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indeed, this review is mostly for non-fans of superhero movies, because the fans probably saw it already and doesn't need this to know how good it is. Flawless logic, isn't it? They say the first twenty minutes are crucial, you can tell from them whether you're going to enjoy the film or not. Well, with "Deadpool", the matter is solved at the very first minute with what probably constitutes the most hilariously creative opening credit sequences ever, or let's say 'one of the', to stay on the safe side? although I really can't tell another opening that made me laugh like this one, or maybe "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". Anyway, I won't spoil it for all the IMDb badges in the world, but let's say, that it was the total opposite feeling than "'I expected nothing, yet I felt let down", This time, I expected something big and I was still blown away.At that moment, I never doubted I was going to enjoy it, I knew I could comfortably sink into my seat and I'll keep up smiling and laughing all through the film, I mean, one that manages to make you laugh in the credits sequences is like gently telling you "we care about you", yes, that's what it shows, a sort of special VIP dedication to the viewer, not to leave any detail unexploited for the sake of laughs. And it sort of borrows from the Python humor, it's anarchical, out of place, and spares nothing, not even self-derision, and I like that. And boy, the rest of the movie, with its fourth-wall breaking, its flashbacks, its constant nods to the audience never leaves you down, "Deadpool" is funny from beginning to end, credits included, and with a creative quality that is Oscar-worthy as far as screen writing goes.Now, remember, I said this review was for non-superhero movies' fans. Not that it's an issue if you love them but I have to warn you, you won't like me if I said I never loved superhero movies, apart from "Superman" maybe, and if there ever was a trend that annoyed me these last years, it was this overdose of Marvel adaptations. I grew up with Tintin, Lucky Luke, Asterix (French-Belgian school) so I loved my heroes ordinary or anti- rather than super. I know some superheroes are more off-hand and comical than others, but if you're not an expert, how will you tell them apart? There are just too many, and when I saw "Deadpool"'s trailer, I was like, here we are, another Spider-man clone. Yet the tone wasn't exactly the same, , but was it a spoof? I didn't even know the character existed in the X-Men universe so how can a preexisting character parodies the universe he belongs to? Now, do these things really matter? Probably not, the one thing is that the trailer looked funny, and the movie better because it's a signal when a trailer isn't really efficient, it doesn't throw all the gags inside just to mislead you. Now to the story, there's Wade (Ryan Reynolds) a retired Special Forces operative falling in love with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), an escort girl. So, they live a beautiful romance until he's diagnosed with the big C, and leaves Vanessa. Later, he bumps into an Agent-Smith like recruiter who informs him about a special treatment to cure cancer. Wade is treated by the sadistic Ajax and his female and generously-endowed sidekick Angel Dust. After a series of painful treatments and tortures, Ajax reveals his true intentions, turning Wade into a super-slave for wealthy customers. A final process of mutation leaves Wade totally disfigured but able to escape, and become totally indestructible. He needs Ajax to repair his face and while Ajax can't touch him, he takes on his most vulnerable spot: Vanessa. So, Deadpool, with the help of a colossal version of the Tin-Man (without the ridiculous hat) and a malcontent teen who looks like a mix of Sinead O'Connor and Daria, Deadpool is off to save Vanessa.I can hear the déj?-vu bells ringing, but just because the film swims in familiar waters, doesn't mean you're going to drown in an ocean of clichés. Well, there are clichés, actually, who am I kidding? But it's all in the treatment and the writing, and the film acknowledges that the writers are the real heroes, and for reasons: self-derision is the greatest mark of humor and there's something very refreshing in the way the film ridicules its own material, that's exactly how "Kick-Ass" started before going downhill with a violence that took itself seriously. "Deadpool" never does and that's what a superhero movie should do. By becoming ridiculous in purpose, from the start, "Deadpool" is even brilliant and creates a precedent that will make hard to take other superhero movies in a serious light, but in a way, it's a kind of reboot in tone of the superhero sub-genre.And apart from the writing, I also credit Tim Miller's directing for never letting the action steal the fun's thunder, in fact, the way the action sequences are choreographed serves the comedy, not the opposite, and that's a feat you rarely see achieved in movies. The film has a few slower moments here and there, but just when you get the feeling that it's getting closer to the typical material, you realize it's only 'serious' interludes before the fun picks off again.So far, "Deadpool" is this winter's winner, and I suspect this is going to break the billion record, because it's the perfect 'word of mouth' movie, I know I can recommend this film, because I know people who're fans of superhero movies, and these are the ones I'll immediately tell to go watch the film because I don't want them to misjudge the film. It is that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big risk and a bullseye.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel simply fails to bore me. I mean, seriously, X-Men, Spiderman, Captain America, The Avengers and now, Deadpool. Deadpool is a film that combines both bloody action and comedy. It is a great mix that a fairly low number of films get to achieve. Kind of reminds me of the last year's Kingsman. As for the story, it is, by no doubt, one of those typical superhero stories. I mean, every superhero starts out somewhere, right? Peter Parker got bitten by a spider, Captain America was in some sort of a Mengele project and here is Wade Wilson, turned into an immortal freak who is both a pervert, a family man and a butt-kicker.The entire styling move where the main character knows that he's in a movie (not to mention that basically Ryan Reynolds plays himself who plays Deadpool aka Wade Wilson) is in most of the films just a downfall and just fails to deliver. However, Deadpool uses (mentions) this concept at a very low and mid-frequent rate that someone would say it's barely noticeable, but it still is quite much noticeable. These little details tell a much more detailed story about Deadpool, because let's face it, not that many people have heard or read a single thing about him before the film was announced last year. As for the side characters, there always has to be someone who is mocked by Deadpool. But this is not a group from another universe, this is all an 'inside job', and when I say that, I mean by Marvel only. A chroma plated, metal headed robot/human in a metal suit and a girl with quite undefined super powers are quite a treat. They don't appear as much, but when they do, the best action happens. Taking everything into consideration and my review not being complete, I have to say I really enjoyed watching this film at the movie theatre. I do recommend you watch it with your partner, since Deadpool isn't just a superhero movie, it's also a love comedy that is even better than most of the mentioned-genre movies out there. Deadpool - 8/10</fullReview>

Because of the last stage of cancer, the hero, Wilson agrees to to an experiment which can survive him so that he can live a life with his love. But, experiment goes wrong and though he becomes a mutant but his skin becomes very ugly. So, he plans to find Francis who can solve the problem of his skin. But, Francis is also a mutant, so the battle between the hero and the villain begins. And this is the story of this film! Comedy is super cool. Film looks like a pure paisa-wasool masala. It has all double meaning dialogues, and in Hindi, they are just too good. We can feel that these are our own! Two X-Men characters are there, too. Not more, because of the producer's limited budget! Hehe!Very sharp editing and some scenes are fantastically made with the use of graphics. And don't forget to watch the teaser of the second part in the end, after the end credits. Believe me, it is really funny.So, one more superhero is in the market. This movie is creating records and collecting money. Sequels will be definitely made. Let's see how long will it go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solid enough story. Hated the flash back type of stuff. Seems to be the way to do things these days. Flash between a couple stories much like a lot of TV shows. This however didn't need it, it was all part of the one story. If this movie was set out more linear it would have been a more enjoyable watch. This could have allowed a more streamlined and thin story setup. Which, unless you were living under a rock at the bottom of the ocean you would have KNOWN the re-gen, cancer stuff anyway. Which brings me to the Trailer, a lot of the good gags are in it along with pretty much 90% of the story points you need. The ending although somewhat witty did lack any substance. Action packed for the sake of it with all the destruction.All in all a decent 8 movie. Could have done with some more GORE and relational remarks/interactions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wanna see a different kind of Love Story. Instead of Ryan O'Neil there's the madcap Canadian Ryan Reynolds as "Deadpool'...and don't go here expecting to see Clint Eastwood either. This movie is worth the price of admission for the opening credits and taxi ride/bridge scene alone, then things get turned up to eleven. Deadpool fan boys (and the odd comic shop girl) know he's one mean mother ex-special ops soldier who's been transformed into an anti- hero in a secret lab, but the end result makes him look like an avocado had sex with an older avocado or a testicle with teeth. In other words he's totally indestructible, but completely unlovable to the opposite sex. Watching DP generate body parts (any body part) is cool and nasty. Marvel movie goers will love this addition to the gang, but be warned this is X-rated X-Men with sex scenes, offensive language the works and not for an audience under 15.(MA rating) If you want to see an expert with Katana Swords and Roombas you've come to the right screening. In addition to Deadpool you'll meet his deadpan mate Weasel played by comedian T J Miller (hilarious). On the fight stage he's joined by the big chrome Colossus and a female teenager with the coolest name ever all from Professor X's Ponderosa that get's destroyed every couple of years. His room mate (he found on Craigslist) is a 70 plus blind lady who loves flat packs from Ikea and reeks of old lady pants. The wonderful Leslie Uggams is back. Deadpools man crush on Wolverine and our Hugh Jackman is a funny thread throughout the movie. This movie learned how to make a great soundtrack featuring Juice Newton, Salt'n'Peppa, Neil Sedaka and Wham! from the Guardians of the Galaxy play-book. Deadpool is the funniest movie of the year (to date)...4.5/5 stars easy...it really is a total game changer for Super Hero movies. PS: don't leave the cinema till the lights come on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Punch This One Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just flat out an excellent film. It satisfies the Marvel characters really well, and it put out humor even faster than the action, which is a good thing. The film jams lots of punch into it's nearly 2 hour running time. The 2 Marvel writer who wrote this script seem to really be hitting their stride. It seems like this one has the pace of a run away train, but it stays completely on track and does not derail.This one take full advantage of the action and spaces it well with the humorous banter. It aids some neat graphics as well. The CGI action is impressive here, very realistic. The script take advantage of the humor between the characters very well. Deadpool is immortal, and that makes it possible to do almost anything with them. They never even seem to run out of jokes. With the double meanings of many of the jokes making them even better, this movie really does most everything right.This is how to design and execute an entertaining film. Highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In what may become the surprise of the year, if not the last few years, Deadpool may also change the way comic book films are made. This film broke many boundaries, and is a risky movie. It broke the fourth wall, and is not a film for kids, as comic book films tend to generate towards. This may also be the funniest comic book film ever, literally every 5 minutes the crowd in the theater was laughing at the over the top puns, and references. The next thing to talk about is Ryan Reynolds in what may be his best role to date. He is perfectly casted as no one else can pull this role off like he did. As for everyone else, they were forgettable and that's all I'm going to say about it. Other then that this film is worth checking out. Now to grade.

		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds has been trying his hand at super hero film for a while now...with varying degrees of success (not totally his fault). But I have to take my hat off to him for this time. The amount of effort alone to get this film made right and market it deserves all the kudos.THE FILM IS GREAT. If you don't understand deadpool you might think this film on the immature silly side...it is but that is deadpool that I love. Who cares if the story is simple or silly, this film is fun from start to finish. So if your going to watch deadpool, leave your adult pants at the door and just enjoy the outrageous puns, the flamboyant deaths, gratuitous swearing. It's just deadpool...read the comic or play the game...you will understand.</fullReview>

The Deadpool character is very well displayed just like in the comics. To talk about acting, Ryan played a massive role in acting. Even though most of the time he will be under mask, the bonding with character is great. So much fun stuff, this makes us watch movie again and again. I really miss 3D. But it doesn't matter anymore.

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Groundbreaking, Risky Superhero films in Years,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast that are also very able to be dramatic when it's necessary. It's a Marvel movie, connected with the X-Men series, but it is so very different, not just from superhero films, but from any other movie out there, it's funny, it has a surprising amount of heart, it's action packed and extremely violent, they certainly took advantage of the R rating. The best part about the movie is undeniably the main character and his ability to break the fourth wall, we have seen it before but never to a degree as extreme as this, he interacts with the audience, makes reference to the movies cast, the low budget, it's a terrific device that makes Deadpool such a fun, lovable character. The only problem I really had with the movie is that the character's origins are overdeveloped, it drags on for a long time, showing us how he met his love interest and how he became immortal, it was necessary but it did not need to be as detailed as it was. The cast is all around terrific, all entirely understanding of the blunt humour of this series, Ryan Reynolds shines in the lead role, of course, as he's been trying to get this movie off the ground for years, and his passion for the character is very evident, he is also joined by the likes of Morenna Baccarin, T.J. Miller, Stefan Kapicic and Ed Skrein, who all did a stellar job with their vital roles. Intense, violent and absolutely hilarious, Deadpool is easily of the best, certainly the funniest, superhero movies out there, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy. After an evil organisation kidnaps his girlfriend, it's up to Wade Wilson, a man who has gained immortal powers and given the superhero persona of Deadpool, to save her. Best Performance: Ryan Reynolds</fullReview>

It is not like any superhero movie. It has everything you want in a movie. It is like a romantic comedy, action packed, gory film which will leave a mark in your brain and will send you home laughing your ass off. It is R-18 but I think kids can watch it too with adult supervision of course. Ryan Reynolds was born to do this and I do not or cannot see anyone else do Deadpool. And the soundtrack is too cool for school. That rhymed eh! lol big shout out to the producers, crew, and the actors who made this movie one of the best movies ever made.

		<shortDescription>A different Kind of Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel comic's unconventional superhero hits our big screen just before Valentines day, a life saver if you forgot that special day ! So style it out and take your woman to the cinema if you want to kill two birds with one stone! The first is that you can take your 'bird' or loved one to see a movie that is a chick flick which has all the ingredients of a love story and the second is that you get see a dick flick that has all the ingredients of an action packed adventure as you would expect from a Marvel Comic movie.The ladies will love this cheesy , tongue in cheek humor with a dash of ahh in it and the male counterparts will be thankful that Deadpool was macho enough to go with your bae and enjoy not only the movie but the fantastic soundtrack .Ryan Reynolds who plays Wade/Deadpool brings this superhero to life with dignity. In a dead end job as a Mercenary, Wade falls in love with Morena Baccarin who plays Vanessa, dreaming of a better life with her, until he is diagnosed with cancer. He decides to leave her to give her the opportunity to live a better life without him and takes the help of Ed Skrein who plays Ajax to cure his cancer and giving him super powers ,as he was a dead man walking so he had nothing to loose.I must say for an 'overpaid' director (you have to see the opening credits ) this movie is worth every barrel of laughter. This anti superhero will have you laughing crying and squeegeeing all at the same time. There are some scenes that are bloody and pretty gruesome but quickly followed by a snare remark to distract you from what you have just witnessed. Make sure you sit through the credits as the humor does not end until the very end.I loved the soundtrack for Deadpool from Junkie XL ("Mad Max: Fury Road") has scored the movie to DMX's "X Gon' Give It To Ya" tracks from Salt-N-Pepa to Neil Sedaka, and Wham! .

		<fullReview>I'll be simple. I loved this movie, not only because it was really funny, also because it had all the elements that it needed to be the perfect deadpool movie. I don't give it a 10/10 because of the origins story, maybe too long and some plot holes here and there, but the rest was pure deadpool perfection. I haven't seen a movie this good of only one superhero in Marvel since Captain America: Winter Soldier. Considering only the $60 million of their budget this was surprisingly good. The R rated helped a lot, hope we could see more R rated movies of superheros.This movie took a lot of risks and it paid off. Crushing the box office in the oppening weekend, making it in the top 30 of biggest oppening weekend in history. All of the acting was perfect, I liked all of them not a single person had bad acting, hope deadpool 2 could be just as good as this one, I'm totally going to watch this three or four times more, hope Hollywood keeps doing movies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brand of humor is a little reminiscent of Family Guy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like I've been hearing about the character of Deadpool for a long time before I saw this movie so having seen what he is all about, there is not much I would boast about. It is certainly entertaining, but basically isn't much to remember. Although the beginning credits are clever, which are basically of generic names given instead of the particular names of the cast and crew; this overall implies my feelings regarding the rest of the movie: apathy. I may not be as gung-ho as perhaps some others, but generally, I would say it's worth it, especially on the big screen. The storytelling hops back and forth during the first half and then pretty much goes into a straightforward narrative in its second half. I think that is one of the reasons why I like the first half better than the second half because its style made things interesting. Then the plot gets muddled halfway through and it is slowly realized that it's a standard revenge film. Personally I think there was too much comedy, which kind of drags it down a bit. The humor is essentially a cross between Ryan Reynolds's charm and the Family Guy series. It runs a little thin after a while.I'm not really a fan of comic books and the movie adaptations are usually take it or leave it, but I found myself mostly intrigued. Not saying I am a big fan of his but to a degree I think it helps to like Ryan Reynolds. Also it's R- rated, which in these days is certainly an interesting concept especially in the way of a comic book movie revisions. From my understanding they wanted to stay true to the source material and for that I congratulate them. He plays a likable mercenary who safeguards teenage girls from would-be stalkers. Then he meets up with an escort with whom he develops a relationship with. Later on, he finds out he has terminal cancer and agrees to undergo an experimental procedure that goes horribly wrong. Then he sets out for revenge on his captor, and then things get really personal when his girlfriend is captured, and there is the final showdown at the end. That's it in a nutshell. It seems with these types of movies, there's no real imminent danger. The fight scene particularly in the end, I couldn't help but think that it could be never-ending. They're all pummeling each other and then again they're basically superhuman. I like this film a good deal but it's not without its criticisms. Overall grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastically entertaining from opening credits to post-film teaser!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A barrage of action and humor blend seamlessly providing an immensely entertaining experience. The story features basic themes of love and revenge, with well-paced flash-backs to the origin of Wade Wilson as he becomes Deadpool, but is refreshingly unique and original. Both in and out of costume, the star provides laughs. Deadpool is no typical movie adaptation of a comic book character; it's nowhere near family-friendly like Spiderman or The Avengers. This one is R rated and intended for mature viewers who enjoy extremely immature comedy, in addition to over the top violence. It's not for kids, except the ones with 'cool parents' of course. Director, Tim Miller, strongly impresses in his first feature film. The CGI effects are well-utilized and Deadpool's signature style of breaking the fourth wall is a frequent treat. The plot and pacing provide a steady stream of fun. The film has its clichés like any, but makes fun of them to viewers as they occur, turning anything generic into a laugh. Be prepared for a vulgar, perverted and crude humor with over-the-top violence. If nudity or sex scenes offend you, then beware. The satirical humor can be dark and twisted similar to South Park at its most extreme. Not all the comedic dialog lands flush, but the creatively colorful dialog keeps the laughs coming. Ryan Reynolds feels perfectly cast as the quick-witted anti-hero. Ed Skrein stars as the antagonist/villain, Ajax. Although the character is a prototypical British baddie, his back and forth with Reynolds is great. Actor T.J. Miller provides comedic support as the best friend, Weasle. Morena Baccarin, who plays the role of Wilson's girlfriend, Vanessa, impresses in a silly, fun role in stark contrast to her work in Homeland. As Deadpool, he has another pair of supporting characters in the form of X-Men, Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The former is played by Stefan Kapicic and Greg LaSalle, who split the work between voice and physical acting. The Latter, who I'll call NTW, is Brianna Hildebrand, who pulls it off well. This movie is not for the easily offended, and not to be taken seriously. Entertainment value is what counts, and Deadpool has it in droves. Disclaimer: I am not responsible for the corruption of any innocent souls that may result from watching Deadpool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no denying Deadpool is hilarious, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool has outperformed all R-rated movies at the box office this weekend, and audiences couldn't be happier. After all, it is a gamechanger for the types of movies studios might take risks on. Additionally, everyone seems to love it. But is it actually any good?Even before the first line of dialogue, Deadpool kicks off with a bang, with a hilarious and appropriate opening credits sequence. The action that follows is equal parts brutal and comedic, and soon, Deadpool takes us back to the beginning of his story. As a matter of fact, he tells us he's going to do that.From the opening scene, Deadpool would appear to break all the rules- breaking the fourth wall, spewing countless profanities in a superhero movie, and having that superhero actually be a murderous psychopath- but in fact, Deadpool is structured like many superhero movies from before Marvel Phase II. It's an origin story, and despite its constant barrage of jokes that poke fun at many of the tropes of superhero movies, Deadpool is actually pretty conventional. This aspect I found to be rather disappointing, because in any meta-film, all the rules can be broken because they exist in our world too. Yet, Deadpool remains confined to the world of the screen, despite acknowledging a world outside of it.Still, that doesn't mean Deadpool isn't a fun film. Outside of a brief respite in the second act, nearly every line of dialogue has a punchline, and there's no joke too low-brow for Deadpool to touch on. This movie is as crass as they come, like many R-rated comedies of recent years. What sets it apart is that the script is so air-tight and fast-paced, it never feels like it's reaching for jokes. Rather, it feels as though the writer tapped into the devil on everyone's shoulder and channeled it every nook and cranny of the script. Anyone who has sat through any superhero film, even if they loved it, has at some point felt indifferent about the genre and its tropes as a whole, and Deadpool mocks every single of those tropes, despite also using them as the vehicle for its plot.The movie is funny enough that even conservative types who don't enjoy low-brow humor will burst out laughing at least once in the film. There's no denying the movie is hilarious. However, I feel the movie really shines in its second act, when things start to get real. The characters, who were previously one-dimensional are actually given some depth. It's a sobering few scenes in a movie drunk with comedy. It proves that the writers are even smarter than the humor of the film, and honestly, could have made a better film. Instead of delicately balancing the hilariousness of the first act, and the darker humor and drama of the second act, it returns to pure comedy for its third act, and it starts to feel a little past its welcome. There's a lot of potential shown in glimpses, or entire scenes of Deadpool, that go largely untapped in the final act when it retreats into familiar territory.Perhaps, in a movie so blunt, the writers felt it best to play it safe in the narrative structure of the film. After all, the studios took a big risk and were often worried about the film. They wanted to make it PG-13. They cut $7 million from the budget shortly before production. They were worried it would fail. Its enormous success has proved them horribly, horribly wrong. Perhaps the writers will up the ante for the second film. I hope they do, because for all the enjoyment I felt watching Deadpool, I also felt letdown. Whether you feel as I do, or hate the film, or love it, Deadpool's success is extremely important to the movie industry as a whole, which has been dominated by the monotonous churning-out of safe, formulaic superhero films, and hopefully that will give the writers more room to take even bigger risks in the inevitable sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool has come at the perfect time. With the current superhero obsession we've seen at the cinema, a film like Deadpool is the perfect antithesis to the over saturation of comic book adaptations. He's a crude, rude pun-making machine, who also has an affinity for breaking the fourth wall, addressing the audience directly.We've seen Ryan Reynolds take on comic book characters before, but gratefully, so has this movie. Deadpool is constantly self-aware, satirically meta, and hilariously open about Reynold's past misfires. It was beautiful to see a film directly discuss what we're already thinking in our head.Deadpool works as pure action entertainment, as well as an over-the- top comedy. It's a revenge tale, a love story, an origin story, and a damn good time. Justice has finally been done to the "Merc with a Mouth." Is it the next Citizen Kane? No. Is it the perfect Deadpool movie? You bet.</fullReview>

Rarely if ever does this film lose momentum and Deadpool is always engaging. Merging sarcasm, charisma and brutal fighting skills the anti superhero Deadpool keeps us guessing and on the edge of our seats. It's a thrill ride you won't wanna get off of.

		<shortDescription>This is a different kind os superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This is a different kind of superhero movie" Deadpool announces to the audience at the beginning of the movie. This is half true. First of all it's true because when he has his red mask on Deadpool is absolutely insane, sarcastic, and hilarious: the Deadpool we know and love. Unfortunately the movie decides to give up this original nature to go the boring way for 2/3 of this movie. After some excellent and hilarious first scenes, the movie shows us Deadpool's origin story. The trailer summarizes the unnecessary clichéness of this story to you in the 30 second trailer. I was sad to see this movie completely adhere to the superhero movie mold. Gets turned into a superhero, His girlfriend gets captured + he wants revenge so he goes to kill the bad guy. One exception was the fact that he does kill Francis in a completely Deadpool manner. Francis the villain, is a fair match to Deadpool and an awesome menacing psychopath. The absolute pro of this movie is the comedy: when Deadpool is in the red suit his humor is absolutely hilarious and so is his attitude and pretty much every scene he's in. The action scenes were pretty awesome but they were a little choppy at times. Most of it was expertly made though.The action scenes and the Deadpool humor and personality really make this movie special. The fact that it (almost) completely fits the superhero mold is unfortunate. There's definitely more pros than cons so you should probably go see it if you're a Deadpool fan or enjoy superhero movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many problems with this move, especially if all the jokes that didn't hit are allowed to be counted as separate problems.Look, comedy is hard. Action comedy is especially hard, and Deadpool is a dark comedy comic book hero. It should not be surprising that the movie based on him can be pretty stupid at times. Some jokes are genuinely funny, but a lot of them are just dumb. Of course, if you are the kind of person who thinks, "So what? Dumb can be good," then this argument has not much of a leg to stand on.However, while the quality of the humour is in the eye of the beholder, its life expectancy can be judged more harshly because a lot of the humour is pop-culture topical, referencing various celebrities or obscure movies, which means that this movie is not going to be nearly as enjoyable a few years from now. Even now it can be sometimes hard to perceive for those who are not into superhero movies.It is not only the humour but the whole movie feels that way: like it will not be relevant or remembered a couple of years from now. It does things like introduce the X-men academy and characters from the X-men universe without explanation because it expects you to know those things, which in turn makes the movie feel like a stop gap between some two other bigger superhero movies.Then there are some standard superhero movie plot oddities. Why does Deadpool put so much effort in trying to avoid bullets, considering his superpower? How did one of the characters who is not a superhero, manage to survive what should clearly be a fatal fall? Do we really need another "I got your girl" villain? All of this does not break the movie though because Deadpool is still a good movie, all things considered. I found it to be less enjoyable for the comedy and more for being a pretty good standard super hero movie. The acting is good if you do not mind Ryan Reynolds' delivery; The chemistry between characters is good; The villain is very shallow but surprisingly charismatic; and the action looks cool.Could it be better? Yes, the jokes could be less corny, the camera work during the action could be clearer, the fighting choreography could be less bland and less reliant on CG, some of the plot points could be less cliché, but as it is, Deadpool is still worth a watch, and worth making a sequel to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess if Ant-Man and of all people can get his own movie (and a pretty good one at that), then Deadpool can finally get his own movie. Luckily, Fox bounced back from its monumental flop Fantastic Four last August with the pretty decent R-rated comic book flick Deadpool. In Deadpool, Wade Wilson is a mercenary in New York City when he meets a woman named Vanessa at a local bar. They hook up, and a year later, Wade pops the question with a ring pop which she accepts. Wade then collapses and is later diagnosed with terminal cancer. One night at the bar, he meets a recruiter from a secret program who offers an experimental treatment for his cancer. Wade declines and leaves, but he later reconsiders the offer and leaves Vanessa in the middle of the night to receive the treatment. The procedure involves getting tortured for weeks on end until a mutation occurs, and Wade is severely disfigured in the process, although his cancer is cured, and he's practically immortal. Wade escapes the facility that looks exactly like the torture chamber in Hostel and vows revenge on the person who did this to him. Oh, and somehow he's aware that he's in a movie. For all its intents and purposes, Deadpool is a very fun and sometimes funny movie, although not all the jokes hit, and it gets a little exhausting towards the end. The ridiculous, over-the-top violence also makes the movie unnaturally entertaining for a comic book flick. Hopefully more R- rated superhero movies are made in the future. Deadpool's ability to break the fourth wall also makes the film more interesting, but it causes the plot to suffer somewhat. A lot of the backstory is told by Deadpool in flashbacks, causing the film to jump around in time a lot. Deadpool may not be the crowning achievement of comic book movies, but it's entertaining enough to watch in the theater. I'm sure it'll be the perfect movie for 12 year old boys' slumber parties after their parents have gone to sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So finally seen the movie i have been waiting ages to see i was first was introduced to Deadpool around 4 or 5 years ago by my older brother I read a few comics over the years and i was hooked and he is my second favourite marvel hero first being Wolverine but I will say that in movie form Deadpool comes first he would probably say that to ha ha.On to the movie I found it very well executed I loved the opening credits simply because it's all about tongue and cheek and not taking it seriously the action sequences were really great to watch really over the top same goes for the jokes I couldn't stop laughing the bit with the hand growing back had me nearly in tears with laughter and the ORGINS WOLVERINE toy was a nice touch.I will say though that the story was a bit lacking and the villain was done poorly but not to enough to spoil the movie.The introduction of Colossus and warhead was great I liked the new version of Colossus really looks from the comics I would say this anyone who does not know the character and wants to see this movie go and research on him and then see how you feel about going to see the movie and always go with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Welcome Change.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a loyal comic book fan I found this a pleasant change from all the recent pg kiddie films. The action scenes are spectacular. The humor is adult and mature. Visuals are also stunning and good for its budget.Deadpool is at his best. That being said Deadpool certainly sets the bar higher for future comic book films. The character is fully utilized and is a direct translation from his comic book counter part.Ryan Reynolds does a superb job as the "merc" with a mouth and delivers on all aspects! Watch out Avengers there's a new hero in town and he ain't playing! A must watch for any person who wants a dark mature comic book hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Merc with a Mouth Finally Opened His Mouth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a movie directed by Tim Miller and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. It stars Ryan Reynolds, Ed Skrein, Morena Baccarin, and T.J. Miller along with Karan Soni, Brianna Hildebrand, and Stefan Kapicic.A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool.I didn't like Deadpool. I didn't love Deadpool. I adored Deadpool. To me Deadpool is the height of Marvel entertainment as it keeps the essence of the iconic character while weaving together a thoroughly engrossing story.This movie's story has everything needed to build a pop cultural masterwork. It finds its heart and originality in in its vulgarity and hubris, much like its main character. This sets it apart from any other superhuman movie ever movie, at least in my opinion. This is thanks in large part to the snark and acid wit demonstrated by the writers or "the true heroes of this story."Though decidedly scatter-shot and a tad bit convoluted, Deadpool's writers over come these minor hiccups with mighty style, showcasing their ferocious flair. Ready and willing to please, these two fine men manage craft a movie that has both humor and depth. A feat like no other.Though the wit, self reference, genre subversion, and fourth wall breaks demonstrated in this movie did impress me, the one facet that really sealed the deal, as Wade would say (perhaps in a different context), for me was the love story. In most if not all action/comedies there is a romance. In most if not all action/comedies the romance falls flat and seems overly clichéd. This is not the case as Vanessa and Wade's romance feels earned, thoroughly sweet, and really fleshes out the characters, leading to some seriously tense and emotional scenes in a movie that utilizes the phrase, "less angry Rosie O'Donnell."The credibility of the love story and the nonstop humor behind it is only furthered by the two dedicated performers, Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin, who display their seamless chemistry 'marvelously.'Another attribute that seemed thoroughly seamless was the pace of this movie. Constantly speeding but never exhausting, Tim Miller, manages to create perfect shot after perfect shot. Never overusing certain techniques and avoiding altogether dreadful uses of shaky cam and other equally annoying and lazy techniques first time directors often use, Tim Miller proved to filmgoers everywhere that he has a long and prolific career ahead of him. Through this movie, Ryan Reynolds has finally proved that, he too, has a long and prolific career ahead of him. Dawning the challenging role of the iconic and universally loved Deadpool, Reynolds offers his best work to date, bringing his trademark charm and enthusiasm to the profane 'Merc with a Mouth.' He is truly the shining star of this glimmering mess. He played the role so well I really can't think of anyone else to play the part, a feat only previously achieved by a handful of talented actors. He fit so snugly into the part that I can really see a possible Globe win for him in the already planned sequel.Accompanying Reynolds, Morena Baccarin delivers a surprisingly heartfelt turn as Wade's love interest, Vanessa. Far from elementary, Baccarin brings out the complex emotional states of her character and Reynolds'. Ed Skrein was really the only wild card in the lot as I wasn't sure how original they could make the 'Evil British Villain' cliché. Luckily for the Transporter:Refueled star, he was given a genuinely decent role as the perpetual thorn in our outlandish hero's side.Overall I can confidently say that Deadpool has quickly become my second favorite comic book ever made, barely lacking behind The Dark Knight. Deadpool Gets an A+ or a 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far the hardest that I've ever laughed in a theatre. The movie does have a weak plot and the villains could be better, but that doesn't affect my rating much because the movie made up for it by doing everything that they did do perfectly. I give it a 9.7/10 but I'll just round it up to 10. I highly recommend the movie, but you probably won't like it if you are sensitive to violence . I Also would not recommend it to children, although it was not as vulgar as a film as I anticipated,it is still definitely for an adult audience. Everyone in my theatre applauded the film afterwards, including me. I'm just rambling because I loved this movie so much, but I should probably sum things up. It was hilarious, action packed, fun, and without a doubt Deadpool</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool: "I never say this, but: "Dont swallow"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HI GUYS! I Don't want to spoil a thing, so im going to talk about some aspects of the movie and rate them.THE Cinematography: Beautiful! This movie had a budget consisting of 56 million dollars. In comparison to for example that horribleness called "wolverine origins" had 150million... and the same runtime. OR EVEN funnier.. ride along 2 had a budget of 40 million. Deadpool looked a lot better.. had good cgi(especially considering the budget), had some cool slomo shots(the opening credits was a complete freeze shot and incredibly well done).. This movie looked great. 9.5/10THE ACTION: Yes sir. THIS R-rated action was amazing. Guys got shot, knived and slammed onto billboards and every bit of blood that left their body was seen on screen. The action was also smart! in one scene *kind of spoiler if you have not seen the trailers* the guy severes somebody's head and kicks it against another guys head! No "we needed a stuntman to do everything so we're gonna use a lot jumpcuts" bullshit. Wide-shots of beautifully made action. 10/10THE ROMANCE/DRAMA: You're not gonna believe this, but it wasn't cheesy.. The love between him and rachel was amazing.. They were both crazy in their own ways and that's what made them have a connection.. *again kind of spoiler if you don't know anything about deadpool* When he finds out he has cancer... You can see him in pain.. not because he's going to die, but because he will lose HER. 10/10THE HUMOR: Guys.. I have not had so many genuine laughs as i had in this movie. Im a kevin hart fan and went to see ride along 2 first.. I laughed chuckled once and laughed, because my friend was laughing more so than the thing itself. Deadpool had me laughing from the first MINUTE till the last minute. The opening credits, im telling you, were the funniest opening credits since the beginning of film. 2010's Sexiest man alive is also 2016's funniest man alive. I loved the humor, which was improvised and also sometimes written by ryan renolds. It was witty and not just toilet, poop-joke, humor. The references to his old *shitty* work he has done, but also the fourth wall breaking and... DOPINDER&lt;--FUNNY FUNNY DUDE, It was all hilarious. 20 out of 10. Don't know how to rate it differentlyAll in all, it was funny, it gave deadpool the movie it deserved and more, it was gripping, sad, scary in different ways(the torture the character had to go through, but also i was scared i would laugh so hard that i would cough up my pancreas. 10 out of 10 for this movie. I saw a lot of people complaining it wasn't as good as mad max yet it was a lot higher in the top 250 IMDb.well: 1. Their aren't as many votes yet 2. My girlfriend hated mad max because it was so focused on the action, it forget to be anything else. DEADPOOL was perfect in every way11/10, but since my rating is restricted by the great limitations of mathematics and stuff.. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Merc Really Does Have a Mouth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again along comes a movie that I hugely anticipated and I find it, well, just okay. Anyway what more could have I expected from this film, but I have to say that the plot was, well, ordinary. Not so much in a bad sense, but it was similar to, say, Wolverine, it's just that it starred Deadpool as opposed to Wolverine. Okay, it wasn't exactly the same, but it simply seemed as if the creators took the basic outline of Wolverine and changed the characters, dialogue, and scenes, but pretty much kept everything else. Mind you, you can't get characters anywhere near as opposite as Deadpool and Wolverine ? actually, come to think of you swap the hair for a spandex suit, and remove the adamatine coated bones (and claws), and the big mouth, then you could probably say that they are fairly similar.Mind you Deadpool is much more a spoof film than anything else, though it is not a spoof film in the same sense as those really bad spoof films that you fortunately don't see all that much anymore (probably because the go straight to video ? or even straight to Youtube). Rather it is the Marvel Cinematic Universe taking a really good laugh at itself, and while there are only a couple of X-men (Collosus and Negasonic), it is clear that it is set in the same universe. In fact there is even a scene where you see a model Deadpool as he appeared in Wolverine (as well as a joke about sowing his mouth shut).That's the thing with Deadpool, he simply cannot shut up, and if there isn't anybody in the film to talk to he'll unashamedly turn to the audience and have a good old chat with them. Further he isn't a hero, and once again he is pretty clear about that, to the point that he flat out refuses to join the X-men (and doesn't seem to be all that keen on joining the Brotherhood of Mutants either). Further, he seems to be pretty accident prone, and forgetful, including leaving his spare ammo at home in the opening scene. All this adds up to a rather amusing interlude within the X-men, Marvel Cinematic Universe saga (and while it is set in the modern age, despite him apparently being killed in Wolverine, we must remember that the entire universe was reset in Days of Future Past).All in all, it's a pretty fun movie, with some clever dialogue, making good use of a rather unique mutant (though technically he isn't a mutant because he gained his powers as opposed to being born with them). Don't expect anything too serious though, because that is definitely not what this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie but lacks some components!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a perfect combo of action and comedy.The movie is both origin story and revenge/rescue story at the same time.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a former Special Forces operative who now works as a mercenary. His world comes crashing down when the evil Ajax (Ed Skrein) tortures, disfigures and transforms him into Deadpool. The rogue experiment leaves Deadpool with accelerated healing powers and a twisted sense of humor. With help from mutant allies Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) and Colossus (Stefan Kapicic), Deadpool uses his new skills to hunt down the man who nearly destroyed his life.Wade Wilson is a mercenary who spends his time in New York City protecting teenage girls from would-be stalkers. He meets escort Vanessa Carlysle and they become romantically attached for nearly a year when he suddenly collapses one night and is diagnosed with multiple organ cancer. He reluctantly leaves Vanessa to undergo an experiment to cure his cancer, only to be injected with a special serum by Francis Freeman and tortured for days by Angel Dust. When Wade is strapped into an airtight chamber, the drop in oxygen triggers a healing factor that removes his cancer, but severely disfigures his face and skin in the process. He escapes from the secret laboratory, but as he cannot come to terms with his complexion, he keeps himself away from Vanessa. Wade moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al, and with the advice of his best friend Weasel, he becomes a masked vigilante named "Deadpool".Following a string of leads from various syndicates, Deadpool attacks a convoy of cars on an expressway before getting his hands on Francis, demanding for a cure to his disfigurement. The confrontation is suddenly interrupted by the X-Men Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who want him to join the team. Their intervention enables Francis to run off, and when Colossus handcuffs himself to Deadpool on their way back to the X-Mansion, Deadpool cuts off his own hand and escapes back to his home.The next night, Weasel convinces Deadpool to go back to Vanessa, but when they arrive at the strip club she works at, Deadpool discovers that she has been kidnapped, and Francis and Angel Dust tell him to meet up with them on a decommissioned aircraft carrier at a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him, and the trio take a cab to the scrapyard, where Colossus and Negasonic have a grueling battle with Angel Dust while Deadpool slashes through an army of goons on his way toward Francis. Both Deadpool and Francis engage in a bloody hand-to-hand combat before Negasonic uses her power to destroy the aircraft carrier. Despite pleas from Colossus to spare his enemy's life, Deadpool kills Francis before he reconciles with Vanessa</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I generally hate super hero blockbuster films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of "all for one" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life and instead receives super healing powers. The bad side - his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. So after breaking free, "Deadpool" is off to get revenge - translation, kill the guy who did this to him.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentor into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>extremely funny, amusing, violent ,exciting and stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSThe director makes his point(that the movie is pointless , stupid but extremely amusing and entertaining clear from the very beginning.) He aims at creating an uncut action hero movie with smart dialogs, good acting along bitter humor and he hits it. He took the risk and tried to avoid the basic structure of hero movies (that have so intensely inundated the cinema that it is hard to differentiate them from each other). The story-telling is good , it keeps the audience interested but still it seemed that the first part of the movie is a bit long, it would be better to stick to present story earlier and intricate it more(the movie overall appeared a little bit short for me).Here's a summary for the plot, Ryan Reynolds is a former mercenary with a loving girlfriend who is diagnosed by cancer and while searching for a cure, he becomes a victim of an evil scientist"s experiment , leaving him disfigured with supernatural healing powers. He becomes a superhero and decides to revenge, the plot is easy to grasp and the way it is told keeps audience engaged and amused(though at the end it gets too predictable , waited for more unique one).Deadpool brings one of the most hilarious fictional character from marvel's universe to life, in a really unique way. The humor is refreshing and funny (waited more about the taxi drive at the end), the dialogs are smart and many scenes are amusing along with being brutal, violent and sexy ( A fairly R rated movie.) soundtracks are pretty decent and enjoyable. The action scenes were incredibly well done (with just 55million budget , which is almost 1/4 of typical hero movies) with a lot of beautifully elaborated details. Reynolds is incredible as Deadpool, he fits the character really well. The great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin gives a good emotional core to the movie and eventually surprises audience by the love story that is one the most honest I've ever seen in a superhero movie . So, Deadpool is a decent comedy, action , hero-movie that offers audience a smart humor, dirty sexual scenes, violence, well-crafted action scenes and amusing story- telling that will probably make you feel engaged and entertained for 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true Deadpool comic on film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although we might all agree that the comic book "superhero" genre has been handled well by Marvel Studios in most of their movies, and occasionally by DC/Warner, FOX and Sony, I think we didn't have many nearly perfect adaptations yet, that capture the source material's feel perfectly and completely "nail" the characters. In such a short list - probably lead by Nolan's Batman trilogy - Deadpool came in to claim a special place. Specially after such an unspeakable crime against the character, in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, this movie not only mends that destruction, but also gives us a Deadpool that really feels like he just came out directly from one of his comics. This Deadpool movie feels like a Deadpool comic, and that's the best compliment we can offer a comic book movie. Being Deadpool one of my two favorite comic book characters ever, I admit I was immensely hyped (I'm waiting for this movie since before it was even a real possibility). I certainly have a few minor issues with the movie, but overall it's everything a Deadpool movie should be. Ryan Reynolds was great and probably had his best performance ever, and the script was brilliantly tailored, as if made by Wade Wilson himself. In all honesty, I'd rate this movie as a high and steady 8. I admit that the little edge that pushes it to my 9 is happiness in finally seeing my beloved character so brilliantly portrayed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Deadpool" has a pretty big mouth and a very corrupted mind."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is viscerally great, bloody comedy rated R has refreshed the genre of superheroes, surpassing to its most strong competitor Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy". Initial credits say the absolute truth, star Ryan Reynolds is listed as "God's perfect idiot"; first-time feature director Tim Miller is described as "an overpaid tool." The writers are referred to as "the real heroes here. Evidently, adventure is full of blood and jokes and obscene topics, not wasting any second to perform one of those jokes. Wade generates an experience more intimate with the audience breaking the fourth wall hundreds of times. It was great!. Certainly this film carries the label of "The First Film R Marvel" with honor, sweat, love, passion and many swear words. Rhett and Paul Wernick Rheese (real heroes) are the guilty of creating a script full of humorous moments that generate irresistible laughter led for the fabulous sarcasm by Ryan Reynolds. If you liked the formula implemented in "G. G.", "Deadpool" you give a pleasant surprise to improve the formula imminently with sarcasm, indirect and direct messages for himself, other superheroes, and even to the own production company. Project hosts two mainly innovative elements chosen by its writers in delicate and precise way, the first was how the same anti - hero put his origins and the second was the constant breakdown of film's four walls. But these were only the bases to solidify the film. Based on the 1991 comic by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza, "Dead Pool" tells the story of Wade Wilson, a bad man who receives a bad health diagnostics, this leads him to take apparently wrong decisions, making him literally a monster but giving him a superhuman abilities and unimaginable ability to cure ( All dinosaurs feared the T - Rex" - Wade Wilson). The film uses various and consistent moments not fundamental to the advancement of the plot but necessary to maintain the close relationship Wade - audience, which include two participants of the "X-MEN" or to an elderly blind who want to assemble her shelf. Several years ago, the comic writers looked the small and complicated in the "X-MEN Origins" (2009) shameful Ryan Reynolds participation, they told him immediately that if at some point in their lives they would have the opportunity to make an own anti - hero film, the main role was immediately for the boy. Good choice writers. His enthusiasm sarcastic is what makes Deadpool "Deadpool", He exudes all the features of the character, even achieving to see his pansexuality and light homoerotic. This guy is eloquent, funny, professional, he's be perfect to play the anti-hero more unconventional of the universe. Director Tim Miller and the rest of the team are the magnificent companions to decorate the work of the main actor, I admire the work done by Miller to lead such a project of enormous magnitude, it is one of the directors of the moment and it will continue to be for a while more. There is something that does not make very happy to the public, the film is all innovation and new things but plot central romantic tends to break for time-periods development fluid film, can choose a subject a little less cliché. Love story for Valentine's day? strategy? more profits?. It is an action choreography , interspersed with a fresh narrative and adding the best reviews of the mercenary. It's a Marvel's masterpiece. At one point, the film can become an action film, in a horror movie, in a film drama, in a romantic film, in a thriller film, is truly multifaceted, having the majestic power of overcoming its premise in the cinema is essential. Sadly, we can not say that "Deadpool" will be Marvel film last for older, but if you can say that 'Merc with a mouth' has done excellent and textual words of super is will turn into a fu---ng franchise. A film that parade perfectly between the thin and dangerous line of comedy , superheroes and fantastic bad language , defends and gives a fresh air to the superhero genre so congested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is one of the most funny, irreverent, and entertaining movies I've seen in a long time. It's easy to compare Deadpool with Ant-Man because of the humor, but Deadpool is much more adult, much more biting, more dirty, more sexual, and features poop and fart jokes. In other words, right up my alley. Deadpool is the fartier man's Dennis Miller.I don't even like Ryan Reynolds. Wait, now I do. And Weasel (T.J. Miller) gets to banter with Deadpool in a way that reminds me of the brutal barbs my high-school friends would throw at each other over lunch. The weakest points don't even really ruin the movie. For example, The Transporter Refueled dude plays a silly villain who's little more than a sadist without any interesting qualities. And the completely unnecessary appearances of Colossus and, ahem, Negasonic Teenage Warhead do nothing but set tables for movies that will perpetually issue until the end of the world as we know it.Much has been made of how violent Deadpool is. But it's really nothing compared to the gore of a Tarantino flick. And the breaking and breaking and breaking of the fourth and sixteenth walls is nowhere near as annoying as you would expect it to be. This violence and fourth- wall breaking is supposedly (sic) all true to the fanboys of the comics, so fine. And Deadpool even hints at his growing mental illness, something hopefully expanded upon in the future. It would also be nice to see Tony Stark's alcoholism become part of the movies.And you know what else? Deadpool clocks in at 108 minutes, not the overlong 2-plus hours you get so often these days, and no false endings or dilly-dallying around. The movie is tight and there is never any time to stop to wipe the blood off your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think we all knew Deadpool was gonna be good. I didn't know what they were gonna change, and I think I'm still a bit disappointed when they modify things unnecessarily (like Weasel turning into a bartender or Deadpool being a mutant). But overall the humor is definitely there, the directing is great for such a low budget, and the story is overall quite good (only lacking a better villain maybe, but since Deadpool isn't really a hero, he doesn't need that strong a villain).For comic-book fans, they may regret that there is no Dr. Killebrew, no mention of Weapon X, that in the end Deadpool get Vanessa (and that she's not a mutant) etc... But as for being faithful to the comics, they will see Blind Al, a funny relationship with the cab driver (classic Deadpool), Wade making fun of the X-Men, breaking the 4th wall etc... Although the numerous trailers spoiled a number of jokes, there's still a good barrelful of them left so you can laugh the whole movie. Deadpool's origins are also well shown.Given the low budget for that type of movie, the action scenes are quite amazing too. It is fast paced so maybe that's why you can't tell, but it doesn't have to blush compared to the X-Men movies. The Easter eggs (like the Green Lantern photo) are great too, and if you were wondering why Negasonic is there like me, well it's purely for comical effect (so is Colossus and his funny Russian accent).There's obviously gonna be a sequel, and in the credits it's mentioned it's gonna be with Cable. I don't think they can do the big story arc there is in the Deadpool &amp; Cable comics (they're gonna need the Avengers' movie budget...) but I'm curious to see what it's gonna turn like. Keep'em coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comic fan of a ways backs' view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say I've never read a Deadpool comic. I did however read enough to give his character some background so I wasn't going in blind.The upside is this movie is accessible to even those who go in blind. It doesn't pull any punches though or try to soften the character, or try to be anything but a great action flick with lots of inappropriate humor. Lucky for me I love that kind of humor.The only complaint I can say I have of the film and Im not even saying its a huge complaint. More like a minor nuisance. Was the pacing. It felt like it jumped back and forth a bit too much, not in a hard to follow way. Just in a lets progress the plot and not keep going back sort of way.Other then that, I cant say there's anything Id have changed. Fight scenes were amazing. Acting was imo great, music felt like it fit the movie rather then a studio trying to push an album, camera work and lighting were well done.This movies not going to win any Oscars(sadly) but it shows what a violent super hero movie can be.(would love to see the next Wolverine movie go this route) Some are saying Kick Ass was better, having seen both films, I appreciate what both brought to the table. Not knocking one or the other. If I had to say this movie was comparable to anything else I'd say a mash-up of Kingsman meets Kick Ass.I want to say so much about the plot but wont ruin it for anyone. Lastly Ill just ad that this is the first super hero movie I've written a review for. I've seen Watchmen, Batman(all of them), Superman(almost all of them?), X everything, and am looking forward to seeing both Suicide Squad and Batman vs. Superman.I'm not a DC or a Marvel, I'm a comic/movie lover. If you have questions feel free to ask me. If there are any spoilers I'll use the spoiler block so as not to ruin it for anyone.Sorry for my all over the place review. Hope this sheds some light for those who are wanting to see it. I only gave it an 8 because 9 and 10 are at least for me more for movies that are powerful emotionally as well.</fullReview>

The effects used are stunning, some situations are as funny as hell (his small hand and his...) and I surely did laugh with the sex scenes that occur with some holidays. The Halloween part and the teeth while giving his girl oral sex, well, you must just see it. And here we have it, Ryan Reynolds as deadpool does give the best he can and it's an excellent performance. And did we ever see Morena Baccarin more sexy than here as a stripper?But not only the acting is above mediocre as are the effects also references toward other actors and flicks are funny and the score used, well, for the people grown up in the eighties it will be a ride down memory lane. If you go watch it be sure to stay until the end credits are over because you will laugh it out again and he surely tells you the truth about cinema's. After Guardians Of THe Galaxy (2014) and Ant-Man (2015) another excellent superhero flick but this one here with an excellent twist. Yeah, I likeGore 0/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 2/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like to keep it short, this one's for the people who don't have time to read huge reviews. This film is your classical action movie, with a comedy twist. Well more like comedy suit, because your pauses between laughing are no longer than 10 seconds. Not a single boring scene is present in the movie, the plot is really good, the characters in the film are legendary and comedy is priceless. If you are fan of memes and sites related to them like 9GAG, this film is like made for you. Breaking of the 4th wall never fails to amaze me in here, especially that subtle announcement of the upcoming sequels in the middle of the film. Actors did an amazing job, Ryan is brilliant. Soundtrack is pretty good, lovely usage of 'Mr. Sandman' , 'X Gon' Give It To Ya' and 'Careless Whisperer' Lowkey one of the best comedies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I never heard of this comic character so I went to see this movie with excitement and curiosity and was treated to the best comic movie since the original iron man. unlike the iron man sequels and the other thor, captain America and disappointing avengers flicks this movie sparkles and is not so cookie cutter. ryan Reynolds is terrific in the lead with many witty comments including a few at his expense making the is movie fun and original plus the r rating allowed this movie to move into more adult direction than the other marvel properties. I found the story fun while the action was well done and it seemed everyone making this movie enjoyed themselves and did not phone in any performances and I hope to see more r rated comic book adaptions while seeing less of the cookie cutter and after seeing this I look forward to the sequel because I totally enjoyed it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives up to the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others I have been eagerly waiting for the Deadpool movie to arrive. I watched every trailer, signed up with the Deadpool corps, and happily gobbled up every bit of promotion they threw out. And did the movie live up to all the hype in the end? In my personal opinion, hell yes it did.Straight out of the gates the movie propels you into the world of the Merc with the Mouth. The opening credits alone are as unique and hilarious as they come, having me (as well as the entire theater) in stitches. I'm sure we all knew exactly what we were getting into; however, I don't think we imagined it would start after only ten seconds. I personally am a fan of how the movie was pieced together. Starting in the present and then having Deadpool tell the events leading up to his current predicament. In my opinion it didn't take away from the story at all; quite the opposite in fact. It really helped the story move along, and it also kept me interested with what was happening. The love story that lay behind all the blood, violence, foul language, and crude humor was amazing. There is one line from the movie in particular, one of my favorites, which provide a good example. "While Vanessa is thinking of Plan A, B, all the way to Z, I'm trying to memorize the curves of her face.", or something like that. I loved every character, even Aja? I mean, Francis, and I thought every one of them was well acted. However, out of all of them Colossus has to be my favorite, besides se?or Pool of course. Here is this giant, metal, Russian man, who also happens to be extremely polite, tries all he can to be helpful, and is just all around likable. He's like Deadpool's guardian angel, or at least he tries to be. The humor in this movie is very smart. Nothing is off limits when it comes to who he pokes fun at: The studio; other characters in the shared universe; even directly at Reynolds himself. This humor truly captures exactly who and what Deadpool is. Sadly the jokes that played during the trailers did not have the same effect in the movie itself. It's probably a case of being burnt out, because who didn't watch the trailers repeatedly? Even something as simple as changing a line of dialogue in a scene would have done wonders.With that one gripe aside the movie is great. It's EXACTLY what I wanted, and what I expected. Also, this movie is rated R for a reason. To the people who think that it's a soft R, you really need to have your mental health checked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant without a doubt say that this might be the funniest movie I've watched. The comedy is amazing and not for the fans but for everyone not even knowing who deadpool is and for those who knows deadpool. I don't think the comedy could be more fitting and awesome. As everyone keeps saying, Ryan Reynolds was perfect for this role and after Wolverines movies disaster of a deadpool. This was just amazing. I've known Deadpool from before and I know what type of comedy and personality he and his stories have. DeadPool has a very unique personality, not like Wolverines anger or Xaviers deep voice with cool headedness. His style is very unique and very challenging to live up to, what with the creative jokes and comedy but I cant believe how this movie might even brought that up even one more lever. Its not that "huge blowing multitrillion dollar Airships and cities" kind off SuperHero movie but more a movie that is more down to earth with a huge twist in it called DeadPool who keeps making fun of his and others franchise all the time by doing what he does most: Braking the fourth wall. I would deeply recommend ANYONE to watch this movie and especially for those who know who DeadPool is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true trailblazer and trend-setter for comic book movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DEADPOOL. He finally gets his movie. After a laughable appearance in the groan inducing X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, Ryan Reynolds is back bringing Wade Wilson, The Merc With a Mouth, The Regenerating Degenerate (and a whole paragraph of other monikers), to the big screen with what is possibly the most faithful portrayal of a comic book character to date in live action.I watch this and I am convinced that Ryan Reynolds has never existed. He has always been Wade Wilson deep down inside and this movie is Deadpool showing up his true self. He is perfect. Exactly like the more comedic Deadpool of recent years but with enough of the bad ass 1990s Deadpool so as not to come across like any other lovable loser. Read the comic, watch the movie, play the game, whatever, it will be the exact same character you know and love.DEADPOOL kicks off with One of the most uniquely imaginative, Tongue-in-cheek opening sequences to over grace the silver screen. (Keep Wikipedia and a counter handy for all the pop culture references). The movie defies genre, it defies convention, it throws us right into the thick of the action. Unlike many comic book character origin stories, we do not get bogged down by a lengthy first act setting up the eventual "birth" of the superhero, where the titular character is only seen in his civilian self without powers or the iconic costumes. For the obligatory tragic backstory, we get flash backs interspersed with the ongoing altercations. Just as the flashback looks like it will start to drag, we are snapped right back into the whizzing bullets, blood and twin blade action.The overall plot is a little bit derivative but in this day and age with eons of creative history behind movie making, what else isn't? It is the execution, the energy instilled by director Tim Miller, and the well timed, well written, clever humour soaked into the script by Writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick of ZOMBIELAND fame. We aren't talking the cartoony quips or snide banter of Disney's Marvel movies. This is smart, actually humorous, befitting of the film and filled to popping point with pop culture references if all sorts. Yet DEADPOOL is not some laugh-a-minute comedy. Ryan Reynolds completely sells even the more sombre scenes with such earnestly. For the first time I actually feel bad for poor ol' Wade and all the crap he had to go through before he became Deadpool. Reynolds sells the heartbreak and the torment in a perfectly nuanced performance. But more importantly, he sells the utter glee and satisfaction of sweet violent vengeance. The film earns its M18 rating with nudity, swearing and bloody violence though i still consider those tastefully restrained for an adult oriented film of such rating. We never get excessive, thus allowing the writing and direction to shine without being marred by the spectacle or eye candy. The music by Junkie XL accompanies The Eye candy and, honestly, is nothing spectacular; your standard electronic action samplings. But the soundtrack, consisting of classic songs, is amazing. The songs chosen and the scenes they are paired with either fit perfectly within the context of those scenes or create this comedic dissonance that enhances the mood.A bit of the backstory has been changed from the comics, as are the villains Ajax (but his name is Francis) and Angel Dust. Here they are devoid of their outlandish costumes and garbed in your Bryan Singer-esque black civilian outfits. On the flip side, we are introduced to two X-Men supporting characters: idealistic metal skinned muscleman Colossus (the big dumb giant) and brooding time bomb (literally) Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Somehow the good guys retain some outlandish comic book traits. Colossus is no longer the chrome clad pretty boy in X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST but a hulking lunk-head who is a dead ringer for his comic book counterpart. Negasonic is altered somewhat from the comics but she now sports a more traditional black and yellow suit like the classic Xmen uniforms. Was this contrast between colourful good guys and drab baddies an intentional jibe at the black leather look of Bryan Singer's X-men movies? Every once in a while, a magnificent piece of work comes along to sweep you off your feet into an imaginative mind boggling masterpiece of modern cinema. Throughout DEADPOOL, one can feel the absolute passion that the cast and crew brought to the project. The story is a tragic romance worthy of Romeo and Juliet: washed out soldier finds the love of his life and prepares to settle down. He finds out he has cancer and leaves hoping to spare his loved one the pain of seeing him waste away. It is also a science horror flick worthy of David Cronenberg as that man gets betrayed to an unscrupulous scientist who conducts torturous experiments on him. It is a revenge thriller on par with a Tarantino movie in Wade Wilson's vendetta, tracking down his old tormentors in hopes of finding a cure for his affliction. Lastly, it can be considered the wittiest, most clever, most violent R-Rated action comedy film of the decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool really made me see Marvel's movies in a very different way, and made me expect much more from their already wonderful movies. I was very worried when I heard of a deadpool movie (being a deadpool reader myself), but I must say they've done an honor to Deadpool's first feature film. The fighting/violence was very well done and more graphic than there has been in a marvel movie, if Marvel takes anything from this movie they should finally see and that regardless of the rating their fans will flock and awe over their movies. And will be excited for every evolution that takes their movies one step closer to the comics, regardless of the seriousness of the attitude.</fullReview>

Note, this isn't your average superhero movie. If you're 13 and haven't seen any rated R comedies. You probably cant see this one. Pros: Action was great, actors were great, Humor was really good, and the 4th wall breaking was pretty funny and really fit for a movie like this.Cons: I thought the villain was a tad forgettable, didn't really stand out that much. And I never wanted the movie to end.Overall, Deadpool deserves the 10/10 rating, I just think a 9 is a little too low.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool, aka "The Merc With A Mouth" made an appearance in Wolverine: Origins, played by Ryan Reynolds. The bits with Reynolds had him without a mask, but still the sassy attitude. He later appeared near the end, a bastardization of the character, this time played by Scott Adkins. This guy was known as Weapon XI, the next evolution of Wolverine? I'm still not sure because that film was a mess of epic proportions. The use of Deadpool in this film is a travesty and fans were obviously upset. Reynolds, who has been a champion of the character for years now, has tried and tried again to get a Deadpool feature film going. He has finally succeeded and now we have a 'proper' version of the character, one that fans seem to love and Reynolds is actually happy with. Deadpool is not your ordinary comic book character, for starters, he knows he's a comic book character. The film version knows he's in a film, he knows about the previous version of Deadpool and even the previous comic book character Reynolds played, The Green Lantern. I feel that some people may have had enough with the super hero genre, but Deadpool, much like Guardians of the Galaxy, is just unique enough to breathe some fresh air into an already bloated genre. Wade Wilson, Reynolds, is a mercenary for hire. While at his best friends bar, he runs into a beautiful woman, Vanessa, played by Morena Baccarin. They instantly hit it off and fall in love. He pops the question, expecting a long, loving life with the girl of his dreams. Things don't seem to work out for him though, as he is unexpectedly hit with cancer. Hitting the liver, lungs, prostate and brain. Not wanting to drag her through the heartbreak of watching him die, he vanishes. While gone he is presented with a new experimental program that could cure his cancer and make him super. Experiments never go accordingly to plan and Deadpool is now born. A mutant with healing properties, enhanced strength and scarred skin making him one of the ugliest men alive. Now he's out for revenge, to get the man who did this to him and hopefully make him right again. Deadpool had an uphill battle, a hard R rating, an unknown character outside of fanboys and Ryan Reynolds, a guy who desperately needs a hit. The film only got the greenlight due to an extremely positive reaction to leaked test footage, which has made it into the actual film, and it seems even more people want to see the film because it is doing extremely well. Does this mean we'll eventually see an influx of r rated super hero films? Maybe. But I doubt any of them will have the pure fun and energetic charm that Reynolds brings to this picture. Reynolds is a perfect Deadpool, he brings the character to life with the spot on comedic timing and self awareness. He brings his usual improv swagger to the role, if you're familiar with his comedic roles prior, it is on all cylinders here. With the R rating, he's able to let the risky profanity filled one liners fly. Some might feel it's a bit too much at times, others will say it fits the tone of the film perfectly. That R rating is well deserved as well. The film is full of profanity, nudity and extreme violence. People are decapitated, skewered, burned, crushed, blown-up and pretty much anything else you can imagine. This film is not kid friendly, despite the fact that there were a few children under the age of 14 in my showing. Despite the violence in the film, it is indeed very cartoon-like. Deadpool cuts his own arm off, cgi blood sprays on the face of another character, then he eventually grows a new arm. Most of the film sees bad guys simply be shot, with precision from the man in red. With a somewhat modest budget, for a superhero film, of only 58 million, the film waits to use the majority of that budget for the last act. The film jumps back and forth between the present and the past. As for as origin stories go, it's pretty run of the mill. Experiment gone wrong and hero seeks revenge. Seems almost like Wolverine and a lot of others. The familiarity of the film didn't bother me because it had a lot of fun with it. A lot of films feel held back by their origins story, Deadpool isn't one of them. Despite some of the juvenile humour, Deadpool is a lot of fun. A lot of bloody, violent, profanity filled fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is simply amazing. I entered the theater with incredible expectations, which I usually attempt to avoid because I do not want to be utterly disappointed. However, this movie is quite different. Not only did this move meet my high expectations, but it exceeded them greatly. Ryan Reynolds is my favorite actor and Deadpool is my favorite character so this was doomed to fall short. But it didn't. The entire theater was in abrupt in laughter from the surprisingly historical opening credits. There was even an applause after one "gratuitous cameo." Nevertheless, the action and fight choreography was stunning, to say the least, the jokes were endless, and the fourth wall-breaking was incredible. This self- deprecating hero flawlessly played by Reynolds was nothing short of spectacular. I encourage everyone to see this movie (over the age of 18 of course *winky face*).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to a anonymous source for leaking some fine test footage and after going through such a fantastic string of some of the best marketing I have ever seen for a film, we have finally been granted the pleasure of receiving a rather satisfying film for our favorite antihero, Deadpool! Fox has finally done right after giving us basically the Merc without a Mouth with laser eyes and no sense of humor at all.We are finally given the right film where Ryan Reynolds finally has the chance to finally show his true form of Deadpool!&nbsp;Showing off speedy parkour-like sword and gunplay, as well as the Merc's infamous mouth, Reynolds plays off this character unlike no other. He was undoubtedly born to play this role, his enthusiasm for the opportunity to play this character&nbsp;is apparent in every scene, whether cracking wise, pausing in&nbsp;a tender moment, or splattering&nbsp;the floor with&nbsp;an enemy's blood.Each supporting character in this really included a specific purpose mirroring key elements of Deadpool's personality, worldview, as well as enduring the titular character's physical and/or emotional abuse. Ajax and Angel (Ed Skrein &amp; Gina Carano) mostly play one-note bad guys for Deadpool to punch but they do have a bit of importance. Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead are exceptionally a funny gag (and dramatic conflict) for Deadpool. Not having the hugest of roles in the film, Weasel and&nbsp;Blind Al really showed some fine chemistry with Wade and some really great humor.Morena&nbsp;Baccarin, Wade's&nbsp;(equally sarcastic) partner,&nbsp;Vanessa Carlysle, is an empowered presence. The relationship between Wilson and Carlysle presents&nbsp;one of the more&nbsp; developed and "authentic" relationships in the superhero genre thus far, a relationship that shows Deadpool as a human being, not just as a costumed killer of bad guys.For first time director Tim Miller and writers&nbsp;Paul Wernick &amp; Rhett Reese, we are packed full of such passionate direction, sharp writing, and exciting action&nbsp;choreography. While Deadpool succeeds as a clever change of pace in&nbsp;the superhero movie genre, Miller, Wernick &amp; Reese, give this film a great abundance of self-awareness, showing our foul- mouthed antihero breaking the fourth wall as well as poking fun at past failures of this character. Being such a huge Deadpool fan, there was a bunch of meta-gag humor, pop culture references and a lot of winking genre-satire that really had me rolling on the floor from so much laughter.I really loved Deadpool, it was everything I wanted and more from a Deadpool film. It was fast paced, action packed, clever and most certainly hilarious. It really took its R-rating seriously with such audacious&nbsp;abandon, really basing it as an opportunity to revel the antihero's irreverence. It was truly a great experience, the film won't be for everyone, especially for people who don't know the character as much as others. Tim Miller has undoubtedly delivered a Deadpool adaptation that, at the absolute&nbsp;least, introduces to audiences the real Merc with a Mouth. If the film's opening credits won't convince you enough, I don't know what will.</fullReview>

Throw in a bit of romance and lots of non-prude (yep) situations as well as innuendos/blunt remarks and you have the awesomeness that is the movie Deadpool.As I stated, people have been waiting for this movie a long time, and it's finally here.

If you are a Deadpool comic fan like me you will be very happy with this movie. As a comics fan you always wonder if they can get it right. This was the character Ryan Reynolds was born to play. Don't be surprised to see this movie exceed box office expectations. Every person in the theater was laughing almost the entire length of the movie.Although this movie is inherently an action comedy it also has it's appropriate moments of being serious....just the right amount to get you invested in the characters.I am guessing anyone not giving this 10 stars is either too old or too uptight with their prudish sense of humor. Make no mistake this movie has some of the most crude humor imaginable and if you're a prude goody two shoes there is plenty of rude crude humor to make you turn away.Even though your younger teenagers will want to see this movie and LOVE it---it is NOT appropriate. There are some very explicit scenes and some of the humor is too adult in nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DEADPOOL review by: Mike Smith "FAT Mike" A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool. It's been 7 years scene FOX tried and failed at putting Deadpool on the big screen. Well he's back! I was worried about this film from the day it was talked about, but FOX did this movie right! From start to finish this movie had me laughing non stop! The writing was well done and in my opinion feels loyal to the comics. This movie has pick up and go from the very start of the film to the end. The action scenes are exciting, fun and gory, with a nice blend of Deadpool comedy and hilarious one liners. The acting is great, everyone becomes their characters and makes you believe they are who they are playing, which is one thing I look for in a film. I believe no other actor could have played Deadpool like Ryan Reynolds did. The one shocker was T.J. Miller, I feel like at time he can over act and/or steal the show. In DeadPool he did an awesome job and blended nicely with the rest of the cast. I can't wait to see the gag reel for this film; you can tell everyone had a blast and it was a blast watching this film.. A big part of the movie is humor, it's not just dick and fart jokes. One of the best humorous parts of the movie is the juxtaposition of the music. Also, the film pokes fun at everything, from the superhero movie cliché, to the studio being cheap and even Ryan Reynolds passed superhero movies. All together Deadpool has been my favorite superhero film since guardians of the galaxy. With a great blend of mature comedy and action, this film made me want to watch it again as soon as it was done. Deadpool shows the world that not all superhero films need to be family friendly. Cheers and remember life won't suck as long as there is a good movie to watch. 10/ 10 Edited by Samantha LockeFacebook page: https://www.facebook.com/FatMikesMovieReviews/ twitter @FatMikeTPKhow do i get my review score?2 - cast (chemistry between cast, acting, and make me believe that they are the characters and not who they are )2- cinematography ( directing, sets, scenery)2- Story 1- rewatchability 1- freshness / better then the sequel1- the ride (is it funny, action, scary all around a good ride and worth a watch)1- if i enjoyed it at all (i know it's a lame point but some movies maybe bad but i enjoyed it or the movie was good but i hate it..)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is inspired. From the director, to the writers (The Real Hero's indeed), to the stars - everyone played their position to the tee.This movie for me, is not awesome because it depicted a road arguably never taken before... It's awesome because it took a route that should not be mirrored ever.The love story was made butch via cursing, boobs and mad action, all at the right tempo and portions, yet still at the heart of it all, the love was marshmallow like; sweet, soft and pink.The humour, quite honestly, was witty, keen, acute and executed with the same precision as the "final shot kill three simultaneously" skill Deadpool achieved. The budget was so well handled... Even if Xavier's school dwindled to just 2 students. Also, Morena Baccarin was sooooo hot... Like truly though... Ohhh my... She really was the Hot Chick.This movie deserves an 8/10, definitely, but not because of it's plot or depth; rather because of its execution, however I hope, through the possible misconception of the masses, that it doesn't detriment or diminish the "Super-Hero" age. Deadpool did what it did incredibly well; The satire, mockery, indifference... But, I'm still a fan of intense drama, sci-fi action thriller. Without question, I still prefer; The Cap: "Tony, you know I wouldn't do this if I had any other choice, but he's my friend". Iron Man: "So was I"!Deadpool earned its right to be what it is... I just hope, it doesn't pollute the rest of the pool.Also... Gina Carano was also hot...#CivilWar #Apocalypse #DoctorStrange #DawnOfJustice #SuicideSquad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>.Funny and Irreverent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool, starring Ryan Reynolds, is the cinematic origin story for the "Merc with the Mouth" Marvel superhero. It follows Wade Wilson, a wise-cracking anti-hero who becomes the titular character after participating in a body enhancement program to overcome cancer.What really makes this film work is its humor. From the opening credits to the closing credits, the jokes flow in a rapid fire of obscenity, vulgarity, and irreverence. The film frequently breaks the fourth wall and takes aim at pop culture elements ranging from movie studios to Ryan Reynolds himself. I was expecting a funny movie. What I got was a hilarious movie. Reynolds absolutely nails the role of Wade Wilson/Deadpool. He has the perfect personality and screen presence to embody the snarky, anti-heroic character. His timing and delivery are impeccable. It was also refreshing to see a superhero movie that does not shy away from showing graphic violence. With the R- rating, the filmmakers were able to show much more than your average PG-13, special effects-laden superhero movie. The graphic visuals lent themselves well to the humor and the brutality of the action. While I mentioned "special effects-laden superhero movies" as a contrast to this film, there is quite a bit of CGI in Deadpool. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. I was not a big fan of the CGI towards the end of the film. The end sequence did not feel real to me due to what I would call fairly questionable CGI. In addition, while the dialogue of the script is witty and creative, the structure of the story is mundane. It follows the same beats and turns as many of the other superhero origin stories. The film gets away with this for the most part because of its self-awareness, but it would have been nice to have a more original story behind the great dialogue.Overall, this is definitely a film worth watching. People who have been suffering from genre fatigue due to oversaturation of superhero movies may want to give this film a shot. It doesn't reinvent the story wheel, but its dialogue and bloody action raise this a notch above its contemporaries in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 7 years of waiting was totally worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to make an account just because I think this movie deserves a higher rating than an 8.8 , after being introduced to deadpool from hulk vs wolverine in 2009 I was hooked on him and he became my 3rd favorite marvel hero/villain next to wolverine and Spiderman. I saw xmen origins in theaters and was pretty disappointed due to the fact they changed deadpool so much from the comics , but I was still sorta happy they added him anyway. After waiting a whole 7 YEARS for the deadpool movie I went in with mixed expectations , the trailers looked great but then again you can't judge a movie by it's advertising , I was hoping it would be good but wasn't gonna cry if it wasn't and all I can say is WOW this was definitely the BEST movie of 2016 as of now and one of the greatest movies ever made imo , it was an adrenaline rush full of laughs , sadistic villains , drama , 4th wall breaking , a ton of pop culture and movie references , and intense fights between deadpool and ajax. I never saw any movie like this because I don't think there is any movie like this. Ryan Reynolds was born to play deadpool and if he doesn't take home an Oscar this year nobody deserves one. The movie also featured 2 xmen members , the comic accurate version of colossus and warhead who's another xmen member which I don't know to much about , but I do know this , they were both BADASS and the team up with deadpool was great. Congratulations Ryan Reynolds and Tim Miller you guys definitely deserve the 100+mil deadpool has made at the box office and anyone who says otherwise probably isn't used to the character or what he's about , this movie is NOT FOR KIDS although I was actually really surprised at how many parents took their's to see this and it was the only time I ever went to a theater and saw people actually dressed up as a character. Overall I give deadpool 10 chimichangas out of 10 &#x1f44d;.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The anticipated Deadpool has arrived, with fans either expecting it to be really great, or awful, but it turns out brilliant.Putting X Men origins under the rug, Ryan Reynolds returns as Wade Wilson the repulsive, vial, antihero for his local town, but when diagnosed with cancer, he is given the chance to become a superhero, but obviously he takes this opportunity to do what he wants and mess about with a blend of his humour with his decapitating people skills.I can firmly say that Ryan Reynolds was born for this role and does actually kill the part in the film. We've seen him in some funny films, and some okay action movies, but what he needed was a mix of the two to create the perfect film for him. (Not implying anything as him as a person just his acting talent) Here we see all the key personalities of Deadpool, the violence, the sexually motivated, the constant humour, and cool action. Of course the whole point of Deadpool is being really silly, talking to the audience, referencing the film franchise itself, it could be seen as stupid, but no its so Awesome.I have never found the small humour in the other super hero films very entertaining, but five minutes into Deadpool, I was already close to hysterics.The only thing that bugged me is the constant sexual references, which is part of Deadpool's character, but maybe there was too many for me.Deadpool is a clear 9/10 and much more entertaining and just so awesome than first thought, and will not be a disappointment to Deadpool fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This guy sucks at reviewing, so I, Deadpool, will talk about how great it is (not perfect, but awesome!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by Robert Nickerson...NOPE! The awesome Deadpool!Hey you! Yeah, you! What are you doing reading this and not at the movies right now watching Deadpool? I've had to wait through two decades worth of comics and that god-awful X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie in order to get my own spin off (who through that quieting me, the merc with a mouth, was a great idea?). I'm even using one of my super powers that allows me to talk to you, the readers (which the other X-Men see as schizophrenia in the world of the comics). Go spend money. Go eat some popcorn. Give more money to 20th Century Fox so that I can get a sequel!I bet your wondering what's my deal. Besides that fact that I can heal faster then that tool Wolverine, I hold nothing back as I cut and kill all people I hate (which might be everyone, so I may be looking at you!). Guns, swords, my hands; as long as I get the job done. But I love cracking jokes that this other critic, Robert Nickerson, is no where near talented enough to make. So now that we've had our little pow wow, let's get into what my movie Deadpool shows about me!Wade Wilson (played by Ryan Reynolds, that guy from Van Wilder) is a mercenary who's no hero, but he's willing to stop stalkers. He's a crack up and makes some good jokes, but the sick ones haven't arrived yet. While meeting with his friend, bar owner Weasel (played by T.J. Miller, nerd), he meets the hooker with a heart of gold, Vanessa (played by Morena Baccarin, super hot!). The two become attracted to each other with their similar backgrounds and sexual interests and seems to be a good couple. Things go wrong for Wade when he finds to have cancer everywhere.To cure his cancer, he undergoes an experiment as run by Francis Freemen (played by Francis Freeman, tool). Wade is submitted to days of torture and medical injections of a serum. His mutation of healing is triggered in an oxygen chamber, but it makes his complexion disfiguring. He manages to escape, but can't manage to face Vanessa with his new look. Hoping to find Francis, he become a masked vigilante to now be called Deadpool. He attacks various syndicates, hoping to find a cure for his ugliness, with the help of two X-Men trying to recruit him, Colossus (the real Iron Giant) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (coolest name ever!)Deadpool is finally the right movie for a guy like myself. Like my comics, the movie allows me to go full force with as much blood and splattered limbs as possible. I have no clue what Ryan Reynolds was meant for, but letting him play me is a match made in heaven. I usually don't care for him as an actor (did you see him in Green Lantern?), but his snarkiness really works o his advantage. He plays me as an unpredictable force, and that's fine by me!Story wise, Deadpool is a revenge story, but it also works as a good introduction for me. Those that don't know will be surprised to find a love story. But aside from that kissy-boo-boo business, action fans will get their kick. Colossus and Negasonic Tennage Warhead are both welcome into the world of the uncanny X-Men. If I had to say anything negative about my movie is that that villain is weak. He may be an evil British guy, but I've seen this guy in too many movies before. And as much as I joke about superhero formulas, mine does succumb to some of them. The good news from that is if I get a sequel (I'll probably get it), the formula has now gotten out of the way in order to really go at it next time around (shall we call it Deadpool Rides Again?).I'll give my movie eight me's out of ten. Deadpool is an awesome, violent, and very meta antihero story that most people will see as a welcome change to the over saturated Marvel line up. Take your friends but leave the kids at home (or take them anyway, I don't care!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>R Is the New Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adhering to MPAA rules is killing creativity of US blockbusters, that is by now pretty certain. The rating system scares away almost any kind of risk taking when it comes to making expensive A-list films because film companies, naturally, want to see their huge investments returned by assuring the widest possible public appeal - but they don't want to p|ss off the censors. That's why it's ever easier to predict the plot and the stories are all looking blander and more and more alike. Any form of gritty realism, readily available on the Internet and TV-news, is a huge "no-no" when it comes to showing a cinematic work of art to a precious little teenager or an adult prude.Films made upon comic books are particularly sanitized, given the nature and obscurity of the source, and they suffer for it a great deal. Enter "Deadpool" as one of the rare attempts to tackle the "R-rating". Not to fight the rating system itself but to sort of rehabilitate the "R" and make it lucrative again, long after the impact of "Pulp Fiction" and "Private Ryan" has been forgotten. It has been heavily marketed as "not for children" and it was implied that the filmmakers hope for a sizable money return nonetheless. There seems to be a growing intent to make comic book films more adult-oriented, and I'm certain a lot rides on the success of this film.Since this is a sort of probe, it's obvious from the first minute that Marvel and Fox allowed filmmakers unusual creative liberties but, unsurprisingly, unusually low budget. A complete newcomer (when it comes to directing a feature film, that is), in form of Tim Miller, is put at helm, partly probably for fresh perspective, partly because he's expendable in case of failure. Expendable is also the main star, a handsome but down-and-out Ryan Reynolds. At this point he's got little to lose.Apparently, Miller handled everything pretty well. From really impressive and hilarious opening shot, through solid pacing and good action scenes, to dynamic climax. Really, hardly anything to complain about there. Editing is also done well, although there are places where more trimming would be welcome. Screenplay is more of a two-way street, however, and it has its hits and misses. It's undoubtedly brave, not only with gratuitous and quite welcome profanities, sex, blood gore and dark humor, but with the concept of a downbeat main character itself and complementing mise-en-sc?ne, as well as with the ending. There are many inventive visual gags and some verbal jokes really click, but a lot of them are overwritten, cheesy, too absurd or unnecessary so the reaction to them is more of a "meh" than a real amusement. But, I suppose that's what the character of Deadpool is all about - an edgy, nervy, blabbering sort of fellow, as the lore goes, a spitting image of Ryan Reynolds.Yes, as it happens, Deadpool, a relatively new hero of Marvel universe, is fashioned after the guy that eventually got to play him twice by now on film. So Reynolds by definition does the character justice. But I did hope for something slightly different than Reynolds doing his usual hamming and nodding. He is surely a likable actor and carries the film well, but a comedian he isn't and he simply cannot find the right measure for his deliveries. So he's a hit and miss too, in this film as well as in his entire career.I recommend "Deadpool" because although not brilliant, it's quite a fun watch. It's also an unrestrained celebration of the "R" and as such, hopefully, a small milestone in the future of filmmaking. I'd honor it here properly if IMDb allowed me to use the same words that were used in the film. Oh, IMDb, you're a walking piece of sh|t irony!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First comic book film of 2016!! Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the origin story of former Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson. He is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him horrifically disfigured but with super powers and his alter ego Deadpool is created.Tim Miller's first big feature! He's known more for his title designs (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo)and shorts so this movie must have been an exciting step up for him.This project went from pretty much being cancelled to being one of the most anticipated movies of 2016. It spent many years in development hell because the people at 20th Century Fox didn't believe that the project had enough box office potential?..well, they have certainly been proved wrong so far! It's the famous Marvel comic adapted to the big screen, just with a serious amount of rude jokes, nudity, crazy sex and violence?definitely not one for the kiddies!!! Few superhero movies are as faithful to the original source material as Deadpool is. Even if you're not a fan of the comic you will still find this movie incredibly entertaining and hilarious! I don't want to spoil anything for you guys but watch out for the opening credits ? genius!! Think Mask/Kick Ass/Xmen with a dollop of Vanilla Sky in there too.Ryan Reynolds 5th time in a comic book movie! He is without a doubt the best thing in this film and I love how the forth wall is broken down and he cracks jokes and talks to the audience, this is a really nice touch.Don't expect too much emotional depth. This film is all about the COMEDY!! There's a really nice love story running throughout the movie but it could have been slightly more powerful?pulling on the heart strings a bit more.So the villain, the baddie, is played by Ed Skrein (The Transporter Refueled)I wasn't a huge a fan of this. I felt his performance was weak and not strong enough to hold his own up there with Reynolds. With every super hero there needs to be an equally powerful Villain! Saying all this I'm willing to let it slide as overall this movie is GREAT fun!! Morena Baccarin was good and she looked stunning, I really liked her in Homeland and it's nice to see her on the big screens.Witty script, awesome music by Junkie XL and you can see how much hard work and passion Ryan Reynolds has put into this project and he is on fire! Joke after joke you'll be laughing yourself silly which is what this film is all about! Comic book fans will not be disappointed! I'm excited to see the sequel and I'm really pleased all their hard work and determination has paid off!! Bravo!!

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliant super not-hero film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many memes across social media have indicated--and I will reiterate--this movie is NOT for kids (and no, your kids are not the exception). This is a super not- hero (and the 'not' is important, but you must see the movie in order to understand) movie that is written for a mature audience. From the groundbreaking self-aware opening credits to the perfectly paced and strategic adult-humor, this movie is sure to have you laughing from beginning to end. And it's not just the writing that is super but the visual effects, stunt sequences, and fight scenes are far above par for this action movie genre. Ryan Reynolds captures the character of Deadpool so incredibly effectively that you will swear that he was made for this role. Not your Disney-Marvel movie, Fox and Marvel bring you a spectacular combination of action and comedy to show off this unique anti-hero, so to speak, for fans of the comic and those who just enjoy a super movie.Simply from the opening credits, it is clear that this movie is incredibly self-aware and playing to the audience one hundred and ten percent. BEST opening credits ever, in terms of creativity and being an extension of the narrative itself. The idea of a self-aware movie is not a common one to begin with and certainly not a trope of traditional superhero movies. I think that is what I appreciated most about the movie. The brilliance behind the self-awareness is that the film is equally self-aware as it does take itself seriously as a superhero movie. Never before have I witnessed the fourth wall being broken so incredibly much. For those of you who do not know what breaking the fourth wall is, in its simplest form, it is when the character addresses the audience. This is apparently an element that was brought over from the comic, according to my comic and anime enthusiast coworker that went with me to screen the movie last night. What makes Deadpool's continuous commentary so effective and entertaining is the fact that he says what many of us would be thinking given if we encountered the same scenario. The candor is such a breath of reality within this world of fantasy or augmented reality.So often a movie will either choose to rest upon its strong writing, impeccable acting/direction, or visual effects; the sheer remarkable innovation in this movie is supported by not one but all the aforementioned elements. Ordinarily, I am able to find flaws in a movie--especially within the superhero genre--but not this time. I suppose, the fourth wall was broken a little too much, but that would be the only flaw I could identify. Sometimes a movie can be a great superhero movie but not a great film; however, Deadpool exceeds expectations both as a superhero movie and as a film in and of itself. At first thought, you may feel that a movie with endless diegetic and non-diegetic commentary may overshadow or steel attention or coherence from the narrative itself, but the writers did such a fantastic job of integrating the narrative and commentary so seamlessly that the movie is doubly entertaining as it would be without the offensive, explicit, hormonal commentary from the earthiest and most human of superheroes. And yes, I realize I am using superhero even though Deadpool reminds me over and over again that he is not a hero, but you get the idea.Ryan Reynolds is one of those actors who is equally talented as he is attractive, and he gets to show off for this movie in ways that many actors wish they could in movies. But, it does not come off as obnoxious at all. That's the beauty in the direction of this movie. You'd think that his over sexualizing of himself and the continuous adult commentary that he (or the movie) would play off as exceedingly obnoxious, but you'd be mistaken. There is a perfect balance struck by the writers and director that enable Deadpool to be a total douchebag, but oddly enough, in the most endearing way. For fans of the X-Men comics, 90s cartoon, or the X-Men movies, you will get to witness a crossover of movies in Deadpool. In an ever growing effort to recruit Deadpool to join the elite mutant force lead by Charles Xavier, Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead confront Deadpool. This subplot is an important elements to Deadpool because it helps to build Fox's X- Men universe by bringing two franchises.Without getting into a lot of IP (intellectual property) rights discussion, despite the procurement of Marvel in 2012, as long as Fox keeps making X-Men movies, Sony makes Spiderman movies (even though he is appearing in the Avengers series), and Universal Studios Florida keeps modifying and improving attractions, then Disney does not have the rights to use the respective characters in movies or rides. Now, IP rights are a little more complicated than that, but I wanted to provide you with a general idea. Back to the crossover. Including the X-Men in Deadpool is strategically important for three simple reasons: (1) as I mentioned earlier, it helps to rebuild and reinforce the respective timelines of both franchises (2) it builds the foundation for a larger character universe, much in the same way Disney is doing with the Avengers and related movies and (3) part of what makes Deadpool so incredibly fascinating is his ability to play the anti-hero off of legitimate superheroes or, as Fox is able to officially call them, mutants.If you are a fan of Disney-Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, and you are NOT a kid, then you will definitely enjoy Fox-Marvel's Deadpool. Prepare yourself to experience a superhero-action movie like no other. From being mesmerized at the stunning visual effects and editing to the incredibly funny writing and acting, you are sure to be entertained and will definitely crave more. Good thing that Deadpool has already received the green light for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool ? the superhero movie we deserve (spoiler alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally did a first-day-first-show, that too on a weekday, in the company of borderline underage kids. Fittingly enough, it was the most irreverent super-hero film of all time ? Deadpool. My friend dropped out at the last minute so I had an extra ticket with me. At first I tried selling it, but that didn't work so I gave it to this college kid for free. He turned out to be quite the expert on comic books, so it was not a bad deal at all. An important bit of info he shared with me was that Deadpool is a Marvel rip-off of Deathstroke, a DC character, who is no. 32 on IGN's list of superheroes. Their stories, super strengths etc. are identical, but Deadpool's sense of humour should set him apart, I think. We will find out soon enough when Suicide Squad comes out. Will Smith plays Deathstroke in that movie. Coming back to the Deadpool movie, it follows a simple storyline : Hero is a bad guy turned good guy who meets the love of his life and instantly gets terminally ill. To ensure he's around for this girl, he secretly and goes under the knife of some very questionable folks who promise him another chance. In his friend's words, he ends up looking like "an avocado had sex with an older avocado, but in a nasty way" and many other gross, hilarious references. Thus, he stays away from her and rest of the story is about finding the guy who did it and getting even, in style. Forget the minimal story-line and this movie is so much fun because of the witty, overboard and overtly sexual humor, which does justice to Deadpool's character at the cost of being rated 'A'. Being rated R is really good because you don't have to pull back on the colorful language and all the amazing head-shots Deadpool pulls off throughout the movie. Of course, the Censor board for inexplicable reasons still mutes all the 'f' words and 'p' words despite giving the movie an A rating. I am not sure if there is any nudity or topless scenes either. Censor board screw-ups on the language and sex scenes notwithstanding , most of the action/violence seems to be in place. This is a movie made up of several memorable moments, just because of how ridiculous and entertaining they are the same time.1. Triple head-shot ? Okay, this one was censored. I know because I have seen it many times in the trailer and the senior citizens of the censor board removed it from the movie. Completely arbitrary. The build up to this is, Deadpool has only 12 bullets left and more bad guys to kill. He ends up wasting bullets on one guy who he's angry with and then realizes there are three more guys left standing. To make up for it, he aligns their heads in his sights and gets a triple kill? almost. The third guy gets a slow bullet stuck on his forehead, or maybe its because he just has a thick skull. He pulls out knives and gets skewered by Deadpool with swords like a 'kebab'. 2. Innuendo and swearing ? A ridiculous amount of sexual innuendo pervades every minute of the film, including the fight sequences. Sadly, the swearing which is integral to the film has been censored. I recommend watching an uncensored blue-ray version to fill in the gaps. The censor board gets all the same words from me, which they muted out from the movie. 3. Silly superhero references a. Taking a dig at Marvel, Deadpool tells Colossus and the little X men girl "Looks like its only the two of you in this big house. The studio doesn't look like they could afford another X-men character". b. When the super strong villain's side kick does a superhero landing, he says "She's gonna to do a super hero landing? (and after the landing) its bad for the knees you know". c. Has a stapled on Wolverine mask on his face when he reunites with his girlfriend, which she pulls off anyway. d. Refers to Prof.X as the 'old bald guy'. 4. Other interesting characters ? Colossus is ?nice? With a strong Russian accent (or is it Eastern European), indestructible metallic body and a morally astute attitude towards people around him. He keeps giving unsolicited advice to the teenage girl and also to Deadpool, which both promptly ignore. Deadpool blowing away the villain's head, despite his dramatic Batman like speech, makes him puke.The movie belongs pretty much to Ryan Reynolds, a witty script and some really cool action sequences. Looking at the bigger picture, Marvel seems to be going so many up on DC/Warner, its becoming ridiculous. Avengers, Guardians of the galaxy, Antman, Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Agents of Shield and I don't know how many more on the way. DC on the other hand seems a little more traditional and laid-back with its movies and TV shows. Arrow and Flash just don't match up to Daredevil and Jessica Jones, in story-telling, action or in character development. Batman is still my all-time favorite super-hero, and its evident that all of the other DC characters are just piggybacking on him. I look forward to the 'Suicide squad' and Justice League, but I can't help feeling that Marvel is slowly but surely taking over mind-space of super-hero fans. Hopefully Marvel's success drives DC / Warner to also focus on heroes other than Batman and Superman, and sets up an epic showdown, if not in the same universe, but at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so I have seen Deadpool about 3-4 weeks ago now. This review is really to congratulate the people who made the film and the risk they took. They all did an excellent job with this movie and the movie was great. Firstly, the rated r. R rated movie are usually good e.g. Shawshank Redemption (1994), Pulp Fiction (1994), The Godfather (1972), Apocalypse Now (1979) and most recently Mad Max Fury Road (2015). But no r rated comic book was really consider great there were some good ones e.g. Blade (1998), Watchmen (2009). I gotta say this movie exceeded my expectation so much. After watching the first trailer (I don't like to watch the trailer because it could ruin your movie experience), I wasn't that impressed of the trailer but after watching the movie the trailer was actually very good. The best thing about the movie is the dialogue. The dialogue and how the character talk to each other is written to perfection. The humour was funny. I enjoyed the joke that break 4th wall and all the pop culture joke and references. The acting was awesome. You could really tell that Ryan Reynolds and the cast are extremely passionate and enthusiastic about the film, making the film's acting great. The style of the movie was very cool how the story basically took place at the bridge. The direction was good. The costumes were great. The villain holy s**t he is cool. He is the definition of a comedy comic book villain. It was so close to getting a ten but there are flaws. The biggest flaw I think is the story. The whole story. What is the whole story? A revenge plot. Oh. Bland. If the dialogue wasn't this good this movie would have been bland. But they covered it up well by saying that it is a love story. That's it. That's all the bad thing of Deadpool. It's that awesome. So go watch it if you haven't. It deserves your money. PS I hope Suicide Squad (2016) is r rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie as soon as I saw the first trailer, and when my friends saw it before me that made me quite jealous. Then those same friends took me to see it, and for the next 1 hour and 48 minutes I was completely amazed. The action was executed perfectly. The plot was on point and did not straw to far away, but the best part of the movie, I would have to say is the script. The script in this movie was great. Like most Deadpool fans know, Deadpool is known for his "funny" diolouge. I was afraid that Deadpool wouldn't be allowed to say half of the things that he did. The script was perfect and there is no other way to put it. I highly recommend watching this movie as soon as possible, due to the fact of it being the best movie of 2016 thus far.</fullReview>

There is so many funny fourth wall breaks witch I will not say because of spoilers. I was also really happy with the costume I mean it is like this movie is just ripped out of the comic books. All in All this is a must watch movie! I also wanted to say the actors were meant to play these rolls. Now this is kinda the Spoiler part so if you have not seen the movie please do not read. Are you ready so at the end Deadpool comes out in a robe saying 'Oh you have not left Yet.' and than what really made me happy is that he said Cable is going to appear in the next movie movie Deadpool 2 here I come</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an avid fan of the character deadpool and a fan of Ryan Reynolds, I was completely blown away by this movie. This would literally be my favourite movie ever. I loved everyone's performance on this masterpiece, Ryan Reynolds is literally deadpool, so that is perfect, ed skrein shows a truly emotionless bad guy but in a very good way, moron baccarin plays a lovely, hilarious and bad-ass leading lady in this. T.J.Miller is perfect as weasel and him and Ryan have some of the most funniest moments in the movie, Brianna Hildebrand plays a likable but moody teen and Stefan Kapicic as colossus just seems like such a great guy and wants to do good and it is the polar opposite of deadpool and he has one of the best scenes with deadpool. Gina carano plays an easily angered super strength mutant as well as one can and it has one of the best Stan Lee cameos ever. The opening credits are perfection themselves, the structure of the movie works so well with this character. The humour is spot on probably 99.9999999% of the time and the action is absolutely amazing and brutal, which works perfect in the movie and doesn't feel to gratuitous and the script is amazing with much thanks to Paul wernick and Rhett Reese who did an amazing job and a great huge thank you to Tim miller who does a mind blowing job for a first time feature film director and I can't wait to see how his path turns out.only one problem with this, I now have to wait for the inevitable deadpool 2.to sum it up, BEST MOVIE EVER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superhero movie like no other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is highly unique and also highly entertaining in so many ways.The storyline is pretty interesting as you start falling into it from the very beginning, and it goes on like not other superhero movie does. Plus, it has a great sense of humor in it. Couldn't expect more from such a cool character, and its movie.Normally there are more than 5 superheroes in these kind of movies but Deadpool has pretty much only 5. That's a little bit expected because of the reason that it's centered just in Deadpool himself but as i said, being unique is the first thing that makes this movie special.And also, the fired shots to Disney and Marvel were really fun to watch.As far as the rating goes, the movie absolutely deserves 9 out of 10. Great stuff.Already pumped for the second one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but less funny than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it seems familiar, I used the same title for another Ryan Reynolds film: Waiting. It's kind of the same story: trying too hard to be witty and failing to be funny.I went to the movie with two girls, both oblivious to who the Deadpool was supposed to be or the filmographic history of both actor and character. Most of the jokes flew right over their heads! As for me, I expected those self-referential quips to be drowned in a sea of actual funny, which was somewhat lacking.Also, about its R-ratedness... not that much. It could have easily been PG-13 with some sex jokes added. For a character that was supposed to have been through hell and back, the psychological horror was severely missing and THAT is what R-rated means, not that poor prudish Americans have to hear about sex existing and seeing some random blood on the screen. Of course, that is probably because until a late phase of the movie's development, they didn't know it COULD be R-rated, so I will cut them some slack. I am excited though that it proved to studios that being a little ballsy doesn't mean people won't flock to see it. Expect all superheroes movies from now on to be a little edgy, after getting over the brooding phase.Bottom line: You know when a song is making fun of a specific genre, but objectively is part of said genre? So it Deadpool. It brings little new to the table beyond proving R can make money. Fun as it was, my favourite scene was Morena Baccarin in nude. I know, I should have started with that...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie, flat storyline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dialogue and the uncut action definitely make this movie worthwhile. Deadpool is an unconventional character as he constantly projects his facetious, fourth wall-breaking humor while asserting his presence as the "anti-hero." The character has an acquired taste, and thankfully his attributes were perfectly portrayed on the big screen.Ed Skrein (the actor playing Ajax) is guiding his path to stardom. The best scenes of the movie were with Ajax and Wade Wilson together, specifically the scenes of Wilson's transition into a "superhero." Witty remarks from Wilson, combined with the stone-cold language from Ajax, resulted in impeccable acting and dialogue.With that said, I'm not sure if the movie lives up to the hype. Even a few of the comedic scenes had me scoffing and rolling my eyes. I'm a fan of the R-rated dialogue, though I found a few of the jokes to be stale and ignorant. This movie met, but did not exceed my expectations. The plot does not thicken, and instead it drives a predictable storyline of Vanessa (Wade Wilson's lover) being kidnapped, which then sets up for a climax that I found to be rather standard.The biggest accomplishment for this movie is that it served as a solid stepping-stone for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vulgar, hip-centric, and purposely anti-hero comic book Marvel outing gives Ryan Reynolds exactly the kind of "super hero" (using that term rather reluctantly) part his career has been pining for. While this could very well be an ideal villain if tweaked, Deadpool seems to be a perfect alternative to the kiddie-family friendly Marvel summer fare so popular every year. He's feisty, insulting, cocky, abrasive, relentlessly chatty, honest-to-no-fault, keen to jump into danger at any moment (particularly with "mutant powers"), opportunistic (if he can get his revenge, no one will stand in his way), and unafraid of any consequences of any of his actions. He was "in the war" (special forces) so his killing/fighting talents have reason. He's not an "altogether bad guy" as he is willing to risk it all to save his "potential baby's mama", but not before cracking wise and pulverizing heavies that follow behind this mutant that is impervious to pain (he can't feel "anything") named Ajax (Ed Skrein). Ajax was head of an underground "let's change hopeless human bums in need of help into mutant superheroes" project that had this suit with a faux sense of offering support to the downtrodden luring unfortunates into a warehouse that features a staff who seem content to pump them full of mutant goo and torture the change into effect! Ajax's suit convinces Cancer-stricken Wade (Reynolds) to give the mutant underground project a chance, and it leaves him?well, worse for wear. An oxygen deprivation tank encourages the mutant change on Wade which uglies his entire body. Going the Elephant Man route provides Wade with a modicum of sympathy, but I guess his mouth could hinder that somewhat. Let's just say that this film unleashes some pent-up frustration that comes with trying to offer a product to a wide audience, within a PG-13 rating. What many might perceive to be a niche Marvel character audience, Deadpool seems to be the answer to a certain demographic's prayers. There's a freeing feeling you can see in this film, with all the swearing, sex-obsessed dialogue, decapitated heads, direct-to-camera-fourth-wall-breaking, 80s music (Chicago and Wham! make appearances!), playful jabs at the X-Men (metallic muscle Colossus &amp; firebrand Negasonic Teenage Warhead lend some help to Deadpool by film's end), Stan Lee's cameo in a strip club (!), and going for a completely off-the-wall back-and-forward origin story. Reynolds' energy and sheer exuberance (he is having so much fun and seems to be totally turned loose from the chains that bound him in "Green Lantern") give the film a buzz it sustains all the way through. Thankfully, he's never a buzzkill. Ajax is your basic cold-blooded villain who looks like someone Jason Statham is trying to outrun/outlast in a Transporter movie, with Gina Carano as his intense and mighty lieutenant (she gives Colossus quite a run for his money!). This is all about Reynolds and his blunt-force-object honesty and sense of humor. The quips are exhaustive, there's no shortage of Marvel vehicular carnage and explosions, epic encounters between fighting heroes and villains are here and accounted for, and even the friends treat each other rather harshly (Wade and his bartender buddy, Weasel (TJ Miller) share an exchange which doesn't politely hold back how Deadpool's new looks are a detriment to him; and a blind, black lady living in the slums who provides him a place to stay shares the oddest of friendships with Wade). This film's big box office has proved that Marvel could make a R-rated superhero film and it be successful. Look for the next film to be even more graphic, explicit, and against type. Deadpool's resistance towards the X-Men philosophy and how he corresponds with Colossus and the teenage firestarter were my personal favorite parts. Reynolds found his winner. Almost pulls out all the stops including quite the inspired opening credits which gleefully ribs the stereotypes of the comic book movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect movie for a perfect "superhero"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A PG18 rating for a marvel superhero movie? And the best marvel super hero too? It's safe to say, that I had my expectations WAY WAAAY up. And I was not disappointed. Deadpool is hilarious, filled with action, the plot is fast and has no dead spots. You will also love all of the characters and hate all of the bad guys. Now the main bad guy was pretty much evil for the sake of being evil, so it would be nice to give us a bit of a back story on that, and on his evil assistant as well, but then again, this wasn't that kind of movie. The movie does not follow any of the comic plot lines (and I read all of the comics). Now lots of the characters from the comics are in deed in the movie, but their roles and background are mostly changed. Even the Deadpool's origin story is reduced quite a bit. However, this is fully understandable, since the movie has limited length, it would simply not be possible to fit everything in there. So not only can the movie easily stand in the genre by itself, with people who never read the comics will have no problems jumping in, but compared to the quality of the comics, it does not lag behind either. For me, this is the first big hero movie from Marvel, where I had no problems deciding on the rating: 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare gem, in an industry that is producing movies, with basically the same formula.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People can whine all they want about the mass production of superhero movies. For me it's like a childhood dream come true. As a kid I always dreamed of movies that are being made today and I will never grow tired.With the foul mouthed, vulgar, tortured, funny, unpredictable and semi sane anti-hero, that is Deadpool, maybe we perhaps will see a slight change in superhero movies. Just like Nolan's Batman trilogies did. Deadpool is the polar opposite of a superhero and not exactly what u'll expect. The movie is first and foremost a comedy and the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.If your not acquainted with Deadpool, he kills, chops off body parts, curses and annoys people for the fun of it. The movie is quite original and doesn't take itself serious. With a lot of movie references, good one- liners and offensive humor, u are officially warned. It is R rated for a good reason. The plot and story is pretty weak, but the movie itself is so thoroughly done and consistent that it doesn't really matter, since it is an origin movie. The sequels will probably be even better, now that the origin story is out of the way. Deadpool fans will not be disappointed, as it stays pretty true to the comics. I strongly urge people to watch this at the cinemas. I want more movies like these made and hopefully one day we'll see a decent "Spawn" movie be made. Then all my childhood dream "heroes" have been put to life. I would also love seeing more Anime be put to life, but hey, a man can dream, can't he?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first time ever reviewing a movie, and I felt like this movie would be the perfect first movie review for me. This review will be spoiler-free. This movie is without a doubt one of the best Marvel movies I have ever seen(second only to The Winter Soldier), and I have seen every one. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is the perfect person to play the part. He owned this character like Heath Ledger owned the Joker. The humor is outrageously funny, right from the get go with the opening credits(I couldn't stop laughing). What this movie really had going for it was how it was so many different genres melted into one. Its ability to have a perfect blend of action, romance and humor was marvelously done. I can't wait to see this movie again, and I can't wait for the sequel. In my opinion this movie is absolutely perfect and is a cinematic achievement. The studio had the guts to let them make a rated R movie, and it %100 paid off because it gave them the freedom to do whatever they wanted. I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when I heard of the early screenings of Deadpool i automatically jumped on IMDb to find out what some of the early viewers thought about it. one gentlemen said "It contained filthy, obscene and crude language and actions in every scene. It was shockingly dark in humor. I can't believe this was a Marvel character. I am appalled at what the movie industry considers entertaining." another lady exclaimed "The fact that this film has already been given an 8.9 is, quite frankly, disturbing and one of the many reasons god doesn't talk to us anymore!!" yes ladies and gentlemen...god. All I could think was, what kind of scenes exist in this movie that would shock even the lights of whathisname and whogivesashh.. this movie must be extremely offensive, hyper sexual and vulgar. I mean for f@*ks sake, even god stopped talking to us. I must watch it, and I did :D. all I can say is, they're right about the vulgarity and hyper sexual scenes, they're right about the crud jokes and excessive violence. they're right about everything. what they fail to mention is the rest of the story. this story is really kind of sorta sweet in a twisted kind of way. some of the best scenes in this movie were when Wade(deadpool) and Vennesa, Wades girlfriend, where together. it was a really nice love story between the two of them...once you get passed all the sex, which granted, was a lot for a 2 minute montage. the supporting characters Negasonic Teenage Warhead whom i'm going to call NTW from now on, and Colossus, were perfect for this movie. Colossus was like a giant metallic teddy bear trying to change Deadpool's anti-heroic ways, and learn the way of the X-men. NTW was your everyday emo girl with nuclear power. the repertoire between Deadpool and NTW was perfect as was the constant nagging of Colossus trying to stop Deadpool from killing... eeeveryone. TJ Miller plays the bartender and Wades best friend. every scene he's in is hilarious. basically this was a laugh out loud, violent twisted and very romantic story. this is not a nice happy PG-13 action movie like Antman okay this is a fun R rated action comedy that takes it to the next level. I haven't laughed so hard in the theaters in years. seriously go watch it, or don't, honestly its not for everyone. if you want to go to the movies for a nice pleasant chuckle kind of time, its best you go watch something else. you don't want God not talking to you over a movie okay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I know close to nothing about Deadpool besides the fact it is produced by Marvel. That being said, I absolutely loved this movie!The jokes are adult-based, so if you are sensitive towards that, I would recommend you to not see this movie. But if you love dark humor, go ahead and watch it, you will not regret it! There were many scenes where I laughed so hard, my chest began to hurt.While funny, some scenes were surprising, and made me feel uncomfortable. One scene in particular is when Francis Freeman (Ed Skrein) tortures Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds). While it is a focal point in the movie, it left me pretty shook up. The nonchalant attitude Francis had torturing Wade had me legitimately angry towards him and increased my support to Deadpool and his goal of destroying Francis.There is also full frontal nudity and a pair of man's butt cheeks (and let's not forget the sex scene), so beware of that before bringing the whole family for family movie night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my review for Deadpool (spoiler free).If you don't know who Deadpool is, he is a wisecracking mercenary named Wade Wilson who is very aware he is in a comic book. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for the role of the merc with a mouth, under the direction of newbie director Tim Miller this is the film that Deadpool have been waiting for.Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Ed Skrein, Morena Baccarin and T.J Miller.Plot: A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool. It's an origin story and a very good one.This hilarious action comedy is filled with funny wisecracking jokes that will leave you crying with laughter probably every five minutes, among the hilarity there are ultra-violent action scenes with wisecracking jokes.Let me go through some points of why I think this is the Marvel film to see this year:Violent action scenes: The strong bloody violence makes this the perfect Deadpool film for any Marvel fan. What else can I say about that?Fourth-wall breaking: The joy doesn't stop there with the action and sex references there is also amazing fourth-wall breaking that is just relentless. The film certainly delivers even from it's meager $50 million production budget certainly less than other Marvel movies. This is Ryan Reynolds at his best he is perfect for the role as the Canadian anti-hero, it's certainly a lot better than 2011's Green Lantern starring the same actor.Tim Miller made this film well and will probably go down in history as one of the best Marvel films all time. This action packed comedy is rude, funny and full of violence in my opinion this is by far the best film of 2016 so far, and I recommend it to everyone. Seriously you will endlessly be laughing with joy. 10/10 is not enough of a rating for this film. Must see. Can't wait for the director's cut later this year.</fullReview>

In fact, it wouldn't be wrong to say that it is a much-needed shot in the arm for the superhero genre in general. While there has been no shortage of comic book hero adaptations into film in recent times, Deadpool is one with a difference. For one, it breaks the fourth wall - that barrier between the film and the audience. This results in the kind of viewer involvement that is both endearing and extremely refreshing. You'll see yourself laughing out loudly throughout the whole movie. It catches you from the start till the end.I've rated it a 8/10 because of the basic storyline. Although that's not what this movie was made for, I would say it could have used a better one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I voted it a 10, why because it was exactly what I wanted it to be, fun entertaining popcorn movie...is it on the same level as the Departed or the Godfather...No but as a 1st movie about Deadpool, laying out the back story (because not everyone knows or reads the comics)and introducing characters to the viewers, it did a great job. Movies are like pizza, its all preference...so because I like my pizza with pep and extra cheese is not as good of a pizza that has baby truffles and goat cheese??? No they are just personal preference. I felt the movie delivered so hence my 10, I loved it.Movies get different ratings for different things, and its about about preference and opinion, just like comments on the board here...you have the right to rate a movie what you want and say what you want...the main reason I gave it a 10 is because reviewers like Cedrick Jones gave it a 2 which is absurd. If anyone knows anything about Deadpool he has the mouth of a 5th grade boy. Go see this movie, its fun and popcorn makes anything better. So here's my 10 to level out CJ's 2 to make it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Marvel movies and one of the best action comedies in recent memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is about a man named Wade Wilson who is subjected to a special experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, becoming the alter ego of Deadpool. Now this movie really surprised me. I was going into the movie cautiously, thinking that the jokes might not be funny or the R rating would be there just because. Well now that I've seen it, I can honestly say that this is among Marvel's best movies. To start off, the writing and the humor in this movie are amazing. You can definitely tell that the writers spent so much time trying to stay true to the character of Deadpool and they did an exceptional job. The humor was also hilarious. There are so many quotes that you can take out of this movie and there are so many moments that had me laughing so hard. My favorite aspect of this movie was Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. He played the character so well that I can't imagine anyone else playing this character. All the other characters, including Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, were exceptional. One thing that surprised me the most was the love story. If you've seen the trailers, Wade Wilson has a girlfriend named Vanessa (played by Morena Baccarin) and their relationship with each other was perfect. The actors have great chemistry and their relationship was actually one that I cared about. Now one thing that the movie has been popular for lately is that the movie is rated R. This is one of the only rated-R superhero movies and it is all for the better. The movie has a lot of language, sexual content, and really strong violence. The good news is that all of this was for the better. The movie uses that R-rating and makes the best adaptation of the Deadpool comic. If there was one thing in this movie that could've been better, it would be the villain. While the villain isn't bad, he's not the best. I guess since everything surrounding it was so exceptional, the villain just comes off as weak. Overall, this is the best adaptation of a comic book character I've ever seen. It is also of one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen. I give this a 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first glance, many people think "Deadpool" is just another Marvel superhero movie- and that couldn't be farther from the truth. The main character, Deadpool, is pretty much the complete opposite of a hero, without being a villain. He doesn't save the world, or stop an inevitable doomsday. His origins are dirty and grimy. His jokes are dark and crude. His motivation is self-centered,but I'm okay with that. It's a different take on what a person chooses to do with his super-human abilities, and I think that is what the world needed to see. I highly recommend this movie to all Marvel and comedy lover's (but please, don't take your children)!</fullReview>

In other words, a guy who makes jokes like "oh I left the coffee pot on" in the middle of a fight scene. OK, maybe you find that funny, Ryan Reynolds did not work for me. I liked those jokes at 13 and would have thought him oh-so-cool.I did like a lot of the movie. It was one of the best comic book romances. The support heroes were charming and funny, the villains were interesting and fun to watch. The action was top notch with extra realism. The structure with how the story was told worked.But the jokes were not funny. I have no problem with crude or adult jokes and did not find it too crude at all. Maybe I just don't like Ryan Reynolds on screen. In interviews he seems like a decent guy. The supporting friend guy (from Silicon Valley HBO) was also typical and unoriginal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems there truly is a first time for everything. It's borderline painful for me to admit this, but I enjoyed a Marvel movie. I wouldn't have gone to see Deadpool on my own, but I was hanging with a friend for the weekend and he insisted on buying me a ticket. What happened next was extraordinary: I went an hour and a half without looking at my watch or wondering what was piling up in my inbox.Perhaps that was part of the movie's success: that it didn't push the 2 hour mark and that it wasn't straining, like some perpetually frustrated fanboy, to announce the credibility of comic book story lines to the world. "COMIC BOOKS ARE COOL NOW TOO! SEE?!? THEY'RE MAKING MOVIES WITH BUDGETS OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH MAKES THEM OFFICIALLY ACCEPTED IN THE CULTURAL ZEITGEIST!" No, rather Deadpool was made for less than 60 million, the script was clever and tight, and it focused on one of the strengths of the comic book format: their absurdity and over-the-top nature.Ultimately, it's another revenge story, but you can get away with following one of the tried and true plot templates as long as you put an original spin on it. Deadpool does this in spades with its buckets of irreverence, a few moments of sincerity to provide contrast, comedy that actually hits and some well filmed action. Also, by shedding the PG-13 shackles, Deadpool remained true to its roots and is another recent example of how film making for adults can still be commercially successful in the 21st century.My biggest gripe with the movie is its "look", especially the background shots whenever you're outside. Like most modern Hollywood blockbusters the environments have this weird, washed-out gray coloring to them that's about as far from authentic as one can possibly get. That's no doubt a cost cutting measure, relying on CG to fill in for well designed sets and difficult outdoor shots, but the ugliness and laziness of these cheap backgrounds is pervasive in the frame, spoiling what could otherwise be a spectacular looking picture.It's not an amazing film, but I liked Deadpool. It was well paced, skillfully written, it made me laugh and by being the antithesis of the last 15 years of lackluster super hero movies, it became the first good comic based film since Sin City.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offbeat but not subversive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Acknowledging the generic nature of your film is one thing, but it's only a half-step towards avoiding being generic at all. For all its off-the-wall innovation, "Deadpool" is still a perfect fit for the Marvel movie mould: take a wise-cracking superhero with a helpless sexualised love interest, a 2-dimensional "British" villain, and an assortment of bizarre sidekicks, and sprinkle with explosions. Spelling this template out in the wacky opening credits is not defence enough against its conformism."Deadpool" attempts to subvert long-established Marvel standards through breaking the 4th wall - a technique which loses its potency in constantly occurring, seemingly more often than actual dialogue - and its absurd jokes. This at least is a success - irreverence piles up as sexual abuse victims, drug addicts and cancer sufferers are all thrown under the bus in the name of Offbeat Humour. Nonetheless, inevitable cringe-inducing superhero epigrams make appearances too. Pop-culture referencing is another tenet of Marvel films and this manifests itself abundantly, to the delight of Marvel aficionados in the audience. Superhero films have always cornered the market in special-FX budgets and cinematography, and "Deadpool" is no exception: the action sequences really are breathtaking, the violence fortuitous. The aberrant 15-rated certificate is made full use of with F-bombs and gory lacerations littered like bullet casings throughout.Even though it punches above the level of previous Marvel features, "Deadpool" still suffers from the usual pitfalls of plot holes, predictable story arcs, poor emotional pacing, and stock characters. What redeems it is its superior sense of humour, irreverent tone, and subtle boundary-pushing in the form of 4th-wall-breaks and gratuitous violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the film was about wade Wilson who is a mercenary who had a dishonorable discharge from the special forces. Who fell in love with a stripper; which they had a relationship, then he came down with cancer in his thyroid, prostate, and brain. He went to his mercenary bar who he then had a shade agent named agent Smith; approach him for a shade clinic that could cure him and make him a super human. He went the clinic but it turned out he was being recruited for a mutant genetic torture clinic to see if his powers would come out. After months of intense torte, he was put in a tube to be suffocated if he lived he would become a super human if not he would die. He did become super human which his powers were agility, super healing, and among other disgusting things; but it came at the price of horrible skin that makes him look like quote on quote" a old avocado had sex with a older avocado" He then went on a killing spree to find Francis who was the scantiest who made him become who he was. Then he tried killing him but the x men got involved and stopped him so he then had to find him a second time.The film was directed by jj Abrams. The actor who played dead pool was Ryan renrylonds. Who then he played the character well. The actors who portrayed then were every realistic but in a way too realistic in there humor bemuse the humor was very raunchy and very sexualized so it was very funny but too real. The story was very easy to follow surpassingly. The scenes make sense in the flashback once again surprising yes.Were backgrounds realistic yes and were the hair styles, costumes, cars and houses realistic surprising yes. Did the music define the mood yes very much epically in the sexualized scenes. It is meant for high schoolers and college student demographic I would give it a 3.5 out 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The debuting director Tim Mller manages to show great shots of action e give the right rhythm to the film. Using the Man of Steel way of telling origins stories, the movie balances between the super hero origin story and his mission to take down the villain which is very badly built. The tone of the film is broken only by its antagonists. They can't be taken seriously and don't represent a big threat. The jokes are very well placed and are a delight to the public, especially the ridiculous amount of bad language. Since is a movie for mature audiences, the sex and violent scenes don't hold back and seen to be enough to hold the movie. More than that wasn't necessary. Wade's friend credited as the "Comic Relief" is not that funny, Deadpool himself is above him in this matter. About the X- Men, Deadpool himself makes a joke about that the studio couldn't pay the other X-Men members, giving space to a CGI Colossus and the young mutant Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Both perform great action scenes and serve as a support for the Merc with a Mouth. The movies makes jokes all the time with everything imaginable, full of references of the pop culture, the X-Men universe, and super hero movies in general, even Ryan Reynolds himself. The movie even counts with a exciting post credit scene, It worth wait in the theater for a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is by far one of the best movies to come out of Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you have read any Deadpool comics previously you would know that Wade Wilson is loaded with humor. His humor in the comics and his personality is perfectly portrayed through Ryan Reynolds in this film. Which is why it has a rating 'R'. Definitely not suitable for children, but perfect for the big kid in every adult. You will laugh your *** off in the cinema for the full 108 minutes, even then remember to stay for the post credit scene. You will want to see it. Plus, be on the lookout for the infamous Stan Lee cameo as known to be in most marvel films, one of his funniest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures Essence of the Character Perfectly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Deadpool", starring Ryan Reynolds-Green Lantern, Blade:Trinity; Moreana Baccarin-Gotham_tv, Spy; Ed Skrein-The Transporter Refueled, Game Of Thrones_tv; Gina Carano-In The Blood, Haywire and T.J. Miller- Transformers:Age of Extinction, Cloverfield. This is the first super hero movie of 2016 and they knocked it out of the park. They really captured the spirit of the comic book character that made his first appearance back in 1991 in New Mutants #98. From the opening credits, you can tell this is going to be a different kind of super hero movie. Ryan plays Deadpool, aka Wade Wilson, aka The Merc with a mouth. He got that last nickname because he is always making jokes; sort of like Spider-Man on speed. Ryan also played Wade Wilson in X-Men:Origins Wolverine. Of course, this being the origin of Deadpool, you learn how he became Deadpool, including how he got the name. Moreana plays Ryan's girlfriend and T.J. is his friend that also runs the local bar that Ryan hangs out at. Ryan is a former special forces mercenary that finds out he has Cancer and gets an invitation to participate in an experimental procedure to cure it. Ed is the administrator of the so-called cure, which does cure the Cancer and gives him the healing factor of Wolverine, but in the process, it mutates his body into a Freddy Krueger look-a-like. Ed and his lab assistant, Gina, have plans of turning Ryan into a super slave for the highest bidder but Ryan doesn't plan on cooperating. There are several cameos, including a couple of X-Men and Stan Lee pops up in a strip club. There is a scene after the end credits so don't leave too soon. It's rated "R" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity, so do not take the little impressionable children to this one- and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 48 minutes. I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

The effects ,the compact story ,the humor and the non linear way to tell this story, are definitely the highlights of the movie. Although I would liked to see crazier Deadpool. The "voices" were not present, which seem to affect character insaneness perception. Another tiny flaw, was the lack of those characteristically stupid and complex plans that somehow work. Still this small missing parts do no affect the overall result,one of the best comic book movie of all the time, a solid 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Deadpool" was a pleasant surprise to me. Despite having some predictable plot points (which are quite common to see in many movies, not only in those inspired by comic-books) I think "Deadpool" does the right thing by not taking itself way too seriously and keeping a decent level of self awareness. And while I 'm not exactly his biggest fan, I simply have to admit that Ryan Reynolds did a remarkable job as Deadpool, portraying this character in way that manages to be twisted and strangely endearing at the same time.Yes, the humor is pretty juvenile, but it's effective and it serves to its purpose. The crazy, darkly humorous tone of the film stands in stark contrast with the seriousness of the X-Men films...And such contrast works incredibly well, in my opinion.I'm not sure if this is the best Marvel film done to date, but is certainly the most entertaining one, being a fun ride from beginning to end. A Violent, raunchy and crazy ride, but fun anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie apology ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool, if you casually dip in and out of the comic genre, is a superhero. You may have heard the name somewhere on screen before, but probably forgotten. However, if you know your comics then you probably salivated at the prospect of seeing the 'merc with a mouth' going toe to toe with Wolverine in the X-man's 'origins' movie. Then you watched it and uttered words that no self-respecting spell checker should let me type.Basically, the makers of Wolverine: Origins completely messed up (putting it mildly) and the fans were not amused. Yes, Ryan Reynolds was actually a pretty good choice for the gobby anti-hero, but then they pretty much cellotaped his mouth shut and completely reinvented his character in the worst way possible. It actually makes a nice change to see a studio admit they totally got it wrong and do something about it (even if the decision is largely governed by money!).And that could have been that. However, luckily Mr Reynolds himself campaigned to bring a truer representation of the source material to the big screen. And, amazingly, it happened. And I'm so glad it did.Deadpool, is a superhero movie. You probably guessed that ? you have the man in a mask who you pretty much know is going to go out there and beat the baddies and save the girl, yadder, yadder, yadder... However, what Deadpool also is, is a comedy. That being said ? it's NOT a spoof. It's a tongue-in-cheek little number which has better action scenes than most action films and better comedy than most comedy films.I'm almost tempted to say that it's a film that anyone can enjoy. I can certainly see both men and women having a good time watching it. However, it definitely is a film for MEN and WOMEN. Whereas Marvel's current cinematic universe is kind of geared at kids (and us kids who never grew up) there is plenty in Deadpool that no parent will want to explain to their little darling. Again, don't let that fool you into thinking that it's all toilet humour ? let's just call it 'adult' humour and leave it at that.Basically, Deadpool is great. Ryan Reynolds is mouthy, but never annoying and totally owns the role (as it should be when he plays the titular character). The supporting cast all do their bit, but it's Deadpool himself all the way. Please let this be the start of a franchise. It's probably a little too much to expect to see him crossing studio picket lines and ending up in the Marvel universe where he ? truly ? belongs, but we can always hope. If nothing else, I'm well up for a 'Deadpool 2' outing.</fullReview>

The movie is full with gore , fun ,excellent fourth wall breaks (even one sixteen wall break) and the meta-humor was perfectly in mod with the today world.

I understand Deadpool is an unconventional character and obviously the director etc had this great idea of making a really cool totally awesome movie dude! that appeals directly to the 15 year old mind.Alas I'm 44 and except for a few interesting fight scenes, found it rather dull. I suppose hoping for anything slightly intellectual or even a real story was a very misguided idea on my part. My wife felt exactly the same.

		<shortDescription>Decent Action, Overwhelming Presence of Dull Sex Jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally I had the time to see Deadpool last night, and it was far from what one could define as a "great movie", or even a great superhero movie at that. It wasn't a BAD film, but it did not impress me in anything beyond the action choreography and the overall design/formation of the Wade Wilson/Deadpool character.Wilson as a character was relatively well-developed, and he did have a somewhat entertaining sense of humor. But that said, I only remember giggling maybe about 5 or 6 times at any of the intended humor that was presented before the audience (coming from Wade or otherwise), and only about twice do I remember actually LAUGHING. He kept beating a dead horse with the infinite sex jokes, and eventually they grew tiring.But I would also like to add that the design of the cinematic Deadpool costume was very thoroughly-done, and that I appreciated. It WAS Deadpool through and through. And that is failing to mention that it looked gorgeous on-screen (in action sequences or otherwise). Oh, but I would like to add that Colossus and Warhead were kind of "just there", and added nothing of real interest to the film.The story and antagonists that came with were both, I dare say, weak. There were definitely a few heavier/more satisfying moments in regards to the plot (Wade being diagnosed with terminal cancer and the emotional impact that left on himself and his friends, which included his love interest), but the storyline was bland and uninteresting in general. Wilson is diagnosed with supposedly incurable cancer, Ajax promises that he will cure him, Ajax mutates him during the operation which leaves him hideous and looking like "Freddy Krueger and a topographical map of Utah", Wilson despises Ajax for what he has done to his face/body and decides to hunt him down in an act of revenge. Believe me, this plot does not come remotely close to being executed as how it is read (in other words, it sounds more intriguing when you read the synopsis, but ultimately it is poorly- executed in-film). And with that comes Ajax (the primary antagonist) and his lackeys, which can all be described identically as the plot: boring and unoriginal. In other recent superhero films, the antagonists have successfully stolen the show for me, and I always end-up disappointed when they receive less screen time than I initially anticipated; but with "Deadpool", they possess zero intriguing qualities that only intensify the bland mood of the already underwhelming plot. Action/fighting-wise, all I can say is that it was very pleasing, and rightfully gory/disgusting. Not much else to say save for the fact that the action-based scenes were generally fun to watch.Should I give it a score, I think a 6.5/10 is appropriate. Not a bad superhero film, but it has it's fair share of flaws. These include: over-saturation of sexual jokes, failing to make me laugh throughout, and boring side-characters/antagonists coming with a storyline as flat as the state of Nebraska.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Guardians of the Galaxy and the two Avengers movies before it, Deadpool shows a worrying amount of smugness, its own self-amusement only equalled by its disregard for the intelligence of the audience. There's not a single one of the "instant reverse" jokes in The Avengers that even a very credulous small child wouldn't see coming, and Deadpool's scatological humour aims for little higher than the lowest (or broadest) common denominator. It's a crowdpleaser, and not awful, but if fart jokes, genital punching and a plot that resembles a 15-year-old's masturbation fantasies aren't your thing, you may find it all a little wearying. The gags are predictable and relentless... which, in fairness, is kind of the point for "the merc with the mouth", but doesn't make it any less tiresome. In an age where scarcely any film lacks postmodernism, Deadpool's constant fourth wall breaks seem almost passé. While a reasonable conceit in and of itself, there's nothing particularly intelligent done with it, the fourth wall just used as another vessel for some masturbation gags.The best jokes in the film - Deadpool frequently commenting on why A-List X-Men don't appear - lose lustre when you realise it's made by Fox and so they could well have. Current voting on the IMDb sees it just inside the top 50 all-time greatest films, comfortably edging out Citizen Kane, M, Rashomon and Taxi Driver.Plot-wise, then a thug also being the brains behind the bad guy's operation lacks credulity, though this is a film where Stan Lee urges prostitution, so all bets are very much off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'm glad to say they didn't ruin Deadpool at all. The delicate balance of "meta" humor, ultra-violence and romantic drama ran the risk of becoming an amorphous combination of blood and vulgarity without any character or texture. Fortunately, the film captures the spirit of the character pretty well, accommodating his contradictory aspects in an ingenious structure of flashbacks, monologues and flash- forwards which rarely stumbles in its relentless advance to what probably will end up being a successful franchise. Or sub-franchise, because Deadpool is set in the same universe as the X-Men movies, like the participation of a pair of mutants proves. In order not to ruin the constant and abundant surprises of Deadpool, I will refrain myself from mentioning all the things I liked. Therefore, I think it will be more efficient to mention some small complaints I have against it. The screenplay is very well built and developed in a way that the spectator receives constant doses of action, humor and drama. Director Tim Miller and co-screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick play with time in order to keep things on a constant movement, not only visually but also narratively, and as a consequence, every fight, explosion and chase contributes to the development of the characters and the general story. However, that "general story" feels a bit light when we realize its thematic austerity. Don't misunderstand me... the screenplay is very funny, with an adequate consistency and internal logic... but I would have preferred it to be more ambitious, genuinely satirical instead of self-referential. And the villain feels too generic and insipid. Speaking of which, I finally fulfilled my fantasy of watching Gina Carano in a super- hero film; pity that it wasn't as Wonder Woman, but as a simple sidekick of the villain with some good scenes, but few prospects for the future. Another complaint: the special effects. Sure, the super-hero films experiment a frequent digital fatigue, but in the case of Deadpool, the problem is the quality instead of the quantity. One of the digitally created characters doesn't work as an actor, even though it has some solid battles during the third act. And a chase with many vehicles has so many cyber-crashes that it seems a mediocre cars video game from the '90s. The render is perfect, but when things lack of mass or inertia, they automatically feel fake, and they occasionally damaged the exciting and very entertaining experience I had with Deadpool a bit. Finally, the actors make a competent work in their roles, highlighting Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin; their romantic interaction feels sincere and spontaneous, giving the film the emotional axis which avoids it from being a cynical and monotonous self-parody (like it happened to Kick-Ass 2). In conclusion, Deadpool redeems 20th Century Fox for the Fantastic Four fiasco, and it definitely represents a step in the right direction, respecting the character without trying to change or "improve" him during his transition to the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The same crap served on a different platter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool: The story of a movie with a poor storyline, which tries to be atypical using vulgarity, crudeness and nudity to distract from how typical of a super-hero movie it is.It's what you've been seeing for years, but it has been disguised and repackaged through means including clever marketing, shock-factor and being just-different-enough to make money at the box office. Audiences must surely be beginning to tire of this movie genre, and should not be fooled by the new wrapping and trimmings. Deadpool, while a solid movie in itself, is not the change that this genre needs but is different enough to entice mainstream audiences back (if they can stand the in-your-face overstylisation that has been relied upon to make this movie marketable).The Humour.......................................................... Not only are the forms of humour used in this film some of the lowest forms of humour, but also they have the effect of detracting from the movie's potential because they are over-used to the point of being tedious and because they take away from movie time which could otherwise be spent developing a quality story and purposeful dialogue. Gratuitous nudity, action and an over-commitment to being 'funny' are not going to leave any lasting mark in the film industry. Audiences may view that this was memorable, but this is likely only due to the shock-factor and should not be viewed as making this a "Fantastic movie" as some fellow reviewers have remarked.Induced misconceptions....................................... Audiences are sold a concept of a non-linear, alternative, less idyllic and exciting perspective on the warn-out "Superhero Movie" genre. However, that is a misnomer, a misconception induced by the Producers, the Director, and clever marketing minds. Mainstream audiences are fooled into consuming the same old crap they've been served for almost a decade now: Meanwhile, the discerning few who see the Deadpool character for what he truly is (a conglomerate of many of the characters we've been spoon-fed for years) are lead to believe that the dialogue is sharp and the humour is "witty." Also, audiences are lead to believe that the use of meta-cinema techniques (i.e Deadpool being aware that he is being watched) is a new or original feature of this movie,and makes this movie deserving of praise. When, in fact, the humour and dialogue relies on shock-factor and being over-emphasised in order to be effective, and the 'fourth wall' is only broken down for comedic relief. It's the Deadpool equivalent to the annoying cutesy/silly troupe that you are likely to find in a Disney movie - ironically the very same troupe that Deadpool Movie is trying to distance itself from. The audience can easily tire of this movie's over-the-top action, and over-reliance on low-brow crude or vulgar content which is disguised as wit through methods such as having the Deadpool character talk quickly or give dialogue at ridiculous times such as during a fight sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE perfect comic book movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a hardcore Deadpool fan you will want to watch this about 10 times, if you're a just a movie fan then you will absolutely love it anyway. It's the most accurate comic book movie to date! it has everything, comedy (so many laugh out loud moments) action sequences that are also cinematically amazing and there's a love story in there too, which doesn't fail to bring the emotions among the comedy and action in the film. This is seriously worth the watch in a cinema, with all the fourth wall breaks it makes it so much fun to have him look down at you and deliver a punchline or clean the camera, it gives you a different cinema experience which is definitely refreshing to all the other movies lately. Lastly, the post credit scene is also definitely worth waiting for with the nod to 'Ferris Buellers day off'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comic book movies for adults is like the problem American car makers finally solved, quit trying to compete with Japanese auto makers and bring back muscle cars. Now adults can have content too: Deadpool can be as filthy mouthed and cut as many heads off people and shoot as many people as he wishes and we can all cheer and root him on and on. As this doesn't have any really super spoilers other than one: if you or anyone close to you has cancer be prepared to have a new favorite "f****" superhero. Even if if one comes out beating this dread monster of a disease I am glad it is Deadpool. I hope the movie makes 5 trillion dollars .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Speaking as a Deadpool fan this movie is just as good as I could hope for seeing Fox's track record as late.The movie itself is pretty straight forward which the trailers essentially told you the whole movie. That's not to say that it was bad but it did take an unusual narrative structure to tell it's story to help stand apart from current Marvel and DC films.Even the easter eggs and breaking of the fourth wall help to enhance the movie in the sense that it knows what it is as a movie and what movie universe it is set in because it helps to drive the movie forward and even point out some of it's own plot holes.The R rating is well deserved in my opinion. It is not for kids. Take the violence of Daredevil, sex scenes of Jessica Jones and mild emotional tones of The Dark Knight trilogy and you get Deadpool.In the end it may be a Fox produced movie set in the X-Men Universe but it's so different of style you'd think it was set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I sat in the theatre on opening day, hearing roars of laughter burst from all around me at a scene I hadn't realized was meant to be funny, I realized that this movie is great. It's not intelligent, original, deep, or insightful in anyway. Obviously though, it isn't meant to be. It's a film which targets people who like crude and obnoxious humour (reminiscent of Archer), and succeeds in its entirety. Although I personally rarely laughed, I came to terms that it simply isn't my type of film. I appreciated that it's fourth wall breaking, self aware, over the top humour was done perfectly for mainstream audiences. Ryan Reynolds even gives a solid performance, portraying an adequate amount of emotion during his origin story while remaining light hearted and comedic during the majority of the film. I could dull this review down by naming countless minor flaws I found through the films runtime but that would be pointless. No one cares, this is an entertaining flick which it's target audience is sure to love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Second time's the charm as Fox redoes Deadpool in his very own movie after the debacle that was X-Men Orgings: Wolverine back in 2009. Again played by huge fan of the comic, Ryan Reynolds, but with a much better understanding of what it is that makes Wade Wilson so special for his fans, this proves to be exactly the movie that we were expecting. However, that is not to say that to enjoy this you must be a knowledgeable comic book fan or even a Deadpool fan at all. The audience is properly introduced to the character, his world and his peculiar set of values in a way that if you pick up any New Mutant story tomorrow, you will know exactly what to expect from The Merc with a Mouth.That is, the same that you are getting in Tim Miller's feature directorial debut: violence, profanity, fourth wall breaking, pop culture references, comedy and non stop fun. This might not be a masterpiece but that is not what it's supposed to be nor was it trying to. What it will most likely end up being is the most fun comic adaptation of a year that is filled with them and that is no small accomplishment. Highly recommend it, just knowing before hand that this is in no way like the Disney Marvel movies. Probably best to leave kids under 13 at home. Helmed by Miller (Most definitely with some input by star/producer Reynolds) who got the best out of the cast, this is not the hero we needed or the hero we deserved. It's the ass kicker we wanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate anti-superhero film, a game changer and a humour festival. Make sure you wear the yellow pants so that no one can see you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is definitely one of the most original, creative, unique films (superhero or not) ever made, and it completely shattered all huge expectations i had. So what matters to say:The story is really, really simple. It's an origin story with a revenge story, but the narrative is told in a really fun way, inducing a lot of curiosity and investment. And being this simple is what actually makes the screenplay so good, because it as time to do só much more, like comedy.It's a comedy with action, not the other way around, though there's plenty of action, and the pace is super fast. There's insane action scenes, with epic showdowns, though the film is very small scale, and once again this is what makes it so good, because it goes against everything you are used to see.This is one of the most consistent films I've ever seen, from the very first second (where you watch a credits sequence bound to be a classic, setting up the mood in the most perfect way possible) to literally the last one (where you have a post credits sequence that can top the one from the avengers, because of how it plays with the concept and the audience), it constantly delivers and is constantly perfect. I can count on one hand how many films (all comedies) in history made me laugh so hard, and constantly, and i don't think i ever saw an audience laugh so much in a theater, ever! the humour is without equal, with a million jokes, i really cant imagine how someone could come up with so much great stuff for the entire film. The writers really deserve a lot of praise.The film jokes about everything literally. About fox, how it was made, the marvel films, its system and clichés, tons of other movies, Ryan Reynolds, itself, anything you can imagine, its a pop culture galore, and you will probably enjoy it a little more if you know all about it, though the best part is that its designed so that you can enjoy it even if you don't know.Its a festival of violence for sure, and it earns its R rating. Ryan Reynolds owns the role and basically gives an unforgettable performance, and the rest of the cast is also quite incredible, and the one that can actually be at the same level as Reynolds is the amazing Morena Baccarin. The visual effects are great, but not perfect, and it could have benefited from a bit bigger budget for this, but it isn't the most important thing, not by a long distance. The score is really great, though not what it could be and i felt that it didn't add much to the film actually.Deadpool is the ultimate anti- superhero film, a game changer that will actually make the people behind superhero movies to open their eyes and take things to a new level. Its super fast, super energetic, with a style without equal, mostly thanks to breaking the fourth wall and dark humor approach. Its surprising, as it is different from everything you are used to see in a superhero film. Its a laugh festival, that you have to make sure to wear the yellow pants so no one can see you... Its a film were you are instantly invested and in love with the characters, that no matter how comic and violent it is, it has a huge heart. And everyone, from the writers to the director, to the cast, should have all the praise possible for creating such a perfect film. Given that this is bound to be a huge success, and the second x-men trilogy is ending, it's a foregone conclusion that a new era is about to come, one where Deadpool will be in everything.</fullReview>

I would definitely recommend people to see this for the action, as well as the great comedy. But there were some children in the theater and I want to say that this is not appropriate for children.

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this, the trailers looked awesome, and it was R rated! When was the last time a good comic book movie was R rated? (Answer: 2012's excellent Dredd). Ryan Reynolds gets to redeem himself after the disappointing Deadpool-in-name-only from 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, although nobody blames Reynolds himself for that, as it was clearly the writers and studio. Instead with this film we get the Deadpool we always wanted: fourth-wall breaking, constant quipping and the aforementioned R rated violence. Reynolds is perfect in the role, banishing memories of Green Lanterns and mouth-sewn-shut mercs of the past. One a side note, I much prefer this Colossus to the one in previous X-Men films. Stefan Kapicic provides the voice for the motion-captured X-Man and he really nails the character. Brianna Hildebrand as "Negasonic Teenage Warhead" was lots of fun too. Add to that a fantastic soundtrack and one kick ass final action scene, and this is one hell of a good time. After the non-event comic book movies of 2015, we've got our first winner out of the gate for 2016, and in a year where we'll see not one but two films with heavyweight superhero smackdowns, this one may have already beaten both already. I'm going back to see it it at least twice more. Bring on the sequel! (Oh and I won't be getting Salt 'N' Pepa out of my head any time soon... uh here I go here I go here I go again, girls what's my weakness? men!, okay then chillin chillin, mindin my business ...</fullReview>

I was so excited for it but I was also worried how will they handle this amazing and funny character. I was 100% wrong. They made Deadpool fantastic, better than fantastic. Everything thing was done so well, the acting, action, comedy, storytelling, everything. Ryan Reynolds is truly this whole movie. He did an amazing job, born to play this role. T.J. Miller was great too, I feel like they could of used him more but he was still funny. The villain was good, nothing special just a good villain. The action scenes were fantastic, fast and surprising very funny too. The only negative I had with the movie was the plot, it's be done before and everything like that but it didn't very hurt the overall experience of this amazing move. Also some of humor didn't hit as much they probably wanted too but there's not much of that. Overall Deadpool was the movie that fans wanted for so long, had everything they promised and more. Great action and even better comedy. Even if your not a fan of Deadpool go and watch it, you will not be disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of Deadpool have waited at least 7 years for the "Merc with a Mouth"to get his own film, and finally we have it, but even better is after the wait it delivers. Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast as Deadpool, and his dedication to getting the character right forms a true portrayal of a character that is very hard to get right, as we learned 7 years ago. Deadpool is hilarious, bitingly smart, and paced like the foul mouthed energizer bunny from hell. In an interview Reynolds said this film has been in production for 11 years, it would seem that the long wait helped the film, because by the time they finally made it, everybody involved wanted to get it right.Deadpool is genuinely hilarious film, by that I mean there are multiple times where everybody in the theater laugh hysterically. The film is even funnier for those that love, and know all about comic book films, because it makes snide comments about the studio and the genre all throughout. Fans of the character will appreciate the fact that Deadpool doesn't pull any punches, it's hilarious from the opening credits to the post credits scene. On top of that Reynolds comedic chops are perfectly complemented by the foul mouthed anti-hero.It shouldn't come as any kind of a surprise that Deadpool is a meta film, as the character's trademarks are breaking the fourth wall, and poking fun at other comic book characters. The film manages to avoid being clichéd, because of it's meta film approach and while not dodging all clichés it winks when it uses one. For those that have seen or genuinely obsess over comic book films, the film is littered with snide pokes at the genre, and a warning for those interested these pokes come early and often. The film is witty to a fault, and honors the character perfectly.From the hilarious opening of the film to the post credits scene the pacing of the film is frenetic. The film begins with a bang, and brilliantly tells it's story in a non-linear format that keeps the film from ever feeling slow. It would have been nice if the low budget hadn't been so noticeable, despite the fact that it gives Deadpool plenty of fodder. One thing that seemed poorly done was the Colossus character, because he's featured in the other X-Men films as a completely different character in look and personality.In the end lovers of the deadpool character will love the film, because it's faithful to everything the character embodies. The film is smart, funny, well-paced, and builds off Reynolds performance to make a genuinely entertaining film. The film has a few small flaws that are few and far between, but overall succeeds in respectfully bringing "The Merc with a Mouth" to the big screen. Note that this film is very mature, but when looking for a great film for an adult's night out this film is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just came from watching Deadpool and it's the first time in such a long time that I've been needing to write a review.Deadpool was such a great movie, it truly lived up to the hype. Not since Guardians of the Galaxy have I seen a superheroes movie play true homage to the original content. Deadpool is all about the jokes, the fun, breaking the 4th wall and not taking itself too serious, and this movie has all of that. The casting is also top notch; Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool as he is quite similar in many aspects. And the fact that he makes fun of himself in the movie for being too pretty? Genius.

		<shortDescription>The BEST comic-to-movie adaption I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie meant a lot to me in so many way! I fell in love with this character about 10 years ago and have long awaited a movie presence of him. As you can imagine, I was quite disappointed by his first silver screen appearance in 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' where he was more of a Baraka hybrid. However, this film made sure to stay true to its comic book heritage. The first time I saw the film was via a competition, in which I got to see it 2 weeks before the UK release date amongst a few of the actors. I was pleasantly surprised by how well the story was told, explaining the origin but yet getting straight to the action. Ryan Reynolds did a fantastic roll as a Producer but a better roll as an Actor. He captured Wade Wilson's personality so well. making him likable but yet fearsome at times! The tone of the movie frequently changes from comical to serious and sometimes even emotional, this helps the film not feel overloaded or intense. All the jokes said by Deadpool are very apt and even come straight from the comics itself, like the 'Shar-Pei' gag. That was a VERY nice touch which I'm sure went past the non comic book readers!The rest of the cast added great support, while not being too distracting. I found a growing interest in Colossus as a character, someone who I felt never showed his full potential on screen in the X-Men films. On that note, It would of been nice to see more X-Men characters involved, which still does not make any sense to me as Fox Studio has the rights to use them, unless it was done on purpose. Deadpool himself does reference that issue.Seeing the film again on the release date allowed me to study it and make note of certain things I might of missed, but all it did was cement the idea of how much I love this film. It did not become repetitive, it still felt fresh and funny.Your probably wondering why I did not give it 10 out of 10. Well, at times I felt the film needed a secondary storyline to help build a gripping narrative. However, that might of been problematic from the way its story was told. Hopefully the next time Deadpool graces the big screen again there will be an opportunity for it to do so.I think it took the mistakes from Deadpool's last depiction to really appreciate this film as the ULTIMATE superhero movie!</fullReview>

He's not complicated; he's got Spidey's witty banter (jacked up with vulgarity), Wolverine's healing factor, two guns and a pair of swords. Not complicated. He looks like what you'd find in the margins of some twelve year-old's notebook.And they finally did it. Ryan Reynolds works well as the Merc with a Mouth, fluent in his own language of potty words. What's refreshing about this movie is that it's a love story disguised as a very naughty action movie.

		<shortDescription>Important Step Forward in Comic Book Movie Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel has gone hard-R before, but never like this. Deadpool is the latest comic book movie and tells the story of Wade Wilson, an ex- mercenary, who is transformed into the wise-cracking, 4th wall- breaking, sword-wielding, revenge-seeking super?. hero? Outside of a guy wearing a suit and having superpowers, the comparisons to your traditional comic book movie end there. Deadpool's obscene, violent, and hilarious take on the superhero genre is a thoroughly entertaining, though imperfect, step closer towards reaching the full potential of the comic book movie industry.The success of Deadpool rested almost entirely on the shoulders of Ryan Reynolds. Thankfully, Reynolds is one of the best casting decisions I have ever seen in a comic book movie. Reynolds was born to play Deadpool, and his enthusiasm while playing the role is unmatched. I cannot imagine anyone else pulling off Deadpool, and this is a huge credit to the studio for trusting Reynolds with another chance to play this controversial and explicit comic book character.Deadpool's entire hour and forty minute runtime is filled to the brim with laughs. Dirty jokes, shocking images, and 4th wall breaks are just a few of the many forms Deadpool's laughs take. However, when you have 100 plus minutes of jokes, not every one of them is going to hit. Thankfully, after every miss, the downtime between that and the next funny joke is very minimal. Deadpool definitely goes for quantity over quality when it comes to laughs, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.Deadpool is extremely violent, but all of the violence works in tandem with the character himself and the tone the movie strives for. The film is directed by Tim Miller, and while this is his first feature film, he does a fantastic job of actually showing the gory action in a coherent and enjoyable manner. The punches, gunshots, and slices all have visual impact and are NOT hidden or censored by the use of many cuts or other lazy filmmaking techniques. However, some backgrounds and images that have a deep depth of field appear unfinished, and at times, don't look good at all. I'm not sure if this was from budgetary constraints or a rush to meet the release deadline in post-production, but it was a minor distraction and worth noting.The story in Deadpool ties all the gore and laughs together. The story is a fairly simple revenge tale, but it has some emotional weight to it that gives the movie an element I was not expecting. I cared about the man under the mask and his relationship with his girlfriend, Vanessa. And although this relationship is impossible to relate to (at least I would hope so), you still buy them as a couple, and this gives the movie higher stakes. Another thing I liked about the story is it goes back and forth from the present to Deadpool's origin story, which I thought gave the movie a good sense of pacing.One of my biggest complaints I have with the movie is the villain, Ajax. I'm not super familiar with Deadpool and his comics or who (if anyone) is his main antagonist, but Ajax is a very boring and stereotypical villain. I get that his stern demeanor contrasts with Deadpool's wise-cracking personality and opposites facing off generally makes for an interesting dynamic, but I found him as a buzz kill to all the other awesome things going on around him. His powers are not even interesting either. Just because villains sometimes have a tendency to overshadow the hero, like the Joker overshadowed Batman in The Dark Knight, doesn't mean you have to copout with a villain like Ajax.The highest praise I can give Deadpool, that I can rarely say for others movies, is everyone in front and behind the camera feels like they are having a blast making it and are trying their hardest to give fans and movie lovers a movie that's not only a lot of fun, but also good. I hope this movie does well financially to reinforce the fact you don't have to follow a standard superhero formula in order to satisfy fans, and critics alike. If the subject matter requires it, you can go R-rated and not limit yourself creatively. There have been other R-rated Marvel comic book movies, but Deadpool embraces its R rating like no other and hopefully paves the way for other brilliant and unique places comic book movies could go in the future.If you're easily offended by extreme violence, nudity, etc, skip Deadpool altogether. Everyone else? Get your brown pants/red pants/whatever color pants on, and go support a movie that is unapologetically different from any other movie I have ever seen.If you liked this review, check out my website www.watsonmoviereviews.com to talk movies or read some of my other reviews.</fullReview>

There are x-men in it, and it has all the cheesiness of xmen and other superhero movies, but it all made fun off, and using the similar light hearted comedy is mixed in with violence and sex that is definitely not used in those movies, along with some very dark humour, it's so out of place of what you'd expect from these kind of movies that it brings a fresh feel that is such a relief after being drowned in the same stuff of 3 iron man, 7 odd xmen, 5 spiderman, 3 F4, 2 Capt America, Thor, ant man, avengers... Unlike the mentioned above, this isn't one to bring your kids to see, and one of the greatest things about it is that it does stick to many of the rules the above movies follow, but it laughs at them and throws in jokes and scenes that tear those rules apart. If your a fan of super hero movies, watch it, if you hate super hero movies.. Watch it.</fullReview>

The plot is OK for the introductory movie of this new superhero but the action and the comedy is the actual spice in this curry. It will keep you laughing and entertained, Nopes there is no social message in this movie and you don,t need one. The Director whoever he is has done an awesome work by keeping it less complicated and filled with fun. This can be really entertaining if you have a good sense of humor or even if you don,t have one. I mean this movie can entertain everybody and is highly recommended.Hit the theaters now ..YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly What a Fan Would Hope for, and More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start off by saying that there are a few stipulations to my rating for the more casual movie-goers.- It is not a movie like other Marvel movies or even superhero movies in general, nor is it intended to be.- It is very loyal to the source material so people who are fans of the series/ people who understand the essence of the Deadpool character will have a great time.- It is not a movie I would take kids under the age of maybe 16 to (unless you're a cool parent). If you are you are a younger person going to the movie, I would really recommend going without your parents, it would be pretty awkward at times otherwise.(Additionally if you are from a part of Canada {like myself} where the movie is rated 14A, you should know that rating really stretches the limits of what can be considered a 14A movie.)- If you are fine with movies that feature lots of swearing, violence, and nudity, then it is great for you.With these points in mind, I loved the movie. It's really clever, nice simple story and with a nice pace that doesn't devolve into some of the annoying superhero movie tropes. For fans of Tarantino's style of humour and violence, this is the perfect movie. At times it can be really raunchy, but it still has its heartwarming moments. I'll probably return to the theatre to see it at least once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The highly anticipated Marvel comic-book action movie has arrived with Ryan Reynolds in 'Deadpool'. After finding out that Wade Willis has cancer, he is reached out to participate in a series of tests that can not only cure but make him capable of having super strength. When things go bad, Willis is out to seek the man who is responsible for his transformation and save his companion. The film is directed by Tim Miller and also stars Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller, and Ed Skrein.Wow! This is possibly one of the best comic book adaptations we've seen in some time since 'Captain America: Winter Soldier'. Given the R rating that everyone clamored for it gave the movie a gritty edge in violence and humor; all staying true to the comics that is 'Deadpool'. All of this mounting to a refreshing contrast to the Marvel cinematic universe we all have been used to seeing. Fun is the word you would describe this film; especially the performance given by Ryan Reynolds. Fans of the Marvel universe will be happy to know that the studio did justice to the character and didn't hold any punches in the process.You can read the entire review here at: thecinemascore.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely different but hardly better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been among the most hyped movies to have hit the screen recently. The trailers and commercials were very indicative of a hilariously rendered action flick. And for the most part, it delivers. It's different, wacky and cheeky, in that it is very conscious of itself as a superhero movie, and it exercises this to the fullest. The story and villain however, are disappointingly mundane. The central performance by Ryan Reynolds is perfect; he effortlessly captures the essence of Deadpool, portraying him with the requisite quirk and gleeful abandon. The music is another entertaining aspect of the movie and complements the adjoining scenes wonderfully. The movie is funny right at the get-go, the opening credits was definitely the funniest and most innovative introduction to a movie, and is sure to have everyone in splits.The beginning of this movie is about the only time it's able to be consistently funny, starting with the opening credits and the car chase/shooting sequence. Post the first 20 minutes however, things take a turn for a worse in these poor transitions to Deadpool's past which act as a sudden mellow to the intensity of the opening action scene. We're then subjected to the quintessential romance that I felt was largely unsatisfying, for as much as Deadpool The Movie detests conformism and cliché, it was unable to do anything new with its half baked romance in the entirety of its runtime. The story hardly progresses in the first half, because it only orchestrates a lot of catching up on the part of the viewer. The origin story was already quite clear from the amazing trailers, and so it oddly felt like a retread. Also, the trailers featured almost all the funniest lines in the movie, so there impact in the movie itself was alarmingly shallow, what with the absence of any MORE funny scenes with the exception of a couple in the latter half of the film. The action too was quite standard, with no real off the chart sequences, barring possibly the initial scene. The story, as I already stated, was conventional comic book-esque fare. In the second half, the film picks up, since it focuses on the present and does not waste anymore time on the ramblings of the past. The humour once again finds its place and the action hits the crescendo, all to once again collapse to a lacklustre climax. The villain, lest I forget, seemed more akin to being the second-in-command to a villain, and was hardly menacing. One last aspect I'd like to dwell upon is the character development. It's safe to say that this movie has very little to no character development at all. There is also little to no back story for the two funny, but disappointingly inconsequential X-Men in the film. Deadpool's love interest too, is hardly explored. So all in all, this movie has a great wise-cracking comedian in Deadpool, for I wouldn't call him a hero. There are a plethora of ingeniously funny scenes, betrayed ONLY by there revelation in the trailers themselves. The story is dull and generic, something that the movie claims so hard to detest. The villain and the romance are half baked. So that's what this is, a comedy with action to complement. If you're looking for plot, character development arcs, "romance", or even an immediacy or urgency of knowing something is at stake, that you're familiar with in other comic book movies, you'll find yourself disappointed. It's apparent that it is receiving a lot of love from viewers which most likely is driven by the insane amount of hype created by the trailers to the movie. For if we were to keep the laugh riot aside, it would be quite apparent that its current rating of 8.7 on IMDb, is exaggerated. Go in with lower expectations and you'll definitely be entertained, if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeadPool- Exciting and Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am definitely late on this movie but I was blessed to get to see it last night. I must say that I was impressed. The movie was cleverly written and it also brought some things to the comedy genre that I had never seen before. For example the opening credits had a fun twist. It is good to see something different in the comedy genre instead of the same old techniques that we see in your everyday comedy movie. Along side the comedy DeadPool manages to tell an interesting story which is not common among comedy movies. It was also exciting to watch especially during the fighting sequences which were greatly choreographed and easy to follow. The final fight was really exciting and I enjoyed watching it. One thing that bugged me was that a lot of the best jokes could be seen in the trailer. I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if I had not seen some of the jokes that were played in the movie already in the trailer. However I laughed at them the first time I saw them in the trailer so still a success. Basically when making a comedy movie you have to put some jokes in the trailer to show it is a comedy so I can't complain too much. Overall DeadPool was a success and I am excited to see what else the franchise could have in store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I went to the movies with a group of friends. One of them had already seen the movie and had ranted and raved about how good this movie is and how i just had to see it. When I got to this movie I was pretty excited, since so many people had given this movie good reviews. As the movie started I had already knew it was not going to be as good as everyone had hyped it up to be. The movie to me was suppose to be about a man overcoming a tragedy when in reality the movie was about a man getting revenge on a guy that cured him/made him look terrible with a lot of flashbacks in between on the killing and the immense amount of blood scenes. Also I was expecting this movie to be funny and to make me laugh a lot. I will admit I chuckled a few times but not to the point where I was falling out of my seat laughing. Overall I was extremely disappointed in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, they got the basics right: the jokes and the violence were quite what I'd expect when seeing one of my favorite comicbook-characters come to life. I had a lot of fun and the movie had the audience roaring with laughter more than once.However, the story and the way the other characters were portrayed couldn't keep up with that. It felt like they put in so much effort to make Deadpool really really Deadpool-ish that they forgot how crazy insane his usual story lines are and just used a 'superhero-movie'-template to make something up. I was disappointed by most characters too, apart from DP only Colossus (to my surprise) and Blind Al seemed to have some substance.Over all, I'd recommend seeing it, but keep your expectations low and just enjoy the fun.</fullReview>

One of the Best Comic Book Movies of All Time!I honestly wouldn't know where to begin, as a fan of the Comic Book I was angry and disappointed how they butchered the character in X- men origins: Wolverine. But that has been forgiven.This is a movie made by fans, for the fans. Ryan Reynolds lives the role and Tim Miller directed a perfect adaptation of a popular Comic Book anti-hero. Full of rich supporting characters, this was a joy ride.Full of action, a twisted sense of humor, fourth-wall breaking moments, this movie was just outstanding at every turn.Not for the faint of heart due to mature content, but otherwise one of the best movie experiences I have ever had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer a few times and while becoming slightly impatient, we had very high expectations, however Deadpool overtook them. It is a movie for big children, forbidden to children, so do leave your -14 at home :) A very blunt humour, which makes it more realistic, awesome special effects and the general idea that all the cast had lots of fun making it. Ryan Reynolds is at his best, so much better than the Green Lantern, which was not his fault, but this is one of the differences between DC Comics and Marvel Comics. We will go see it again, especially that it is shown on a 170 square meters MacroXe Ultra HD Screen only for a limited period of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is a movie based on the comic book character of the same name. I've read a few comics and yeah... this movie felt kind of disappointing. Okay so Wade Wilson has a wife, and we have a montage of them having sex around holidays, and then he gets cancer, and then he gets horribly tortured for no reason other than to make the villain more evil than he needed to be. Oh yeah, the villain is pretty forgettable, a common problem with many marvel films. And he rescues his wife at the end of the day and makes out with her. I also didn't find it very funny but I will give credit that at least the action was pretty good. That's about it.</fullReview>

Although more time was spent on this than with some other movies, I personally did not feel that it was overdone.Now for the part that ruined this movie for me -I feel that the gross humor and profanity was way overdone, which was quite disappointing. I think it would have been a much better movie, and appealed to a much broader audience if that had been dialed back a few notches. Pay very close attention to the 'R' rating.

		<shortDescription>Loved the movie! So why 5 stars?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best movie ever! Let me first preface this review by saying the movie was a freaking amazing, hilarious, action packed, shoot em up with super energetic characters.So. Wtf's up with the 5 stars? To put it as bluntly as possible, I would say this movie tried way too hard to earn it's R rating. I love the concept of Deadpool, a smart-ass merc who can't die and no reservations with killing people. I also thought the way they handled gore was very tastefully done and not overboard Which brings me to my two base issues. Nudity and language. First off no, I am not going to say I think the movie should of had no language, I really did not care that everyone swore, my issue was the way it was done. It felt like literally every sentence had to have as many curse words as time would permit, even if they made no sense whatsoever. So often things were said that had me scratching my head trying to figure out how any of those words went together. Don't get me wrong, I would of preferred the movie have no curse words and I think it would of been just fine (see Expendables 2 and how they originally intended to have 100+ F words), but I won't argue that point because that's not my real issue with the dialog. It's the incoherent method they went about it, trying for some sort of pervasive language award or something.Second off was all the nudity. Seriously people, none of the nudity benefited anything. The sexual references were also a bit thick but I didn't go to see a Deadpool movie and not expect to hear a bunch of those. But the inconsistency of he nudity really frustrated me. Some were blink and you would miss it (bedroom scene), some were strategically hidden except when for no reason they weren't (building explosion), some nudity was specifically not shown and made specifically pointed to as not showing it (think colossus scene) and others were thrown in our faces for no point (nightclub scene). No rhyme or reason for how much or little was shown, none of it benefited the movie plot or were important for maintaining story integrity. Just unnecessary gratuitous nudity to further push the R rating.I'm not a prude when it comes to language, gore, nudity or references if done tastefully and sparingly. I literally watched Freaks of Nature and The Night Before just before watching this movie, I gave The Night Before 9 stars, it had nudity, language and references but it was all done within reason and never just thrust in your face for shock value, it was also super hilarious.Of course I enjoyed this Deadpool, I laughed so hard and so long! I will be remembering quotes from the this movie for many years to come but I will not just let Hollywood get away with doing whatever the hell they want and assuming people will be fine with it. There were 5 of us watching today but if this movie had less crap in it I not only could of brought over 20 more people to see it who now won't, I would of probably watched it myself 5-6 more times. However in its current form I will not As always people will disagree with my review but this is the Internet, you aren't really saying anything worth saying if no one is getting mad at you lol</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the pixie sticks of movies. It hits you in the dome and then you wondered why you geek'd out so hard. I couldn't recite one joke from this mess. It's not that memorable, because he's so clever and so funny and so charming with the references. Right? RIGHT?! This, of course, will pass for today's theater experience. Throw it on the wall and hope they like something. Watching this was equivalent of someone grabbing you by the scruff of your neck and dragging you through a teenagers bedroom circa 1990-1996. Like when you went over to your friend's house, and their little brother couldn't stop annoying you with their toys. THE single biggest issue I had with this movie is that there are way too many people cracking wise. Deadpool, his bartender friend, his girlfriend, the blind Black woman he inexplicably takes as a roommate?for what reason, please tell me (so he can crack more jokes?). This is one big skit and violence in between. There are so many questions to his psyche that despite Ryan Reynold's supposed charm and self-effacing humor?it doesn't cut to the darkness. Yes, there are glimpses of true pain and anguish, but it's quickly diffused with THAT humor. Either you get it or you don't. And it's hard to imagine any of the teenagers in the theater I saw it in understand why the 20 something hot prostitute girlfriend knows the value of a Voltron ring. She's really not that cool. She's a whore, but doesn't look like one, act like one, feel like one. I see that years earlier, this would've been a great role for someone like Gina Gershon. In this movie, this girl doesn't have that broken busted look NO MATTER how much pain in life she's endured. Number one rule of storytelling, show DON'T tell. And there's a TON of tell.Backstory upon history, upon explanation. Yes, it breaks rules. But it also doesn't know when to use the rules they set up. They break the fourth wall to talk to the audience. Then make references to how cheap this movie was made (only TWO X-Men characters). Is this funny? Yes and no. Most people don't give a damn about what's outside those walls. Only that you're entertaining us. But that is the point. They are DYING for you to like them. I don't think I've seen a movie try so hard for you to like them. And for the most part, I do. But?it's exhausting to be around this attention deficit flick. For the most part, are the stakes really that high? Not really. Wade Wilson a.k.a. Deadpool voluntarily accepts treatment for cancer that will kill him. He's cured. Except now he's deformed. His biggest issue of revenge is ridiculously superficial. Which they had to explain away, in terms of how people find each other?looks being the sole purpose. Even though nothing in the history would explain Wilson and his girlfriend's attraction was due to looks. They are kindred spirits by way of?pop culture. So similar, they might as well be brother and sister. That's broken rule number two: there is nothing unique about her. She is the proverbial hooker with a heart of gold. Or is she? Who knows? She doesn't seem to be in that much of a hurry to leave the business (as she's seen later as a cocktail waitress at a strip club). By the way, has anyone asked what she's doing at a bar which is frequented by regulars and would just nonchalantly let in a hooker trying to score johns? The villain is?so?plain. What is his super power? Oh, one that he gave himself. And it overlaps with others. And is vague. He doesn't feel pain? Okay, so that sword that is jammed through his shoulder and carotid wouldn't, you know, stop his heart? I guess not. Since, in this world, you'd need to feel pain to bleed out. And he heals slower than others, so say a hubcap to the face, or being thrown through vehicles wouldn't, like?break every bone in his body? Nope, not in this universe. Also, the teenager with the cool name and the ability to (apparently) nuke the world?how is it that it didn't incinerate Gina Carano's clothes off. Obvious as the big metal Russian guy was sparring with her, she had nip slip. If you're going to go all the way, start with that. Look, don't ask too many questions and you'll have fun. For me, it did what it needed to do. But I don't think this movie will hold up to the hype it's getting a few months from now. It's a lackluster ice cream with a TON of whip cream. It'll make you fat, and you'll regret it down the road however, it's a good matinée watch, and worth debating with Marvel nerds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A way better love story than Twilight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2016 is going to be an insane year for superhero movies, yet the only one I was really interested in is this one. Seriously I am so disinterested now with the big budget superhero films with such convoluted plots, excessive and gratuitous use of CGI, awful pacing, and even being unfaithful to the comics.Speaking of unfaithful, I was so looking forward to seeing Wade Wilson in the 2009 Wolverine movie, even more when I heard Ryan Reynolds was playing him. That's perfect! Van Wilder can quip like no tomorrow so he's perfect for playing the Merc with the Mouth... sewn shut. Yea great job there Fox. And great job with Fant4stic too...Then the leaked test footage came out and all of us were like DO THAT! And the coke snorting corporates at Fox listened. From the cleverly designed marketing campaign you knew exactly the direction they were going and man did they not disappoint.This movie was so much fun. They really got the character so right because I was laughing non-stop. This was a really funny movie. Deadpool is one of the very few characters in the Marvel universe that can break the fourth wall and is self aware. And the movie really got because it is rife with meta-humour which can be seen in the very beginning with the best opening credits scene ever. And yes we see him breaking the fourth wall, making pop culture references, and slicing up bad guys. The film is not tame. The humour is nowhere near South Park levels but it does give the biggest middle finger to PC culture. The action scenes are also a lot of fun. From the sword fighting, to the shooting, to the acrobatics, they were all filmed really well. It delivers on the violence too, which is cartoonish enough but it doesn't go too much into Blade territory. Although with Wade Wilson's face, in the comics it is really boiled and deformed and here he just looks like a prune. Guess they wanted to use Ryan Reynolds as much as they could.The story is quite simple here. Its a love and revenge story. It is well paced though as it is told in a non-linear style. It somewhat slows down for me when it does get to the love story part but thankfully those scenes are mercifully short. There are some plot holes, but you really don't care because of how fun the movie is.This movie is so refreshing. I thought I was too jaded by superhero films but when you pick the right character to adapt, you can have so much fun with him or her. Honestly I really don't care about any of the upcoming Avengers films or this new X-Men film or the Superman vs Batman film because they're all so formulaic. Deadpool brought us something different and it was awesome, like a chimichanga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Shh - my common sense is tingling"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wades?er, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, "an avocado had sex with an older avocado". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent ("count the bullets" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as "that British villain" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here?), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpopular Opinion: This film isn't that good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The long awaited Deadpool is finally and with its much talked about "hard R" rating. Starring Ryan Reynolds as a quick taking, fourth- wall breaking, insult throwing, masked superhero, we hear about how Deadpool became Deadpool told in flashback sequences, while simultaneously following a present day plot as well. The question for the average movie goer is "Is this film really as good and as raunchy as everyone says?" No it isn't. I don't mean to ramble much so I'll start with the good, this film does have some humorous moments and most of the supporting characters are very entertaining to watch. And yes this film also does have some good action sequencesSadly, that is where the good ends. This films tries very hard to be edgy and raunchy, as well as claiming to not be your average Marvel film because of those following reasons. But let me assure you; This film is most definitely very similar to all of the other Marvel films. By saying "fuck" a few times, showing breasts at a strip club and throwing childish insults such as "dicktits" is not smart filmmaking or screen writing. It is easy adolescent humor. This film has a simple plot that is easy to follow and is spoonfed to you. I have seen good comedies and I have seen good superhero films and this excels in neither. In this films defense it may not try to be anything other than feel- good-fun-turn-your-brain-off type film, but that within itself is lazy filmmaking. I shouldn't have to turn my brain off to have enjoy a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chimichanga time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is the eighth installment in the X-Men film series. It follows Wade Wilson who, after being subjected to an experiment that leaves him with new abilities, hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life.From the studio that inexplicably sewed his *beep* mouth shut the first time, comes... Deadpool. It may not have been the superhero that Hollywood wanted, but he's certainly the one they deserve. After years of speculation as to whether or not everyones favourite anti-superhero would actually get made into a standalone picture, Tim Miller's Deadpool has arrived. Do not let the February release date fool you, this is very much the film that both fans of the character and Ryan Reynolds have been waiting for. Full of comedic snark and constant fourth wall breaks (and Inception style fourth wall breaks within those), it delivers every bit upon its promise, a truly entertaining ride from start to finish. Minutes into opening credits, you are gracefully dropped into the self-aware world of the film, with notable credits such as "directed by an overpaid tool," and "produced by *beep*hats." If that does not sell you on what kind of comedy Deadpool brings to the table, then you can always catch a screening of Zoolander 2 next door. When it comes down to it, Deadpool is one part vendetta film, one part romantic tale a la "Beauty and the Beast" style. This is the role that Ryan Reynolds were born to play. It's been a passion project for the actor for many years, and it shows. He is to the Deadpool franchise (the sequel were already planned ahead of its release) what Robert Downey Jr. is to Iron Man. You cannot imagine anyone else possibly playing the role. Erased from memory is the X-Men Origins: Wolverine version that Reynolds played in 2009. What a relief. The tie-in to the world of X-Men is somewhat limited aside from the inclusion of Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. I will not saying more. At the end of the day, Deadpool's re-watch factor is sky high, possibly the most important success of them all. I'm touching myself tonight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summer fun in February!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hooo boy! The year has barely started and already we have shots fired. In the battle to earn your comic book movie love (And dollars) Marvel has come charging out of the gate. After a dearth of comic book films last year Deadpool comes out swinging giving us a reason to love the summer again and it ain't even March. The film begins with an ambitious opening scene, the credits of which, perfectly set the tone of the movie from the get-go: funny, irreverent and self-aware. Marvel appears to have adopted a doctrine of making their films be entertaining (Imagine that!) above any other concerns and Deadpool seems to be a culmination of that philosophy. It is a testament to the skill and commitment of Marvel and the makers that they can get so much mileage out of one second tier character, and half the budget, than other companies can with four first rate ones, fantastic or otherwise. (Way to redeem yourself 20th Century Fox!) Not bad for a character that was a created as a joke. (For the non-initiated, Deadpool started life as a blatant clone of Deathstroke, a character from DC Comics, Marvel's main competitor.)In all this the film is aided in great part by a crackling script that never lets up. Whereas too many action movies treat the scenes between set pieces as filler packed with exposition and the occasional comic relief, Deadpool deftly weaves between wise- cracking slapstick, violent acrobatics and scenes of serious peril with effortless ease. The result of all of this is a movie that is engaging throughout whether featuring profane, brilliant banter or graphical, bloody shootouts. For the film wears that R rating proudly with enough sex and violent to make Paul Verhoeven get all misty-eyed. It is not surprise there is already a sequel in the works.Another revelation here is Reynolds himself who in Deadpool seems to have found his Iron Man, a character so indelibly linked to the actor that plays him that you cannot imagine anyone else playing him. And his work here acts as vindication of that whole Wolverine debacle which we won't mention ever again. But the secret ingredient in the Deadpool stew is geek heroine Morena Baccarin, who, besides being cute as a button brings the acting chops honed in fan favorites like Gotham and Firefly or even as the darnest adorable reptilian alien ever in the short-lived "V" reboot. Baccarin has the perfect easy-going confidence to match Reynold's sardonic bravado and their superb and convincing on-screen chemistry provides the impetus for Deadpool's heroic arc.For despite all the foul language, gore and masturbation jokes, this is a story that is surprisingly tender. It turns out it wasn't just a marketing gimmick and, Deadpool, really is a love story. To be sure, one with more severed body parts than your average love yarn but a love story nonetheless. Starting a new franchise is always risky and studios hate taking risks. Whatever your stance on comic books is, the fact remains this movie should not have been this good. The writers and director have shown what can be achieved with bold writing and an unapologetic attitude, and, more importantly, that comic book movies need not be made for kids to be enjoyable or, indeed, successful. Here's to hoping that trend will continue. Hopefully Hollywood will take notice.Parent's BriefRated: R Running Time: 108 minutes On Sex and Violence: Plenty of both. There is graphic violence of the gratuitous kind. People get shot in all kinds of places and I mean their bodies not exotic locations. Limbs get bloodily cut off. A lot of foul language which I don't mind but I'm not here to judge. Deadpool and his love interest get into some vigorous love making and elsewhere there is some brief frontal nudity. Boobies. Boobies are shown. So yeah. Don't take the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How a superhero movie is supposed to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds is the embodiment of the Deadpool character. He did an absolutely awesome job and made the movie as epic as it is. In my opinion his sense of humour perfectly matches that of the original character. Before watching the movie, I was a bit afraid the story of Wade would slowdown the roller-coaster ride, bit it is nicely scattered throughout the movie. Not so much to lose track of the original storyline and not too little to be oblivious of where the superhero comes from. I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if more of the Marvel universe was pulled into the story, but I'm not completely sure of it :). The fourth wall being broken here and there is very refreshing and very Deadpool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world.. where superhero movies are often unnecessarily dark and gritty, #Deadpool comes along and shows you how it's done! It's the perfect combo of action, comedy, and R-rating that really don't give two sh*ts about your sensitivity. Do you remember that warm blueberry pie that your grandma made for you when you were younger or the time you saw that girl you've been crushing on during chemistry class in high school? Well, you can throw those memories out the window now and make way for DEADPOOL.Ryan Reynolds plays a skilled special forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, Morena Baccarin plays his hot-ass girlfriend, Vanessa. This woman is the embodiment of sexy. They are a match made in Marvel Comics' heaven. But their dream is crushed upon discovering that Wilson has cancer all over, a situation that forces him to sign up to a rogue experiment that subjects him to accelerated healing powers. The lab is run by Francis/Ajax (Ed Skrein) who himself is a bit of a mutant. The brutal experiments turn Wade Wilson into an ugly dude but an indestructible one. He's now bent on revenge, especially after Ajax kidnaps Vanessa. Meanwhile Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead from the X-Men, try their best to convince Deadpool to join their team and become one of the good guys. But let's face it, that ain't DEADPOOL's style! The first people we have to thank of course would be the original comic book writers/creators Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld who brilliantly gave us this very unique superhero unlike any other. The next people in line to thank are screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick who remind us why we loved "Zombieland" back in 2009, they inject the same brand of humor into DEADPOOL and keep the character faithful to the comic books, yes, by that I mean none of that crap version of Wade Wilson in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" anymore! Applause goes to Tim Miller as well, what a helluva feature directorial debut, clearly when you give a superhero project to a geek who loves the material and knows it inside out, if you just let him run with it, it's like giving G.I. Joe toys to a kid who can name them all by heart, great things can happen.For those of you who are not familiar with DEADPOOL, just a heads up, this movie, just like the comics, is extremely over the top graphic in terms of sex, violence and humor, and that's exactly how we like it. Wade Wilson is a chatterbox, he talks a lot, to some this can get annoying, while to the rest, it's music to our ears, mainly because of the sh*t he says. And he breaks fourth wall, meaning he'll talk to you the audience. But what's even more epic than that is the fact that he is AWARE of the universe that he's in and the universe that you're in, and those two collide in the most epic way possible, so Ryan Reynolds' character, Wade Wilson, makes fun of Ryan Reynolds the actor and also mocks Ryan Reynolds' previous poor decisions like Green Lantern and People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive This movie is a dream come true for those of you hardcore fans, it even has what I think is one of the greatest most hilarious opening credit scenes in the history of cinema. For a while, I heard that the studio wanted the film to include more mutants, but I'm glad the filmmakers kept things to just a few characters for this first installment a.k.a origin story, so it's simple enough for the new fans to follow. I love how the humor is so brash and unapologetic, it's like insult comedy or one of them roast shows, everybody is fair game. The fights are rock 'em sock 'em and the VFX is impressive! And I can't be happier for Ryan Reynolds, I'm sure he had been wanting to redeem himself since "Green Lantern" and whatever the hell that was in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," so with this DEADPOOL movie, he finally got it right, you can tell he desperately wanted to be part of this superhero genre, and so now he's really part of the gang. He was born for this role. He was destined to play this. In many ways, Deadpool is kinda like Van Wilder on crack. And actress Morena Baccarin as Vanessa? well, let's just say that after watching this movie, every guy on earth will wonder, 'Why can't my girlfriend be more like that!' If you're looking for a date movie, DEADPOOL is it. if you're looking for an action-packed movie, DEADPOOL is definitely most certainly it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal and hilarious... Or hilariously brutal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I've been a fan of Deadpool since I first picked up issue #1 of the newer series back in 2012, and I've been reading the comics ever since, including many of the older issues. I love Deadpool. I went into this movie expecting it to be mediocre. After all, Deadpool is the kind of character that really needs to be done right, and I felt that if the movie changed anything about the story or the character, it would be awful. But at the same time, I had heard how passionate Ryan Reynolds is about Deadpool and that the writers really wanted to stick closely to the source material, so I was hopeful. And then I saw it opening night, and I was absolutely blown away. Deadpool as a movie is everything I ever hoped for and more. The visual effects are stunning, the acting is superb, and everything about it was absolutely, positively Deadpool. The movie is practically a comic book that came to life on the big screen, with everything perfectly tuned to feel just like a Deadpool comic. Fortunately, the writers did a great job of making sure that this is not just for die-hard Deadpool fans. My wife went with me to see it opening night, and she liked it nearly as much as I did even though she's never read a single issue of the comics. This is a great entry point for anyone wanting a more brutal "superhero" (or "anti-hero," technically) but with a lot of humor that you won't find in other dark comic book movies, like Punisher or Blade for example. This movie is rated R, and for good reason. This is definitely not the kind of movie you should show to your kids just because the main character wears spandex. There's nudity, gore and language that would make a sailor blush. You know in the comic books when the speech bubbles say "@$#^%!!!"? That doesn't translate to live action, so all those grawlixes (that's the comic book word for them) turn into real-life curse words, and all the comic book violence is exponentially stronger when brought to the big screen. So please, do not rent the DVD and put it on for your kids and leave the room just because "it's a superhero movie." This is an adult movie, based on an adult comic book. Overall, I was blown away by how well Ryan Reynolds portrayed my favorite comic book character, and the entire movie was exactly as it should be. If you're a fan of Deadpool already and haven't seen the movie yet, do yourself a favor and grab it May 10 when it comes out on Blu-Ray. I've already reserved a copy. If you're not a Deadpool fan yet but you like comic books, superhero movies, and tons of immature humor, drop everything and go see Deadpool this instant. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to rate this movie 9 mostly for the the marketing and that the film was near perfect. Also it has a lot going for it with a groundbreaking combination of pacing,action,lots of laughs and a good drama.The movie knew what it should be,plays with it's limitations and is very entertaining and that's why you go to see movies. The rated R was refreshing and so was the build up of the story which makes you say at the end"I want more of this".Ryan Reynolds did a good job as the anti-hero and the supporting cast played just as strong making all there roles memorable.So,the 8 rating is because of a possible sequel and also how it holds up after some time has passed. I think second Deadpool could be even better so than I'll rate that 9.For now,this was a great movie,I really recommend it and I know that I'll watch it again a few times and try to spot the jokes I missed the first time(because I was laughing to loud).Probably the best super(anti)hero origin story I have seen so far. (and I mean as a movie I don't know the comic book).This movie is awesome for everyone...except families with kids.I enjoyed it a lot and I hope they'll go even a little darker with the next one and raise the stakes and keep the momentum.I liked this movie all the way,I hope it will be a good franchise. (Deadpool was my 100th review on IMDb,thank you if you ever read this or any of my other reviews)Thanks again and enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

However through all the comedy and action the thing that really stole the show, at least for me, was the story. The storytelling in this film was honestly better done than anything else, which is a compliment because the other aspects were quite good. You will come for the jokes, and Deadpool was overall a pretty funny movie, but the (admittedly clichéd) story will likely impress and surprise you.So should you watch Deadpool?

There is nothing special you gonna find interesting from the plot apart from the fight sequence and punch dialogues.When it comes to casting ryan reynolds did complete justification for his role and the job he did for giving voice over to his character is absolutely commendable. It is completely hilarious the way deadpool talks and the rest of them did their part well.

		<fullReview>It's a Marvel superhero movie, but with a lot of adult jokes, which I could not understand all of them because I am not native. A lot of people laughed, so most people enjoyed it. I guess that was because of those adult jokes. But I gave 7, because the story is very simple. The action is OK. I can recall some similar scenes in other movies. It was Valentine's day. There was love element in the movie too, but only for adorning. so far more than half of it's box office comes from domestic, which approves that this movie more suit for local people, because for these kinds of superhero movies, domestic box office generally only accounts for one third.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the very few modern era heroes (or anti-heroes) whose daily life is somewhat similar to a standard citizen compared to other marvel (or DC) heroes, Deadpool is a movie that should be seen by everyone who likes comic multi-verses. I think that in the overall sense, the movie slightly fails the over-hyped expectations of the internet community, but it is nonetheless a very important milestone in this sense. The narration style, fun moments and mature content makes this otherwise uninteresting film a 7 star one. Of course, the lead actor have a large part in this as well.

Not only does this have MAJOR use of language &amp; sexual language but has two scenes of female nudity along with one scene of male nudity. There is also a sex montage where (SPOILER) Wade &amp; Vanessa have sex &amp; it shows their sex over a time period of the different holidays. It also has a TON of blood &amp; gore with a scene where Deadpool cuts off his own hand &amp; multiple scenes where a couple of heads will be cut off &amp; all of this is caught on camera. There is a scene where we see Wade masturbating but he is under the bed, but you can still see what is going on with the movements.

I'm a fan of Ryan Reynolds and therefor might be biased, but even the supporting actors did a really good job. And you connect with all the characters. Most superhero movies are mindless entertained based entirely on the "wow" factor. But this one actual makes you feel what happens to Deadpool and in most cases, agree with what he does.The visual effects were outstanding, the fighting fantastic, and the re-creation of Deadpool from a comic book character to an actual movie character was on point.And the added X-men inclusion was like icing on the cake. I loved how the X-men were mocked constantly in the movie. Especially shots at Wolverine and Hugh Jackman. Funny as hell.If you haven't seen this movie, you need to. Definitely going to be best movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm middle-aged, into many anime and manga, am black, and have lived in several countries, including the USA. I've been a comics fanboy since way back. I owned the first Spawn, and collected comics since the 1970s. I've followed the films of many comic adaptations, and this is absolutely one of the best. So I would say that this film appealed to me.The music selected for the film was pure genius. It gave added energy and edge. The story was light, but did have the basic components to create a full story. There was pathos, humour, revenge, sex, and action. It was a sort of adult version of a Spiderman story, if Spiderman had been raunchy, and had a bit of Wolverine in him. I may go see it again, but even if I don't, I'm buying it as soon as its available. Great film. I gave a very high rating, due to its immense fun factor. Sadly for other similar films that are due out soon or in the not too distant future, the bar has been raised. I'm not worried for Batman v Superman, but I am scared for Suicide Squad, as it may have to have some re-edits if its to have the type of following that Deadpool has gained.

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie! A little too gory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was hilarious.Extremely well acted, the characters were memorable and likable, and Ryan Reynolds is hysterical and makes the perfect dead pool. The fight scenes were well choreographed, the female love interest is believable, and dead pools friend is just as hilarious as he is. The whole thing was marvelous.The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars is because for some reason they thought having it excessively gory would make it better and it doesn't. A flying limb can be funny, but we don't need to see all the dangling tissue and stump of a leg attached.Definitely an R rated movie, I would not take kids to this, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mouthful of a hero to expand the Marvel Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel's ever expanding Universe introduces us to an unlikely hero. Almost as a mockery of superheroes, this wisecracking, re-generating mutant will not shut the @#$% up and will randomly digress into thinking about his kitchen stove in the midst of a car crash. His moral compass is broken to an extent where he disregards human life and ignores collateral damage caused by his actions. The distinction between good and evil is blurry to him but all this doesn't quite make him an anti-hero. He still has a freakishly loving girl and a villain who is British enough to be one. Deadpool's origin story doesn't break new ground. Nor does his emergence in the Marvel Universe make it any easier to prevent Thanos from destroying the Universe and yet, debutant Director Tim Miller does get a few things strikingly right which make Deadpool an incredibly fun, must watch action film. Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a mercenary who crossed paths with some dirty folk and then got even dirtier with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) for months at a stretch. Soon he realizes that he is diagnosed with cancer and that his only remote hope is to be a part of a medical experiment that involves mutant genes. We know how that goes.... The resulting hideous face needed a mask and a body suit that ended up being red, just so the enemies wouldn't see him bleeding. Embarrassed by his condition, Wade chooses to live with a blind old lady and not confront Vanessa till he forces Ajax (Ed Skrein), the mad scientist who created this accidental mutation, to reverse the adverse effect. With this origin story reflected upon in the middle of an intensely gory action sequence, Deadpool reverts our attention back to his gruesome ways as he pursues Ajax's convoy and practically decimates the scene. Just as he is about to torture Ajax, Colossus and the punk teen named Negasonic Teenage Warhead from Prof. Xavier's University intervene and try to arrest Wade as Ajax sees the right opportunity to escape. In the movie's timeline, all of this occurs in the first fight sequence itself with a couple of lengthy flashbacks. Unable to forget his love for Vanessa, he gathers the courage to face her at her workplace, only to realize that Ajax had kidnapped her just then. Wade will need the help of a lot of ammunition, Colossus and the Teenage Warhead to stand a chance against Ajax's forces that include Angel Dust (Gina Carano). The finale atop the Helicarrier has all of them battling with Marvel's special effects galore as Deadpool still doesn't stop yapping away with his punchlines. The usual origin story of the unlikely superhero doesn't quite surprise anyone. What the film instead depends on is the narrative through the fourth wall, the snark comments, unabashed action that is both gory and gruesome, and the naughty yet petulant romance that really makes a badass like Deadpool genuinely care about someone. It finally seems like Ryan Reynolds has a possible franchise that could be his career. He enjoys the sarcasm and wit while his character transitions through several phases. The carefree attitude and fickle behavior are what make Deadpool so enjoyable and Reynolds has pretty much nailed it. Morena Baccarin not only looks gorgeous but plays the naughty escort with convincing charm. She can certainly combat Wade's innuendos with effective volleys. Ed Skrein (Transporter Refueled and 'Dario Naharis') is matched in mutant powers but his character falls short of an evil that is worth despising or respecting. Perhaps a more powerful nemesis will follow this origin story that had a lot more to introduce than just a battle against evil. Tim Miller and his writers haven't reinvented the genre but they certainly have re-engineered a tired concept that involves a multitude of characters and special effects over some witty dialogue and R-rated action to enhance the character's appeal. Deadpool will leave you entertained like no other superhero can. If it all comes down to Earth's saviors having to send an emissary to negotiate with the arch enemy, Deadpool will be a mouthful of a hero who might just save the day...... if he cares enough.- 8.776 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect For what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool was Perfect for what it was. It is tough to write a plot line for a character that can literally read the script in the movie. Even with that tough spot the movie did and excellent job of creating a background and a story that can intrigue the non die hard comic readers and keep the die hards in love. The jokes were some what corny but it is so deadpool that you can't complain. I think the Marvel comic fans will enjoy this movie more than the general audience. The 4th wall breaks were really well done and did not consume the movie as it did in the deadpool video game. There was no one moment or moments that had me on the floor crying from laughter, but there were plenty of great laughs at every moment. The ending was hilarious but predictable but once again it was so deadpool that you can't complain. All in all the movie was hilarious wild crazy and entertaining, but most of all it was SO DEADPOOL. COMIC FANS EMBRACE THE MERC!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Canadian Film i have ever seen, Full Stop. And incidentally has now joined the list of one of my favourite films.(Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dedicate this review to Silvers. Deadpool, it's got action, it's got disconnecting heads but not like a Quentin Tarrantino Film- no blood and kid friendly i would say. 'The splat against the motorway/highway/freeway signage.'How can you tell its Canadian..Ryan Reynolds, who to put it bluntly is the Star....yes he really is ;) , and zambonis, and hockey bags. He goes up against the pope..no he really doesn't..Its laugh out loud funny or was for me. The inmovie wise cracks really appeal to me. The out of movie wise cracks really appeal to me(the opening credits.) Its an avengers tie in with the Ruined SkyCarrier thing. Its Marvel and Stan Lee cameos. Its got hockey double layered same letter first initial names, which incidentally are Marvel Character Double layered same letter first initial names too..its got a Metallic Silver Colossus..incidentally this is the first time I've seen the movie, did see Colossus in the trailer mind you, one of them. its got a bar which reminds me of a bar i most certainly, err might be visiting in Canada. I've seen the photo of the actual bar. Wade Wilson is the empowered dudes name, yup he is super. As an Englishman, all the wise quipps, i am shortly to visit the North American continent. It honestly felt like a primer for this. Its even got unicorns twice. Will appeal to kids too. it is a 15 certificate though- people may disagree but if there's a 12 rating, id have rated it that...as regards the big V, its the tamest i have seen. My favourite films are Fifth Element, Talladega Nights, Wreck-It Ralph and now this one too.. Wreck-it Ralph was an inappropriately(maybe) titled film for kids or family. This is an inappropriately (maybe) content filled film for kids or family. A mighty 10 out of 10 by me..Gonna buy it hd when i can..this ones a keeper. On Deadpool, Go Deadpool. Let's go Deadpool. i'm up for a sequel if there is one... Script(choreography type thing) was perfection for me...it was one of those start from the middle movies but Wasn't difficult in knowing where it was..the then speed past and up to current, coolio..(watching Memento i'm sorry i found an effort to watch but yup THAT was a different style of movie). Bit disappointed he didn't pay the taxi driver mind you. that's why every discerning superhero needs a utility belt for something after all....another reason for a sequel..suit mk2 ;) Not sure if it was an easter egg type thing or i just wasn't listening but i am gonna be watching the movie again ANYWAY, no not today(or tomorrow but it really is a fully recommended and great movie).....did i actually apparently miss one of the funniest quips in the movie.....no more on that. Great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so i have been a fan of dead pool for a good 2 years i read all comics and then when i finished i wondered "why the hell is there no movie yet" this character is so interesting and unique and deserves its own movie.i then heard they were making a dead pool movie and i was so excited.I watched the first screening and Wow did i enjoy it. i felt like a kid a again i had my eyes wide open and felt a big grin across my face during the whole movie.not one aspect about dead pool disappointed me the jokes,action,dialog,credits and more were just perfect and couldn't of been executed any better. and Ryan Reynolds as dead pool don't even get me started he really redeemed his self from green lantern and previous attempt of dead pool in X-men origins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My son loves Deadpool character and I was worried about taking him to see this R-rated movie. But in all honesty, there are much worse that kids nowadays are exposed to (games and movies). Yes, Deadpool has violence and it is a little bloody, but I think the humor really helps to tone down the heaviness. The violence in Deadpool doesn't compare to 300 or Old Boy, which I would never let my kids see. As far as the sexual scenes, there were a couple of scenes and they are far in between. I do think they can tone down on the "unnecessary" swearing that seem solely there just for the sake of making it rated R. I'm by no means sensitive to it, but just stating there are many rated R movies that definitely can carry the same message without unnecessary swears every 5 seconds that makes it seem more annoying than meaningful.If they do decide to do a sequel, hoping they will stay true to the character's humor and essence. My son did mention that Deadpool in the game was a bit stronger than portrayed in the movie. Most sequels destroy hit movies by trying to overcompensate and thus going over-the-top with bad jokes, story lines, and more violence. More is not always better. This one was nicely done, but can tone down on swearing a bit. Just keep it simple but effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel seems to be really straining for Super Hero names. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . since it has sunk as low as DEADPOOL. I guess that that's what happens when you're bored with the 18 billion names already given to Real Life People on our planet (including Rocky Rhodes and Chastity Bordello), and you concoct an infinity of Alternate Universes. Because the Artist Formerly Known as Prince already has exhausted Society's patience for Hieroglyphical Names, since numeric monikers become monotonous after about three digits (just try to imagine telling someone that two social security numbers kissed each other), and with names composed of random letters (such as a-s-d-f-g-h-j-k-l) largely viewed as being both crude and unwieldy, Marvel is forced to resort to the DEADPOOLS of this world. With Ryan Reynolds making a couple of post-credits appearances here to promise a DEADPOOL sequel including new Super Hero characters, I'm willing to contribute a few free suggestions to the obviously depleted Marvel Brain Trust. First off, "Braintruss" seems perfect (sort of like a jockstrap for your mind). As Marvel values testosterone so highly, why NOT add "Jockstrap" and "Testes" to its Pantheon, as well? They'd make a great team. Finally, I once ran across an "Alice" limerick that could provide Marvel with a real thumper--they only have to beat out D.C. Comics in the race to be the first to trademark "Phallus!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the title says it all.I am one of those few guys who have never read any comics (I KNOW!!!). So like all other marvel comics movie I went in without knowing anything about what to expect.So if you are one of those guys then you are going to like what I have to say next.Did you like pulp Fiction? What about Inglorious Bastards? Kill Bill? Do you like blood sputtering everywhere? Do you like when you can see the inside of the brain of a person after a bullet has hit him? Do you like to watch beheading with a sword? If the answer is yes to the above it is very highly likely that you are gonna love this movie.Any movie from Marvel Comics has a certain standard. It will never be too bad. And there have been a lot of them in the last few years, and they needed to stand out. And the way this movie decided to stand out is by being gory,bloody and unchildly.Don't get me wrong - as we expect from ANY Marvel comics movie this is full of action, amazing special effects, great characters, decent storyline. But this also comes with a villanish hero. Its almost like the black spiderman. A superhero with an evil spirit inside of him.For me to review a movie is to think about what I will remember about it a year from now. And I will remember this: Marvel Comics got heavily inspired by Mr.Tarantino and created an evil spirited superhero who likes to take head off with a sword at any chance he gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool: The Merc finally got his mouth (and a movie)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been very interested in superhero movies. Although there are some rare exceptions, these mostly come from DC (The Dark Knight or V for Vendetta, for example) and not from Marvel. Yet, I was highly anticipating the new film by Marvel Studios, starring the Merc with a mouth, Deadpool. Let me tell you why and how these expectations were satisfied.Deadpool tells the story of Wade Wilson, a mercenary with a very dark and sarcastic kind of humor. Wilson is diagnosed with terminal cancer in his liver, lungs, brain and prostate. He takes part in an experiment, to develop regenerative powers which, as a side effect leave him permanently disfigured. Then follows a typical revenge story to the people who have disfigured him. The story is not really the high point of this movie and the villain seem uninspired. They are just "bad" because they are and have no real motives.However, Deadpool's strength lies in his very special and meta humor. It already starts of perfectly in the opening credits where the writers are described as "the real heroes here" and the director as an "overpaid tool". This is the sarcasm and hilarity people want to see in Deadpool! There are many other funny moments, but sometimes audiences have to wait to long for the next laugh. There are two interwoven time lines in this film which eventually combine: The Wade Wilson pre Deadpool time line and the Deadpool time line. I personally found the Deadpool time line much more entertaining than the former.The acting is solid, but nothing special. The visual effects are very good, but also not the best we have ever seen. The soundtrack features, among others, a song from George Michael, for comedic purposes, but also actually good songs like Hit The Road Jack or X Gon' Give It To Ya.In the end, Deadpool is a great action-comedy with its flaws. It features hilarious humor, good effects and a diverse soundtrack, but also has a bit too clichéd plot, boring villains and sometimes a bit too much waiting time until the next good joke. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is a good take on the comic character of the mercenary Wade Wilson. It's nonlinear in that it ends where it starts and the plot is explained throughout the film in a flash back fashion. It has a similar dynamic to Fight Club in that way. It was a good mix of comedy and action. It makes use of dark and ironic humor. It definitely justifies some of its major hype. It compiles lots of story and action into one small film through narration. The action and effects are very well done and engaging. The narration is important because it really emphasizes the character of Deadpool and the way he thinks. The fourth wall breaks were also very accurate to the role of Deadpool. It was a very fun and entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done, Reynolds, but we want more (which is good!) from Marvel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To summarize my taste in Marvel films, I love the Captain America's, The Iron Man's (except the 3rd one) and think the two Avengers films have been good but have not lived up to their potential. I was also a big fan of Antman, thanks to Paul Rudd.Deadpool. Always been a fan of Reynolds, but don't think he's a great actor... However! He's found a role which plays to his strengths (mainly his motor mouth) and has done well here. With the support of studio he has finally unlocked some of his potential and shown us he can be a blockbuster actor. A money maker. Just not an award winning one. To the film. Yeah it was fun. We all new what was going to happen before we went and it happened well. The plot was obvious, as we expected. If you've read the reviews, you know the type of gag you're going to get. If you've watched the trailers, you know the characters involved and their best 'punchlines'. I went into this film knowing all of the above, but I still came out smiling. Job done by all in my eyes. 8/10 in my eyes - and it would be even higher if I didn't believe that the next dead pool could be even better, which is the biggest achievement for this film!</fullReview>

Maybe when they come out with the sequel there will be more. Just hoping!If you haven't seen the movie, just remember: IT IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!!! THERE IS A REASON WHY IT HAS BEEN RATED R!!!!

No matter what genre you like be it romance,action,thriller,comedy,and drama it caters all of it in a single piece.That's a rare combination in a movie we know that.Also the thing I came to know after watching this movie was that in the movie Origins:The Wolverine the one Wolverine fights in the last part of the movie was Deadpool only.So the movie basically derives its roots from XMen Series.Ryan Reynolds confirms through his acting that no one can replace him in this role.Seems like the guy has been made for this role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to describe this movie in words is a challenge. All I can say is that when I left the cinema, my mouth was gaping wider that the entrance to Luna Park. It was raunchy, it was violent, it was hilarious. Many say it started off strong and slipped to above satisfactory. I disagree. It definitely slowed at some points to give way to the eherm, "plot". But am I going to nit-pick that? No. It was done well.This is the best movie of this year so far, and it will be a challenge to beat. And why's that? Because it's original and genuinely funny, delivering "zingers" every 30 seconds (pretty much). The weird thing? I can't remember any because it was all so relevant to the situations in the movie. That is definitely a good thing.Plot? Almost imaginary and uninspired. Like as if they took it from a magazine called "cliche monthly". Again, that's not important for this film. This one was all about delivering a new kind of hero to save us from the increasingly mediocre other Marvel films. It did however throw a few spin-balls into the mix for the whole damsel-in- distress scenario, which was nice.So why a nine? Because it was a fantastic film and deserves a crisp high-ten. But if it's a ten, there's nothing better right? I believe Deadpool 2 could be, so I'll leave a bit of a buffer...And please don't take your kids to see this. I saw a few embarrassed parents walk out with their youngsters after 10 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally Fox gets it right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know. I'm late with the review. Stuff happens man, what can I tell you. This film has a lot of sexual stuff, a shadow image of some frontal nudity and gore. So please be warned, don't take small children, unless you like answering a whole lot of sex questions. The expletives are creative to say the least. So that's another thing.However if you can leave the small ones with grandma or your lonely best friend, do that and go see this film.So pros vs cons.Pros: Great costume. Effects are a little on the frugal side, but very good in keeping with the personality of Deadpool. Nonstop action and comedy. Both over the top and subtle. Some dramatic moments. X-MEN BABY!! As you've seen from the trailer both Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead(The coolest name ever) are in this, in all their collective glory.Can't comment on the guys but the ladies are gorgeous in this. Gina is fantastic and if you like her as a fighter, you won't be disappointed.Also, it's not linear. YES! None of that, this is what happened front middle and end nonsense. No brooding in a cave or fights with best friends. It goes to the action, then back to story, then back to the action again. Fantastic!Okay...Cons:Well...They did a fantastic job on Deadpool's look and Colossus and even Negasonic looked like an X-Men. His girlfriend, and main antagonist did not. Granted hard to do the Weapon X program with Hugh "Wolverine" Jackmen retiring, but the look of all the characters would have been nice. Now, I enjoyed looking at Ms Baccarin, as she is, but a little nod to her comic book character counterpart would have been nice. Just a little sexiest just having her as the girlfriend, that gets kidnapped. Which made no sense, seeing as Deadpool was already after Francis. Speaking of Francis(Villain) he was just another comic book character that was a pretty face instead of the gruesome character he's supposed to be. Also, this is a film by Fox and you know what that means. Lack of diversity. Yeah, if your looking for minorities you will only find two, and no, it was not fantastic. Not in the slightest.Otherwise if you can stand some deviations, gore, sexual content and foul language, then you will enjoy this movie.Til next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I don't read comic books, I haven't seen any of the X men films, and I didn't really know what Deadpool was about before seeing it. In fact, I expected Deadpool would be something along the lines of 'Kick-Ass' (another excellent film), but how wrong I was.It is hard to explain how funny this film is. I think the fact I had no real prior knowledge about the film or the comic books it was based on meant I wasn't going in expecting anything. The humour is just hilarious! It's proper good old fashioned adult one liners, with plenty of 'nob' jokes to keep the little boy inside everyone of us amused. I found myself laughing pretty much all the way though the film, with tears streaming down my face. If you are hoping for political correctness, you're going to be disappointed!There is loads of action, love and romance, bad guys, car chases and crashes, and loads of great special effects. I don't know how else to describe Deadpool apart from to say that if you like comedies and/or action films, you really will love this film. You don't have to be a fan of X men or the other Marvel films to enjoy this film. If you are, great. If you're not, then you'll probably enjoy this as a hilarious send up of them.The best money I've spent going to the Cinema in years. I can't wait to see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I bring you the Pool. Deadpool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first someone will think that's another movie about a new superhero who gained super powers to save the world. Totally wrong. Deadpool is a very special character and in fact he is unique in several ways. In the world of comics he is relatively new because he is old twenty(ish) years, but rapidly gained favor with his audience. He is the anti- hero (dare to say the best), he is aware that he is a character in the comic book, very often addresses the reader, has perhaps the strongest (fastest) ability to cure, has a special style of fighting,he is dangerous and deadly and with this all he is completely crazy. This is a short list because there's more. The film is great seeing all this. I can understand that someone did not like this movie, but then I realized that the film was not made for him. Since it is very faithful to the comic transferred to the big screen, it is clear that there is a large grade or hype. Ryan Reynolds was not playing a great Deadpool, he was Deadpool. I liked it immediately from the excellent opening scene and enjoyed until the end of the post-credit that is really awesome (there is someone who has gone by now?). A few months ago I was hoping that this will not be the only PG-13 movie than R movie because otherwise you can not make a Deadpool movie and to be good and true to the comics. This movie has a million jokes, there are a million references to other characters and movies (well, let no million, but there are over 100). Well this movie was made for such a person, who understood each reference and each joke. It is clear that this is not a new Godfather, The Odyssey, Fight Club, ... (insert the movie of your choice), but in its genre, for what would this movie should be, then this achievement deserves the highest ratings and positive reviews. I look forward to continuing.</fullReview>

I hope you do not miss not one piece of film because the references are held every 2 min, all of them are linked to the world of Hqs, movies, series, TV, drawings, novels, other films, actors ... It is totally important to follow with patience and attention throughout the film From start to finish.

I think he has a natural delivery for the jokes/quips being delivered from start to finish.Deadpool himself is unashamedly selfish and is the first superhero I have encountered who is not concerned with morals,ethics or helping anyone else but himself.The storyline wasn't brilliant, but it served as a great way of introducing Deadpool to new audiences and I'll look forward to the sequel and hope they do something cleverer with the plot next time.I didn't think I would like this movie, but I'm glad I went to see it as I laughed all the way through.

		<fullReview>First Of all i want to say that this movie is way very different from another comic book movies.Deadpool brings us massive action,comedy movie with lots of jokes and full of action.This movie will not allow u to get bored on one second.I couldn't imagine that film with low budget like this could be so awesome.I recommend this movie all comic book fans and it does not make sense u that u love DC or another comic books just go to movie theater pay for ticket and enjoy for pleasure which will be in your memory rest of your life.Also box office of this movie was really unexpected but i was deserved.Ryan Raynold did a great job as dead pool and he had to because he was trying to film dead pool about ten years and we have to evaluation him and pay Little amount of money for big excitement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, Im not usually into super hero movies or movies like these but this one was by far the funniest movie ever The actors were amazing! I have this girl crush on Negasonic Teenage Warhead. By far she was super awesome ever if she didn't speak too much on it. The whole catchphrases and jokes had me laughing and the action and fighting scenes were pretty bad ass as well. Im looking forwards to what they will be doing next and i even hope to audition for this sequel that the have planned. I had to give it a 10 out 10 for all above awesomeness. Ryan Reynolds seriously killed it, I'm glad he managed to get this project out there. An amazing job well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good, But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very well done. It portrayed Deadpool in a way a lot of us fans were hoping for. The movie was very entertaining, but I believe too much was shown on the trailers. For instance, about 75% of T.J. Miller's lines in the movie, as funny as they were, I had already seen them. What people are saying of "Ryan Reynolds being born for the role" is absolutely true. This will go down as his best performance.What was upsetting was seeing all of the children that were in the theaters. Parents, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR KIDS! But overall, this was an entertaining movie and worth seeing IF you're mature and not squeamish :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game Changer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We sure enjoyed the superhero movies in the last years, didn't we. A look at the box office gives sufficient evidence for this thesis. However, as much as I and everybody else loved these movies there's always been something missing. By "something" I mean violence, sex and a psychopath who tends to break the 4th wall. Yes, we had Frank Miller adaptations namely 300, and Sin City but these trends never seemed to set foot in mainstream superhero movies. Batman, Superman, even Iron Man all of them had some kind of asexuality to them. Furthermore the lack of blood somewhat made it hard to believe the action. I witnessed scenes, in which whole buildings collapsed and cities have been destroyed, yet you couldn't see one civilian get harmed, what BS. I am certain, that, if there would have been buildings collapsing in Deadpool with some random civilians in it and debris flying around, the writers wouldn't have been afraid to break with the cliché of people not getting harmed in this kind of situation.Where does this conclusion come from, you want to know? It's because the writers weren't afraid to break or ridicule any other superhero cliché either! This is what made Deadpool such fun, along with the over-the-top violence, nudity, and the hilarious comments of course. On a side note: being immortal Deadpool's persona also had more credibility to himself, than let's say Captain America, if you let both fight against 20 guys with MPs, Captain America would have to dodge every single shot, abilities, which he does not possess and which make you wonder how bad the aim of the bad guys has to be, that he can survive such stuff. Whereas you actually can see Deadpool getting hit, but you know, it doesn't matter anyway because he just regenerates, he cut of his own hand, and he was glad about it. Why? Because in the aftermath he considered it would be nice for the purpose of masturbation (and yes that's the reason for the spoiler warning in this review). Anyhow, this universe really does make sense. Also on the plus side: Vanessa, Wade's girlfriend is played by the wonderful Morena Baccarin, who has been reduced to the role of the girl with the crazy eyes in How I Met Your Mother to his point, hopefully this is a game changer for her as well.This sure isn't a movie for sophisticated movie goers, also, if you don't have any clue about nowadays pop-culture, if you aren't entrusted with Marvel movies in general and if you aren't a fan of obscenity (like there was a scene (another Spoiler) of Wade getting a strap on up his butt), don't watch it. Also don't watch it if you aren't 18 yet.Unfortunately the movie had some downsides to it as well, the plot wasn't that great, the enemy was kind of lame, most of the characters somewhat felt flat (Looking at you cab driver, Wade's friend, the enemy sidekick, Megasonic-something and all of the bad guys) also people all around Deadpool were somewhat too cool with the things happening to them, and not everyone of Deadpool's comments was as funny as it was meant to be, then again, being annoying kind of is part of his character as well.In conclusion I sure hope other studios took notes, whilst watching this movie and may the second installment be at least as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most fun if not the best superhero movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Maybe some spoilers*I wasn't the biggest fan of the comic books but I knew the character well enough to be excited for this movie. Deadpool is everything I want from a FUN movie. This is the best comedy in years for me. This is the kind of comedy I'm looking for, the kind of comedy I have the most fun from. Everything from the 4th wall breaking, the sex jokes, all pop culture reference are spot on. Just the fact that days after I saw the movie I still laugh whenever any scene comes to mind is enough. The best thing about the character is that he never stops, every 2-3 minutes you have a great punch line, a pop reference, usually from a movie (and some movie spoilers :P ). He's relentless, his mouth is as dangerous as his sword skills. What makes the movie even more special though is the few times we have some dramatic scenes, even some romantic scenes, the movie works 100%. The worst thing about funny movies is that usually the drama never works. That's not the case here. The romance works perfectly, the two stars have a great chemistry and you can't take your eyes from them every time they are together on screen. The torture scenes are scary and very effective. That makes the whole thing works on so many levels. For last I kept a crazy speculation. I know that this is not the case in the movie, and it's very far from what the comic book is all about, but bare with me just for the fun of it.What if Wade Wilson is still with Francis been tortured again and again and everything from the moment he becomes Deadpool are just in his mind? I know it's crazy and it's got nothing to do with the character's lore. But I think it's a legit idea. I mean the whole 4th breaking the self referential thing starts from the moment he becomes Deadpool. He can be back at that lab, maybe he's losing his mind or he's in a coma or something. Anyway it's just some crazy idea I had and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good comedy with some crap drama sprinkled in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm only writing this review so the annoying notification telling me I should write one will go away. See, I can break the 4th wall as well.Anyways, imagine all the superhero movies you've seen up till this point, with a twist. The twist being that the main character knows that he's in a superhero movie, or in the case of the comics, knows that he's in a comic. The movie plays out like a comedy, with a super(anti)hero, where the executives or something forced them to put in this sappy drama subplot that basically just detracts from the insanity that is Deadpool. If you're going in expecting a comedy, I assume you will be satisfied by the jokes on display, if you're in it for more, though luck, this ain't the superhero movie for you. They kind of mangled the origin story for Deadpool, but this is the movie universe I guess and putting ink on a paper isn't as expensive as everything that comes with movie-making, thus here we are.A decent comedy with not so decent drama, half the punch of the original origins story blown out it's asshole, heading for a bright future in the comic book superhero movie adaptation business. Cause a complete anal evacuation is still a notch above the regular Marvel treadmill.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Constantly hilarious and action-packed, Deadpool is the perfect superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Deadpool With high expectations, i've been a fan of the character since the video game where i first knew about the character, the Comics were pretty good too but i haven't read a lot of it, and when i heard they announced a Deadpool Movie, i just screamed in joy, i saw the Movie a week after it's release and here is my thoughts.The story is predictable but not bad. A former Special Forces operative now mercenary named Wade Wilson likes doing crime and being a villain, but one day in a bar, he meets Vanessa and they instantly fall in love, until one day, Wade collapses to the floor and the next day, he finds out that he is diagnosed With thermal cancer and that he will have a few days of survival, but a recruiter at the bar he goes to says he can give him Powers and Cure the cancer. Wade agrees and is sent to a facility where People get their Powers, the leader of the facility Ajax (villain) tortures Wade and straps him up to a machine, the machine while giving him Powers, made his face disfigured and burnt, his New Powers are regenerating Health and invincibility, now Wade must seek revenge on Ajax for both making his face disfigured and for stealing his girlfriend, so Wade becomes Deadpool With the help of Weasel and Al, old lady, and he Slices his way through the city of Vancouver to get to Ajax and fulfill his revenge With help by Colossus and Negasonic teenage warhead.Ryan Reynolds in this Movie is absolutely stunning, he is the Perfect Choice for Deadpool and his wit and sophistication is wonderful. The characters are pretty good too, while Ajax is a bland villain, i really liked Weasel and especially Al, they're both funny supporting characters and they will never be forgettable. Even Dopinder is a great character, i would have liked if he had a bigger role, but he is still a great character.The film's main selling point is the humor and is also one of the film's strengths, the humor is near Perfect With a lot of in-jokes, fourth wall humor from Deadpool, pop culture References, Visual humor and vulgar humor, all of them work, even the jokes that suck are pretty good, because they are supposed to be bad on purpose, which makes the humor even better.The Source material is top notch, everything from the fourth wall humor and the characters is very like the Comics, this is one of those Comic book films, where it follows the Comic book perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, some of the best i've seen in years, they're fast and very gory and profane, the scene where Deadpool shoots Three guys With one bullet is some of the best piece of action ever put into film, it's absolutely marvelous.The film isn't by any means Perfect, the story like i said earlier is predictable and the origin story feels kinda rushed compared to the Comics, and the villain is bland and forgettable, and sometimes the jokes can wear off, but other than that, the film is amazing.The climax and post credits scene is amazing, the climax is funny and exciting and leaves you wondering and the post credits scene is especially awesome, since they're Deadpool tells the audience that there is gonna be a Deadpool sequel featuring Cable and making jokes about actors and films along the way, so excited for the sequel.Deadpool is one of the funniest and exciting films i've seen in years, it's ambition, humor, characters, Source material, action sequences and did i forget to mention, the soundtrack With Music by DMX and Salt n Pepa is pretty good, the story as well as it's origin story is predictable and the villain is bland and some jokes are a little clunky, but this film is Worth recommending, guaranteed.10/10 Btw, the film is very damn vulgar AF</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stopped me Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is an extremely violent film; picture an adult version of Tom and Jerry, if you will; only the characters are not a cat and a mouse. The film also dishes out a steady stream of obscene one-liners, many of which are over the top because it alludes to previous films of the director. But both these should not deter you from enjoying a well-constructed spoof of the superhero genre of films; unless you are queasy about intestine churning violence and/or prudish about offensive obscenities. The film makes its irreverent intention clear right in the beginning with a hilarious credit sequence that almost begs you not to take it seriously. Lest you begin to start taking the violence and vulgarity a bit too earnestly, the film breaks the fourth wall putting things in proper perspective for you. Amidst all this style, violence and vulgarity, the film also manages to tell a solid story; and it is nothing less than a love story. Just when our hero finally finds the love of his life, he is struck down with cancer. The torturously exotic cure that he seeks out leaves him horribly disfigured but endowed with superhero powers. Does he get back his girl? Does he get back at his tormentor? I am no fan of Superman, Spiderman, Batman or X-men, but I liked Deadpool. It stopped me dead for 100 odd minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bet 20th Century Fox are kicking themselves that they didn't take Deadpool off the shelf sooner. Big thanks should go to Ryan Reynolds for sticking with it since X-Men Origins: Wolverine. He reprises the role as Wade Wilson (which was considerably underused in Origins) running free in the new Marvel expedition. Profanity follows even cruder profanity, as Wade, or Deadpool, pulls us into a kamikaze of nonchalance and amusement. Rather than follow the same formula as other Marvels, Deadpool starts near the end, backtracking to parts of Wade's life that eventually brings us up to speed. Without the humour, Deadpool would lightly suffer, and blend in with other superhero movies (origin, save the girl, final showdown). Its comedy outweighs its action, but when the action comes round, it flourishes. Deadpool is at its most beautiful and crass when Wade 'breaks the fourth wall', mocking everything these types of films set out to be. The title credits alone let you know what you're in for. And don't forget that end credit scene!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the cinema really hoping that this would be one of the best Marvel films to date. I mean, it's Deadpool! You can't really get a better super/antihero than that. And when I got outside, I felt kinda disappointed but at the same time I wasn't disappointed. Deadpool is stuck somewhere between "Oh I loved that!" and "That really sucked!". What you get with this movie is (in my opinion) a generic Ryan Reynolds performance. It felt like they had taken his character from Blade Trinity and placed him in a Deadpool film. Don't get me wrong. This is one of the better superhero movies I have seen and in some places it is very clever. The best example of that would be the intro scene. It is the funniest intro sequence I have seen in a film to date. The biggest problem I have with Deadpool or any movie in fact, is the hype. You always take a risk if you jump on-board the hype train. In the end Deadpool was exactly what it should be. A decent film and when you get a movie that is (to me) just a, you get let down. Because today you expect a mind blowing movie with the funniest jokes and the best action sequences and that makes it hard to appreciate a movie that is just a movie. All in all I would recommend Deadpool to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Marvel movie so far. A comic book movie made for everyone, not just comic book fans. I wish more were like this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This is a different kind of superhero story." Wade Wilson is a former Special Forces member who now works as a mercenary. He has the perfect girlfriend and everything is going his way. When he discovers he has cancer everything changes. When Wade is approached by a stranger with a way to cure him he takes the chance. It doesn't go as planned and now Wade has only one thing on his mind, revenge. If you have read any of my reviews before you will remember one thing, I am pretty much over the whole superhero movie trend. I am a huge Ryan Reynolds fan and this looked funny so I was looking forward to watching this one. This, to me, is hands down the best Marvel movie they have ever done. The movie is hilarious, very adult, and self aware, which I love. There are a ton of little inside jokes and the movie starts with maybe the best opening credits ever and ends with one of the best post credits scenes I have seen. Superhero movie fans will love this. Non-superhero fans (like me) will love this. This is just a fun movie that never really lets up. I just cannot recommend this enough. I loved it and my stomach hurt by the end of it. Overall, the best Marvel movie so far. A comic book movie made for everyone, not just comic book fans. I wish more were like this. I loved this movie. I give this an A+.</fullReview>

Ryan Reynolds owns the role of Deadpool.The (dark) humor feels unaltered compared to the comics. I almost choked a couple of times. It's raw, violent, sexy, sadistic, cruel, gore, ... all of this.The image, effects and presentation are very nice.

		<shortDescription>Ryan Reynolds is back!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all i@m must say well done to Ryan Reynolds for his comedic performance in this superhero movie. I thought we saw the last of him after his last superhero movie, Green Lantern back in 2011 but he's come back ultra strong with this one, Bravo!!!Now this an R-rated so i would not advice a parent to bring their child to a screening. This film really is adult themed and could traumatize or badly influence you're young one, even though it's a comic book movie. There are some many inside jokes, references and Easter eggs here i have lost count. It pokes fun out of almost every single comic book origin film including Ryan's very own Green Lantern character. You will laugh hard seeing this film. If you don't, you're dead inside. I think this is quite a different type of superhero movie we are used to. Deadpool could really be described as an anti hero.Overall a very enjoyable movie. i can't wait for the sequel. Go see it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was a pleasant surprise in a world where Marvel super hero movies are impossible to avoid. the story was far from original, but the humor and the acknowledgment that is was a movie gave it nice feeling. Predictable as the script was they were able to keep my interest because of the personality they gave the hero. Like James Bond where Sean Connery insisted that the JB movies had a humour element and without that the JB franchise would have lasted two or maybe three movies. This movie does not take itself seriously at all. It is comic book and much better than it first appears. It will get no Oscar nominations (not even for special effects)and the violence is token rather than graphic. DP kills people but there is no blood, I would like to see a Luc Besson version!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone remotely interested in this film already knows what to expect so let me just say, what is promised in the trailer is absolutely delivered with no deception and only adds so much more of the kind of humor, violence and other goodness synonymous with Deadpool. The idea of a solo hero drawn from the X-Men stable getting a standalone movie hasn't been looked forward to greatly or pulled off successfully up until now, if only by virtue of Deadpool's being such a truly unique character. However, they did also take into account that, unlike The Wolverine, omitting other mutants to the point that you don't even need all the fingers on one hand to count them all is a truly horrible idea, and this film did not make that same mistake, so while the primary focus was on Deadpool (and rightfully so), the two other X-Men members got plenty of time to shine, both in terms of exposition and personality, as well as exhibition of their powers. I wasn't expecting to see a scene that could have, in another movie, been something like Hulk vs She-Hulk, but this film delivered that pleasant surprise and I was loving every minute of it.95% of the humor hit, particularly the meta style humor where Deadpool breaks the fourth wall directly or at least acknowledges to the other characters that something beyond their understanding is looking down upon them, and the other 5% is stuff that is just so-so, or was said too quickly for me to completely pick up on. I think that was one of the main flaws, some things were just cut too fast to either see and enjoy completely, or hear with complete clarity. But the vast majority is what we get and I was extremely satisfied.Almost every character was fantastic in their role, and the only real complaint I can think of is in that regard is, I would have preferred to either get more from the Blind Al character (who got very little background or development), or not have had her there at all and maybe save her for the sequel so we could get a fresh start with her and be more fleshed out, perhaps with a situation closer to the comics. But TJ Miller, Morena Baccarin, and Gina Carano, none of whom I'd seen in anything-or at least nothing that major-before, all did very well in what roles were written for them, and while it seemed utterly ludicrous for Colossus to spend 100% of his screen time being animated, I felt like this was his best portrayal yet in an X-Men universe movie, and newcomer Negasonic Teenage Warhead was a fantastic new addition and I would be disappointed if she did not make a return appearance at least somewhere, if not the sequel.The only other nitpick I could really say is that Deadpool's obsession with fixing his deformed skin was very bothersome. That he could think something like that (which actually varied from time to time) would break a relationship was laughable, and the very idea that him also having a healing factor that could then somehow not also fix his skin problems, just felt too inconsistent. Wolverine looked a lot like that after being burnt up by the explosion of an A-bomb, and went back to looking like he always did. If there was a significant reason why, it was not satisfactorily explained.In summation, if you were expecting this to be the deservedly R-rated slice of fried gold Deadpool deserved to have his name slapped across, you will not be disappointed. This should wash the bad taste out of your mouth from both Deadpool's previous portrayal and, with luck, the recent Fant4stic debacle. I saw it in IMAX, not 3D, but I'd say based on my viewing, 3D would totally be worth it too.</fullReview>

Ryan Reynolds' comedic timing is that of an atomic clock. Spot-on. But sure enough, the humor doesn't get in the way of the sequences.As a comic book fan, I appreciated the fact that this doesn't deviate from the heart of the glossy pages.I only had a few gripes:Now, I am perfectly fine with any amount of cursing, nudity, vulgarity, etc. I don't give a rat's ass. However, it shouldn't get in the way of the story, dialogue, or jokes or whatever.That said, the word, "f#@k," is used to great effect in the movie, but, at times, it was used in a way that made the dialogue a little bit clunky. While almost all of the jokes landed, some of them relied on the word as a crutch and they didn't work. But again, most of the jokes landed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the Best Superhero Movies I Have Ever Seen. Now Deadpool is one of my favorite superheroes ever. His costume is cool, this movie is hilarious, cool, etc. (***SPOILER ALERT***) My favorite part is the big fight at the end where that bad guy get's shot in the head by Deadpool. And Deadpool was killing everybody, the big metal war machine was throwing stuff at the bad guy's girlfriend, the teenage girl was blasting through everything and making explosions, etc. And I think the scenes where the characters swear are hilarious, because they act like little kids, and I think that's funny. And Deadpool shot the bad guy in the head but I think that it should be more violent. Deadpool's now one of my favorite superheroes ever because his costume is really cool, he is invincible, he is hilarious, he is like me, etc. And I wonder what Deadpool 2 is gonna be like, maybe he has more superpowers, maybe he meets other superheroes, or I don't even know if they are gonna make a sequel. And the acting was really good and really funny. The actor of the bad guy was acting like a real life villain. The acting for Deadpool, that metal guy, the teenage girl, was hilarious! So I think this is the best movie of the year so far. There is also a lot of movies i'm excited for that are coming up. And I think that this movie is okay for kids over 13 if they are mature enough and understand, but if they wont understand I think it should be for 16+. So that was my review for Deadpool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's sort of a running joke that Marvel's blockbuster squad is giving its Midas-touch reach-around to progressively fringier characters in the comic book "universe," a trend I blame on Iron Man and one that shows no sign of letting up. (I heard they're doing Aquaman in 2018.) To this slow trudge of gold-plated also-rans we now add Deadpool, no one's favorite secondary superhero who?thanks, handsy Midas!? actually deals a solid R-rated base hit in this strong, strong film.As any helicopter parent will tell you, excellence starts early. And the opening credits are brilliant. Not the CGI, which is cool and all, but the actual credits. So rare to see something really novel done here. I've never laughed so hard at names before?and that includes the social security list of unusual baby names. I loved this opening nearly as much as I did 21 Jump Street's end credits. (But them's tall boots.) Also, if you were in LA on opening weekend, there were some truly inspired spoof billboards around town. Hausey likey.Ryan Reynolds is in his element here as Wade Wilson, an ex-special forces type who falls in love, gets sick, and turns invincible. This isn't the gentle rom-com Reynolds?no, this is the real, improv-bred, Van Wilder Canucklehead Reynolds. He's crass and harsh, breaks the fourth wall on the motherflippin' regular, and slings insults like Donald Trump in a Tough Mudder. He's great. His white-hot love affair with his manic pixie dream girlfriend is a bit much, but gives him dramatic purpose and all. Also, he forgets stuff in cabs, leading to a cute (if lonesome) side storyline.And not to toot my amateur-reviewer horn here, but I did once learn screen writing from the late Syd Field himself at AFI?and armed as I am with this prestigious toe-dip into The Real Thing, I feel qualified to opine that this film is structurally very interesting. That's as far down film school lane as I'll take you, but check this out: Syd's BMW 3-series had the vanity plate "PLT PNT." Take that for lagniappe.It's a shame then that given such an engaging and in-your-face antihero lead, Marvel poops it down the bad pipe with a closed, self- referential story that distills down to Deadpool exacting bloodthirsty revenge on the dude who helped him. There's no real villain to speak of, no heroics, and nothing really for Deadpool to do besides take out his own dirty laundry?which causes one to wonder what he'll do once that strange score is settled. (I'm sure Midas will figure something out.)But as much as I generally despise closed-system superhero films (ahem, Green Lantern), here the basic narcissism of the storyline works fairly well. After all, Deadpool is unapologetically all about himself and his own problems, and the only folks with a ticket to the twitching bone heap are those who've wronged him in past. Fair enough, Mr. Pool.What I won't do here is trot out once more my standing objection to Marvel's "mutant" science. It's beyond ridiculous, and nothing's changed. But couldn't they at least have done something with the fact that cancerous cells are themselves mutated, so mutating him more would likely cause more cancer?? No. Sigh.Haus Verdict: Ultraviolent. Funny, and in on the joke. Meta and it works so well you won't mind the second-string X-Men and empty plot. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually cool and intentionally funny, like the first "Spider-Man" (2002)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy cool and witty masked heroes/antiheroes; as the summary line suggests, it's why I've liked Spider-Man since childhood ? of course they had to increasingly fudge it up with the franchise's sequels. Clowns like Batman or the X-Dorks don't do it for me: they either take the stuff too seriously or just make them for serious nerds ["The Dark Knight" (2008) was neat, though, because non-campy and with Ledger's Joker]. Anyway, Deadpool; I was vaguely aware of the comics and got intrigued by the recent promos, also due to Reynolds' good showing in "Self/less" (2015). Costume and character are great, so the premise of a mutant goof thrown against the usual fantasy action mash-up works just fine. While the comedy is sometimes forced or just silly, it is mostly funny and entertaining throughout, despite the mandatory X-Whocares (how could a metal hulk be choked?) and T.J. Miller, who shouldn't appear or be heard in anything. If they shoot a "Deadpool 2" I hope they make it even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw Deadpool and i didn't expect it to be so good it was funny as hell and bloody as hell although you won't see a lot of blood in almost every scene you will hear a lot of bad mouth lines. I loved the cast and everyone did an amazing job and i hate to say this but Colossus was the biggest surprise of the movie i loved his accent and even tho he was cgi he was amazing portrayed and he had moments to shine also the opening and end credits were epic and i loved the references to X-Men Origins Wolverine (especially the figure cameo) and Alien 3 and Godfather and a bunch of other films good and bad. If this isn't the best Marvel movie of all time it's definitely on my top 10 list. Ryan Reynolds steals the show and he is so freaking funny even tho i wasn't a big Deadpool fan i kinda feel that i am right now and i know that people will hate me for saying this but i loved both versions of the character the old one and the new one although this one is the superior version my favorite scenes is definitely the ones where he fought Francis Twice and the whole highway scene also this movie had the best use of cgi i've ever seen better than most recent Marvel movies and DC movies. Deadpool is definitely a great movie that you need to see sure it's not for everyone but R-Rated films were never so freaking cool this movie deserves praise instead of the 2015 Mad Max: Fury Road and if it can win an Oscar i would definitely be happy for the effects at least. Can't wait for Deadpool 2 also that Stan Lee cameo was priceless. My final rating is a 10 out of 10 loved it!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this film, it made me feel so much for the character of Deadpool. But also how he stays true to his character. It broke me when I see him in the streets after Wade got into the project and then survive. It made me feel for him because I care about him and even for his love. Also the other characters in the film bound off perfectly from each other and Deadpool cracks up jokes and it hits real hard. Like the action figure that Wade picks up in the film is himself from the XMen origins: Woverine. Is himself and made me chucked to put that little easter egg in there to make fun of that film. Also the actions scenes are well made and very smart. And made me believe that Deadpool is the most overpowering character in the Marvel series. Always, I had fun time watching this film. I was on the edge of my seat watching this film because I did not know what is going to happen because it is Deadpool is Deadpool. And I liked how this film fix everything and put it in the Marvel cinematic universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was full of great, yet most of the time, vulgar and crude humor. Ryan Reynolds was the perfect guy to play the role as Deadpool, along with the guy that plays the role of Francis, the crazy bad guy. Due to the nudity, bloodshed,and the constant over age 21 puns throughout this movie, please do not take your kids to see this at all. It shows every kill in slow motion, along with making sure to show you every detail of the torture and murder played out. But besides all the gore and breaking/dismembering of body parts, it was a great movie that will have you laughing from beginning to the very dead end. It also has a great love story in between all the humor and violence. This is a must see Marvel movie, even if Deadpool is not your usual SpiderMAN or X-MAN!!! Hoping for a few more sequels to this movie. A++++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wade Wilson is a former special forces operative who works as a mercenary in New York City. He meets escort Vanessa Carlysle at a local bar and they become romantically attached. One year later, Wade proposes to her and she accepts, but he suddenly collapses. Wade is diagnosed with terminal cancer and though Vanessa remains by his side, he fears losing her.A recruiter from a secret program approaches Wade offering an experimental cure for his cancer. Although Wade initially refuses, he decides to leave Vanessa and undergo the procedure. At a laboratory, Wade meets Ajax and Angel Dust, whom he instantly resents. Ajax injects Wade with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes, then have him subjected to weeks of torture to induce stress and trigger the mutation without success. Wade discovers Ajax's real name, Francis Freeman, and mocks him. In response, Ajax straps Wade into an airtight chamber which raises and lowers the oxygen level to keep Wade constantly on the verge of asphyxiation. Ajax reveals to Wade their true purpose: to make super-powered slaves to be sold to wealthy customers. Several days later, Wade develops a healing factor which cures his cancer, but severely disfigures his face and skin. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wade, impales him with a rebar and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory.Wade attempts to return to Vanessa, but is afraid of her rejecting him because of his appearance, and keeps himself away from her. After consulting his best friend Weasel, Wade decides to hunt down Ajax and have his disfigurement cured. He becomes a masked vigilante, takes the alias "Deadpool", and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al. Following a string of leads, Deadpool tracks down Ajax to a convoy of cars on an expressway. He kills all the escorts, corners Ajax and demands a cure to his disfigurement. The confrontation is interrupted by two X-Men, Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who have been trying to recruit Deadpool. Taking advantage of the distraction, Ajax escapes. Colossus handcuffs himself to Deadpool and begins dragging him away. Deadpool cuts off his own hand and escapes. His hand regenerates overnight.Ajax goes to Weasel's bar and learns of Vanessa. Weasel calls Wade and tells him Vanessa is in danger. Wade goes to the strip club she works at but, unable to face her, psyches himself up in the bathroom first. However, when he comes out, she is already kidnapped. Ajax and Angel Dust tell Deadpool to meet up with them on a decommissioned helicarrier in a scrapyard.Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him, and the trio take a cab to the scrapyard. While Colossus and Negasonic battle Angel Dust, Deadpool fights his way through Ajax's henchmen, and eventually engages him in close combat. After Angel Dust knocks out Colossus, Negasonic uses her power to repel her, but accidentally destroys the equipment holding the helicarrier upright. As the helicarrier tips over, Colossus wakes up and takes Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety, while Deadpool successfully saves Vanessa. Ajax, still alive, attacks Deadpool, but is subdued and reveals there is no cure for Wade's disfigurement.Colossus begins urging Deadpool to be a true hero and spare his enemy, but Deadpool kills Ajax. Wade turns to Vanessa, who removes his mask revealing his face. Vanessa is angered that Wade left her, but still loves him. She accepts him, and they reconcile by kissing.This movie was just simply awesome !!!!.Go watch it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool has a simple plot. Revenge. It also has a ton of comedy, vulgarity, and violence. Simply put, it was fun to watch. Ryan Reynolds was obviously very comfortable in this role and he nailed it. Great supporting cast as well.I enjoyed how the movie opened up with a Deadpool scene and used flashbacks to give his origin story. My only complaint with the origin story is the whole we are going to save you from cancer by torturing you and turning you into a mutant thing, which still confuses me.I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 because of the humor, the great cast, and the excellent action scenes. Glad I watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent comedy and action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool was entertaining from start to finish. It immediately establishes its tone - immature comedy mixed with over-the-top violence. It "breaks all the rules" successfully. The opening reminded me of Monty Python and the Holy Grail - they can't even take the credits seriously. The humour reminded me of the first few (best IMO) seasons of South Park - happy to offend anyone and everyone but with the focus still being pure comedy. I don't usually like dick and fart jokes much but Deadpool makes them hilarious. It's the juxtaposition of such immaturity with a well-made action movie that makes it work. And it has a story and dramatic moments as good as any recent superhero movie as well.I'm not familiar with Deadpool but it sounds like he's a very popular comic book character. The film-makers (and perhaps Ryan Reynolds in particular) have tried their best to do the character justice. He is irreverent, wise-cracking and likable even if he isn't exactly noble. He says and does what we're too afraid to say and do. He only fights bad guys. And he lives for the woman in his life. Where other superheroes are hypocritical and maintain a facade of moral superiority, at least Deadpool can admit what he is and make fun of everyone including himself while trying to fight evil and help the innocent.I liked the many times the fourth wall was broken. The film-makers know their audience and what kind of movie they're making and it shows. They use the device effectively where appropriate and without it becoming routine. It makes the movie more fun and the darkness easier to swallow. There are so many lines from the movie that I loved, both in concept and delivery. Comedically, it was very satisfying. I don't remember any missed jokes; every chance for irony or sarcasm was taken advantage of.The action was engaging and cool even if similar things have been done before. Every sequence is creative and infused with Deadpool's humour. In one part, he has only 12 bullets and counts them as he uses them. He wastes some and chastises himself but then makes up for it by killing 3 henchmen in a line with one bullet. It's a good sign if you can't tell whether you're enjoying the action or comedy more. I liked the fight choreography and even though some CGI must have been used, there seemed to be a lot of impressive stunt work. Seeing bodies flip and impact solid objects is just inherently exciting.This movie was a great introduction to Deadpool. His origin story was well done. It's pretty dark but it's nice to see something so odd and unique being presented sincerely. Comic books deserve proper film adaptations. The film makes good use of non-linear storytelling near the start. It's never confusing and the order of events is logical in balancing action and getting to know how Wade Wilson became Deadpool.You could say every person is flawed with good and bad qualities. But some people make you feel good, they make you laugh. And some people are self-deprecating and accept their mistakes and are open about their short-comings. Deadpool is like one of those people whose company you always enjoy.</fullReview>

Lots of one liners some too quick to process or catch.This movie suits Ryan Reynolds because he is a better at comedy than more serious roles. Morena Baccarin is very beautiful in this movie and deserves to be on the big screen more not just television shows that not that many people watch. Gina Carano is suited to her role but she has become a very stocky.Prefer this to Guardians of the Galaxy. Worth one watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is an excellent mash-up of action, romance, and comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a very, very funny movie. It takes the overexposed superhero genre, mixes it with comedy and romance to create an entertaining and very funny film for adults. It's hilarious from the start with the tongue-and-cheek introductory montage scene. You get "a British villain", "a CGI character", produced by some "asshat production." Talk about being self-aware! I mean this movie knows exactly what it is, and it delivers on that! While the first 20- 30 minutes is very action heavy and has some awesome action pieces, it's ultimately a love story between Wade Wilson aka Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) and his girl. Before this movie came out, I was very confused as to why a superhero movie was coming out so early in the year given that usually not so good movies come out during this period? In seeing Deadpool, it makes perfect sense! Because ultimately the movie's plot revolves around: boy meets girl, boy falls in love, loses girl, and then tries to win back the girl. Oh did I mention evil research scientist, mutants, and X-Men characters including Colossal, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, and mention of Wolverine? (There are so many throughout the movie that you begin to wonder if there is something going on between Deadpool and Wolverine besides plain rivalry).Things I didn't particularly like:1. My biggest gripe with the movie is with the girlfriend's character. Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Initially when Wilson meets her, she is portrayed as a strong female character, but are we really supposed to believe that she just accepts her boyfriend back after he leaves are suddenly without saying anything, and disappears for 2 years (?) during which time she assumes him to be dead?!! Really??? I just can't help but feel her character was objectified in the movie. Apart from being the perfect girlfriend material, and being "the thing" that drives Deadpool's motivations and actions, she doesn't have much else to do here. Her character was disappointingly one-dimensional. It's a shame because Morena Baccarin is so good here. But apart from having a lot of skin show, we don't get to see other sides to her character.2. I didn't really care for the blind landlord lady. I don't think their scenes were particularly funny given the level of comedy in the rest of the film. I found their relationship just way to awkward for my taste.3. I didn't like the way the only Indian character in this movie was portrayed. Why must an Indian be portrayed as either a science/tech person or a taxicab driver? Why? Yes, Dopinder (Karan Soni) and Deadpool's scenes in the taxicab were all very funny, but can't we move away from over generalization and perpetuating the same stereotypes of ethnicity? Couldn't the writers come up with something a little more inventive?See full review on: http://www.artspeaksy.com/deadpool-movie-review/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of DP since the first time I saw him in a DD comic. This is perfect and hilarious and completely and utterly Deadpool. I think it hit new highs for me as a Marvel fan.However, this is NOT for kids, omg, I cannot stress this enough. If you think the Marvel logo makes it kid friendly, you'll be surely surprised. I saw two families with kids and whoops did they leave fast. I loved the soundtrack, very random but fits the tone of the movie, and this movie is amazingly centered but full of tangents and flashbacks and full of fourth wall breaking amazing goodness and I have to say it's my favorite Marvel movie right now.If you love violence and romance and gore and toilet humor and witty banter, you will love this movie. If you love romantic films about the consequences of love and the bitter truth of surviving cancer, but hate grotesque violence and bad language, you will hate this movie. But Deadpool deserves all the praise. It's quick and a few jokes take a second listening, but so good, can't wait for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this film, while excited I was also honestly a little hesitant. Largely because of the marketing giving the impression that the "Deadpool" movie was to right the wrongs that "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" had done to the character. Any time I hear a film attempting to "correct the wrongs" of a predecessor we receive movies like "Exorcist II: The Heretic" or "Batman &amp; Robin". What I'm saying is that it usually doesn't work out very well. I was worried that the fourth wall humor would get stale or annoying. Or maybe the story would be too standard to be entertaining. The moment the opening credits hit the screen, all my doubts were put to rest.After thinking hard about it now, I can confidently say that I love the hell out of this movie. So much so that it possibly rivals what has been my favorite Marvel movie for the last couple years, "Guardians of the Galaxy". The comedy is gold, from the hilarious opening credit sequence to the ending credit sequence I was pretty consistently laughing. The action is pretty fun and creative and gorges itself in the hard "R" rating. The references and cameos were fantastic. The fourth wall breaking actually worked extremely well and was one of the highlights of the whole movie. Ryan Reynolds loves every second he is playing this character; you can just tell that he is giving this role all of his energy and love. Last year he was in a movie called "The Voices", also a very good movie but is not the same as this; much darker but still very funny as well as intense. After I saw that movie I was saying how I hope that Reynolds will finally get his comeback movie and not keep getting handed bomb after bomb, it took a year but I believe that it finally happened. He's in a great movie that is actually going over very well with the audience it seems. I'm not really going to delve too deep into the story, not because I think it's going to be chalk full of surprises for anyone who sees it. I think that most can probably guess what's going to happen because it's a simple story. That isn't an insult to the film at all, actually it's a compliment. It's nice seeing a Marvel movie breaking down to a basic revenge film instead of having to save the world in some grand and epic way. While I'm not saying that it's necessarily a bad thing when an "X-Men" or "Avengers" film does that, I'm only saying that it's nice to see one of the comic movies break away from that formula is all.The film is about Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) who meets a girl (Morena Baccarin), falls in love and after a while he finds out he has cancer. Attempting to spare his fiancé any problems, he runs off without a word and joins this secret experiment that is promised to rid him of the cancer and even give him additional abilities. Things don't quite go as planned, causing Wade to take on the title "Deadpool" after being hideously deformed by the mad scientists involved, so he may exact his revenge and save his fiancé. Basic origin story, doesn't need a "world destruction and must stop it from happening" plot line. There's no "fish out of water" thing going on. There is one smart ass of a character that just wants revenge and to be with his fiancé again while not looking like hamburger meat. Everything in this movie works. The relationship between Wade and his fiancé was a lot of fun and I actually felt invested in them. Even the villain, who was played by the man that took on the last "Transporter" installment for its lead, Ed Skrein. I thought he was terrible and extremely bland in that movie, but in this he actually was some fun to watch and posed an actual threat to the hero without be too "stock". For some reason these characters easily grew on me and it didn't take me out or detach any emotional investment whenever the fourth wall was broken. Which can be a very hard and tricky thing to do, but this film does it flawlessly in my eyes.I thought that this was a blast and I would love if I could see it again. I say bring the whole family! But that's because I grew up on "RoboCop" and "Friday the 13th" as a kid, although there wasn't a pegging scene in any of those movies...well anyways, if you like hard "R" action, Ryan Reynolds and "Wham!" on the soundtrack then you'll probably get a kick out of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Deadpool because it is my kind of humor and the great thing about Deadpool is that he kind of breaks the 4th wall and that is just amazing i think. Deadpool is about a guy (Wade Wilson) who have found love and suddenly out of nowhere gets cancer and he doesn't know what to do. Some guy says he can help and cure him and leaves a card with a phone number on. Wade then calls the number and ends up on an operation table in a underground lab. They make him into someone special. They say he can not leave and that he have to work for them. Wade escapes and sets out on a journey to hunt them down to make sure his loved ones is safe. Ryan Reynolds is the PERFECT actor for Deadpool i don think there is any other actor that could have pulled it off. Ryan is Deadpool. Deadpool is Ryan. Morena Baccarin is a beautiful actor and a great actor for the part. I don't think there is any of the actors in this movie that did not do a great job on their role. The shooting and directing was great! when i look at the cinematography in movies and series i compare them to The Blacklist because The Blacklist i think does it all perfect and Deadpool was close i think to the same level. The lighting was good as well and I don't think there was any scenes in the movie that didn't have good lighting.The music was awesome! every song was so fitting to the scenes.I am rating this 9/10 because it was everything i looked for in a movie about Deadpool I am not giving it 10/10 because there are very few movies worth giving 10/10 and i don't want to give it away to everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello, I want to start with the negatives, in order to get them away as fast as possible : a) The movie does not follow the myths of Deadpool - many things that make the character what it is, are overlooked, ignored or did not make it into the movie. b) No Lady Death - forget it. c) Ajax was just not good enough for this. d) Why is he able to break the 4-th wall? And why is he even mad to begin with, there are reasons for that. e) It followed the "1-st movie for the hero" tropes But. But the movie captured the aftermath of what Deadpool is. I was busy laughing around 80% of the movie, I was not able to catch a break and this is a movie I will recommend to 9/10 Deadpool. I hope that where it fell flat (like why Deadpool is actually mad) will be addressed in the next movie of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest movie I've seen in ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Deadpool was announced and the first trailer started to roll, I was hugely hyped since there were no other actor other than Ryan Reynolds that I could think of portraying him. I still remember the filthy mouthed guy that struck me in Blade 3 with his "f**k me sideways" line. And the trailer was so promising that I started to have doubts, if the rest of the movie could be as funny and raw as the trailer. These days you watch so many trailers that are better than the whole movie, so I had my concerns. So, I went to see Deadpool when it premiered and, boy, was I blown away from the first second. This movie brilliantly gets right in the middle of the plot, during the action and flashes back and forth, making the viewing of the movie interesting and does not bore you for a second. I knew that the Merc with the mouth was a filthy, filthy mouthed anti-hero, but the level of profanity and foul language is so high and disgusting that I am amazed that high executives gave the green light for such a blockbuster. I won't go into many details, but the movie is extremely funny and raw, with so many dick jokes as anyone can handle, but at the same time is very sweet and tender. It is actually a love story clothed with explosive action and sick humor. It is very well directed, with the proper pace, it takes the time to let you know about the protagonist, it doesn't take things for granted, nor does it demand that you should have read a million comic books in order to "get it". It provides the back story with a great back and forth movement. It, also, has so many easter eggs that it would probably require another 2-hour movie to analyze everything.So to wrap it up, this is a hilarious movie, with the best casting decision for a superhero, equally awesome as Robert Downey Jr., who nailed Iron Man and became an immortal god. Now, if you are easily offended, hate the foul language and the occasional butt plugging of Reynolds, then you should probably pass. If you want to see a thought provoking movie go and rent Primer. If you have kids and want to go to see the movie, good for you, you're an awesome parent. But be AWARE, in this movie some things cannot be unseen, so if you fall in the above category of easily offended people, you enter at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too good to be true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Movie is amazing! I saw X-men and it completely hated it, when i heard there was going to be a movie i thought i aren't going to see it - but after hearing good things about this movie i went to see it, and it blew me and my mum away: keep in mind she hates movies like this usually. The plot-line is so understandable and easy to figure out which makes it a perfect movie for the jokes to come in: even for dead-pool and other characters within the movie! The only downside to this is that there are two main action scenes at the start and the end but nothing in the middle, its just getting know what happened in the past for him. They did do a massive action scene at the start with background stories but the middle was just a way to get it all out in time for you to know that the end will be coming..... The extra scene after credits is funny: it tell us quit a bit on how much they had to go on this and how well the made it with a small budget. But i think it is confirmed to have a second movie, if it is not; there's going be rage from fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly pulled off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie was announced I was a sceptic as to weather they could pull it off, and I'm glad they did manage to pull it off. The jokes are funny and are made funnier by the delivery. I could not imagine another actor other than Ryan Reynolds playing Deadpool, he was a brilliant choice. The film was completed with his voice and charm as he managed to break the fourth wall excellently, the best use of breaking the fourth wall that I have seen in any other film or play.Yet I felt towards the end of the movie that they lost the charm that was with the movie to begin with and it ended rather abruptly. I understand that it had to come to an end, I just would have preferred a funnier ending. The film over all was beautifully played, I'm just nit-picking over the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly a little too full on, but still a fun and amusing ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Former mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) now ekes out a living as a sort of odd job man for hire when people need the frighteners laid on. Things perk up when he meets Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), the love of his life, and they look set to live the rest of their lives together-until he is hit with late stage cancer in several of his most vital organs. All seems lost, until he is approached by a mysterious agency that says they can cure him, as well as giving him superhuman abilities. It's all just a cruel front, though, so the villainous Ajax (Ed Skrein) can use him to experiment on. Left hideously disfigured, Wade re-invents himself as Deadpool, the ultimate wise-ass, wise-cracking, indestructible tough guy superhero there is.The whole superhero franchise is placed on such a pedestal these days, like the ultimate symbol of high art against which others must compete, so it was begging for something to come along that stripped it of its pomposity, and play out as more of a parody. Deadpool, if it does nothing else right, hits this mark perfectly, from the flashy opening title sequences where insults are replaced by way of crediting the producers and stars of the film, to Reynolds's relentlessly dry, wise-cracking delivery. On this front at least, it works.The reverse story-telling style was something that had taken a little break for a while, but director Tim Miller gives it a second-coming here, a little over-bearing on what is such a short and simplistic tale. The sarcastic humour is what gives it its distinctive charm, but the hand that feeds it becomes its chalice, by at times feeling a little too in your face and full on, even in interludes when a more sombre tone would have fitted.The inclusion of two X-Men characters as comic relief serves to highlight the leap between two CGI creations, and a guy bedecked in a homemade suit, and further highlights how Deadpool stands alone in the crazy Marvel universe. But stand alone he does, and, while at times this feels a little overdone, it's still a funky, funny adaptation of one of Marvel's trickier characters. ***</fullReview>

Supporting cast is good(Ryan's friend).Villain(the lead from the latest transporter movie) doesnot have much to scare off.Actress is a bit of eye-candy. Dialogue writing is good , witty and funny. There are references to other movies characters as well. Direction is good.

		<fullReview>After the Feminist, PC machine of Disney, Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams destroyed Star Wars forever with their crazy left wing ideology and their pandering to all the morons, drug addicts (Millennials) in this Country I cared not to see Deadpool. I wasn't ready to see another movie in the theater just yet. I went reluctantly and was not disappointed in the least. Deadpool delivered! Good characters. Good story. Great cinematography. Really good music and great humor.The fight scenes were awesome. Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin had terrific chemistry. T.J. Miller was actually OK.If Star Wars 7 crushed your soul like it did mine, just go see this movie. "Deadpool will begin to make things right." Even if you liked SW7, go see Deadpool. Hopefully you will understand that SW 7 was hot garbage compared to Deadpool in story telling, character building, script, dialogue, acting, humor, music, etc. I could keep going but I think you get the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, everyone knows of the god awful "film that shall not be named" that sealed the Merc with the Mouth's mouth, right? Well, Deadpool destroys that movie's Deadpool to kingdom come!Deadpool is a crazy, deadly, hilarious, crazy, 4th wall breaking, dirty talking, crazy, mercenary who kicks bad (and sometimes good guys) to get what he wants. And that's exactly what we got!Ryan Reynolds is as much Deadpool as Hugh Jackman is the Wolverine, Robert Downey Junior is Iron Man. Reynolds and the rest of the cast had brilliant and hilarious moments.Not to mention the marketing team did an amazing job purely showing what Deadpool would do if he was in the world. If you have a friend/wife/sister/aunt/grandma (okay maybe not grandma) and they're girls, tell her Ryan Reynolds is in it, women, including me, love this movie. Note: Don't take kids under 12, they'll say "don't worry, it's just a Marvel movie", it's rated MA in Australia and R for the rest of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it's about time.For so many years we've suffered through the moralising of Batman, Superman and any number of X-Men (or women), oh and don't get me started on Spiderman and his "with great power comes great responsibility" waffle. They're all so anxious, obnoxious and tedious.But now we have Deadpool.Here's a superhero I can get behind (not the same way his girlfriend gets behind him?. not that there's anything wrong with that??) he's a dude who fights the bad guys the way they fight. Nasty! How many times have we seen Superman smash a baddie and stop short of killing the guy to hand him over to the authorities just for said villain to escape again? Deadpool doesn't suffer from such niceties as justice or compassion. He shoots first and asks questions later. Much later. Like the next day while the coroner is sifting through the remains.Deadpool is a guy who just gets the job done and doesn't need to moan about it to his butler, in his billion dollar mansion while two supermodels polish his furniture. In fact his alter-ego Wade Wilson lives in a fairly spartan apartment with a blind woman for company and what seems to be a cache of weapons and ammunition big enough to take down ISIS? He's a blue-collar-down-to-earth former soldier with outstanding recuperative skills thanks to a recent brush with a mad scientist. Not "crazy" mad, "angry" mad?? at Wade!Ryan Reynolds was born for this role. He's funny AND annoying which is huge improvement on his Green Lantern effort where he was just annoying. His co-stars are just along for the ride which is wildly violent, extremely crude and so unlike every other superhero film it's an instant classic.Not a kids film or a date film (unless your girlfriend recommends it, in which case go?.. then marry her on the way home).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about 'Deadpool' that hasn't already been said? Quite possibly nothing, but here I go anyway. Let's start off with a clean slate: I was no comic book fan before 'The Avengers', and more specifically, I was no Deadpool fan before this movie. So I'm not one of the viewers going into a movie and expecting a superhero film to live up to the expectations set by my beloved graphic novels. Does that mean I usually end up liking all the wrong superhero movies? Yes, sometimes. But 'Deadpool' is for once, I think, ambiguous. Despite its constant use of pop culture and other superhero references as humor, this is a movie for all action comedy fans to enjoy. The performances are hardly ratable. All I can say is that it was hard to believe that any of the actors were even acting. This felt so real it was ridiculous. Ryan Reynolds has sunk so deep into his character that I haven't even called him Ryan Reynolds since I saw this movie. He is Deadpool to me, now and forever. I am equally pleased with the supporting cast. The hot chick, the British villain, the comic relief? Every single one of them helped to make this feel like this was a movie that actually happened. And that sort of made the fourth-wall breaking that much more accurate and humorous. The plot itself is rather predictable, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. For instance, I knew immediately as Colossus went off on his superhero speech that Deadpool would interrupt by shooting Ajax in the face. I also knew that Vanessa would see Wade's messed up face and still love him for it anyway. Basically, if you've seen any to all of the trailers, you know how this movie will begin, middle, and end. But trust me, that's okay. Even though it sucks when trailers spoil everything, the entire ad campaign for this movie deserves an extra star in and of itself. This film is exhaustingly enjoyable and after only one viewing I can tell that none of this will ever get old. 'Deadpool' doesn't even make me laugh out loud at every joke, but it doesn't matter. This is a wildly entertaining movie all the way around, and it deserves eight stars. Seven for the movie (I did, at first, give this movie a 10/10. But let's be honest, that was just the hype getting to me. My biggest complaint about the movie is that it had a plot. I wish this could have just been Deadpool going about and interacting with people. The taxicab conversations are some of the best moments. So in actuality, this didn't do everything that I wanted, hence the slight demoting), and another for the great job done in advertising the movie's release. Overall a great job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid change from standard superhero films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an age of never ending superhero films it's nice to come across a film like Deadpool. Deadpool tells the story of a mercenary named Wade Wilson who becomes a test subject for a shady organization after discovering he has cancer. After surviving he becomes a mercenary bent on revenge calling himself Deadpool. The plot of the movie is very formulaic and true to form. The real delivery of Deadpool instead comes from it's sense of humor. Deadpool is self referential, crude, but also a lot of fun. It's a balance between pure gritty antihero movies like "The Punisher" and typical superhero fanfare of "The Avengers." However, with such a barrage of never ending jokes some are guaranteed to be funnier than others. One of my gripes with the film comes from the main character himself. Although Wade Wilson is understandable in motive and generally funny some of the emotional moments of the film landed flat for me since he's unlikable. It's an entertaining film and worth watching at least once though.</fullReview>

A lot of things seemed forced. The effects were lame, like there wasn't enough money to do it right.Involvement of second-class X-men, for me, was unnecessary if they couldn't bring the real deal. Regarding the profanities, it wasn't bad.Acting of Ryan Reynolds was on the spot, he was the right man for the job, but other things failed enough so this movie couldn't deliver as it should have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Merc with a mouth is here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is here! Finally on the big screen. Our favorite antihero bags himself a movie and it has something to do with Polverine ;) Let the fandom erupt! It walks closely on the scales of comics although focuses on his origins more. The Vanessa Carlysle story is chosen to go with him in order to pack in the romance quotient. Writers take it all the way through. Tim Miller chooses to go with an oscillating presentation where he tries to merge up the current and the past later connecting us to the stream midway. Deadpool occasionally breaks the fourth wall for emphasis, and it does manage to pack in his comic quotient.Action seqs are jaw dropping as the protagonist rolls midair, does impressive flips whilst performing enthralling takedowns. Gore speaks volume with the rad Deadpool guns. Heads drop, bodies get spattered, bones break and faces get battered to pulp. It is all in there just how you would have imagined it to be.At no point in the movie does the humour stop. It is on an incessant unchecked ride that has so many Marvel and DC references that would put you in laughter fits. Watch out for Green Lantern, X-Men and Wolverine references! So many quick snappy comebacks that have been aced by Ryan Reynolds nicely. The Merc with a mouth has a flair that relates to the cool perfectly.Other characters in the movie are great as well. Portrayals of Dopinder and Weasel go with the comedy bandwagon complementing the hilarity just fine. Whilst Ed Skrein mixes style and perversion beautifully. Stan Lee makes a cameo as usual and a hilarious post-credit scene waits for you in the end as well. Don't miss that one! The big downside of the movie is its plot. It weighs low on it since most of the times Deadpool is busy entertaining us with his sarcastic unceasing one-liners. Also, Negasonic Teenage Warhead gets lost in the chatter, and fails to make an impact.But we tend to overlook all of that since it was supposed to be an entertainer anyhow. Oh wait! Before I almost forget: "Beeeeeeeeeeeep you, Indian Censor Board!" You ruined it for us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>R-rated super hero movie. Oh yes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad this movie was made. And who can we thank for this?. Ryan Reynolds, the handsome awesome-dude. Reynolds kept pushing for this film for like a decade before it was finally green-lit. The studio did not believe in this, but Reynolds never gave up.What we have here ladies and gentleman is one of the funniest films in a long time. It is so over the top hilarious at times, and so imaginative, you actually sit there watching the film, and think to yourself that there actually might be hope for Hollywood yet.I got to applaud marvel though. You can say a lot about the movie industry the last 10 years, which seems to be filled with super heroes. But marvel really know what they are doing. Making one great film after another, further building on their franchise and heroes. It is something DC isn't even close at replicating.But this is also where Deadpool comes in at the perfect time. It is a Satire, which makes fun of all the superhero movies, but at the same time it is in the same universe. That is truly amazing, it takes balls to do this, the intro sequence alone gives you a heads up how much guts it took to make this film.The film isn't perfect, few are. But it keeps on making you laugh and have a good time all the way through. And it is amazingly creative, this is a well written film, and the direction is rock solid. Mind boggling to think this is Miller's first film, absolutely amazing.And of course it has a lot of "grown up" language going, therefor the R Rating, which just adds to the total experience by a huge amount.And as a bonus you get an absolute gorgeous Morena Baccarin. I have been a fan of her all since Firefly, and she has had her ups and downs since then, but mostly ups. And here, in this film, she shines and are delivering a performance that fits her role so well, i can't think of anyone who could have done it better. Ryan Reynolds on the other hand is only in this film because he is handsome, this we all know. ;)Thanks for making this film guys, thanks for taking risks, thanks for daring to stand up for something and see it through, even if big studio executives are working against you. This was a very fun movie to watch, and i want you to make more!8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Readily accessible wit and self-mockery, sooo much pop-culture and gore and not a moments' respire - just the way I love it! The jokes keep coming and they are not getting old; on the contrary: albeit being quite simplistic, they remain refreshing and enjoyable. All characters are adorable, even the evil Francis, who tries very hard to be a super- villain with a bad-ass name (the allusions game is strong in this one!). The unrelenting humour transpires beyond dialogue through the costumes, attitudes, even settings. From movies to commercials to Marvel mythology, the (self-)references never stop. (Do you think Ryan Reynolds relied on his acting skills to get this one ;) ). What better way to market and celebrate the industry than by beautifully trashing it at every turn?! It's a fantastically violent mutant ninja rom-com ... with superheroes. And the main character, Mr. Pool, who promises a wild and strange ride from the beginning, delivers.</fullReview>

The action/fight scenes do not disappoint...I really couldn't find much I didn't like. I'm usually not one for over the top raunchiness, but there was just enough crude language and sexual innuendo to make it tolerable without taking away from the enjoyable components that I love to see in Marvel films.

		<fullReview>Hey Guys, Well having just watched this film today. I have to say that this was so not a disappointment marvel comic film. Thank God that Fox did not screw this film like they did with fantastic four. You have to thank Ryan Reynolds for not allowing then to screw this film up, it was just excellent. Thank god this was not a PG typical marvel film for kids. i loved it, such much bad language, i lost count on how many times bad language was used and so much violent was in this film with a perfect balance of comedy. Ryan Reynolds was just too good in this film. he really did a great job in this film. its like this film was meant for him. Unlike what DC did with the green lantern, marvel and fox just let Ryan Reynolds do what ever he wanted to do in this film. He also followed the comics more. Man, the romantic scenes where good just a good perfect balance. This for sure did not feel like a typical marvel film that was made for kids. I love all the bad language used in this film, the adult jokes used in this film were too good. this film had the perfect balance of action and comedy with a good storyline. I also love the soundtrack from this film, i love that they have used one old songs just like guardians of galaxy did. The whole crew do a very good job acting their roles. In the comics Deadpool is really an stupid funny guy who wolverine always hates. Please go and watch this film, this is one of the best comic films that won't let your down. We actual have to give credit to Ryan Reynolds and the director Tim Miller for putting this film together and Fox for letting them do whatever they wanted to do and mostly because its s rated film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By that, I mean that the plot (mad scientist moonlighting as merchant of death ultimately kidnaps Catherine Bell look-alike doubling as love interest of anti-hero) exists only as a means of thinly justifying all the action sequences. On the other hand, the Thornton Wilder-style breakings of the Fourth Wall do allow Ryan Reynolds to take some well- deserved pot shots at Time-Warner with regard to GREEN LANTERN. Furthermore, the almost-touching scene where Wade walks out on Vanessa, in order to take advantage of Ajax's "cancer cure treatment," leads to a bit of scenery-chewing by the British guy playing the latter that--quite frankly--almost literally put me to sleep!That being said, however, I still enjoyed this film a lot more than the prequel I shall always (without hesitation...or apology) refer to as X- MEN: LOW CLASS. Especially the debut of Negasonic Teenage Warhead!I'm hoping she's a revamped version of Boom-Boom from the comics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real heroes here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Superhero movies have been dominating the box office for the better part of two decades, and most tend to lean towards moody and intense ? though Iron-Man and The Avengers have certainly enjoyed adding searing one-liners to the mix. As for ratings, superheroes have steadfastly claimed PG-13 as the perfect blend of massive action, massive muscles and massive audiences. So it's a little surprising to find a movie about a relatively unknown superhero, that's the first feature from director Tim Miller (previously a visual effects guru), crashing through the R-rated barrier in no-holds-barred fashion. It's startling and refreshing to see a new take on what had become just a bit too familiar.This is a movie for which you will want to actually read the opening credits and stay for the post credit scene (a 2-parter). Additionally, you will want to make sure you keep not only little kids away (remember the hard R-rating), but also any grown-ups who are offended by harsh language (on the Tarantino scale), ultra-violence (on the Kill Bill scale) or any combination of sex, sex talk or sex jokes (all at an entirely new level). To label this movie as crass or profane is like calling Chewbacca somewhat fuzzy. And while it pushes the raunch-o-meter, it's also blazingly funny at times (especially for a cancer movie).The previously mentioned opening credits refer to the writers as "the real heroes here", and while the plot is pretty textbook superhero stuff, it's the barrage of one-liners and sight gags at which those writers so excel. They even make sure those unfamiliar with the Wade Wilson backstory understand that he is a former special forces operative turned mercenary for the average Joe's and Jane's. In no time, it's drilled into our heads that he is also a wiseacre, wisenheimer, wise-ass, wisecracker and any other adjective that means funny but not wise.Ryan Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson/Deadpool and leaves no doubt that he has finally found the role that fits him as well as his red suit. If you are convulsing as you flashback to Mr. Reynolds as Green Lantern (2011), take solace in the fact that this movie fires a couple of deadly shots at that oh-so-disappointing effort. His girlfriend Vanessa is played by Morena Baccarin ("Homeland"), and his best buddy/bartender is played by TJ Miller ("Silicon Valley"). Since Reynolds had a brief appearance as Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), there are numerous nods to that franchise, including two key roles here for Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The target of Deadpool's revenge comes in the form of Ed Skrein (The Transporter Refueled) as Ajax and Gina Carano as Angel Dust ? accompanied by her theme song "Angel of the Morning" (unfortunately it's the Juice Newton version, and not the more powerful Merrillee Rush and the Turnabouts version). Lastly, it's pure joy to see Leslie Uggams cast in a spunky supporting role.Your kid may have a Captain America figurine on their bookshelf, but the R-rating is solidified in the first 10 minutes, and is relentlessly reinforced until the movie ends. We can only imagine how much fun those old enough to watch are going to have, and brace yourself for an onslaught of Deadpool comebacks over the next few weeks ? only hopefully not in church, at the office, in front of grandma, etc ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Omg. DEADPOOL was like the best movie ever!!!! New favourite? Do not misssssss!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was about time. We'd reached the saturation point in Superhero genre. There were way too many generic origin stories and sequels from both Marvel and DC. Every superhero movie nowadays is either about a cookie cutter villain who wants to take over the world, or about a cookie cutter villain who wants to take over the world and show up in the sequel. And the heroes either weep gloomily (Man of Steel) or try too hard to be funny (Ultron).We needed a superhero who gets the bullshit out of the way and knock people in the balls for fun. We needed a superhero who doesn't mope around in his origin story. We needed a superhero who impales bad guys with dual Katanas. And most importantly, we needed a superhero who asks if you're going to touch yourself tonight.With no attempt at a hyperbole, I can tell you that the era of The Dark Knight is over. Deadpool is here. And things will never be the same again.Deadpool, directed by Tim Miller is a raging, exploding subversion of superhero films. And by subversion I mean it grabs you by the collar, shows you how most superhero movies suck, and nimbly demonstrates how things can be different when some brain cells are put to use by filmmakers. The opening sequence, a slow freeze frame zoom out of a car crash plays out like an Honest Credits skit, where the producer is called a rich asshole and the writers are called the real heroes of the film.This is the kind of film Deadpool is - self aware, self-referential and in full Hollywood bashing mode. Nobody is spared ? not even the producers of this very film, where Deadpool makes fun of the lack of budget. The film doesn't shy away from thrashing rivals studios as well. In the scene where it's time to turn a human into a mutant with a sci fi experiment, Deadpool, played by Ryan Reynolds, who also played Green Lantern, asks the evil scientist not to give him a shitty CGI suit.His love interest (Morena Baccarin) isn't the delicate blonde haired damsel in distress ? she's as demented as him, and their disturbingly lusty relationship is played out as love. No schmaltzy upside down kisses in the rain here ? the woman wears a strap on and proceeds to bend the superhero here.Such insane subversion is feels like discovering treasure. And now that you've seen the shinier side of the genre, it's going to be difficult to come back to the straightforward superhero movies. When Deadpool spends the whole movie telling you how you've been watching shitty movies until now, your expectations for Batman vs Superman, and the future Avengers films dissipates.It's like tasting Belgian chocolate waffles in Belgium - you can't go back to Bandra Nutella waffles after that. Or like eating a Pizza in Milan and realizing Dominoes tastes like turd. Or like wearing silk underwear and realizing you can't go back to cotton. If the point still isn't clear in your head you need to schedule a meeting with Deadpool.This movie is written by the same guys who wrote Zombieland, and their wicked sense of humor is infectious. The more surprising part is that this is director Miller's first film. With the kind of visual artistry, mayhem, and grasp on humor on display in Deadpool, this achievement is the equivalent of the Taj Mahal being built by a guy who held a rock cutter for the first time.Deadpool is Fox's Guardians of the Galaxy, and it's opened a whole new gateway for the superhero genre. Whether you have a date or not, make sure you celebrate Valentine's Day at the multiplex playing this movie. It's a love story after all, with lubricated strap ons. Deadpool is be a very rewarding cinematic experience that is refreshingly different from any other superhero movie before it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The filthiest, most entertaining, and hilarious superhero movie in the Marvel universe! // instagram: moviesmaniax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds returns once again as Deadpool after his first appearance in X-Men Origin. Expect the unexpected in the most anticipated R-rated superhero film of the year that will blow your brains out, literally.After the failure of rebooting Fantastic Four last year, 20th Century Fox finally redeems itself with Deadpool and takes a risk in releasing this with an R-rating, which is really rare for a mainstream superhero film these days, but the result clearly shows that they made the right decision. Deadpool has a pretty basic plot about a guy getting revenge and killing people along the way. While it may not have a fancy plot like other superhero movies, the result is beyond satisfying and lives up to its premise. The whole movie is filled with non-stop raunchy humour as well as a delightful amount of bloody, violent action sequences that are refreshing and certainly will entertain the hell out of you throughout its running time. This is a movie that totally deserves its R-rating (for strong violence and language throughout, sexual content and graphic nudity). I'm pleased to see that they didn't choose to go soft by giving it a PG-13 rating to gain more audiences, which in that case, would have totally limit the movie's potential. Thanks to that decision, you all can now expect lots of violence and nasty dialogue and prepare to laugh your guts out.Also, the important element that makes all this all work is the cast. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for this role, which reminds us what a big mistake it was to shut his mouth in X-Men: Origin. Deadpool here is just as foul-mouthed and filthy as you expect him to be. Without a great supporting cast, this movie wouldn't have been this satisfying. T.J. Miller, Rachel Sheen, Brainna Hildebrand (as Warhead), and scene-stealer Leslie Uggams (as Blind Al) all did a great job portraying their characters and adding a great comedic touch and chemistry with our Deadpool and naturally balanced their performance really well. And trying not to give anything away, Stan Lee also has one of the best cameos you will ever see in a Marvel movie.Overall, with its gleeful violence and non-stop raunchy humour, Deadpool turns its simple plot into the filthiest, most entertaining, and hilarious superhero movie in the Marvel universe.&gt;&gt;A&lt;&lt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irreverent and wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy was this fun. Ryan Reynolds should be commended on bringing Deadpool to the screen, because not many people would be able to rise above the criticism levelled at him over the years for both Green Lantern and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Beyond that, he should be commended for the performance he gives here. He wears the classic costume with pride, kicks complete ass in the action sequences and is in general the funnest protagonists to grace the comic book screen since Peter Quill, and eclipses both Chris Pratt and Robert Downey Jr. with his sheer charm and humour.After one of the best opening credits sequences ever made, we are treated with a cleverly interspliced story. Deadpool is hunting down his nemesis Francis, but this sequence on the bridge is cut between the origins of Deadpool's powers. The filmmakers knew we would get bored by the same formula, so they shake it up and keep us entertained. That's not to say that the origin story isn't fun. Reynolds and a wonderful Morena Baccarin have enough chemistry to engage us with their love story in the same way that Eisenberg and Stewart did with American Ultra. Ed Skrein is an adequate villain (I believe in you Ed! You can do great stuff!) with enough drips of smug malevolence to make his downfall desirable to the audience. In the present, there's some great work done by Brianna Hildebrand and Stefan Kapi&#x10d;i&#x107; as a pair of X-Men who try to get Deadpool to join their team. Both of them are so much fun that I found myself wishing for more of them on screen. There's even a hilarious subplot about a taxi driver named Dopinder, which ends up serving the final film instead of being useless. (in stark contrast to Sicario).What accelerates Deadpool is what everyone wanted from Deadpool - humour, fourth wall breaks and general irreverance. Masturbation, and sex jokes are both crass and hilarious (yes you can have both!) Wilson's foul mouth, wit and childish love for innuendo is absolutely irresistible, but best of all are the constant digs at X-Men films, Hugh Jackman and especially Ryan Reynolds himself. I was always holding out for the next fourth wall break and rarely did they disappoint me. I adored the Monty Python inspired jokes and they worked superbly on all fronts. The use of DMX's music is inspired and utterly wonderful. I could find fault only with the action sequences, which are choppy, shaky and almost impossible to decipher. I also felt that having established Negasonic's powers, she was forced to sit on the sidelines to avoid overpowering the whole film. That being said, Tim Miller's directorial choices for the most part were brilliant - especially a cliché-kicking "wow that was awesome!" declaration by Deadpool after what would inevitably be an "OMG where's Wade" towards the film's climax. I'm glad that a debut director got his hands on this property, because anyone experienced in the industry might have been tempted to give into the formula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anti Superhero movie worth cheering for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year populated with Superhero / Comic-book movies, Deadpool enters the fray first as this lovable anti-hero delivers a truly one of a kind not so superhero movie.Wade Wilson is a mercenary for hire who's unfortunately stricken by cancer. Desperate to find a cure, he enlists on an secret experimental program *cough cough Weapon X cough cough*. However things do not go as planned as the program left him for dead, though cured of his cancer and more, Wade Wilson came out a completely changed person. Seeking for retribution, Wade Wilson adapts the codename Deadpool and searches for the people who tortured him.One of the most beloved comic book character finally hits the screen with Deadpool. Now he's been portrayed before from a different movie, but it's a movie better of forgotten and buried in a "never to watch again" box. This movie on the other hand, does the character justice. It's everything a Deadpool fan asks for in a Deadpool movie. It's crude, violent, extremely funny and all around enjoyable. The movie takes advantage of it's R Rating and it works incredibly well.Ryan Reynolds is perfect as Deadpool, it's as if he was born to play this character. His jokes are witty and delivers them with perfect timing. From his sarcasm, to his foul language to references to other superhero movies from breaking the fourth wall and talking to the audience. These are lines a fan would thoroughly enjoy. The side characters were done well, the addition of Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (geez that's a mouthful) compliment's Deadpool nicely, specially Colossus who's given a much needed personality. Though Deadpool is still the star of the film, Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic) gave a nice noticeable performance.Though the movie is incredibly fun and laugh out loud funny. It's with flaws, the antagonists Ajax (Ed Skrein) and Angel (Gina Carano) were one dimensional and though they play the villains well, there's not much else to them. Also some of the CG were obvious and one can tell that there this movie was not made with the same budget as other superhero movies. However these are just minor flaws, and it shouldn't ruin anyone's viewing experience.Overall Deadpool has definitely raised the bar for the rest of the superhero movies coming out this year. With a perfect on-screen adaptation of a comic- book character, Deadpool delivers a refreshing take on the superhero genre. It's a satirical movie who's not afraid to comment on the clichés and flaws of said superhero movies. It's self referential yet uses this to it's advantage to deliver a near perfect anti-superhero movie. Highly recommended for people who are familiar with the product, likewise for people just looking for a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They got it right with this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool (2016) Directed by Tim Miller Cinema Ryan Reynold has tried to get this Deadpool film off the ground for 10 years as he is a big fan of the character and desperately wants to make amends for how the character was butchered in the now defunct timeline of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It took the leaking of some old commissioned test footage that got comic fandom buzzing to finally get greenlit. Then Reynolds and co wisely settled for a very low budget so they could keep the film R rated and have delivered a film very authentic to its origins. For those unaware of Deadpool, he is a former Special Forces operative turned smart mouthed mercenary who is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool. He is part of the Marvel universe or more specifically within big screen parameters, the X-Men universe. He is famous for being the one character who constantly breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the readers directly, or in this case viewers. Everything about his character is not the usual fare for superhero films which is half the reason he has never made it properly for this long. Reynolds was born for the role and he delivers with the help of a smart script that does not hold back and my shock many who are used to the PG super hero films of the last decade. The supporting cast are great too and include some familiar characters. There is no shaky-cam for the action which is great and it really delivers. The budget may have been quite low comparatively but it rarely shows except for in the special effect in a small part of the finale. This may end up being the funniest comedy of the year, the best action film of the year, the raunchiest R rated film of the year and it wouldn't surprise me if in a year when there are more high profile super-hero films coming out than ever before, that this ends up being at the top of that mountain too. This is a smaller film that does not need for their to be earth destroying consequences to give it gravitas. Much like Ant-man from last year the situation is smaller but the film has relationships set up and some heart as well but not unlike the Daredevil netflix show, the gloves are off here and they are way off and anything goes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We need this sardonic actioner at this time of year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You're probably thinking 'This is a superhero movie, but that guy in the suit just turned that other guy into a f----ng kebab.' Surprise, this is a different kind of superhero story." DeadpoolRyan Reynolds' titular Deadpool is not like any other superhero; in fact he's an antihero. He murders men and women and murders language as well. Yet, his unceasing banter is sometimes witty and full of cultural allusions, especially to X Men, who would like him to join them.But he's not ready yet, for he needs to track down the baddie, Ajax (Ed Skrein), who gave him a horrible face as a result of an experiment that cured his cancer and gave him supernatural powers. In the course of the pursuit, Wade (Deadpool's civilian name) meets Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), a dark-haired beauty who makes his life worth living.Most of the film is of course the usual CGI comic-book roughhousing but peppered with so much irony and sarcasm that it's worthwhile just trying to catch half the tossed-off lines. Reynolds is a master of the one liners, many of which can be found in the IMDb sidebar "quotes." For example: "WAIT! You may be wondering why the red suit. Well, that's so bad guys don't see me bleed." Or "I didn't ask to be super, and I'm no hero. But when you find out your worst enemy is after your best girl, the time has come to be a f----ng superhero." DeadpoolAnyway, it's the kind of dialogue best suited to adolescent boys, but this arrested adult critic finds the dialogue entertaining and the movie a refreshingly sardonic take on an inviolate genre. Enjoy this out of the summer-hero fest at a time of year when we all can welcome the relief from otherwise mediocre and boring fare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Deadpool movie we need the Deadpool movie we deserve!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where shall I start with this hilarious, action-packed and witty film? Deadpool is a funny film from start to finish ? the humour is laugh out loud funny. The movie itself doesn't take itself totally seriously and this is perfect for a film like Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds truly was born to play this character as his dead pan or rather Deadpool performance was very watchable. Morena Baccarin is also very good as the main female lead of the film. She adds another perspective on the piece overall. Ed Skrein is a slightly clichéd villain but this does not take away from the film as Reynolds really does steal the screen. The on screen action is fantastic and stylised. The progression of the story is also very good (although unconventional). The brilliant writing and clever observations really are the strong foundations of this film though. To conclude I thought Tim Miller did a stand up job on this first feature film. I hope Deadpool returns and continues to make me laugh. Overall, I would give this film 8.9 out of 10. The film was extremely funny but was just missing a little something to be 9 out of 10 for me. This being said, I think Deadpool is a great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants not only a laugh but a good action flick.</fullReview>

The intro is Deadpool, the credits are Deadpool, the after credits scene is Deadpool.He speaks to you, he speaks to me, he'll even speak to your wife/girlfriend/husband/boyfriend who isn't into superhero movies. Because this isn't a superhero movie. This is a Deadpoolmovie, or maybe a Ryan Reynolds movie.There are just so many things, small and big, that make this movie. The story (for those who don't already know it), the small (and the big) references to the X-Men, the jokes. Oh the jokes.This movie is just marvelous. Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler spoiler spoiler Well I watched dead pool yesterday and all I can say is wow. What a different take on the super hero genre. For one as he says in the film it's not a super hero film it's a love story. However it's a funny love story with many funny moments. I've never heard blind jokes that made me laugh Ryan Reynolds changed all of that. This part was made for him and there was action laughs sad moments and it touched all areas. Dead pool is a guy names wade who gets diagnosed with cancer. He decides he doesn't want his girlfriend to have to see him die so he decided to get some special treatment done which basically Turns him into dead pool. When turned into dead pool the side affects are gruesome and he blames the people who changes him. He decides he wants to get his messed up face fixed. So goes on a killing spree to get the guy who did it to him. Basically there is some kind of corporation that turns people into mutants by torturing them. So after getting the back story and working his way through armies of people he gets stopped by the xmen in the form of colossus and some girl who's name escapes me. Again there are allot of laughs when they come into the film. I don't want to spoil to much so please go and see this great film that sits on the top of the podium with guardians of the galaxy as marvels best installment to date. This film isn't really a children's marvel films it's more of an adults marvel film with allot of swearing and gore. Amen to that</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm one of those people who first saw the leaked test footage some years ago and having been a Deadpool comic book fan from a young age, have been hoping that the movie would get made and in a way that honours the comic book.If you are a fan of the Deadpool comics and can forgive that they have lightened up a little just to have this made at all, this is a fantastic movie.Right from the credits (which you have to pay attention to) there are 4th wall breaches, which give you an indication of the type of movie that you're about to watch. The initial part of the movie is interspersed with parallel telling of Deadpool's origin story and the current period time, a difference of about 2 years right up until Deadpool hits the motorway - which is where the test footage starts to look very familiar.The movie is definitely bloody and not at all for the faint hearted, however the comedy aspect of it makes the gory scenes almost so unbelievable that you can laugh them off - between people being shot in the head, you have Deadpool being shot in the ass - which lightens the whole mood of near decapitation by a single bullet.The laughs don't stop coming either, even in the midst of all that violence. The 4th wall is constantly broken - from the appearance of a toy "Wade Wilson" as a kind of Deadpool from that X-Men:Wolverine movie that we would want to forget him appearing in, to references of McAvoy and Stewart as Charles Xavier. The jokes are juvenile and crude, and the action violent and bloody - apart from a few jokes which I don't believe translated as well to little old New Zealand - I absolutely loved it and plan to go see it again!Do make sure you check the closing credits and stay right until the very last credits!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Merc with the Mouth finally gets the movie he deserves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never read a single Deadpool comic nor having seen the mess that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine, I was curious when I heard that a Deadpool movie was coming out, so I went to my local theater, watched the movie and I have to say, Deadpool surprised me with its great writing and humor, awesome action scenes, Ryan Reynolds as the title character and it's off-the-wall craziness. The film begins with a well-shot action scene with Deadpool in action, shooting and slicing up guys like sashimi, and then cuts back to two years before where Wade Wilson, a mercenary for hire meets a prostitute named Vanessa and they soon become lovingly committed. One year later, Wilson pops the question to Vanessa and she says yes, but Wade abruptly collapses and is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Later on, a recruiter from a top-secret program approaches Wade and offers him a chance to cure his cancer, Wilson at first refuses, but decides to undergo the treatment. At a laboratory, he meets Ajax and Angel Dust who inject him with a serum that will rouse any dormant mutant genes and expose him to weeks of torture and pain to trigger the genes but without any success. Afterwards, Wilson mocks Ajax, resulting in him being put into an airtight chamber that puts Wade on the edge of suffocation. After Ajax reveals his true motives to him, Wade attacks Ajax and is subjugated, impaled and left to burn to death. Now, with a disfigured face and revenge on his mind, Wilson adopts the name Deadpool and must find and kill Ajax and save his girlfriend.Tim Miller manages to pull off the impossible with Deadpool: a movie essentially built on fan service that doesn't suck or pander to the fans too much, but Miller is shrewd enough to understand that Deadpool is so much more than just one-liners and decapitation, the real heart of the movie lies in the emotional and character rhythms which are delivered in spades. The storytelling here is creative by chucking us into an action scene then cuts back and forth in excellent and surprising ways to tell the story of this crazy but oddly likable antihero. Usually flashbacks and fast-forwards can get tiresome, but then they're done right, they can help make a simple story feel new and thrilling. When it comes to the action, Deadpool having only a few action scenes does indicate it's small budget, but seeing fights kept as thin as they are here is refreshing, even if it isn't settled by a unsubtle joke modifying their scarcity, but we're not left hanging: the action is short, quick, ultra-gory and violent and extremely stylish with the opening scene and the final fight between Deadpool and Ajax being the highlights for me.There's no denying it that Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool and his obsession for this character powers a career defining performance and is instilled with a talent of making even the crudest phrase shine with spirited charisma. Reynolds makes every single beat of madcap humor, furious rage and pain come so natural that there's an eerie feeling of him being lifted out of a comic. Morena Baccarin is perfect as Vanessa, matching Reynolds in delightful crankiness, steering just shy of hot, fanatic-pixie-fantasy-sweetheart typecasting by maintaining just the perfect amount of insane, as well as being a lot better developed than other comic book damsels. T.J. Miller is reliably hilarious as Wade's friend, Weasel and steals every scene he's in. Ed Skerin brings plenty of arrogant, muscular cruelty to Ajax which makes him feel a lot less generic than most other action movie villains while Gina Carano works well as Angel Dust. Leslie Uggams is deliciously amusing as Blind Al. Stefan Kapicic and Brianna Hildebrand bring their A game as Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, allowing for some humorous banter and help keep the action bouncing all the way to the end.The humor in Deadpool is one of the reasons this film works so well with lots of in-humor, references to films like Taken and Robocop, visual jokes, and vulgar humor. There are some nice jokes to Reynolds' previous outing as Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine like when Ajax threatens to sew Wade's month shut or when Wilson says not to make the suit green or animated is a nice nob to Green Lantern. One of my favorite jokes is when Colossus is taking Deadpool to meet with Professor X and he asks him if James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart is the most recent professor at the institution. If you are an avid Deadpool reader then you're probably well aware of his ability to break the 4th wall, talking to the audience. Well, there are several times he does this during the course of the movie when he does. Every single joke in this movie works and not once did the humor not make me laugh. Rhett Reese and Pau Wernick knocked it out of the park then it comes to the humor and the writing. The music here is fantastic, ranging from Salt and Pepa to Chicago. It makes sense that Deadpool's theme song would be DMX or at least until he starts playing Careless Wisper by George Michael which makes me wonder they took a page for Guardians of the Galaxy.I can't recommend this movie enough, It's funny, action-packed, has an awesome soundtrack, Ryan Reynolds rocks it as the title character and it's just an all-round fun movie. Little word of advance, this film is not for kids or anyone who is easily offended, Deadpool is a hard R movie and wears it like a badge of honor, so please don't take your kids to see this. Also, be sure to stick around for a post credits stinger that just might get you feeling a little gritty. Go see Deadpool if you haven't already, it's one awesome movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally a superhero film that urinates all over decorum, and well, on just about everything else really, especially other marvel characters. Talking about which, I must say I am seriously impressed that marvel has once again been able to make something out of very little.This is for all intents and purposes just another revenge film. There's nothing particularly original about Deadpool but with snappy, foul mouth and clever dialogue, a frenetic pace, fantastic visual effects and an opening sequence that will blow your socks off, this rates as one of the best examples of what Hollywood can achieve if you allow certain individuals to run free with their passion.In Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds played the titular role for laugh out loud entertainment. Morena Baccarin is gorgeous and delivers her sometimes equally foul mouth rants with glee. I think it's fair to say that everyone in the film appeared to have had an absolute ball. Tipping my hat to the director Tim Miller for his directorial debut. The opening scene alone almost had me in spasms, it's exciting to see such talent coming out of mainstream Hollywood. Loved the soundtrack, loved the visuals, loved the sick humour, loved the lead actors, but I didn't really get the role of those x-men characters. It's OK, that was a minor quibble. Overall, fantastically entertaining film and must be seen on the big screen.</fullReview>

Thank you so much sir for making this movie go through, you showed love to the character and to the fans. You played deadpool so well that really no one else will be able to play this character again. As for deadpool, what a fun and interesting character, you can honestly just have him sit in the a chair and talk. His constantly pulling out funny remarks and jokes. His fighting style is awesome. For the other characters they all bring there part to this story but i feel that it really is all about deadpool which is not a bad thing.The action in this movie is well choreographed and entertaining. The RATED R really did allow this movie to steer off from the original super hero movies we have come use to seeing.Overall this movie was everything i wanted it to be, i was please and really looking forward to what we have next!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In many ways it is the piece de resistance of the Marvel Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What did Deadpool do right? Very nearly everything. This might be the only "Superhero" film since the genre exploded that is a true 100% labour of love. Ryan Reynolds and Tim Miller fought tooth and nail to make this film happen and make it happen the way they wanted it to and the way the fans wanted it to. Deadpool is insanely entertaining. It is ridiculously gratuitous in all the best ways you'd expect, it crosses into the X-Men World so it's a nice break from the whole "Avengers" world although it gets mentioned as well. It is dark, twisted, hilarious, gory, unique, insane...every time I didn't think it could impress me more, it does! I was worried Reynolds' sarcastic humour would be overused and it isn't, I was worried it would have a weak story and it is anything but. Every expectation was met and no glowing review was wrong. This was quite simply a great time at the movies. It also has so much to it and the script is so fast and clever and with the pop culture references and Easter eggs I am certain I could watch this several times over and walk away with something different each time. It might have given gas to a genre (described by Steven Spielberg so accurately as the Western of this generation) that is slowly losing steam I think. Best of all they did it on a very moderate budget and yet the special effects, stunts and CGI are some of the best I have ever seen period. Nothing is held back.I have always liked Ryan Reynolds. I know he's a good solid actor because he's proved he can be versatile. However, he was born and bred to play Deadpool. It was like Deadpool was written with him in mind 20+ years ago. Hugh Jackman single-handedly made Wolverine come to life and now Reynolds does the same for DeadPool. But this isn't just a super-hero who kicks the crap out of people though he does plenty of that. There is an actual story here, Wade Wilson has some serious depth to his character and Reynolds is clearly very passionate about this character. In order to be this amazing character he needs a near perfect villain and they find that in Ed Skrein who is fantastic as Ajax. The two of them have a deep rivalry that works on a terrific level and unlike some villains who are out for world domination, this rivalry is personal. Morena Baccarin is decent as Wade Wilson's love interest. She wouldn't have been my first choice but I never cared for her on Homeland as a character so maybe I'm biased. She is still decent and their chemistry is solid. The supporting cast also truly shines in this film without characters you just want to see more of. Karan Soni, Stefan Kapicic, T.J. Miller and the excruciatingly underused but fascinating addition of Negasonic Teenage Warhead played perfectly by Brianna Hildebrand. This is also the first time I've seen Gina Carano who is just awful awful awful at "acting" be tolerable in a role but mostly because she is reduced fortunately to a thug whose purpose is to fight with Colossus. Still Carano needs to stop getting cast in anything ever.Director Tim Miller really knocks this out of the park. Sometimes a new director proves themselves in such a way that they can set themselves for life and I think will be Miller's home-run. His style, the depth of story he's created here, the incredible special effects and the way he uses the characters and actors and he's just made something so incredibly deeply entertaining. This is one film that lives up to the hype and is a must see but is such a far cry from other Marvel films out there and definitely not for the youngsters. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool delivers action, comedy and a fun, entertaining twist on everything an anti-hero movie should be! Based on the famous comic book published by Marvel Comics, this film tells the story of Wade Wilson, played by Ryan Reynolds, as a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary. Wilson becomes involved in an experiment that left him with healing powers which creates his alter ego, Deadpool. His mission is to take down the man who nearly destroyed his life. Action packed with a dark twisted sense of humor, this film surprised me tremendously and was ridiculously hilarious! Directed by award winning Tim Miller, this film brings everything imaginable to an action film. Reynolds did an amazing job and was as funny as I've ever seen him. He has played a wide array of characters in his previous films and continued to do so in Deadpool! With such an amazing director, cast and the magic of Marvel, this film did not disappoint!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1hr48mins 9/10 14 years in the making at a budget 0f 58 mill This film had a lower budget than any of the X-Men, Iron Man, Avengers, or Captain America movies. so they have limited budget but it doesn't take away from being unique and A new class of superhero. that rise from the ashes like a Phoenix marvel have kept their brand fresh and funny and Ryan Reynolds describes Deadpool's "breaking the fourth wall" this means he talks straight to the camera so his jokes taking himself not seriously and not been overly serious so this film is a origins film so it has story a back story rewind/ and fast forward button ability as a reflection of his wit: "He's funny and and a little bit of a mad. But he's also not trying to be liked, he's intentionally trying to annoy everyone. " but his other superhero roles like the green lantern get mentioned as his other roles like his green roles as we see the slow mo action scenes from the the start the hero roles the genius marvel the English villain the cameo from a xmen the of genius in marvel show this sword wielding guns is subjected to a rogue villain experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool. This director Tim miller first film and he does well with what he has got at his disposal Tim miller does his best at the subject and joke taking that goes on with loads of scenes which is not for children is why its r rated movie great cast are up for this. This is an easy movie to review but compared with the a list of marvel this is the underdog with a soundtrack from the 80 like wham and Chicago been belted out and Ryan Reynolds singing along to cheese pop with his suit but his girlfriend in this movie loves him but when he disappears her life changes but his also changes Armed with his new abilities and a dark, twisted sense of humor, Deadpool hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life.but fights to get his life back and with help of two xmen with great fights scenes and wise cracks the battle scenes with a cameo of sorts for of the marvel and shield item in the back ground which becomes a Hugh scenes so watch out and also the blind women fun at her usefulness at doing things and not knowing who her roommate is helps dead pool a lot but there reference to taken for Liam nesson in takenso with a big prop from the marvel shield universe for the finale to help the big battle for hearts and minds this film I gave it 8.5/10 because I giving to many film easy tens</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great. Really worth the money and time to go see it when this comes out on DVD or Netflix it's a must see or get movie. Very funny with a lot of twist you couldn't really guess what was going to happen next like you most movie but that's why it's mainly a good movie to see the director and everybody did a good job in creating this movie that's why I gave it a 10 out of 10 it'll have you dying laughing by the end of the movie. Hope to see a part 2 if there is a part 2 you know I'll be there the first day it comes out. Most people who say this movie isn't great doesn't know anything about movies cause this was a master peace I recommend seeing it before it leave theater so you can get a full experience of the action and everything that was going down in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wise-cracking superhero for teenagers and geeks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand why 16-to-25-year-old geeky guys (i.e. the internet generation) would love this movie. It's a fast-paced video-game ride of a movie with many, many wise cracks, self-deprecating humour and cultural references. It has an overtly camp edge to it. Much of this movie constitutes a running dialogue between Wade and his adolescent viewers. This movie is cool, camp, sexy and violent. (The violence and sex in this movie are not that over the top. I saw nothing that really made me squeamish. It is more graphic than most movies. There was an extended torture scene that made me a little uncomfortable..)The movie's themes are the themes of adolescence in the early 21st century: sci-fi, superhero movies (yes, the movie's genre was also a theme), fitting in, rebellion, anxiety about personal and professional failure, angst about disease, looks and getting the girl, stalking, cruelty, bullying, alienation, feminism, sexuality, etc.The movie doesn't even pretend to be realistic. Yes, I know it's a movie about a comic-book figure, but c'mon there has to be something realistic about it. And it's not adult in any way. You know what I'm talking about. This is not a movie for adults.I have to go back to see the movie twice because much of it was too fast. The movie was funny, but the kind of funny where you feel afterwards that you didn't quite get the joke. Cultural references hurled at the viewer do not make a movie intelligent. I did get some visceral enjoyment out of it all. I was mildly moved on a few occasions, and I did chuckle out loud. But at the end -- despite its attempts to be an anti-superhero movie -- much of it was just the same loud, over-the-top bust-everything-up superhero cr*p you see in all these films. The big scenes here are the same old sh*t: big crashes, disasters, shootouts, kung-fu fighting. I thought at one point that the film was made for young men who have grown up with difficulties focusing and require a barrage of snappy dialogue and crashes to enjoy anything.It's really just another Marvel X-men movie. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose. I really liked the last one, so that's two good ones in a row. It's just that I don't need all my movies to be franchise movies about Marvel comic figures or anything else. Let's do other things once in a while. This movie didn't blow me away as much as that Galaxy movie.I want to give it about 7.5. I have to round it down because I can't say this movie was all that great. It's somebody else's 10, 9 or even 8. It's a 7 to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another entertaining anti-superhero movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comic book hero movie franchises can often get off to a good, fun start, then peter out so badly that you lose interest in watching more sequels. "Deadpool" has gotten off to a good start and hopefully being more anti-hero in genre will hold the (wannabe) franchise in good stead.Ryan Reynolds plays the titular anti-hero in this movie and you get to see - through fragmented and out of sequence story - how he came to have the extraordinary powers that he does. If I've seen any of Ryan's films before this one, I don't remember them...at least for him specifically. In that way, he's kind of an "unknown" actor for me and I do like the way that the character of Deadpool is underplayed by him. As for how Deadpool came to have the powers that he does...I'm not so sure why he's so upset...given the alternative that he faced.With the vulgar and violent nature of Deadpool, it could have been easy to make him much larger than life...like Jim Carrey's performance as The Mask...or maybe demonstrate the kind of exuberance you see by the superhero in the first Spider-Man movie, starring Toby Maguire. As it stands - in this first movie, at least - Deadpool isn't as charismatic as one might have been lead to believe (I've never read any of the comics for that character. Apparently he had a small part in one of The Wolverine movies...if I saw him there, he meant nothing to me) and nowhere near as charismatic as Chloë Grace Moretz as Hit-Girl in the "Kick-Ass" franchise. Again, this isn't a bad thing...at least not yet.The action scenes in the movie are well done...stylised and exciting...cf. the second Avengers movie where "more" most definitely translated into 'less". Also enjoyable was the humour in this movie...Deadpool doesn't take much seriously. If you have wide pop cultural knowledge, you can play "Spot the reference"...e.g. there is a variation in this movie of an even longer Monty Python sketch which stretches the joke to breaking point. There's also a paraphrase of a famous quote from "Notting Hill". If you've seen "American psycho" you might get a kick out of the discussion on the merits of "Wham!". It's hard to say if the anti- hero's tast in music is meant to humorous too...I suspect that it is! The humour of Deadpool also gets quite "meta" at times...he refers to actors...who play characters in superhero movies...You do see other superheroes from the Marvel universe in this movie...I just have no idea who they are...but their super powers are...suitably silly. Some of the reviews that I read for this movie made it seem like it was particularly violent but I didn't find it particularly confronting. Some of the dialogue has sexual references, so, combining that with the violence, I'd say that this isn't a movie for the youngsters.The character of Deadpool reminds me a bit of the Tom Baker years as The Doctor, in "Doctor Who"...but more violent. Have to say that I'm more a fan of these anti-superhero type movies than the more conventional kinds...so, I like Deadpool...as well as Watchmen, Kick- Ass and Hancock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an Oscar and yet the best movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We didn't need to have a Deadpool movie with a exceptional story. Or at least I didn't. I was perfectly happy with a movie that had Deadpool making jokes and killing people in a by the numbers revenge movie, but this film went way beyond that. This was just supposed to be another Kick Ass movie, but for me this movie can compete with the R rated spy thriller known as Kingsman which I also gave the same rating as this film. This film has some great action stunts, good blood and a lot of death defying stunts, but that isn't what makes it a good film. This film also has a heart and it wears it on its sleeve. It is the most romantic film for a non romantic movie. It beats out Pepper and Tony in the Iron Man movie and can compete with the relationship between Peter and Gwen in the Amazing Spider-Man. It really is a film that can break boundaries. This film also keeps the spirit of Deadpool alive Giving us a perfect interpretation of the character. There were a few minor differences from the character created in the comics such as the multiple personalities and I am pretty sure Wade Wilson wasn't crazy before the weapon X project happened. That being said it was still good enough for all of us fans of the character to really have a good time with him. Deadpool wins!!!!</fullReview>

The acting is great..at first i was a bit skeptical but now i cant imagine anyone better then Ryan Reynolds as dead pool. This is not your typical super hero film, so u most have an open mind in order to really enjoy this. The only problem with this movie is that its too small and gets u really hooked.But its OK they are going to make deadpool 2 (they say it after the ending credits) so its OK.I would rate this movie a 9/10.

		<shortDescription>Deadpool shamelessly and beautifully breaks all the rules...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know that guy in the movie theater who you hear laughing at every little thing that happens? I think I might have been that guy today while watching Deadpool. Although I'm a bit of a super hero junkie, I didn't really know much about Deadpool, so I was caught off guard and amused by his behavior... and what is the number one ingredient when it comes to humor? The element of surprise, which this movie had plenty of.I absolutely love Deadpool's shamelessness and quick wit. This movie is refreshingly brave, and it isn't afraid to break the rules or be non-traditional... although the "romance" aspect of the film takes me back to a more traditional Cary Grant style of romantic cinema.In recent years, intimacy between characters has been promptly reached... usually not long after their initial introduction... but back in the day there would be a lengthy battle of wits between the lead male and female character. It was like a method of firm, yet playful flirting. The romance in Deadpool was like a throwback to this kinda thing. It was fairly brief, but it was there... in a unique and twisted way.It's sadly not a method that you're likely to successfully utilize these days. Now days she would get offended, her gay friend would get offended for her, the authorities would be called, and a long series of hateful texts and tweets would ensue... but back in the day people broke each others balls, and it was all in good fun.The original action/choreography that movies continue to deliver never ceases to surprise and entertain me. This is an area that Deadpool solidly delivers on. To see someone get their head sliced off, then kicked in mid-air, knocking out another bad guy... well, ya can't get much better than that! I could probably keep going and going here, but lets just sum up this little review by saying that this is the kind of movie where everything just comes together and works beautifully.I'm eager for sequels, and I'm very pleased with how 20th Century Fox has managed the rich and grand world of X-Men. In fact, I find most of these movies MORE entertaining than the bulk of what Marvel Studios has pumped out.I give Deadpool an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

In terms for problems for this film there are very few, there was some cut content which was in the trailer but not in the finished film but these are just a few jokes and one liners. I would highly recommend this film to anyone as it is a brilliant new laugh out load action film and a true Deadpool comic in a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DEADPOOL is one of those great achievements in movies. It won't win any Oscars. But it will win cash lots of it. And it'll be well remembered as one of the best films of its time because its Fun. Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. His delivery and comedic timing is superb. And he makes it clear. This is not a superhero movie. Deadpool is not a superhero. He's a merc for hire. he's paid to kill people. Itjust so happens that Deapool has a reason to have a conscience. He's got s soft spot for the little guy. Wade Wilson is a Mercenary who is hired out for work killing people. But He finds love with the lovely Vanessa and he feels like his life is now complete. He has love. He also has Cancer in the lungs prostrate and brain. So in order to extend his life he submits to a shady operation designed to cure him. What they want is another weapon. The operation is cruel its inhumane and its designed to create stress to activate Wade's mutant healing powers thanks to a mixture of a serum laced with Wolverine's blood. During this stress Wade becomes disfigured. And he escapes vowing to kill the people who did this to him. He's immortal but in pain. He's also got a grasp on the world few others don't. He can break the fourth wall. And he is literally insane as well. Deadpool's sense of humor tends to move towards the black parts of life. But he is funny. That sick sense of humor is what makes the movie. The story takes a turn for the worst when the thugs kidnap Vanessa and force Deadpool to come to them. With the help of Two of the X-men Deadpool goes into battle determined to kill and maim the bad guys . That's it the story in a nutshell.The Story works because of Reynolds. He is Deadpool he waited ten years to make this movie. And that was time well spent because they made a movie that is one of the best in the superhero/comic book genre. It does not take itself seriously. And avoids the clichés . Deadpool has to be seen on a movie screen to be appreciated. And watch it without kids . This is not a movie for the little ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as subversive as it looked, but thoroughly competent and often enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool, one of the 2016's most hyped movies, follows a mercenary who is subjected to an experiment which turns him into a mutant with superpowers. Sounds like your everyday superhero movie, right? Well, no. As the rather brilliant marketing campaign never stopped repeating, this is not your average superhero movie. Swearing, sex, gore, adult humour and meta jokes add up to a very unique superhero movie which is not for kids. Deadpool is a victim of its overhyping, but it's a good time and at least a bit different from the usual superhero movies. It does have quite a few problems though. In many ways, the plot is generic and while some clichés are mocked, not all of them are. At times the film is too dark. At times the film- and the central character- are unbearably smug and insufferable. Many scenes just feel like the film trying to be as R rated as possible, and the adult nature of the film starts feeling like a gimmick as a result. Not all of the jokes hit, although quite a lot do, and it's pretty entertaining. It's not as different and unique as it looked, but it's still subversive and entertaining much of the time. It is funny, occasionally hilarious, the performances are strong and the visuals are very clever. Possibly the most subversive thing of all is that the romance actually works for once. It's probably not going to age too well and I think people will realize it's not deserving of it's ludicrously high placement on IMDb Top 250 on repeat viewings, but it's a decent enough movie with some very good lines.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good movie. I was really tired of bad superheroes, bad plot, ridiculous scenes which exaggerate the comedy in an awful way (the new Spiderman saga, Thor 2, Iron Man 3, Avengers, the last movie of the Fantastic 4 - no matter if Kate Mara is Sue, etc.). But this time, was a big surprise for me.Fortunately for us, this time a suitable version of a "relatively good" Deadpool (or at least no a really deranged one) was chosen for the big screen, and creates a credible superhero, with very human and understandable motivations. And most important, this is a superhero which is not an idiot who thinks that bad guys deserve a second chance. That is what you really like in a movie like this. A real hero (even when sometimes is not really super).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short Cuts: "Deadpool"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Short Version: Deadpool is a fun little gift to the fans, a strong comedy on its own, and just an all around blast to those who love things reminiscent of a live action cartoon. If you want to see something like this, even if you aren't a big fan of Deadpool or his humor, you'll still be quite satisfied.I don't really want to make this a full on "Review", since doing so would spoil chunks of the movie. However, I will say that the movie is a very abnormal enigma. It's pretty much a live action cartoon with gracious violence, and yet also plays with other genres(Usually taking huge shifts in tone, like at the Weapon X building. You'll know when you see it)I wouldn't recommend taking your young children to see this, because the adult stuff in here is reeeeaaaaly out there. However it does shift to a long cut of scenes involving such explicit content. However, if you want to see a comic book movie with a lot more of an edge, then I couldn't find a better film that came out as of late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not your family superhero movie. Don't be taking your mom and dad--or kids--to go see this. It's perhaps the uninhibited superhero film we've been waiting for, if you're into that sorta thing. It's not even really a superhero movie, so much as it's a comedy in a leotard.Ryan Reynolds plays the title character, Wade Wilson (aka Deadpool), a mercenary who undergoes a special procedure to help cure him of his terminal cancer. This ends up giving him special powers of self-healing, but also makes him look like a freak--hence the mask. Meanwhile, he's afraid to see the love of his life, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), because of what she might think of his new face.The film plays around with the timeline a bit, jumping back and forth between post-superpower Wade and everyday guy Wade--most likely to avoid any boredom or anxiety built up by superhero origins.At it's best, it's very very funny. Reynolds' timing is excellent as the snarky, insouciant rascal. From the beginning, the jokes are rapid-fire. It looks as though we're in for a Guardians of the Galaxy or Ant-Man type of film. But this goes way beyond that. It breaks the fourth wall about a dozen times, and occasionally has the star self-deprecating himself. At one point, Reynolds makes a quip about the film not having a big enough budget to feature any other X-Men characters. The comedy can eventually get tiring for some. Not so much tiring, actually, just numbing. But luckily, the jokes come fewer and far between at about that point in the movie. Then we get the big action sequences and all that.Deadpool is definitely something new in this world of belabored superhero films, and that's probably the most refreshing part about the movie. It never takes itself too seriously.It doesn't give us some ridiculous villain who unstoppably giving a shot at world domination. Instead, Deadpool spends much of the film just trying to hunt down the man who turned him into a freak, killing anyone standing in his way--which is made to be funny until we realize there's no real reason for any of these people to die. In fact, maybe Deadpool is the villain after all.But if looked at as a superhero action film, it will evoke distaste in many. However, if you see it as a comedy, then it all makes more sense and you can sit back and enjoy it.It toys with this whole "beauty is only skin deep" theme, but never really capitalizes on its impact. Instead, the film cares more about its irreverence. If this movie were to be amazing, it would have found a perfect balance between heart and gall. But honestly, I don't even think it tried to.Twizard Rating: 83</fullReview>

Yes, we have seen cooler superheroes, better effects, more intense fight scenes and mind blowing CGI, but none of it succeeds to be as memorable as Deadpool's hilarious screenplay and Ryan Reynolds.Reynolds is the most perfect casting not only in Marvel films but many many others I've seen in last of couple year. He steals every scene, where he talks, moves or gets naked.The movie makers know that Deadpool is no Captain America or any similar franchise hero, but also they realize that even anitheroes can excite people. Consequently, Deadpool never takes itself seriously and it jokes the sh*t out of everything. Sometimes it may seem to be 'politically incorrect', too R rated but trust me, you'll never stop enjoying it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been said of "The Howard Stern Show" that it appeals exclusively to the very stupid and the very smart. The same could be said of "Deadpool," albeit with a narrower spectrum, trimmed at the latter end. Deadpool is unique among his superhero brethren, in that he's quite aware of his status as a fictional character--there's an existential crisis in that sentence somewhere. He is constantly playing to the audience, whether it be moving the camera to save his viewers from witnessing the coming violence, or shamelessly mocking his own genre--Hugh Jackman jokes aplenty; digs at the lack of financial support from Fox. As a character, Deadpool strips away all the respect and pretension that his compatriots have worked so long to receive.Unfortunately, Deadpool's impish presence doesn't bleed over into the narrative itself, which is the usual superhero fare of initially horrid transformations, lost lovers and the sweet revenge that caps it all off. While these steps are taken with an abnormal--but welcome-- amount of sardonicism and waggishness, it wasn't enough to grab my interest--merely tapping it on the shoulder and inquiring whether or not it's free for the next couple of hours, to which my interest declines, having been burned before. However, the disjointed structure of the film works in its favor, turning the dull bits into fleeting detours. In other words, anytime Wade Wilson isn't in the suit, the movie suffers.As far as the comedy goes, I respected the air of contempt more than the jokes themselves, which, more often than not, are foul balls. And Deadpool's "creative 15-year-old who doesn't apply himself" vocabulary becomes grating over time. There are a few winners however:--Deadpool informs a blind woman that 150 kilos of cocaine are buried somewhere in her house, as well as the cure to blindness.--When Colossus is going to take Deadpool to Professor Xavier and Deadpool replies: "McAvoy or Stewart?"--The black knight scene--a tried and true gag.--The baby hand. The broadly talentless Ryan Reynolds--Deadpool said it, not me-- needs to hold on to this character like his career depends on it, because it does. Just as Downey Jr. has realized--failing financially and critically in anything where he doesn't where an iron suit--Reynolds needs Deadpool more than Deadpool needs him.I'm looking forward to the sequel, in which Deadpool fights his greatest foil, Kirk Douglas.</fullReview>

Despite being a "SUPERHERO" flick, this one's crass, non family-friendly, gruesome/graphic &amp; relentless. But, thats its trump card. Its a trend-setter, in many ways!'Deadpool' Synopsis: A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool.'Deadpool' is a knockout. I loved Ant-Man &amp; 'Deadpool' is equally engaging on all Marvel levels. The pace is Crisp, the Action-Sequences are Spectacular &amp; the Protagonist is to die for. Played Magnficently by Ryan Reynolds, he as Wade Wilson/Deadpool, is wickedly fun &amp; addictive. His unassuming charm, his crass language, his manic personality &amp; his fighting-chops, all hold tremendous appeal. He's so unlike a regular Superhero &amp; yet he's a Hero. Thats where 'Deadpool' scores enormously, its different &amp; unabashed in its approach.Paul Wernick &amp; Rhett Reese's Screenplay moves a brisk pace &amp; offers enough scope for crazy humour &amp; brilliant action. The Writing is tight all through. Tim Miller's Direction is top-notch. He has handled he film with command. Ken Seng's Cinematography is perfect. Julian Clarke's Editing is razor-sharp. Make-Up merits a special mention. Art &amp; Costume Design are terrific. Graphics are WOW! Tom Holkenborg's Score is decent.Performance-Wise: Reynolds is a complete scene-stealer. He nails each &amp; every punch of Deadpool, displaying tremendous flair for comedy &amp; great intensity while breaking into a fight. Its a career-making performance &amp; we finally, can move over Green Lantern. Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle, is perfect as the hero's lady-love. T.J. Miller as Weasel, is funny. Ed Skrein as Francis Freema /Ajax, is a super villain &amp; scores in the action bits. Gina Carano as Angel Dust, is sexy. Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead &amp; Stefan Kapi&#x10d;i&#x107; as Peter Rasputi/Colossus (motion-capture), are just right.On the whole, 'Deadpool' is a B-L-O-C-K-B-U-S-T-E-R! There's no stopping this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pros: Morena Baccarin is hot hot hot.great video tricks. very well set car and motorcycle chase, almost like in the matrix. good martial arts moves although not realistic. great sound effects. great slow motion.good flashback-N-forth.actors are talented enough. Cons:movie promotes gay superhero. This movie is dedicated to promote the idea that even superhero can be gay. story is weak and includes a lot of unnecessary scenes perhaps just to add more minutes as many scenes just to fill time and won't make a difference if deleted from the movie. Hetro audience will hate this movie because it is gay gay gay. A bollywood actor was shoved in the movie seemingly for no reason unless he was a producer or partner. Final Word:Do not waste your time; it is not worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love science fiction movies already. And this movie is very funny.Wit and sense of humor was a good movie. Single bad side open There were scenes. This film will be followed mostly children "superhero "for that film and it will be a bad example. The film came to me a short time, had a longer time, it would be nice. And there's something I wondered. Producers would be nice if the explanation; Does this film will be more X-man? Or did join the team avengers? Did or will be second? I have a problem. Why i can not write Turkish comments. I don't know. Do you read my writing. I have my superhero story (scenario). I want to make movies, but I have no money. Anyway. No one cares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Deadpool Film, Decent Superhero Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Fox screwed up the beloved Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, fans wanted the character done justice, the right way. And, in 2016, Fox delivered. Deadpool is a fun superhero movie that tries hard not to be a "conventional" superhero movie. Does it succeed? Somewhat.Why I felt the film was fun and decent, but not great, was that it focused so much on being an R-rated superhero comedy movie that it fell short on being a really good superhero comedy movie (See my other ratings on the Marvel and DC films). Deadpool satirizes the PG-13 conventional superhero film that has not-too-violent action sequences, minimal swearing, and little to no nudity and basically overloads on everything that can possibly make the movie R-rated. The plot was minimal at best and doesn't expand on the X-Men Universe or storyline, because the film wanted to focus on Deadpool and his R-rated antics. The film has its emotional moments, but the comedic gist of this film overshadows everything and makes those moments a bit harder to soak in and absorb than any other superhero movie would.The comedy for me was hit and miss. There were sequences and meta-jokes (that broke the fourth wall) that I thought were hilarious and perfectly written and delivered; they were jokes that would please any fan who would speculate and imagine the perfect Deadpool movie. There were also sequences that fell rather dull; sometimes jokes were funny, but not THAT funny. It depends on your sense of humor of course; if you love X-Men and dirty, raunchy humor, you'll LOVE this movie. If raunchy humor isn't for you, you'll still find the movie funny. The comedy writing seems to cover all sorts of genres when it comes to humor, and, as a result, can fall flat at certain times while hit well at others.Fans of Deadpool will probably love this movie. Fans of superhero films might love it, but might also feel like something is missing with the writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool is for anyone who loves a hilarious R-rated action superhero film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Previously, Ryan Reynolds had portrayed Green Lantern, which I remember enjoying but I later found out others had not. Knowing that, I have to say that me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed him here as Deadpool, a wisecracking costumed hero from Marvel Comics who swears, kills, and is mainly after the guy who did something bad to him. He also has a fine-looking girl played by Morena Baccarin who seems a perfect match for him. This was quite a funny, action-packed movie we both enjoyed. The beginning credits were really funny and if you're familiar with a certain John Hughes movie, you really shouldn't miss the after credits scene...so that's a high recommendation of Deadpool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool - reviewI have to admit, after watching this movie, I believe I am becoming a little fatigued with these comic-book movies, and or maybe I just wasn't excited enough to see this movie. I've watched all of the advertisements and I've seen all of the trailers. I wasn't anticipating this movie as much as hardcore Deadpool fans. The only reason I paid a ticket to see this comic-book movie is because, almost everybody on the freaking internet has been ranting, raving, and losing their minds over this movie. Seriously, almost everybody on the god "forsaken" internet has been telling me how good and funny this movie is. Here it goes...Positives...1. I laughed two or three times2. The love story was engaging (I admit, I got a little tear eyed)3. The action scenes were well choreographed4. The action scenes were slightly well directed5. Ryan Reynolds nails it as Deadpool6. The final fight scene got my adrenaline pumping7. The guy who played Colossus did a fantastic job (keep him) 8. Gina Carano is HOT! (Personal Note)Negatives...1. I was bored a majority of the runtime up until the end (I almost wanted to go to sleep)2. Action scenes could of been shot better (give me more wide frame shots, hold the camera still, and stop the fast editing)Overall...I didn't really have a major problem with this movie. The truth is... I just don't care about Deadpool. I would watch this movie again if someone wanted to see it for the first time. If Deadpool was on TV I'd watch it. However, I'd never add this movie to my personal collection. Final Grade = B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Former Special Forces operative Wade Wilson(Reynolds, hilarious) is lending his services to those who need it for small fries ? but don't call him a hero. When he learns he has cancer pretty much everywhere, he goes along with an experiment that may bring out his mutant superpowers, if he has any. It leaves him able to heal any injury, while also rather unattractive. He fears his romantic partner Vanessa(Baccarin, sexy, charming) won't want him anymore, and tries to find Ajax(Skrein, easy to hate...in the right way), who was in charge, and who claims he can reverse the effects.A straightforward revenge story, complete with a love interest, leaves this just mainstream enough to satisfy the studio heads, and lets writers Reese and Wernick, as they did with Zombieland, play around with every single other genre trope, subverting our expectations and delivering an enjoyable ride to those just coming in as well as those all too familiar with the comic adaptation. The cool, swift action isn't big enough to compete with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it's the first movie in the X-Men franchise to refuse to add several detailed abilities(leaving it rather bland, with both sides just being "incredibly strong"), and it is very much an origin flick. While there's no teleportation, we do get dual Desert Eagles and Katanas, and there's acrobatics all over the place. And this does justice to the non-stop barrage of pop culture references and irreverence of the Merc with the Mouth. The fourth wall breaks are kept sparse enough to have the most impact.There is a lot of strong language, a moderate amount of brutal bloody disturbing violence, and a little nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone who has a dark, twisted sense of humor. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The comic book movie we have been waiting for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, Deadpool is incredible. This really is the comic book movie we have been waiting for. This film is an incredible adaptation of the ever so popular dirty mouth anti-hero that is Deadpool. And it is not only an incredible adaptation, it is an incredible film. Tim Miller did a fantastic job on this film, and you can really see how much fun they had making it.Ryan Reynolds was born to play this character. His performance was incredible. It was energetic, charismatic and you could tell that he was having the time of his life playing this character. And he really brought this character to life. He played the emotional parts well and his delivery of the jokes was stellar. Every performance in this film was great. There were no weak performances at all, they all delivered their lines perfectly and there was no stale performances, they all worked well as these characters. The CGI was good for the most part. There were times where you could really tell it was CGI. For example the scene where Ed Skrein (Francis) is on top of his base (I guess it's his base) and it looked like a video game. The action scenes for the most part were great. They were fast paced and very violent. People get ripped in half, lose their heads and it was incredibly fun to watch. However in a particular car chase scene the editing was very quick and the scene became very chaotic and it was quite hard to see what was actually happening. But overall it's fantastic.The cinematography was good, nothing special. The best shots were the close ups on Deadpools face whenever he went to say a one liner. And there were some very good slow motion scenes that were very well shot, the camera was still and you could really take in the action. There is practically no shaky cam, therefore allowing us to actually see what the hell is happening.This movie is hilarious. It has a lot of raunchy humor that doesn't go over the top and probably 80% of the time is hilarious. There are also a lot of funny references to other comic book characters and films that were really well done. My personal favourite being when Colossus is pulling him and Deadpool says "Dead or alive, you're coming with me". The humor is both smart and incredibly raunchy. My most clever and funny scene in the whole film would have to be when he is fighting in the car and then says "Have you seen this man?" whilst holding up a picture of himself, as a taunt to the enemies. It was so incredibly well done and Ryan Reynolds delivery of the line was perfect.The fourth wall breaks are also fantastic. Every time he talks to the camera it always has a purpose and isn't just some stupid gimmick. In fact the best fourth wall break is actually the end credit sequence.Speaking of credit sequences. The opening credit sequence was fantastic. Instead of saying "Directed by Tim Miller" it says "Directed by an overpaid (bleep)", at least as far as I can remember it says that. (stupid IMBb, you can't swear) This movie just takes the (bleep), out of everything. And it's great! Oh and also the Stan Lee cameo is great, don't want to spoil it. But it involves naked women.The main story is told in a very cohesive and interesting way. Instead of doing what most comic book movies do, where they tell it in a linear narrative, where it shows the origin at the beginning and then reaches the point where he is a fully fledged hero. This starts of straight into him being a bad-ass, cuts to the origin and then keeps cutting back. And each time it cuts back to bad-ass Deadpool to Wade Wilson there is obviously Deadpool talking to the audience and it's great. But the main story is actually rather interesting. I love his origin story and the love story that the film is basically about, is actually really good. You care for the two of them. It is sometimes cheesy, but that's the point. This is Deadpool we are talking about.So, overall this movie is emotional, heartfelt, funny, fun, clever and overall a really entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK movie, not the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so i went into this movie knowing that it was going to be very immature and dirty, and i left the theater not laughing as much as i wanted to. If you are a person who loves sexual humor (i don't) you will enjoy this movie a lot more then most people. Not going to say that there isn't other type of humor, but it is mostly is sexual. The story was very predictable, there was no big turns or plot changes. In my own opinion i left the theater liking Colossus more then DeadPool. The action in the movie and the special effects and the fight scenes were on point. They were very fun to watch and enjoy and sometimes left you cringing at the amount of gore and blood. So to sum up why i gave it a 6 out of 10, well it gets the 6 points for being good in action scenes and special effects. They seemed very realistic and made a good watch like a super hero movie should be. I did not give the 4 extra points because it was to predictable, the script was cheesy at times, sometimes it lacked a bit of seriousness when there should of been. Also, this is a superhero movie, which means it should of been available for all ages. Now i cant bring this movie home and have my family watch it. I hope in the second one they tone it down. Also if they could make a clean DVD version would be nice. That way children could watch it.</fullReview>

T.J Miller plays a brilliant supporting role.The direction, screenplay and CGI are all great but the one thing that I want to give a special mention to is the "Script writing". It is Fantastic!! It is difficult to gauge humor in words, you have to experience it for yourself to understand what I mean.Overall a 9/10 for me.

		<fullReview>For it to be a Ryan Reynolds' "love project" of sorts it's an incredibly well- accomplished movie. The reason I removed one star is because the way the movie is narrated detracted to me from pushing the story forward.The story is told in a flashback fashion and though sometimes it works, I found myself anxious to get back to what was currently happening instead of getting the back story. It's not like it wasn't interesting, fun or important, it's just that I would much rather figure out where everything was headed.Also, there's 2 after-credits scenes so remember to stay!</fullReview>

Man from start to finish was funny as ****. Laughing my *** off from beginning to end and **** even the possible preview at the very it about the 2nd....ROFLMAO the whole time..***SPOILERS*** {{Below}} So now i am gonna break down each part of the movie...Opening credits already breaking the forth wall and funny as ****. Whole place was rolling at the whole thing. The scene on the bridge with the SUVs and Poolie and the only having 12 shots you just know going in that **** is gonna go down... I was not disappointed in the teasing that there would be hardcore Rated R action. Head shots people going splat limbs and even a shot in the *** quiet literally all was just what you might think dead pool would have to be and it lived up to it and more. Ryan (Deadpool) was definitely the only person that could have pulled off such a hilariously bad-*** "Merc with a mouth". The back story with his woman was pretty awesome hardcore everything. But honestly the scene with Stan Lee in the strip club was great had me in stitches...Basically in conclusion I will say this again #DeadpoolForPresident!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply enjoy this movie for what it is. And it is a gamechanger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After months of all kinds of trailers, posters and tireless social media promotion, Deadpool is finally in the cinemas. To be completely honest it is everything it promises to be. What was obvious at a first glance is that this movie is different from usual superhero stuff we see almost every month. in fact,this movie should not be called a superhero movie,nor antihero movie. Why so? Deadpool (aka Wade Wilson),famously proclaimed as the Merc With The Mouth, is actually a really cool guy in a red suit. His role is not saving the world (or city) from an alien threat. He is a man on a mission but one that is more about himself than benefiting society. But as we all know it his most noticeable feature is his wit and there are tons of that throughout 105 minutes.Giving 9/10 is giving this movie a considerable weight and I was inclined to give it 8. Why didn't I? Because I simply enjoyed the movie,had many laughs and loved action scenes (which were kinda pretentious and over-pumped,but who really cares). As far as I am concerned that is mission accomplished.This movie definitely could have had more use of its plot. It is decent at its best and comparable to many other Marvel movies. As you can now guess the villain (played by Ed Skrein) is not that interesting and magnetic and gets completely overshadowed by somewhat egoistic main character. Those are some serious drawbacks but they are sacrificed for the best thing about this movie. It is bringing freshness to a bit mundane superhero world. Now,you don't really watch what he is doing next but how he is doing it. For once you get not only to love a titular character but you are ready to let him entertain you for an hour and a half.So is this is just an action comedy? You can put it that way,but it is difficult to really define it. This movie simply exists in its own universe,and it does it so effortlessly. And it deserves a massive applause for that</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is back after X-Men Origens: Wolverine, and hopefully we all forgot about that mess. This movie blew me away! Thankfully this film is here and it was awesome. Ryan Reynolds nailed the character of Wade Wilson so well and was hysterical throughout. The opening credits were so unexpected but hilarious. This movie recognizes its place in today's film industry and plays along with it throughout with so many references to modern culture. The thing I really liked about Deadpool was how original its film making ideas were and how it was just such a totally different comic book movie in general.The action is bloody but done in a perfect way to complement Deadpool's humor. About that humor, I was laughing my butt off almost throughout the film. Any scene with Deadpool and Colossus was hilarious. The revenge story and the love story present in the film were presented in a great way with both being extremely funny. It is also very, extremely vulgar, so be ready for it. The only legitimate problem I have with Deadpool was that some scenes are a bit too gratuitous when they honestly didn't have to be. Ed Skrein is fine as the villain but he definitely could have been more menacing.If you didn't like the movie, that's completely fine but be able to justify that with good reason. I've read a few reviews hating on Deadpool claiming the film is "too violent" or "not appropriate for my kids." Honestly, what were those people thinking when they went in? It was clearly labeled "R" and what did they expect from the movie after watching any of the trailers? Apparently they thought this is a perfect family superhero film just because it features a Marvel character. And then they call people who liked the movie stupid...Overall, this is a completely self-aware film that knows exactly what it is and what it needs to do to be a really fun action movie and it does it extremely well. Deadpool gets an A-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Deadpool.As the name might suggest won't be your typical marvel movie, and going by trailers and any kind of background reading of the comics won't be the ideal movie for Nanas who hate swearing, sex and violence. This movie is the perfect first movie for Deadpool which stays true to the comics. Simple plot line as it is simply an origins story. Origin stories are meant to be simple and predictable because everyone knows how it ends as the person becomes the embodiment of the comic book character.Ryan Reynolds nails it. Mostly because he is so similar to the comic book character that it's scary. His line deliveries are just right for Deadpool and the reason is because most of the main jokes were improvised (something Ryan and TJ are very good at).It's violent, it's crass, sexual and wrong. Exactly as it is in the comics, and pretty much what the trailers suggested (beyond the funny love story trailer, which probably caught the 1 star reviewers hook line and sinker!)If you like deadpool comics, watch it. If you like the crass Ryan Reynolds of past (van wilder/blade 2), watch it.Otherwise don't bother going just so you can affirm you wouldn't like it in the first place.(Insert sarcastic rant here) I give titanic 1/10 because it was too lovey dovey and there wasn't enough superpowers, gore and crass humour. "But Adam, none of that was showed in the trailer, in fact, the opposite was shown in the trailer. Why would you expect anything other than what was advertised with the trailer and rating?" Oh yeah... Right. That's how you get a feel for what a movie will he. Silly me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be damned! A superhero movie that was different. I'll drink to that!I was reluctant to go see this, as I'm not a fan of superheroes anything, but I was also curious to see what all the fuss was about. Here come the opening credits... And they are like nothing I've seen before. Best opening credits ever! Had it not been for the excellent script, and wonderful directing, Deadpool would have been your run of the mill, formulaic superhero movie. The deadpan and tongue in cheek humour, the unexpected references and the rhythm make Deadpool stand out. Reynolds does a great job delivering the lines, at times it's so fast, your head is spinning. In a good way! :-) The soundtrack was spot on!I personally didn't have any issues with the language, or the nudity. I see people comment that it's violent. They're probably watching and loving Game of Thrones... It didn't bother me.This is definitely not for kids! But hey, I for one am happy that Hollywood dared make a movie that was a bit smarter, and I loved that it didn't take itself so seriously.Deadpool was so unexpected, so irreverent, so funny, I couldn't help but love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadpool arrives on the big screen! Again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most fans would rather forget the character's first film appearance, but it was that appearance that did lead to this film. So while the character did not really get fleshed out all that much at the beginning of X-men Origins: Wolverine nor was he portrayed correctly at the end, the end result is one of the funniest movies I have seen at the theaters in many years. Truth be told though, I am not really big on comedies for the most part. Still, this film was a great spectacle to behold and it is nice seeing Ryan Reynold's film really take off. Not only because I always enjoy seeing him in films, but also because he made a comic book movie the right way, something Hollywood seems to scared to do. He made a comic book film where the character acts like he does in the comic, looks like he does in the comic and it has not been made for the general audience. No, we get Deadpool in all his crazed glory, doing what he does best...killing! When he is not killing, he is constantly breaking the fourth wall as Deadpool knows he is a comic book character and Reynold's portrays the crazed 'hero' with magnificent glee! The story, well that is simple. Deadpool wants to kill someone! Why? Well, through a series of flashbacks we learn of the way the merc with a mouth has become the way he is and a love that is lost to him. To not only fix his deformed face, but to also get revenge he must find a guy named Ajax, who is actually named Francis. Deadpool will get help in the form of the mighty Colossus and his teenage protégé. He also has allies in a man who runs a bar that deals with problems, a cab driver who does not seem to mind getting paid in high fives and a blind roommate who enjoys cocaine. Yes, all the typical things one tends to find in comic book movies...not! Did I mention boobs? Yep, they're in there too! So Deadpool must go find the ones who wronged him and do some slicing and dicing too! I am very happy with the film's success; unfortunately, I do believe that Hollywood will get the wrong idea by the results. They are going to just assume that making every comic book film with a slightly edgy character should contain gratuitous violence and nudity and all that when the real reason the film is doing well is the fact it was made for those of us who enjoy reading comics. Too often they soften up a character and completely change things to suit a wider audience, but this film proves that is not necessary. The characters have been portrayed a certain way and I find it insulting when those of us who read comics get dismissed and things added to other comic book films to attract say more female viewers. Seriously, did having Bruce Banner and the Black Widow have a thing really work? Never happened in the comics and this is just one example in one of the more recent comic book movies. Just look at Colossus in this movie. He finally has a Russian accent and he has a better fight scene here than he did in any of the X-men movies. This movie proves you can do things by the book and the film will do good, but the lesson they will learn is just to make everything R.So, I enjoyed this film immensely. Had it opened last year it would have trailed only Mad Max: Fury Road as my favorite film of 2015. My only problems with the film are the fact I thought they showed a bit too much back story in how he became who he was as the film did have a bit of a romantic subplot going itself. Still, in the end it was about shooting and killing and learning that if you are going to be killing and bleeding a lot to make your costume red. This film took awhile to finally get off the ground and I am glad Ryan Reynolds did not give up as he made a very funny comic book film on a rather small budget by today's standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel has earned the right to take some chances when it comes to it's cinematic universe, and while Deadpool does not fall into that just being able to put a marvel logo in front of your movie goes a long way. Deadpool is more related to the X-Men universe, a universe that seems less fit for the merc with a mouth but none the less it is where his story resides. Deadpool brings some adult comic relief to comic book movies that is not necessarily the first of its kind, but definitely the first to take it this far.First the good things, right off the bat I will mention that this movie has earned its R rating which for a Deadpool movie is almost necessarily a must. This was the right choice for so many reasons namely the violence and the dirty words laden through this movie. It's nice to see what may actually happen to an unlucky civilian if they were toy get into the crossfire with one of these superheros. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for this role and we all knew it since X-Men Origins. His comedic style fits the role perfectly and it's always nice when an actor really throws himself fully behind a character the way Reynolds has done here. The story is surprisingly well paces mixing back story with action sequences in a creative way. Unlike most if not all other comic book movies the humor in Deadpool has no cheese ball factor. Not every joke is a home run but most of it fits the characters. Another problem comic book movies have is too much back story/personal stories interfering with the main plot of the story. They may add some light to these characters but ultimately bog down these movies. Deadpool pays its service and gives him a reason to go on his quest, without spending more time than needed.I do have some problems with the movie, none of which ruin the movie, but if some were not there it would have been a much better movie. While Ryan Reynolds is perfect in his role, I thought he was almost underutilized. The character was without a doubt written with him in mind, but I think the writers tried too hard to make the Deadpool fit Ryan Reynolds rather than letting him fit into Deadpool. The movie also sort of teases us at the beginning. The opening is so different than anything in any comic book movie to date and gives hope that not only will the comic book movie genre get lampooned a bit, but also that Deadpool will be different than all of these movies. As the movie goes on though that seems to fall away and we almost get left with a basic comic book movie plot in the end. This genre has been so flooded in the last few years, it can feel like I am watching the same story unfold over and over again and I had hopes that Deadpool would avoid this structure.Overall Deadpool is a great deal of fun for anyone who is a fan of the genre but has been getting bored with the same 7 characters being re booted and re made. Deadpool took some of what Guardians of the Galaxy had going for it, new characters, solid well thought out comedy and a sheer passion to make the movie happen. You can tell that even while there seems to have been some slight interference from the studio, Deadpool seems to be almost a passion project for some people involved and that always shows through. A truly enjoyable movie for any comic book fan of legal age that is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay? I don't know where to start? there were times where I liked it and times where I didn't like it all. I feel like it had more potential. first of all too many dirty joke. and I like dirty jokes but this was just too much.. I felt like I watched a teenage boy trapped in a grown mans body? and he had just discovered the words: D***, penis, fart, masturbate and F***. AND I don't know? the whole "be a bad ass douche and you'll get your D** wet".. I don't feel like that sends out the right message to young guys.. I don't know?? One thing I liked a lot though was that they opened up/broke the fourth wall. (if you don't know what that is look it up it) Overall it was pretty entertaining and a lot of raw action, but you have to see it for what it really is "FANTASY, MARVEL, Fiction". Oh, and there are better films to take your girlfriend, this is more of a "chilling with the mates" kind of film. Words to help describe this film: cancer, revenge, D***, fart, mansion, self touching. I give it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that perhaps my age may be a factor in my enjoyment (or lack thereof) of this movie. The last Marvel movies to be R rated were the Blade series. It was clear that they were R rated due to the content (vampires and killing). I thought "Deadpool" would be along the same lines; an R rating for excessive blood, maybe gore, or maybe one too many F bombs. Well, "Deadpool" milked their R rating for all it was worth: plenty of profanity, nudity, sex and even a masturbation scene. That wasn't what I was expecting.Deadpool to me, in the lore of the Marvel Universe, is in the periphery. He was always a character I knew existed but never took the time to delve into his comics. "Deadpool" the movie was going to be my first full introduction. If first impressions last the longest, this one is going to stink.Deadpool is funny, in a crude, sophomoric kinda way. Anyone who's seen Ryan Reynolds in anything knows that he can talk a mile a minute and can be quite the laugh. Well, imagine Ryan Reynolds with no limitations. A lot of the humor was missed because A.) Ryan Reynolds talks too fast, B.) he made references to things obscure to you (or me in this case) or C.) it just fell flat. I expected humor and got it in spades plus some stuff I didn't care for. I expected some nice effects and fight scenes and also got that. The fight and gun play scenes were astounding which left me wanting more of it and less of the other stuff.This was the comic book movie for adults-- (which is weird because so many kids were in the theater. I don't think parents know what R rating means anymore) and not all adults. I think the movie could have been better with less profanity, less nudity and fewer sexual references. When I say sexual references I'm not talking subtle innuendos, I'm talking in-your-face crass sexual humor. Tone that all down an it is a lot better movie.</fullReview>

On the plus side, if you happen to be a 12 or 13 year old boy then there may well be some hysterical moments in this latest Marvel.This should have been sold off to Netflix as yet another dreary exclusive. Sure it'll do the rounds and make money at the box office but it really amounts to another nail in an already fairly well-sealed coffin.I'd spend time going through why its so bad but really you'll all see it and make up your own mind.

		<fullReview>Really I would have votes twice higher if this wasn't an adult oriented movie. The f** swearing is too much, and the violence (although there aren't many scenes) is brutal. This is no film for kids, obviously but what is disappointing is that it could have been a cool funny movie.Because it mixes crude violence with humor, it seems like some creep/weird movie.The good side is that it's well composed and well focused on the main hero while not retaining 'clichés' or annoying lengthy parts.If they do a second one I hope they will give up violence and language and give us a nice humorous flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly scripted, horribly directed....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a Deadpool fan who enjoyed reading the Joe Kelly run of Deadpool comics and I knew right off that this was going to be one of those "leave your brain at the entrance" stupid-type brainless movies. I don't mind such movies as long as they are enjoyable enough, but this movie's stupidity level is so high, I couldn't bring myself to enjoy it much. The script is so horrible I stopped listening at various points throughout the movie because I couldn't stand how stupid some of the lines are. Here are some examples "You don't have to be a superhero to get the girl, you just need the girl to bring the hero out in you." My reaction: Geez, Mr. Pool. You sound like a 13 year old hardcore superhero comic book collecting nerd who thinks superheroes are the be all, end all and have just noticed girls for the first time in your life."Did I say that this is a love story? I did, huh? Well, it's not. It's a horror movie." And I'm like, Wow , you just reminded me of my 6 year old niece who couldn't decide what the creature in her drawing was, if it is a cat or a mouse.Some of you may say that is Deadpool's character, he is crazy and stupid, but not this stupid and no, his best characterizations doesn't contain the immaturity that is so on display in this movie. Also, in this movie, I don't really find him witty at all, and witty is part of Deadpool's character.Ryan Reynolds does fit the role of Deadpool well enough, but he didn't do a very good job of it. This is due to the horrible script, horrible direction, as such, I don't really blame him. Like when he gets angry and kicks the door and says "f**k" several times. You don't feel any of his anger at all, he's more like a one of those pukes who says "f**k" all the time and who's not really angry and is just throwing a fake tantrum to seek attention.I hate that this movie does such a hard job of trying to constantly reminding you that this is a superhero movie, what with the green lantern, wolverine/hugh jackman, x-men jokes, even worse, bringing in two x-men characters who fight with their flashy costumes (complete with prominent 'X' logo) and and their flashy CG super powers. If I want to watch a flashy superhero movie or movie with x- men characters, I'll watch a flashy superhero movie or X-men movie.And I hate the superhero origin story (AGAIN!!!!). This one is done in media res, you see Deadpool in a big action scene first and then flashback back to his origin. I've seen almost every single superhero movie and this might be the first time (or few times) it's done this way. I can imagine the script meeting going something like this: "No, we must have a superhero origin story. MUST. It's gonna flop if it don't. I know it's in a million other superhero movies, people are sick of them, but still... So do any of you bright folks have any ideas?" "I do." "Yes?" "How about we do it in media res?" "Wow, genius!! Freaking genius! Let's do it." Well, I hated it, and couldn't wait for the boringly executed origin story to be over and get back to the action scene that we were in the middle of before. This movie gave me such a huge case of superhero fatigue that I finally completely understood what Emma Thompson said when she said she loves Spider-Man and all, but she was gonna shoot herself or something if she sees another Spider- Man movie. Of all the superhero movies to make me feel this way, it just had to be Deadpool.The best part of this movie is related to a superhero joke though, about the ridiculous "rule" that superheroes can never ever kill, no matter what. I find this "rule" so inane and cannot believe it when fans actually really flip out when this "rule" is broken (cough*man of steel*cough). It's almost as bad as when playstation and xbox fans troll each other...I wish I could erase my memory of this Deadpool movie to get rid of superhero movie fatigue because Batman V Superman is coming up next and no matter how good that is, I going to be reminded of it and feel it. Sighs...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is Awesome :DThe storytelling here is creative by chucking us into an action scene then cuts back and forth in excellent and surprising ways to tell the story of this crazy but oddly likable antihero. Usually flashbacks and fast-forwards can get tiresome, but then they're done right, they can help make a simple story feel new and thrilling. When it comes to the action, Deadpool having only a few action scenes does indicate it's small budget, but seeing fights kept as thin as they are here is refreshing, even if it isn't settled by a unsubtle joke modifying their scarcity, but we're not left hanging: the action is short, quick, ultra-gory and violent and extremely stylish with the opening scene and the final fight between Deadpool and Ajax being the highlights for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As the legend goes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the big guys and gals of superhero legend slowly wind down their cinematic reign, more obscure characters are now being tested for multiplex domination. "Deadpool," which, according to the film, takes place in the "X-Men" universe, is perhaps the most daring comic book adaptation yet, with the red-suited antihero a troubling figure of cynicism, sarcasm, and murder, with his journey very different from the troubled but noble titans audiences are used to. Instead of soberly working through yet another origin story, "Deadpool" looks to spice up the norm with a freewheeling sense of humour and loads of R-rated mischief, separating itself from the pack. And it's a successful experiment, jazzing up the genre with a blast of unexpected energy from an unlikely source. A mercenary with a military background, Wade (Ryan Reynolds) makes his living doing odd jobs for people in need, reporting back to his only friend, and Sister Margaret's Bar employee, Weasel (T.J. Miller). Falling in love with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), Wade finds a true connection in his lonely world, making big plans for the future. However, a late-stage cancer diagnosis cuts the party short, putting him in a difficult position of commitment. Leaving Vanessa, Wade signs up with a shadow group dedicated to human experimentation, with Ajax (Ed Skrein) and Angel Dust (Gina Carano) put in charge of the new recruit's mutant evolution. When Wade is betrayed and fried by Ajax, he begins to plan his ultimate revenge, testing out new self-healing abilities as he works his way up the criminal ladder, followed closely by X-Men members Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), who want the new crime-fighter, rechristened Deadpool, to consider a life of heroism. Deadpool isn't an honourable guy, joining the ranks of comic book characters with less than savoury attributes, graduating to a visual medium that always has trouble with shades of gray when it comes to costumed heroes. However, instead of another sullen war machine in the vein of The Punisher, Deadpool is largely known for his irreverent sense of humor -- as quick with a one-liner as he is with a weapon. This shift in tone benefits "Deadpool" tremendously, especially after Wade's last screen appearance, in 2009's "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," treated the goofy brute as a mad science project, scraping off his personality and gluing his lips shut. "Deadpool" rights the big wrong, returning the mercenary to his roots of ultraviolence and pop culture references, giving Reynolds another shot to portray the specialized hunter as he was meant to be played, giving fans of the comic series (which debuted in 1991) an adaptation they deserve. Despite a substantial amount of CGI utilized to bring Deadpool and his balletic moves to life, Reynolds is the true visual effect of the movie, gamely going wherever director Tim Miller leads. The character is an improvisational machine, with a stream-of- consciousness delivery that's second-nature to the star, who gives Deadpool an impish wit to go along with devastating finishing moves (the picture earns its restricted rating -- it's no family film). He's also a sight in red leather and as Wade, who's covered head-to- toe in horrible scarring, keeping him away from Vanessa. It's an exceptional performance, and while "Deadpool" isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is, select moments are executed perfectly, with Wade/Deadpool breaking the fourth wall (even messing with the camera), referencing his own tattered screen history (and Reynolds's People Magazine covers), and habitually messing with everyone, including roommate Blind Al (Leslie Uggam), an elderly women who shares a fetish for IKEA products. While there's an agreeable supporting cast, the effort belongs to Reynolds, who's a perfect fit for the material, making Deadpool not only palatable (no small feat), but a real candidate for an ongoing franchise that may one day collide with the "X-Men" all-stars. Miller (making his directorial debut), does a fine job with expansiveness and storytelling, making "Deadpool" feel big as it jumps around in time, interrupting an opening freeway showdown with flashbacks to Wade's once semi-peaceful life with Vanessa. It's an anarchic movie, but there's something resembling an emotional core with Wade's state of shock over his death sentence, giving the film a touch of sensitivity to go along with all the sliced limbs, self- referential jokes (one punchline features Deadpool questioning which Professor X he'd possibly meet: Patrick Stewart or James McAvoy), and sexual humor. There's a precise atmosphere of rascally behavior presented here, and Miller gets it mostly right, pulling off an impressive helming job that keeps "Deadpool" lively and fierce. "Deadpool" goes for the big-bang-boom finale, ordering up a showdown of mutant powers, an accidentally exposed breast, and some medium- scale heroics. It carries on for longer than it needs to, but bloat doesn't keep the picture from becoming pure entertainment, always pushing Reynolds in verbal diarrhea mode, with Deadpool's "maximum effort" often devoted to making fun of Ajax's real name. The movie remains down and dirty to the end, but it's never mean-spirited, riding a fine line between parody and purpose. "Deadpool" made not be known to a wider audience, and he's certainly not a courageous figure, but his debut is one of the better ones in the Marvel universe, adding some needed filth to the superhero routine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds and Co. excel in the bloody, foul-mouthed, and fourth wall breaking "Deadpool": a comic book movie for people who are sick of comic book movies. Even as the opening credits roll, you know you're in for something different. The plot plays out as a typical get revenge/save the girl superhero movie, but the added twist comes from Deadpool himself, who is there the whole time to crack jokes and sneak winks to the audience about how played out and formulaic the plot their following is. Weasel (T. J. Miller) and Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) provide some laughs along the way, but it's Tim Miller's direction and Rhett Reese/Paul Wernick's script that makes the movie whole, not to mention Reynolds' dead-on portrayal of Deadpool that seems like it was ripped straight from the comic's pages.</fullReview>

Dare I say Deadpool actually had a real plot. The movie definitely had me excited once or twice but I personally feel it needed more. The movie trailers definitely ruined a lot of funny parts to the movie but get I've seen worse. I enjoyed seeing colossus in the movie and sonic as well. If I could I would've made Colossus a lot stronger. All in all, it was good, but I feel like the movie needed more. I also wish he had his vanishing move as well that not only would have made the movie more awesome but more accurate as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parody of Superhero Blockbusters Proves Genre Has Jumped the Shark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'm not a comic book guy; I usually avoid comic book movies like the plague (unless they're about Batman, which has been a steady part of my media consumption for a long time). To start off with the negative: the fact that "Deadpool" is a parody of Marvel/DC superhero blockbusters--and is actually successful at parodying the genre--means that the whole "superhero blockbuster" has jumped the shark. Where do you go from "Deadpool", which lampoons the genre down to the last detail? While also paying homage to superhero movies, "Deadpool" mocks the clichés and tropes of the genre so effectively that it is nigh impossible for me to take any action blockbuster superhero movie seriously ever again. We've reached peak- superhero-blockbuster, people; time to follow a new genre of film. Not even Mel Brooks could parody the genre like "Dea"?you get the point of what I'm saying (while also dating myself).That said, I loved the movie?and I rarely like movies. From what I could tell, the "Deadpool" comic was one twisted story, more akin to comical comic books like "Howard the Duck" and "Tank Girl". The Nostalgia Chick said years ago that adapting "Tank Girl" into a movie (which most people didn't like) was like trying to make "Deadpool" into a movie?only this time, the results were excellent. Ryan Reynolds is hilarious as the "merc with a mouth". The film is the definition of a "meta movie". Deadpool is aware that he is in an over-the-top superhero movie, and constantly makes references to people, movies and songs from "the real world". Reality and fiction are melding, people! The movie doesn't just break the fourth wall: Negasonic Teenage Warhead nukes it to oblivion! Deadpool's wisecracks make Spider Man seem like an amateur. In short, the film's an ingenious parody that fans and haters alike of superhero movies should see.I think "Deadpool" may be for action films what "Pulp Fiction" was for films in general: a totally original take on a shopworn genre that could get the public excited about movies as an art form again. That said, "Deadpool" heralds not so much the revival of the superhero blockbuster as its death kneel; again; where do movie makers go from here? I'd call this film the reductio ad absurdum of comic book films if it wasn't a completely self-aware parody.PS: "Deadpool" would be an excellent cartoon on "Adult Swim": the execs of that channel should get together with Marvel/Disney and make it happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all knew coming in that Deadpool (2016) was going to have great action and lots of comedy poking fun at cinematic superhero conventions (as well as popular culture at large), but I was utterly taken aback at just how tender and real the love story at the center of the film turned out to be! While I don't dislike superhero movies, for me they tend to be one or two viewing affairs; I liked The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy but had little desire to re-watch them. However, Deadpool, in addition to being simply hilarious, has emotional depth and heart. Not that every action film needs that quality in abundance, but it was refreshing to see what would otherwise be a half-baked subplot given such attention.It's also nice to see the stakes scaled back. Deadpool is not about saving the world or the universe or existence; everything is much more personal. While most of the film is action-comedy, the second quarter is very dark. It is a credit to the filmmakers that there is next to no mood whiplash there. Everything flows so well. The cast is perfect all around and the script is smart. I'm so glad my comic book fan friend recommended this one.(PS I know it has been said before, but it is so great to see an explicitly pansexual lead. As a bisexual woman, I can tell you it is heartening to find such wonderful non-monosexual representation.)</fullReview>

I was hooked from the beginning credits all the way through to the final credits. What is even more valuable, though, is how it could not have been nearly as masterful if it weren't for the fact that Ryan Reynolds was born for this role. I was pleased to see him be able to shine in a role that displays his true talents and, boy, did it pay off.With the exception of Sam Ramie's Spider-Man or James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy, too many Marvel films attempt to receive easy money by creating a film through an unaltered formula, in which makes them all seem the same. Deadpool, however, manages to stand completely on its own compared to ANY movie ever created mainly due to the fact that the main protagonist is unlike any other you've been introduced to. A word of advice, go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At this point most Marvel and DC fans are expecting a bit of a slow down with the rate of comic book related movies. The studios would probably agree that to keep audiences coming, they have to keep it interesting. This Marvel flick seems to fall into the middle category depending on your interest in the comic book character of Deadpool. Ant-Man had a similar take where it was good, but not as powerful as some of the other Marvel flicks we've seen. Most of the Marvel movies are good at delivering a punch for great fights between characters and short witty lines in the middle of the normal dialog. Deadpool seems like it's an extension of what we got w Andrew Garfield's take on Spiderman, who does more bantering with the villains. If you like bantering comic book characters, this is more for you as opposed to characters like Batman who don't talk all that much when in action. I'm actually glad the studio managed to satisfy the Deadpool fans enough to shatter the February record - for Valentines Day. (That comes off a little weird). Oh, and for the fans that are anywhere from 30 to 40 years old, you will appreciate the end credit scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Actually a 9.5 out of 10, but whatever.) Superhero movie fatigue has begun to set in, and after a while it felt like there would never be a superhero movie that could rejuvenate the genre. Since its announcement in late 2014, along with its brilliant, aggressive marketing campaign all throughout last year and into early 2016, "Deadpool" has finally arrived, and I'll be damned if I don't admit right now that it was well worth the wait. From the opening credits to the end of the film, you are in for a hilarious ride. The jokes are hilarious and well-written, and the comedic timing is on-point. The violence is spectacular, and while it can get pretty gruesome, it is never too over-the-top, to the point of being confused for a Hollywood-produced "snuff film". The acting is also fantastic (give credit to Ryan Reynolds, who slays the role of Wade Wilson/Deadpool). My only gripes are that the villain was generally cookie-cutter (he felt too similar to a MCU villain, who aren't that well-written), and characters such as Negasonic Teenage Warhead are sadly underused. Overall, though, I will go ahead and call Deadpool the best movie of the year so far, and one of the best superhero films of all-time. You'll be doing yourself a favor by watching this movie.</fullReview>

Make no mistake, this is a hard R rated movie, they held NOTHING back! however I'd like to point out that this movie really does have a little bit of everything.you have a comic book hero (or anti-hero really), you have a light seasoning of romance that doesn't feel forced at all, some slice of life and a lot of comedy.They did attempt to throw a moral dilemma in there in the end but by then you'd have taken in the overall atmosphere of the movie and in your head you'd be like "ehhh shut up and shot already!" which to my glee Deadpool did and called the other character on his monologuing!Is the movie perfect? nope, it's perfectly insane! And I loved it, it was a ton of fun and refreshing change from the usual super-hero genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saturday Night Live skit of the superhero archetype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film. You will laugh from the opening credits to the very end, but I think the coolest parts of the film weren't just the jokes but the character himself. Deadpool, AKA Wade Wilson, a rip off of DC's Slade Wilson (Deathstroke) but still a cool, unique character nonetheless--and a tormented character with a lot of baggage. I thought the film actually did the character a disservice because they could have used all that inner torment to make a great revenge story, but instead, we got a bunch of cliché scenes and a really flat villain, a villain whose name I couldn't even remember after leaving the theater and a villain who had as much depth and motive as any typical villain of the week on a superhero TV series.Now, for my biggest gripe. I just hate it when actors talk to the audience throughout the film, or when actors refer to themselves by their real name, like Ryan Reynolds mentioning the name Ryan Reynolds. That just takes me out of the film and tells me that I'm watching something akin to an SNL skit. I am not really a Deadpool reader and so I don't know if they do this in the comic books, but if so, they should stop. Deadpool is a really interesting character, more interesting than the character he was inspired from (Deathstroke) and he should be taken a bit more seriously. Okay, maybe I'm taking this too serious! I love the jokes, but this was overkill. I take my superheroes serious!!!I score this a 7 out of 10. A movie with a score of a 7 or higher means that I will watch this movie again, at least one more time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Deadpool" is the same-old exchangeable Marvel happy-go-lightly formula wrapped into a very naughty, very black-humored, often cynical, violent and sexually loaded package that might appear fresh and shocking at first glance, but, once you've unpacked it, there is not much left than just a slight feeling that you've just seen nothing more than solely a bizarre persiflage of a good superhero-movie and not just that, you also discover that deep down, "Deadpool" is a rather naive story about true love, acceptance and the unwillingness to grow up.The main hero is such a chatterbox that he not only won't shut up even when a bullet pierces him another b***hole, he also speaks directly to us beyond the screen on a kind of meta level: this together with his ability to fully regenerate his body when injured really takes away something that every unforgettable movie should have which is, suspense.Sure, many lines are very funny and worthy to remember and some of the action scenes really kick a**; the somewhat kinky erotic dimension brought in by M. Baccarin, playing a role reminiscent of her iconic appearance in the series "Firefly"; all this combined make the movie entertaining nonetheless, I just wished the plot itself would have been as provocative and crazy as the way it was presented to us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining as hell and explosively raunchy, Deadpool is a very welcome change of style in the genre, bringing to life a movie with many merits and ideas, yet, in my opinion, it is not the breath of fresh air everybody is saying.I'll just skip talking about Ryan Renolds since everybody out there has pretty much already said what there is to say, he is perfect for the role, born for it. What really surprised me about him even more is how much he was willing to make fun of himself. Actually I was surprised overall, by the whole movie, in how many times it went in certain places. I clearly remember saying aloud in the theater, amidst all the laughter, "I can't believe they went there". Some of the references, some of the irreverence, some of the hidden movie quotes, it was definitely the part I loved and that surprisingly, I wanted more of.The movie also shocked me in how much it had heart. They found a way to make a bat-sh*t-crazy love story actually work thanks to the pitch perfect use of comedy for storytelling. The whole setup of it was really strangely charming and absorbing. And it being so good in the first part actually made the second part kind of decline, because other than the final moment which is kind of fun, the love story really looses some steam and is sidelined for a big chunk. I really get why, but I just think that it was a mistake to divide the film into these big storytelling blocks than don't get to mix into each other. It made for some repeatedly poor stakes which made the film really loose the tight rhythm it could have had.The action scenes are a mixed bag here. On on side it is amazing to see some good old R-rated action that also manages to make out of the action some very big laughs and it does this a lot. On the other hand, it is really poorly put together, it is fast cutting and CGI enhanced a little too much. it isn't in no way "Ales Cross" level of crap, it is just a little underwhelming and could have been handled a lot better.The secondary characters also have their ups and downs. On one side they are all integrated into the movie very organically and play their role perfectly both in the story and in their relationship with Deadpool. But sometimes I saw a lot of character being given up to transform them into witty braggers. Yet I am a little exaggerating here, for the most part they all serve a good part of the film and even the villain who isn't the most three dimensional character, to say it cheaply, manages to still emerge. Colossus is a welcome addition to the film and he has multiple moments of his that are really fun.Overall I enjoyed the experience a lot and had a blast with the comedy in the film, still I would have liked all of the other elements to work just as perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solo movie Deadpool has been a long time coming, originally being set to be a spin-off from X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Despite the film being put on hold star Ryan Reynolds and first time director Tim Miller were determined to make Deadpool and after seven years and leaked concept footage we finally got this hyped flick.Wade Wilson (Reynolds) is a bad guy who is paid to go after even worst guys. After meeting a prostitute, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) Wade forms a relationship. But their happiness is shattered when Wade discovers he has cancer and volunteers for an experiment to give him mutant powers. The treatment was a success but disfigures him. Wade sets out to get revenge against that the man who mutated him, Francis (Ed Skrein) and becomes everyone's favourite gun totting, katana wielding, motormouth assassin.The appearance of Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine was a complete distance. Reynolds stole the show in brief appearance as Wade, but when he turned to Deadpool the film reinterpreted to have his mouth sewed shut and blades coming out of his arms. Even the X-Men films before 'Days of Future Past' rewrote continuity ignored 'Origins' by the X-Men films and Deadpool's solo outing is a more faithful adaptation, letting the character wear his famous red costume, being extremely violent and breaks the fourth wall. The primary goal was to please the fans and it manages that effortlessly.Deadpool was a pet project for Reynolds, he wanted to see it made despite a lack of interest from the studio. Deadpool was the perfect character for Reynolds to play, he has the quick wit and delivery while also physically believable as a superhero. Reynolds has notorious bad luck with superheroes, starring in Blade Trinity and Green Lantern, but with Deadpool he finally found the right role for his abilities. As Wade Reynolds was witty with his delivery, whether talking to Vanessa or taking on a foe and as Deadpool he lives up the title of the 'Merc with the Mouth'.Deadpool in the comics is famously aware he is a comic book character and a part his shtick is he forth wall. The film adaptation keeps this and has a blend of self-referential humour, pop-references and crude humour. It could have easily been a disaster since it this was a very difficult type of humour to master, but fortunately the writing, acting and direction gets it right. The film starts off with one of the best title sequences for any film in a long time which makes fun of everyone involved and having some well placed references. Reynolds makes fun of himself and his previous superhero roles and himself and as mentioned constantly has witty lines. There are also plenty of visual gags and Reynolds is not the only funny character in the film, T.J. Miller has some funny exchanges with Reynolds and Brianna Hildebrand was a revelation as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, being a sardonic, snarky teenager who has a very dry delivery.Other actors played their roles more straight, mainly Skerin and Stefan Kapi&#x10d;i&#x107; as the voice of Colossus. Skerin was convincing enough in the action sequences and does toe-to-toe with Deadpool but as a villain on the bland side. It was a shame that Daniel Cudmore did not respire his role as Colossus but Kapi&#x10d;i&#x107;'s version is more loyal to the comics, being a huge Eastern Europe metal man. The film uses Gina Carano to the best of her abilities - by not letting her speak much and lets her fighting do the talking.Tim Miller also shows himself to be a director with potential. He has previous worked as special effects artist, including working as the second unit director on Thor: The Dark World. He keeps a fast pace and he delivers some excellent action sequences. The opening action sequence was an excellent recreation of the leak test footage and the action as a whole was perfectly bloody as Deadpool uses his knives and guns. Tim Miller was bit like Zack Snyder with his approach, being highly stylised as Deadpool uses his guns and swords and jumping up in the air. When Wade escapes from the experiments felt very similar to V's escape in the film adaptation for V for Vendetta. But the risk for Tim Miller is he could end up being the next James McTeigue, have a great debut film and makes nothing good afterwards.Deadpool was made budget of $58 Million, very modest for a big superhero film. Considering Tim Miller's background the CGI work was strong, particularly the motion capture for Colossus. It would have been great to see Colossus to change back and forth from his human to his metal form, but he was kept in his metal form because it must have been cheaper to do so. Deadpool even makes a dig at the film's budget.Though Deadpool is a funny and fun film, being a good example of an action-comedy, it's the story that is let's it down. It's a standard origins story which by itself is fine and the logic is to help distance this version of Deadpool from the last one, particularly since it has the same star. But it brings nothing new to the table and the film is not as subversive as it thinks it is. Films like Kick-Ass, Super and Chronicle are much better deconstructions of the superhero genre.Deadpool does what it sets out to do, please the fans of comics while also being a genuinely funny action/superhero film. It deserves its status as an immediate cult status and there is enough for a more causal audiences to enjoy. An excellent start to the 2016 superhero season.</fullReview>

This is the Deadpool we've been looking for! Seriously, we have never seen anything like this before. Ryan Reynolds dream came true! He also kills it as Deadpool! This movie is so twisted as it's should be. It's insanity, pure insanity. Deadpool has it all, literally. There's action, blood, sex, and a hell of jokes. Like the jokes are constant and it all mostly works. Laugh after laugh after laugh. Easily the funniest movie I've seen in quite sometime.

		<fullReview>It is 0:54 and I just got home for the late session at my local cinema in Spain where today the 19th of February Deadpool has been released. Now, the movie has a beautiful screenplay and acting cannot be more on point, and we haven't even got to puns, pop culture references, other comic book characters references, the fourth wall, OMG THE FOURTH WALL... Everything beautifully put into place in it's own way of course. Now come on everyone, red band trailer, plenty of warnings, parental control advised, let's all be grown ups and admit that if you had done your homework you would know that this is no kiddies film. With that being said I have to stress again that there is very little wrong with this movie, in my opinion of course! The only two thing I see out of place are:1. The advertising... While it's clever and teasing to release a trailer with a countdown for another trailer with our Anti-Hero drinking something hot in front of the fireplace for Christmas, in my humble opinion the trailers were much too revealing. For quite a large portion of the film I was rather expecting to see the things I've seen in the trailers then focus on the film because you could actually anticipate the best part of it as in "oh, now's when Weasel says what Wades face looks like", understand?2. And second, I believe that Deadpool doesn't really stay much in one place for long and there are only two general setting in the movie apart from the origin story. What I mean by that is that I don't get the feeling that Deadpool really moves about, like in the game for example, he goes to Genosha he is being annoying to the actual Wolverine, he explores more places and it gets much more random so to say.Once again there is nothing wrong with the actual film but next time I would say shorter trailers and more places.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an OK movie. It does several things right:1. Doesn't last too long 2. Doesn't take itself too seriously 3. Goes for fun &amp; jokes 4. Pokes fun at the superhero genreBut, it's not great. (Most of) The jokes aren't that good. The breaking of the 4th wall, a Deadpool "trademark", is pretty random - a lot of times you would expect him to speak to you, yet he doesn't - and vice- versa. While poking fun at superhero genre, it ends up being a lot like other movies of the genre (sans self-referential jokes).Since it pretty much abandons the idea of having a (cohesive) story, and jokes aren't that good, what's left is the characters, which aren't very interesting. Deadpool is OK (but not great), so is his bartender "sidekick". Others, not so much. Morrena Baccarin's beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but, unfortunately, there's not much else. Villains are pretty flat. Gina Carano, especially, could just as well have been a robot.So, if you're 21 or older, it's an OK watch. Just don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last an actual fun kickass superhero film. DEADPOOL. The film had scope to be better though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superhero films are not really my thing, for me films like the Avengers, Transformers etc are comparable to Indian masala films, where the hero punches a guy and he goes flying in the air. It's what I call junk food cinema, it satisfies ones taste buds, but we all know junk food in excess just causes diarrhea. However with this weeks released Deadpool my expectations were a little higher than I would have from a Avenger film, this is because the trailer of Deadpool was kickass fun, and novel. Deadpool looked hilarious, and he seemed like a anti-hero who didn't want to save the world for the millionth time in the films trailer. Well in eventuality Deadpool was a little underwhelming than I thought it would be, but it was still great fun, and miles ahead of all the other superhero films I have seen except Guardians of Galaxy which I enjoyed slightly more. Deadpool is quirky, zany, and the humour is downright raunchy, and thats something you probably have not seen before in a superhero film. Deadpool is a satire of sorts on superhero films, but were the film should have broke the clichés it was making fun of, it in the end gets caught in the same rut . Deadpool works mainly because of the films badass hero Deadpool aka Ryan Reynolds who I have never liked in a film before ( acting wise) Deadpool,but more on that later.Story wise a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, who after being diagnosed with cancer in the final stage, he is then subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopts the alter ego Deadpool. Armed with his new abilities and a dark, twisted sense of humor, Deadpool hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life.Acting wise honestly other than Ryan Reynolds nobody is really noticeable on screen, and that's a great thing for all Deadpool fans, because Ryan owns the screen. He is hilarious, he kickass like never before, and Deadpool doesn't want to save the world(thankfully). This is the first Ryan Reynold's performance I have enjoyed, and it's a bloody good one. Keep up the good work.Deadpool has a clichéd villain, there is a clichéd love angle, and there is a climax fight sequence were the superhero has to save something( luckily this time it's not the world) so the film is not really novel. But everything is done a quirky, zany satirical way, were everything is being made fun of,so one enjoys the proceedings, but I won't lie I excepted something a little more badass at times. For example the whole love angle in Deadpool could have been done with, the film would have worked without it in my opinion. However everything is being satired like I mentioned before, so even the cheesiest scene brings a laugh. Like the scene when the girlfriend is about to say will you give it to me in the a$$,and Wade says I love you ( he thought she wanted him to say that). Scenes like that evoke a huge amount of laughter. The films biggest plus is the raunchy, over the top humour. The films action sequences are top notch, and the bridge, and climax action sequences are feast for a action film lovers eyes. The added gore was nice touch too.The production values were good, but there eerily similar to Antman, but both are marvel films so it's expected I guess. I must say my favourite scene was when Deadpool, and the Xmen characters ( who I have never heard of)walkout in the climax fight with Dmx playing,that was badass. A special mention to the films Director for using Raj Kapoor's Classic song Mera Jhoota Hai Japani in Deadpool, that felt like a proud moment being a Indian, however the brown taxi driver character was too clichéd.Was also nice to see my hometown Vancouver BC as the main shooting location in the film.Deadpool's story and screenplay needed a bit of work because the character Deadpool gave scope to make a even better/bigger film, but the lacklustre predictable story bogged the film down.Overall after Guardians of Galaxy, Deadpool is the only superhero film I enjoyed. It's a film that never bores, and is great kickass fun. Minor blemishes aside for the regular cine goer this film could be a enjoyable prospect. For all you freaks who are superhero cinema fans( I am joking) you have already either the watched film, or reserved your tickets, so you don't need my recommendation. 3.25/5* or 6.5/10</fullReview>

Some of them felt like I was watching the Batman series from the 60's with better graphics.Deadpool is great stuff from the get go, well done flash back scenes that didn't reveal the entire story in the first 20 seconds and a main character you could really empathise with.

		<shortDescription>(Anti)hero as we needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no other hero like Deadpool. Created and invented in 1991 by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza from Marvel Comics, character had fast become on of the most memorable heroes of this universe. His unique and vulgar sense of humor with his awareness of being just the comic figure made him favorite Marvel mutant for many readers. However, the reasons of success of the comic novels was also the causes of reluctance of creating the movie based on them. Nowadays, when you can't find much blood or brutal violence in super-hero scores and there is no single imprecation in them, it's hard to believe, that the movie like "Deadpool" could succeed in any way, especially if it was rated as "restricted" on the cinema's repertoires. How movie about mutant would earn big money without young viewers? It's impossible, right? Right?! Fortunetly, Fox have taken the risk to find out about that.All of the super-hero franchises always have the same problem: screenwriters can not dare to show as something new and original. So, we get the next stories like "let's save the world guys!". We love such movies, but to be honest - we have been a little tired with new productions like "Avengers: Age of Ultron" or "Fantastic Four". We needed something fresh, something absolutely new. Film with new conceptions in showing the story. And that's how we get "Deadpool"!Directed by not well known Tim Miller, movie doesn't even much care about the plot itself, because it isn't so necessary in this case. It's just the origin story, connected with romance (in order to release the movie during the Valentine weekend, of course). The fact that film is quite short (it takes less than two hours to hit to the end credits) can make you sure, that you won't fell boring at any moment. Every single scene is full of ribald jokes, gallows humor and untypical Marvel easter-eggs. Deadpool breaks the fourth wall to the ground, humiliate Hugh Jackam like he was his favorite villain...he even humiliate himself! Who could stop him from doing that?! Who would dare?!Miller's score is one of the best comic adaptations of all the time. It doesn't only fit to original stories perfectly, but also show them from the new perspective. It's also a great evidence, that super-hero kind movies do not have to be imitative, predictable and based mostly on the same ideas. Although, the plot in "Deadpool" may seems to be chaotic, screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (they both have worked on 2009's "Zombieland") have made a impressive work, by connecting black comedy with love story and also X-Men franchise. And it's really crazy mixture. But it's the movie about our lovely Deadpool - it has to be insane!"Deadpool" wouldn't have happened without insistent efforts of Ryan Reynolds. Almost forty actor wanted to produce the film about dressed in red mutant since "X-Men Origins: Wolverine", where he played Wade Wilson in a very...strange way, with sewed up mouth and extra-long adamantium blades. He's been trying to convinced 20th Century Fox for almost six years to shoot single Deadpool movie. He believed, that he was born to take this role. Now we can see, that he was right. Movie belongs to him at all. He doesn't have to play Deadpool. He is Deadpool. He literally invented him, created him and brought him to live on the big screen. Altought, most of the cast are very talented personalities, no one of them is able to have any match for Reynolds. He steals the whole show. So pity, that two of three main actress - Gina Carano and Brianna Hildebrand - don't even try to be so aspiring...I'm curious: what have thought the "Deadpool" producers after first opening weekend? How have they reacted? They haven't believed in the success of the movie, they used to be sure, that such kind of production, directed only to adult viewers can not earn big money. I hope, that they're still shocked. "Deadpool" is a proof, that you don't need two hundred million dollars to create great super-hero franchise. All what it's going to take is a brave decision to create something special, something different than typical film, using adored character, played by actor with passion to do that. And that's all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essentially it's Kickass without the ironic secret identities and with actual superpowers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Got to be honest to date I have seen it twice (something despite what some believe I don't do that often) and while I enjoyed it the first time I think I liked it more the second time. On first viewing it felt like the humour was all "smoke and mirrors" hiding what if it had been intended to be taken more seriously a very over the top but sub par superhero movie. (Although Super-Antihero makes for a better description) But second time round having heard the jokes already I was able to find stuff there that I had overlooked the first time and I think I enjoyed it more as a result. One definite strength of Deadpool is the title character itself once again played by Ryan Reynolds after his brief appearance in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (clearly putting his past poorly received superhero movies behind him). A lot of the fun, humour and what makes the film entertaining in general comes from his portrayal of the character. As much as it would seem that how he was played in the film Wolverine would make it feel like no one else could play the role he makes for a even more memorable character the second time round. While although still technically set in the X-Men universe he brings his own spin to the character that does enough to set it apart from the X-Men movies and to become its own thing. Even going as far so poke fun at his past superhero movies (from a action figure of his original Deadpool design to jokes about how he doesn't want to look green/ animated like he did in Green Lantern) something that was worth a laugh or two for those in the know. A lot of the fourth wall humour from Deadpool himself did stick to this formula that's for sure. Even one moment early on similar to the marketing done based on the Valentine's Day release date by having Deadpool mimic the girlfriends in the audience thinking they were tricked into watching a superhero movie and the seemingly conventional Marvel post credits scene on how there is "no Samuel L Jackson with a eye patch" or Deadpool 2 trailer.But look past the title character and focus more on the superhero movie satires, it does come across as another kickass type of movie. It is much like Kickass a very over the top, extremely/ graphically violent movie that does not hold back (almost surprising it managed a 15 (the UK mid way between PG-13 and R) in some ways). But in some ways on this front the more ironic nature of Kickass in the sense that the title character was not what you would expect from a superhero (I.e nerdy, not big or strong, doesn't actually have superpowers) dare I say it seemed to work more at what both of those films and also Deadpool where both trying to do in those movies. But despite this Deadpool still comes out on top comes out as the more entertaining character. Plot wise is a stark contrast to what we have seen, it mainly regards that there had been another movie featuring the character (although if hypothetically if X-Men Origins did happen I would argue that it took place after Ryan Reynolds scenes in that movie and after the climax of it but that's a big if). The character is introduced in a more focused not at all down played way although there is hints of what happened during the character's first appearances in X-Men Origins: Wolverine but so vague it felt more like a Easter egg. There are some moments while that while surprisingly dramatic for a film that wasn't intended to be taken too seriously that goes in some directions that kickass did not. But there was still the downside too this in that this only gives motivation for becoming Deadpool and not much else in the long run. But it's mostly a revenge story somewhat about love, that is the best way I can put it.But in all Deadpool is still an entertain movie, it is quite the adventure and pure escapism. It has the right kind of self aware nature to it all that seems to work for the movie and does become what you would hope for it to be. Of course if Kickass was not your thing then this will not be yours either , but if it was then this is probably worth checking out.</fullReview>

Comic book fans of Deadpool can appreciate this work, especially for the use of making mentions of his other works. Hopefully in the next movie we see some fun with Cable and hopefully more Colossus too. Maybe get some of the other X-Men like Wolverine to be a part in the movie too.

		<shortDescription>Best part: How to deal with bad guys!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SHOOT EM IN THE FACE!! (I have long been a proponent of this method... it's super-effective!) This movie is everything the hero genre needed. This better trend began with GotG, with 'heroes' who aren't quite heroes (anti-heroes and so forth) and who can act like actual human beings.. in spite of sometimes not being human beings... and possess powers and abilities beyond mortals.Brooding is fine for certain characters, but when everyone is dragged into the same mold, it begins to get overwrought, because that's just not how people work, and we know that. We're not all on Xanex and Zoloft! We're not miserable 24/7! And most people don't like hanging around people who are! Deadpool also brought us a snarky, brutally sarcastic wit sorely lacking in humor overall these days, save for "South Park". The fear of offending anyone with an entitlement attitude has finally begun to break, and I believe "Deadpool" may signal a resurgence as the studio execs have had the blinders unceremoniously ripped from their eyes: guess what, the vast majority of us are thoroughly sick of watered down, PC writing! The merc with a mouth dragged all the SJWs out of their safe spaces and spanked them soundly, to much adulation! Is the movie perfect? Nope! Do I care all that much? Double nope! I don't exactly judge "Spaceballs" by the same standards as "The Maltese Falcon", after all! Does it accomplish a great feat with it's rather small budget and give the finger to the whiners who wanted it to fail because it upset their simpering sensibilities? ABSOLUTELY!! It's a comedy first and foremost, and succeeds at that aim 110% The writers were indeed the real heroes in this movie! As such, I feel it deserves a very high rating because it does everything it set out to do and made myself and the rest of the audience laugh ourselves silly with some truly brilliant comedic creativity. That's what comedies are supposed to do, and the rest of Hollywood should realize this simple fact... and stop with the terrible Wayan's parodies PLEASE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thing to come out of Hollywood since the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I knew very little about Deadpool before going into this movie, part because I'm not big into comics and also to avoid any spoilers as I was admittedly caught up in the hype. I don't even like Ryan Reynolds most of the time but he's on another level in this. The serious parts he plays incredibly well pulling the audience on the team Deadpool bleachers by the end of the film. Every joke hit with roaring laughter at the screening I attended and the fun was entirely infectious. This is the kind of movie my generation wants to see; terrifying yet hilarious, crude but smart and oh so deliciously gory. The fact that it sits with over 8/10 but at a 65 currently on the professional critics scale shows how far from relevant these people's opinions are. Bring on Deadpool 2, raise a statue in his honor and let's all enjoy life a little.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you love taking the younger nerds in your life to see each new superhero movie? Of course you do! But for the love of God, do NOT take any kids to Deadpool, the most recent entry to the "X-Men" cinematic cosmos. Ryan Reynold's affectionate take on this C-level Marvel anti-hero fills a massive hole in the ubiquitous world of superhero films: fanboy fiction for proudly immature adults. A no-holds-barred, Guardians of the Galaxy-esque romp, it's gleefully violent and unabashedly debauched. Deadpool serves as proof that true passion projects are sometimes worth backing. Unfamiliar with the Deadpool character? No problem. The film catches us up to speed with some unique origin story-telling, jumping back and forth between his present crime-fighting life and his past normal life. It's a gloriously messy way to breathe some life into a clichéd story form. All the while, meta-references and in-jokes burst from every blood-splattered shot, starting with a wonderful opening credit sequence that features self-mutilating gags (i.e. referring to Ryan Reynolds as "God's Perfect Idiot"). Reynolds, a guy often overly interested frat-boy shenanigans, revels and shines in a role he was clearly born to play. And hopefully this won't be his last time donning the red-tights and foul-mouth. If done correctly, the sequels have the strong possibility of only being better than this first one, as the setup of the character can be lost to more frivolous fun. How will this strongly R-rated character get tied into the larger X-Men story without losing his bite? Not sure; for now let's just enjoy this one-shot action-comedy as a one-of-a-kind superhero experience that you've likely never experienced before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you Ryan Reynolds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, it lives up to its impressive marketing campaign and then some. It was truly worth the 11 years it took Reynolds, and the entire Comic book fan base to get this movie made as it is a must see for anybody.I have never smiled as much as I did throughout this, the film is non stop fun consistently, and it really is emphasized by the amount this movie was allowed to get away with after being made a 15. The Superhero genre for me have been burning out recently, with the high volume that marvel seem to be churning out, so a change of pace was needed. This film offers a completely fresh take on superhero (or in this case anti hero) which should be praised for its balls and excellent plot, which captivate the audience.My biggest concern going into the cinema was that the 4th wall breaking wouldn't transfer well onto the big screen, but it really gives this film an edge over all others in the same genre, it never takes you out of the immersion and is a constant reminder of how comic books really can be brought to life in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And only for this movie I want to read the comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually see heroes movies and get disappointed because there is a lack of shades of grey (oh, not the 50 shades of crap, please!) that human nature must transit in life and the choices we make. We are not perfect or heroes, those movies around doesn't show a moral for us but perfection we want to be... and is nice to see for a little while, and it is entertaining, but are for kids, not for me... I am not a kid. But Deadpool gave me what I need it: A movie with grey and human nature and stupids decisions that lead to something bigger (and some times horrible) twisted deep consequences, and a road to dark places. A movie with a hero for me and not for kids. That is what suppose to be. X- Men is one of my favorite series in comic but a lot of the reality seen in the series is totally lost in the adaptation. And it is a comic for adults! I know there is the comic for Deadpool and I've told that the series is far much better and only for see this movie I want to read it. I was told that critics have praised Ryan Reynold's performance and I must agree. The whole cast (specially Morena Baccarin, whom I admire since Firefly) did a great job but Ryan was excellent and I am just so pleased! The script is amazing. It never stopped, it caught me since the very beginning, action, laugh, some nudes and sex... all in one pack. And of course our heroes in costume and cool fights! I wish I would see this in Wolverine. Finishing, this is my second 10/10 in reviews, and I couldn't be happier for it. This is a film for not all people but those who appreciate what we are and all of our choices in life. This is for adults who need a hero... in costume (that's a plus, at least for me) Greetings!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Consensus: Deadpool tries too hard to mock the properties that have preceded it, losing potency, originality and its identity in the process.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds in a spandex-ish tight superhero suit?does this movie deliver? Let's find out.I think Deadpool definitely is a strong addition to the comic-book movie-verse, boasting strong performances and above-average action set pieces. Does it do enough as a Deadpool origins story? Not quite. Deadpool is far too self-aware for its own good. The film tries so hard to be different it actually disappointingly falters in its attempt to be original. The director seems too inexperienced to accurately meld all the wild elements in this fun and quirky Deadpool script. The writers of "Zombieland" nail the one-liners and most of the self- referential sadomasochistic non-sensical commotion that goes with it. Is there such a thing as trying to be TOO cool? Pop-culture is pop-culture for a reason. Quotable film lines are deemed classics because of the audiences that make them so. You can't coerce your way into pop-culture fandom, rather you earn your place there. All in all, Deadpool had me leaving the theatre with ambivalent feelings. I do not know exactly where I stand when it comes to liking an anti-hero who keeps on reminding us he is a reluctant superhero while being in a spoof movie of the subject he is making fun of. Does that make any sense? The film definitely is a satire of the comic-book superhero formula; alas the execution of that satire is far from perfect. Deadpool is enjoyable for its jokes and to watch Ryan Reynolds sadistically inflict pain on his bevy of hopeless criminals- I think the audience secretly felt more pleasure as we watched him ingeniously come up with dozens of ways to perform his lethal duties.Fans of the character will be pleased, comic-book movie fans who have an insatiable desire for unconventional chaotic superheroes will also be content with this adaptation, film fans who care about the plot and cinematic elements will be divided on this one. No one likes a smartass, even though it is amusing to watch one in (his) confidence and insanity- capture the screen.</fullReview>

That is one thing this film is full of, action/violence and everything is served with a snappy remarks, a joke and a smile :) and it just works, my son is not going to see this any time soon, but I loved it a lot that is for sure.I have always liked Ryan Renolds and in this film he really goes all in or maybe out to be the best "super hero" he can be as long as he doesn't get a green suit he is all good.Location, seating &amp; time: Imperial, Nordisk Film, Vesterbro, Denmark - Bio 1, row 14 seat 3 &amp; 5 - 22.02.2016 at 16.10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a timely trendsetter for the jaded superhero genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds' much hyped anti-hero, DEAD POOL finally bags his own feature film, seven years after his first-appearance in X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (2009), and it becomes the latest box- office phenomenon, both domestically and internationally. What are the odds it is against? Firstly, its R-rate manifestly shows the guts to forfeit the increasingly important (profit-wise) Chinese market (the same as last year's MAD MAX: FURY ROAD 2015), and still profits; secondly, it has been dumped to a lousy February release signifies either that the production company doesn't have high hopes for it, or much more commendably, a left-field strategy to ignite the heat from the rock bottom; last but not least, its modest budget, estimated $58 millions, is significantly lower than any major studio superhero commodities, which promises a higher rate of return and indicates a new franchise is in the offing.DEADPOOL is director Tim Miller's feature debut, and it punchily and timely injects a paradigm- shifting novelty into Hollywood's mainstay genre where Marvel and DC Comics reside. From the stop-motion and self-mocking opening credits backing with ANGEL OF THE MORNING, viewers are induced to get enchanted by this unorthodox and loquacious mutant, his trademark breaking-the- fourth-wall (at one time it multiples up to sixteenth) interactions are tremendously entertaining, not to mention the ceaseless gags (its teasing victims vary from pop culture, comic book characters, showbiz celebrities, to the protagonist Reynolds himself), salacious innuendos, pulpy slaughters and gallows humour, which all dampen the pretty dark and grisly happenings of how Wade Wilson, a mercenary suffers from cancer eventually becomes Deadpool, a defaced super-human with impeccable healing powers.Surprisingly, the plot itself is a conventional boy-meets-girl, boy-leaves-girl, then boy-saves-girl three-act, and the British villain Ajex (Skrien), has no ambitious agenda to destroy the world or humanity, he is simply sadistic and enjoys beating the pulp out of his opponent or being battered since he has lost all the feelings, where Deadpool's recovery ability makes him a perfect rival. Noticeably, due to its budget, the movie doesn't involve too many exorbitant WTF visual spectacles, and action pieces are quite numbered, Deadpool's only mutant allies are the preachy Colossus (voiced by Kapicic), and a young Sinead O'Connor lookalike Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Hilderbrand), still, he beats Ajex, who has just one sidekick, Angel Dust (Carano, the girl who can fight but cannot act). Yet, the outcome is mostly rewarding, especially when viewers appetite has been pampered with too many bombardments.Reynolds spares no effort in showing off his ripped bod and pulls off Deadpool's unusually audience-friendly character, it is a long-waited recognition and hopefully his career will steer to a new direction. Wade's love interest Vanessa (Baccani), whose mutant background has been omitted here, is the only one who plays with a straight-face to at least verify the slightly uninspiring storyline, whereas T.J. Miller's Weasel, triumphantly upstages others with his competence as a constant purveyor of comic relief.The sequel has already been put on the agenda, so as a trend-setter, DEADPOOL sets up a new double-wining (both word-of-mouth and box office performance) template for studio franchises and a high bar for its follow-ups, let's wish it is not just a flash in the pan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Shines Over The Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always it's what you don't see in the trailer that kills a film. In Deadpool's case it's the sappy moments that drag it down. You know the ones where the music gets all sad and you're supposed to feel that this is important and dramatic as if you had some Pavlovian response. Much time is wasted on unnecessary long origin story. Instead of spending time with Deadpool we are stuck with Wade and you just wish it would return to the action again.But what's the weirdest part about this film is how basic the plot is. What would typically be a half, or even a third, of a typical superhero plot is the entire story in this film. And when you learn how small the budget was you kind of have to wonder did they simply not have enough money for a big scale action film?And of course your enjoyment of the film will depend on your tolerance for crude, juvenile profanity that becomes old really fast. The problem is that it's so overused in this film that it looses its punch towards the end.That's about what's bad about the film, but it has plenty of good to make up for it. The humour for one thing as this film seems more like a parody than a legitimate superhero film. Ryan Reynolds plays it perfectly, so much that you can forgive him for a certain other superhero film. The first 20 minutes or so are made of pure awesome as it's the type of action that should have been the entire film. And there's an Adventure Time watch (yes I'm including this).Overall I ended up liking Deadpool because its good parts shine over the flaws, but after a film like Mad Max: Fury Road last year I can't say I'm not a little disappointed.</fullReview>

Deadpool is an amazing character to begin with. Ryan Reynolds more than made up for the fiasco of Green Lantern with this one! I can't wait for a sequel! The movie had it all. Nice storyline, flashbacks that explained the history of the hero and lots and lots of jokes, funny, racial, you name it. A movie with no clichés, looking at the spectator more than once and with a decent result. Other movies that have tried to bring down the fourth wall have not made it - this one did!Would love to see more X-men in the movie but it's fine! As long as I see deadpool in the next X-men movie, I will be happy! Hurry and get to the cinema before it's out cause even the special effects are worth it! And then, just buy a DVD to have in your house! You'll never get tired of watching this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not without its flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wade AKA Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) tells the story of how he was subjected to painful experiments, now with mutant abilities he seeks revenge.Deadpool is a superhero movie unlike anything before it. First off it's extremely R-rated. Second throughout the film the main is constantly braking the fourth wall, not mention there are some great jokes about the studio.Deadpool has LOTS of comedy, but with comedy being very subjective I personally felt this movie was very hit-and-miss, though when it hit it was hysterical.Next the story, its nothing outstanding, a simple predictable revenge story, the villain is really nothing special.Last the action, it wasn't as awesome and exciting as I was hoping, there was an overuse of CGI, given some scenes required it, but still, it feels faker looking then other CGI heavy films I've seen. Early on there are some pretty crazy action scenes, but the further the film goes the duller the action got.I personally feel this film was perhaps rushed? More time could've given them the chance to focus on crazier stunts and in the least a more balanced sense of humor.One last note, the one reason Deadpool actually didn't meet my expectations was that I kept hearing how this film was setting the new standard for R-rated films. I don't know what those people mean, I've seen movies push the envelope way more.In conclusion its worth a laugh, but don't expect anything Oscar-worthy.</fullReview>

I couldn't believe this was actually a Marvel movie. There's action but it's not as impressive as I'd hope it'd be. This seemed more like a dark comedy than a Marvel movie. Don't believe the hype this movie is not worth your money. Not that the money matters but if you're a true Marvel fan you'll feel cheated. His love interest had great dark humor &amp; Dead pool also had a few jokes here and there but no gut busting comedy. I don't know why Colossus was in the movie his role was minor &amp; he was treated as the voice of reason. The story completely changes from how he became Deadpool in Wolverine, it's been rewritten to be more sentimental, I'm guessing because the release date so close to Valentine's day. I could write about the negatives of this movie all day but I'll stop here but not before I say ANT MAN was way better &#x1f602;&#x1f602;&#x270c;&#x270c;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched "Straight Outta Compton", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new kind of super-hero about to spawn a new franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like your super-heroes straight and serious as opposed to camp, jokey and totally foul-mouthed; if you prefer a narrative that is linear and third person rather than one with lots of flash-backs and a first-person dialogue which regularly breaks the fourth wall; if you like violence to be quick and clean rather than brutal and disfiguring; then I guess "Deadpool" is not for you. Think more "Kick-Ass" than "X-Men". If, on the other hand you're up for something rather different - a central character with special regenerative powers who is out for revenge for himself rather than justice for society and whose constant witticisms are as often about sex as cultural allusions, then you will find this movie a refreshing change from the usual super-hero fare.Five years ago, Ryan Reynolds starred as the Green Lantern in a disappointing movie, but here he has created such an original and fun character than we might well have a new franchise. Certainly there would be scope for more bridges to the X-Men franchise, but for now we have only two new X-Men in the varied shapes of metallic giant Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and young Sian O'Connor look-alike Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). Also it would be good to have a more original villain than yet another Londoner (Ed Skrein) and to see more of Wade Wilson/Deadpool's girlfriend Brazilian "Homeland"-star Morena Baccarin.By the way, be sure to stay till the end of the credits ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I am not a superhero fan who knows the whole back story behind Deadpool, it was a funny movie nonetheless. It contained many witty jokes and great, but graphic, action scenes that really draws you in; especially during the beginning scenes. It contains everything movies about superheroes do, even though we are constantly reminded Deadpool is no superhero. His romance's ability to overcome the great physical damage caused by the experiments and final victory over the "villain" was easy to foreshadow. In contrast, it definitely has its unique characteristics that stand out comparatively to any other comedy superhero movie. Overall, it is a great feel good movie with comedy, but it is easy to tell how it is going to play out from the beginning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is hilarious news at superhero genre. Humor is fresh delightful. Violence scenes are not the wildest you have seen, but there is a blood enough in this movie too. Ryan Reynolds is great as a Deadpool and seems to enjoy at his role. Deadpool is not greater than life experience, but certainly it is fresh at Marvel series. There are a lot of hints to other Marvel movies and that makes it feel a little disoriented. It feels like a big action hero movie with a low budget at the same time, and that maybe is a reason it feels so fresh. Deadpool is very schematic comic book story made to silver screen. It doesn't offer lot of anything new, but there are a lot of very funny moments in it. It is full of obscene humor, but not enough to be tasteless. It certainly is not suitable for younger audience, but mature audience will enjoy it. Sequel had already announced and it will be interesting to see if they found something new to story. Hopefully Deadpool 2 will be as hilarious as this one. It gonna take a lot from screen writers, but if they manage of it movie may be even more hilarious than the first one. Deadpool is fresh and funny movie to an adult audience. Very entertaining and it feels all new at its genre.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool is easily he most fan service of comic characters, so it makes sense that his big screen spotlight is a movie that feels a fan service movie. The "merc with a mouth" is a character that doesn't take himself seriously and neither does his big screen adventure, which is the biggest appeal of an otherwise standard super hero formula hiding under waves of winking irony, crass humor, and gleefully bloody violent mayhem. Ryan Reynolds plays Wade Wilson, a hired gun that undergoes a risky experimental treatment by a shady black ops organization to cure his terminal illness. It makes him generally indestructible with a rapid healing ability but his flesh is also horribly scarred and Wade is afraid his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), a hooker with a heart of gold, will reject him. Even in the opening credits, you know this isn't going to be a typical super hero movie. The time is ripe for a film that knowingly ridicules the tropes of the super hero film industry, and Deadpool scores some big laughs when its making fun of itself and its super peers. The dark humor can often surprise with how go-for-broke it can get, like Wade and his Vanessa's flirty one-ups man ship of hypothetical sexual trauma. There's a clever montage of Wade and Vanessa's romantic history told through sexually-specific holiday celebrations, and the inclusion of a couple of low-rent X-Men provides a comic foil for Deadpool to bounce off from. The action is fun and the movie is entertaining from its opening credits to the now-mandatory post-credits bonus. Reynolds is spiritually attuned with the irreverence of the anti-hero, finally plugging into a part that makes full use of his charm, motor mouth, and physicality. Deadpool's runaway box-office success (grossing more than any X-Men film and on at least half the budget) will hopefully allow Hollywood to feel comfortably allowing their less than family-friendly comic titles to stay true to their intentions. Then again maybe they'll just take all the wrong messages and think that audiences just want to hear more swearing from people in spandex. Deadpool is a super hero movie that prioritizes fun over everything else, and while it may not be for everyone, at least it's trying to be for someone different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very hilarious movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a vigilante that has well earned his own movie. We all began to gain respect for him and ask for him in his first appearance in X men. From that day forwards we knew deadpool would become a wonderful character. This movie did way better than what people actually thought it would do. They chose the perfect actor (Ryan Reynolds) to do this hilarious movie. It give you everything that you want in a movie from action to comedy to a nice little love story. If these are your guidelines for a movie and your a marvel comic book fan, you definitely should go and view this movie for yourself. Or if your just trying to have a Romantic date with your loved one then you can do this too. The best thing to do is give the movie a chance and see what everyone has been raving about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but DEADPOOL was awesome! It was great to find an action-comedy that assumes I'm an adult.It's dumb, it's profane, it's utterly silly, and I loved every minute of it (literally, right from the opening "credits"). Is there a story in there? Yeah, I guess, but it's really just secondary to Deadpool's constant smart-alec riffing. If anyone was considering writing a Marvel spoof screenplay, don't bother; "Deadpool" frequently bites the hand that feeds it and skewers the label as thoroughly as anyone could hope.Deadpool "breaks the 4th wall" frequently, and even parodies that device by breaking the 4th wall in a flashback WHILE breaking the 4th wall ("That's like, 16 walls!").Do NOT take kids. This movie revels in gratuitous violence, graphic language, and juvenile humour, and makes no apologies for any of it. This is an "R" rated movie and comes by it honestly. If you're good with that, though, the odds are good you'll laugh your butt off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Yet Forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a lot of jokes and laughs there are in this movie.As long as you like juvenile humour and sexual innuendo that is. No problem for me, I laughed a lot.If you have no idea what this film is about some of what follows could be regarded as Spoilers.Boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girls, boy fights to get her back, and does.The (anti) hero of this movie has had a bad thing done to him and he wishes to right that wrong.Wade Wilson, later to be Deadpool, is, despite being a special forces op, reduced to defending young maidens against the unwelcome advances of pizza delivery boys. He does this in a wise cracking, if totally over the top, way.In his downtime he drinks in a bar where fellow "mercenaries" hang out, although none as are as cool as him. In fact they all look like deadbeats.He shares wisecracks with the friendly bartender.Visiting a strip joint he meets the love of his life. A woman as sexually charged as he is and there is a sequence where they romp through a variety of sexual experiences to show their growing love for each other.Sadly on the horizon to spoil the moment is the news of terminal cancer.Ah, but wait. A mysterious figure appears in the bar offering a cure.Wade signs up for this, leaving his beloved behind. He does not want her to seem him fall prey to cancer so steals away in the night to have a cure effected which will not only get rid of his cancer but bestow upon him great powers.Of course all is not as it seems but after a long drawn out process at the hands of the baddie and his female sidekick Wade does indeed gain superpowers.For some reason he looks like a burn victim, not that horrific but enough for horrific jokes to be constantly made about his appearance. He seems aggrieved at his treatment and goes after the baddie whom he believes can make him look lovely again.Dead pool chases baddie and eventually, once he finds out that said baddie was lying to him about making his skin baby soft again, kills him.In the process of this he is reunited with his sexy girlfriend who, despite his looks, still finds him a sexy beast.They all live happily ever after.So that's the story but how is it delivered?Wade Wilson is a wisecracking dude but once he is transformed into Deadpool one of the powers that seems to be increased is wisecrackingness. He just can't stop.At one point I thought it might be Jim Carey beneath the mask.There are lots and lots of jokes. Many revolve round sexual issues which young boys will love 'cos they feel so naughty. After a while though the non-stop masterbatery references tire somewhat and any adults in the audience might wish for something more. The effects are well done, although nothing new.There are lots of knowing nods to the "Marvel Universe" which can go straight over the head of the casual viewer. It is a well made film which is too knowing for it's own good and could do with some script editing but as a way to pass a couple of hours it is perfectly acceptable.As long as you are, or have the mind of an adolescent boy.I am sure there will be a lot of posters of Morena Baccarat sold in the coming (childish pun intended) months.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The highly anticipated Deadpool movie is finally here and everyone seems to want to be amongst the first people to see it. If the number of people who went to see a movie was any indication of how good it is, Deadpool would be awesome. Unfortunately, most of the times those number only indicate how well a product was advertised and Deadpool may be an example of just that.Because it is certainly not a very good movie and it certainly doesn't live up to it's expectations. Instead, Deadpool is basically 108 minutes of toilet humour mixed with not particularly well choreographed fighting scenes and an occasional breaking the 4th wall.Maybe most disappointing are these 4th wall breakings. Nowhere does the movie make clear that the titular character is effectively aware of the fact that he's a movie character, which would be the case for a movie adaptation of a comicbook character who is "comic aware". Throughout the movie it merely feels like the lead character is just narrating the story about himself, rather than a movie about a character that is aware of the fact that he is a movie character. Even the mandatory Stan Lee cameo wasn't used and the wisecracking (allthough at times funny, particularly the joke about the lack of superhero's at the X- mansion) at the camera nowhere surpasses Ferris Bueller.Deadpool could have been an awesome movie and a completely different kind of superhero movie. The trailer had us expacting no less, but instead it even falls short to that other superhero movie Ryan Reynolds starred in. That movie never got a green light for a sequel. If it were up to me Deadpool would also receive a red light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched the trailer I thought it was crap but then I thought, maybe I should it give it a shot. I love Xmen and can't wait until May to see it so maybe a little bit of mutant is not a bad idea on a Saturday night. It turned out really bad.If Xmen is the real project, this is where the interns practice and get their coffee money. I was shocked that Marvel franchised this movie. There is no story line, no twist, no surprise, no thinking, nothing. And the casting is lousy as well, characters are dull and they try too hard to be funny. Yes, speaking of funny, I don't get why people think this movie is funny. My conversation with a Starbucks worker over the counter has more funny lines than this movie. Or the audience these days don't even read, that they still laugh at the jokes we laughed at in the 90s? If you wanna laugh during this movie, better a joint when the trailers are playing.</fullReview>

It's pretty funny too, although the humor is extremely campy. It's as though the old British "Carry On" movies were crossed with Quentin Tarantino.The language is bad, there is a good deal of nudity, there are tasteless masturbation jokes, and all-in-all it's a heap of low brow fun. Don't look for moral lessons, there are none. :-DPlus, it was wonderful to see Leslie Uggams, still a classy-looking lady although she didn't have much to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHEN watching the trailer for Deadpool, I expected it to be about a wise-cracking and crass superhero with a penchant for showing off his taut body in a red spandex outfit. My expectation was proved true when I watched it. I just never expected it to be filled with dollops of crude humour.The film actually has a soft spot, even though it's littered with profanities and action scenes that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger go green with envy.On the surface, it's about a superhero whose face is so scarred that people in the streets avoid walking near him. Deep down, however, it's about whether his girlfriend can look him in the eye and accept him for who he is.Ryan Reynolds doesn't have a good track record playing superheroes. His Green Lantern (2011) quickly faded into oblivion. He, however, takes a different tack with Deadpool, using his motormouth, instead of his dashing handsomeness, to portray his character's quirks and insecurities.Read more at www.abigspark.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect with this alternative superhero movie, the trailer for it was appealing, and I read it was getting good reviews and making a lot of money, so I was looking forward to what this next entry from Marvel would had to offer. Basically in New York City, former special forces operative Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) works as a mercenary, he meets and becomes romantically attached to escort Vanessa Carlysle (Gotham's Morena Baccarin). A year later Wade proposes to Vanessa and she accepts, but he suddenly collapses, at hospital he is diagnosed with terminal cancer, Vanessa remains by his side, but he fears losing her. Wade is approached by a Recruiter (Jed Rees) from a secret program, he offers him an experimental cure for his cancer, Wade initially refuses, but he later leaves Vanessa and undergoes the procedure. At a laboratory Wade meets and instantly resents Ajax (Ed Skrein) and Angel Dust (Gina Carano), Wade is injected with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes, then he is subjected to weeks of torture to trigger mutation, with no success. Ajax, who Wade finds out his real name is Francis Freeman, reveals the true purpose of the experiments is to create super-powered slaves for wealthy customers, Wade does develop healing abilities, but his face and skin are severely disfigured, he escapes his chamber, but is impaled by Ajax and left inside the laboratory that is burning down. Wade survives and returns to the city, he wants to reconnect with Vanessa, but he is unable to come to terms with his appearance and stays away, with some help from his best friend Weasel (T.J. Miller) he decides to hunt down Ajax, who claimed he could cure his disfigurement. Wade becomes a masked vigilante, using the nickname "Deadpool", and he moves in with elderly blind woman Al (Leslie Uggams), Deadpool follows a number of leads from various syndicates to find Ajax, he eventually locates her, causing chaos on the expressway. Cornering Ajax, Wade demands a cure for his disfigurement, but he is interrupted by two X-Men, Piotr Rasputin aka Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Ellie Phimister aka Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), they have been trying to recruit Deadpool, Ajax escapes, Deadpool is handcuffed to Colossus, but he cuts his own arm off to escape, his arm regenerates overnight. Now knowing that Wade is alive, Ajax goes to Weasel's bar and finds out about Vanessa, Weasel tells Wade that she is in danger, but he is still unable to face her, and she is already kidnapped, Wade is told by Ajax and Angel Dust to meet with them on a decommissioned helicarrier in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to join him to confront Ajax and Angel Dust, Colossus and Negasonic battle Angel Dust, while Deadpool battle many henchmen, and eventually engages Ajax in close combat. After the big battle, the equipment holding the helicarrier upright is accidentally destroyed, Colossus, who was knocked out, wakes and takes Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety, Deadpool successfully saves Vanessa, and Ajax is subdued, he reveals there is no cure for Wade's disfigurement. Colossus urges Deadpool to be a true hero and spare Ajax, but Deadpool kills Ajax, he turns to Vanessa and removes his mask to reveal his disfigured face, she is angered that he left her, but she still loves and accepts him, they reconcile and kiss. Also starring Karan Soni as Dopinder, Michael Benyaer as Warlord and Stan Lee as Strip Club DJ. Reynolds is a good choice as the wisecracking anti- hero who calls himself a bad guy going against the "worse guys", his breaking of the fourth wall, sending up the clichés and in-jokes about him knowing he is in a superhero movie works well, he even jokes about his unfortunate performance as the Green Lantern. This X-Men spin- off is good fun, it makes you laugh in the right places, the romantic element is alright, you really root for the vulnerable and naughty masked mutant, the explosive chase and fight sequences, and some black comedy violence, combined with the special effects are great, overall it is a most worthwhile fantasy action adventure. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Let the Fanboys Get to You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember stumbling into my father's office one day as he was editing footage of a thirteen- year-old boy's Bar Mitzvah. He was trying to figure out what to do with this horrible chunk of film wherein the boy and his friends were passing around a microphone, shouting any and every moronic, inane thing their brains could come up with. I recently rewatched bits of that footage under a new name: Deadpool.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), former Special Forces operative turned gun-for-hire, finds the love of his life, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). They understand each other, they have great fun and great sex together, and Wade is the happiest he's ever been. That is, until he inexplicably develops late-stage cancer throughout his body, and randomly leaves his girlfriend in the middle of the night to participate in some super secret experimental procedure that will cure him. The procedure turns him into an ugly freak, but grants him extraordinary healing powers, prompting Wade to seek revenge on the man who changed him, and win back his girl.The biggest problem Deadpool has is Deadpool himself. For some reason, people seem to mistake his rampant profanity and poorly cultivated sexual humor as comedy, because it comes from the mouth of a comic book protagonist. I thought we had matured from beyond that point. I thought that Watchmen, a product of the 80s, proved that we could expect more from our superheroes. Why people choose to settle for comedy that was stale when we were middle schoolers, I don't know, but I think it bears mentioning that Deadpool doesn't tell jokes. He just curses and makes half polished "that's what she said" quips. His breaking the fourth wall shatters any sense of immersion a viewer might have experienced, and while Godard gets a pass on such antics because he's not directing story-driven action films, Tim Miller gets no such pass. Similarly, Deadpool's discussing the actors who play other X-Men characters is beyond frustrating. I want to grab the scriptwriters and scream at them. What kind of universe is this where Ryan Reynolds references himself, but doesn't acknowledge that he, himself, is currently playing Wade Wilson? I hear the argument all the time that all of this is satire. Deadpool comics exist to lampoon preexisting tropes and archetypes, but satire requires a point of view, which Deadpool ultimately lacks. In actuality, the film succumbs to the same trite stereotypes it pretends to transcend.All that aside, there is still a considerable amount in this movie to like. Most notably, Wade and Vanessa's love story, prior to the ill conceived revenge plot. Reynolds plays Wade with charisma and energy, and Baccarin reciprocates in turn. Their characters are engagingly quirky, and some of the most well crafted and cinematic jokes come during these scenes. One scene in particular, which takes place in an arcade, stands out as my favorite sequence in the entire movie.Unfortunately, when your movie is called Deadpool, and Deadpool is nothing more than an obnoxious man-child who leans so heavily on the crutch of generic, crass, uninspired R-rated humor, it's hard to look too fondly upon the film as a whole. Don't succumb to the fanboy hype. Realize Deadpool for the manipulative, immature rehash it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible movie experience for an overrated piece of crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deadpool is a flick genetically engineered to appeal to IMDb spawn redditors with no sense of sophistication who laud meme dialog, which supports upvote circlejerk mentality, and meme acting with a good movie pandering reddit tier meta superhero "entertainment" sensibilities and a meme TV movie aesthetic. This is a cheap flick at best and will be forgotten in few weeks.The flick itself is nothing "fresh" other than some cheap shots of ass and boobs and not to forget fart/poop jokes in a "superhero" flick. Basic story,same old saving the girlfriend from villain revenge plot, Ryan Reynolds playing himself for 134th time, zero interesting characters, deadpool's teammates were a literal walking/talking CGI and an average tumblr user. Also one more thing that i didn't notice in the movie was a villain, was there an antagonist in this movie? I remember two henchmen one male and a female but never remembered seeing a villain. I understand their budget restrictions for making this a small scale movie but the ending helicarrier destruction was totally unnecessary waste of their cgi and budget. Now to things i like about this movie, action without too much cgi parts, the costume, Morena Baccarin and the scenes where deadpool didn't make a dumb jokes, references and quips, oh wait there wasn't any.Now to the audience, i had to share the theatre with were 12 year olds and 6 year olds with there parents who laughed whenever Deadpool appeared. Flicks like these becoming successful is the reason why movies like Mad Max and The Revenant(not the best examples but anyways)will never be commercially successful. TL;DR This flick is the greatest proof pandering to the lowest common denominator aka low iq manchildren with a sense of humor of an average big bang theory fan and 12 year olds, is the best way to make a big r rated blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a glorious marketing campaign, the "Merc with a Mouth" has finally arrived in Deadpool, a film that proves the power fans can have. In the pipeline since 2004, Deadpool was green lit after test footage leaked online during the 2014 Comic-Con. The footage was so well received that the studio had no choice but to announce Deadpool, a film his fans had been well and truly waiting for.Being an R rated film in America and a 15 over here, along with the fact he breaks the fourth wall and is very meta, Deadpool offered audiences an escape from the conventional superhero adventure we are so used to seeing. How unfortunate then that it feels like a bit of wasted opportunity.After falling in love with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and being diagnosed with multiple organ cancer, mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), is offered a chance by Ajax (Ed Skrein) to take part in an experiment that will cure his cancer.The treatment sees Wade injected with a serum designed to unlock mutated cells, and after suffering through torture at the hands of Ajax and Angel Dust (Gina Carano), Wade is left disfigured. Out for revenge on Ajax, Wade becomes Deadpool, the antihero who can't help but run his mouth.Deadpool is Ryan Reynold's passion project, he is as much a fan as those who went nuts over the leaked test footage, and he really is the only person you could imagine playing the character. He is Deadpool in the same way that Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark or Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. Reynolds' performance as Deadpool is not one for the ages but is is one that works well within the film. I've always liked Reynolds as a comedic actor and it's that skill set that brings about the film's more entertaining moments. Deadpool wastes no time in throwing us right into the action with an opening title sequence that is both funny and deliriously entertaining. From there, we see Wade's story in flashbacks until we are fully caught up and the film begins to tread that ever-so-familiar formula found in most superhero films. If only the film carried on the way it started. It moves at such a fast pace, thanks to the joke-fuelled screenplay by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, and the frantic action directed by Tim Miller, in his directorial debut. One thing that I found quite disappointing was that quite a number of the jokes cheapen the film and I didn't really take to the meta side of the character much. Deadpool was at its best when combining the action with his sense of humour.Coming to the performances, Deadpool doesn't really have a lot to shout about. Reynolds is of course the star of the show so he gets the majority of screen time and jokes, meaning that others are simply shoved to the side or wasted. T.J. Miller was pretty funny as Wade's friend, Weasel, who gets quite a few laughs but Morena Baccarin is dealt a pretty underwhelming hand as Vanessa. The villains are rather unforgettable too, Ed Skrein and Gina Carano both delivering unspectacular performances.Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) were welcome additions to aid Deadpool in his quest for revenge but even then, they don't really do much at all.The funniest moments come when the film isn't trying too hard and there is a homage to everybody's favourite fourth wall breaking character in a post credits scene that tickled me. Deadpool is certainly enjoyable however I don't really think it's as smart or funny as it thinks it is.</fullReview>

It is definitely NOT a superhero movie or a love story. I'm extremely disappointed that Marvel and Ryan Reynolds made this. It was gratuitously bloody and filled with vulgar bathroom and sex jokes. Some of the jokes might have been worth laughing at had they been in another movie, but I was too disgusted overall to crack a smile. I'm trying to think of a worse possible movie. Maybe if you remade John Wick with Jim Carrey telling jokes as he shoots people and cuts them up. If you have teenagers, I would keep them far away from it.</fullReview>

The acting and characters aren't bad, but aren't specially good, I couldn't really connect with anybody, I kinda felt Colossus was the most fleshed out character, the other just felt like clichés. The movie looks really cheap, the color grading is absolutely terrible, and the CGI goes from bad to decent. The action isn't that great also, 90% of the best action scenes and gore appeared in the trailers. I had fun and laughed a lot watching this movie, but it felt more like a stand up show than a real movie, it looked like the filmmakers were only worried on making the public laugh and didn't care about making a great movie, but it's still a lot fun just not that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first and most likely my last review but this film deserves the honor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I knew I wanted to see this film. Not because I am one of those fanatic, over the top, comic hording maniacs. But just because I am a sucker for the easy to watch super hero movies. My expectations did not exceed the ones I had prior to all of the xmen films or any other film of the same genre for that matter. This last week I had some trouble reaching my goals at work, so to reset my good mood, I asked a friend to go see this film. Without thoroughly reading reviews, I quickly scanned some headlines that already had been written about Deadpool. I seemed promising!I can ensure you with near to definite certainty, this will be my first and my last review. But this film deserves every misspelled, every typo and every sentence which in English does not fully cover that what I am trying to express to you on how much I liked this Film.Deadpool does not have loose ends, does not have moments which leave you wondering afterwards about how do they not make sense. Some people may find the abundance of humour confusing in a superhero movie, but hey, how would you be if nothing could kill you?I enjoyed every joke, every one liner, every reference to other movies. The entire audience in the cinema couldn't stop laughing. And for your information, the Dutch are the hardest audience to entertain. Now the only thing I am not sure off is that female viewers may go home with severe lack of self esteem due to the overload of extreme good looking women (and the occasional nudity.....skip that....loads of T&amp;A)I am also worried about milking Deadpool. The sequel will never be able to top the first. So unless the studio is confident they are able to make something better, my advice would be; please don't bother. Let this one become an icon. This film raised the bar and set the standard for films to come in this genre.If I was asked to say something about this film in one sentence than it would be this; Too much of anything is never a good thing, until deadpool was made...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this a super hero movie? Well yes in a way that Deadpool cannot be killed. Is this meant for kids? No. It is more violent with adult scenes and nasty jokes. For Super hero movie it more of super vengeance movie of a character taken from the movie "Good,Bad and Ugly" having the traits of all the three. X-men are comedians and Deadpool is originally a human. If I were to give a presentation of the movie it will end in three slides. Slide 1 introduction, Slide 2 Romance and Terminal Disease, Slide 3 Betrayal and vengeance. But then presentation of this movie is very good. With little content they made a good movie. For me a movie should have more content with good presentation of course. I wont call this movie as bad but the expectation after seeing the trailers were very higher. In the end trailers alone was enough for this movie. If you have seen all the trailers then you don't require to see the movie to spoil your imaginations as there is nothing more impressive to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool, masterfully played by Ryan Reynolds is very entertaining, with a lot of funny jokes and not much else.By the end of the initial sequence, the novelty will wear off, and you'll left wonder if there's anything left to see. There isn't. What follows is a torrent of one-liners between the occasional (more violent than usual) fight scene. Most of the jokes have no build up, are dick-related or pop culture references and are delivery in such an abrupt manner that you become numb to it. Worst of all, the lead characters can only interact through these jokes and seem incapable of any other kind of speech, and that's a shame.It's almost impossible to relate in any way to these characters. Some of them come as bigoted, others as one-dimensional. There's no progression, no struggle and barely any conflict. The film starts at the end and doesn't add much more to the beginning. Bound to an origin story, most of its shortcomings come from the wish of the creators to stay as close to the comics as possible. The film would certainly benefit from more creative freedom and more room to breathe.Deadpool can by appreciated by it's mere existence and by the self- aware nature of the character. It's in the meta segments that Deadpool is at it's best. But in the end, it never delivers on the promise and fails to satirize its counterparts, becoming one more addition to the super-hero movie in the process - one where it's impossible to disassociate the man inside the suit, Wade, to it's alter ego, Deadpool.Although there's much room for a much more interesting (and already confirmed sequel) Deadpool is exactly what one is expecting and that's disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny but too violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wacky humor is there, that's a plus and that's all that was needed. Unfortunately -- unlike the game -- the movie is extremely violent and full of gore and may cause nightmares. I like the jokes but find the unnecessary violence -- which includes torture -- in bad taste and it cancels out all the fun.I haven't read the comics, maybe they are equally violent, but there's a way to film a violent comedy -- even a gory one -- without making it real. Take a lesson from Peter Jackson's "Braindead".Missing from this movie is the fragmentation of his personality that pervaded the computer game. I wonder if the movie is true enough to the original character.Avoid if you have any good taste at all. Else have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please see the first line of my review of the Our Gang "comedy" "The New Pupil" for more information.Although - since 20th Century Fox, who co-produced and released this sorry waste of time *and* money - also made the equally disgusting "Myra Breckinridge" 46 years ago, maybe they should have lifted the scene from that film and inserted it somewhere into this one (possibly after the fight scene in the junkyard) where Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett were in bed together and just as they were about to "do it" after Ms. Welch dons a holster with something attached - well, I'll leave that to your imaginations - Alice Faye is seen singing "America, I Love You." That would have fit right in *very* nicely in the context of a piece of junk like this. (Or did I just give Fox and Marvel an idea for what to put in a sequel? My Lord, it makes me want to *hurl* just contemplating that!)In fact, Time Magazine put it very succinctly when they reviewed "Myra Breckinridge" in 1970; it *most definitely* also applies to "Deadpool," and I paraphrase:"'Deadpool' is about as funny as a child molester!"(Do you suppose in addition to being crack addicts and perverts, the "writers" and "director" of this crap are also closet worshipers and/or disciples of Kenneth Parnell, the creep who kidnapped Steven Stayner in 1972 when he was 10 and sexually molested him until Parnell was arrested and finally bought to justice in 1980? I *guarantee* it! And if any of them are reading my review and they're offended - GOOD!!!! Now we're EVEN!)And yet, this was the top movie in the country this week. I guess that proves very well where the mentality of the American public lies, eh? And it *ain't* in their heads! -END-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After waiting for this movie for years I was almost sure I would be disappointed with that high of expectations. But I was really happy to be wrong. The movie was full of hilarious references of pop- culture and classic movies. But the best ones was self-references of Ryan Reynolds. They implemented Deadpool's breaking of the 4th wall masterfully. The movie was both an origin story and a revenge/rescue story at the same time. It had a unique telling and it was effective. Ryan Reynolds was great, Ed Skrein was great all the cast felt genuine and they had great synergy. There was some tweaks and some characters were different than their comic book counter-parts but as a fan of Deadpool's comic's more than being fine with it I loved the said tweaks.The movie itself felt like a comic book there were scenes you could swear was panels.The action scenes were mind blowing. Most of the time the humour overshadowed the fluent action.Deadpool is just the movie for you if you can enjoy some dirty jokes and if you have not lived in a cave for the last 10 years and can understand the references.</fullReview>

If you really plan to watch it, do it at home later. I was fooled by the meta-score... you don't be! If this kind of movies succeed in the market, we're gonna see more and more of them in the future... Unfortunately, the super hero movies are getting more vulgar and empty one after another. They abuse too much of sex, blood and violence to attract the crowd. No matter what kind of effects it might have on youngsters. The detrimental effect of this type of violent scenes on children and teen have been proved by research. I see this trend alarming...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film wisely takes a cue from "Guardians of the Galaxy" with its soundtrack...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Deadpool" is the story of two like-minded individuals who fall in love amidst calamitous hardships ? and physiology-altering mutant abilities with disfiguring side effects. Former Special Forces soldier Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) works as a mercenary-for-hire out of Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Children. Running his mouth while running odious lowlifes out of business nets him a satisfying career that also inadvertently introduces him to Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), a prostitute who shares his penchant for dark humor and funereal banter. The two quickly fall in love and become engaged, only to discover shortly thereafter that Wade is afflicted with terminal cancer. Unwilling to subject Vanessa to further torment and misery, Wilson spontaneously leaves her. When a mysterious broker offers the desperate man a possible remedy, he agrees to undergo an experimental procedure that will change his life forever.Posing itself as the ultimate anti-superhero movie (with a theatrical release timed for Valentine's Day), "Deadpool" goes to great lengths to distance itself from the pack of recent Marvel entities, which have become more or less interchangeable. The problem is that it accomplishes this mission with such unyielding purposefulness that it regularly ceases to be a about a character in a film; at times, the world of Deadpool exists somewhere in between the Marvel Cinematic Universe, self-aware satire, and an alternate reality, where superheroes are recognized as products of movie studios. Fortunately, the humor tends to make up for the noncanonical bits and the occasionally unwelcome attention towards the fictionality of cinema.Crazy credits, pop culture references, animation mid-scene, nods to movie tropes ("It might further the plot," suggests T.J. Miller's Weasel, when motioning Wade to meet a black-clad man in a shadowy corner booth), and routine breaking of the fourth wall are all gimmicks to highlight the flaws of superhero pictures, as well as to mock them mercilessly. It's funny to see this skewering in action, but it becomes contrary as the film progresses, particularly as it begins to employ the very techniques and devices previously laid bare for roasting. Had "Deadpool" chosen to use only super-soldiers and human sidekicks, it would have been forgivable to see the star prancing about like an R-Rated version of "The Mask," filled with the dirty dialogue of Kevin Smith. But once Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) show up (and Angel Dust - played by Gina Carano - reveals her abilities), the cliché superhero customs turn exhausting rather than facetiously self-deprecating.The film wisely takes a cue from "Guardians of the Galaxy" with its soundtrack, utilizing fitting or contrasting music at all the right times, which helps to enhance the action and romance or make fun of various activities. Like "Kick-Ass," the main amusement comes from the comedic insight on the fallible, potentially laughable construct of superheroes, though hyperactive violence and expletive-filled wordplay strive to overshadow the cleverer humor of exposé. Sex, nudity, strip clubs, and sadistic torture also aim to darken up the typical PG-13 vibe of Marvel's better known projects. Ironically, the element that stands out the most is the love story, accentuated by sarcastic, damaged-goods morbidity, which demonstrates a quirky compatibility for two modern, sexually progressive personas stuck in a superhero movie - a superhero movie disguised as one too quick-witted to fall into that category.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

The casting for this movie was nothing less than absolute perfection, Ryan Reynolds shines with his secondary characters T.J. Miller (Weasel), Brianne Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead), and Stefan Kapicic (Colossus) providing great performances that really worked with Deadpool's character. I was taken aback, I knew I would laugh at some jokes, but not THAT many jokes. This movie, although following a by-the-book plot line, covered up the story with it's action and comedy and made it feel brand new. This movie may not have reinvented the superhero genre, but it surely provides a fun and refreshing good time while it lasts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deadpool isn't your typical mainstream comic book character, he is rude, crude, violent and not for the kids. And this movie encompasses everything that has made Wade Wilson an unforgettable comic book icon. Deadpool is one part origin story, one part love story and whole lot of ass kicking action. It's humor is unmatched in this genre and it is my belief that after the movie's release you won't be able to escape the Deadpool's grip on popular culture.While the film's villains are definitely its weakest parts, their is a plethora of things to love in this film so it's easy to look past them. The highlight are X-men guest stars Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (picked solely based on her name). Deadpool interacting with the heroic X-Men was definitely my favorite part and really gets you excited for the inevitable sequel. Deadpool is a superhero film we have yet to see grace the big screen and let's hope it starts a new trend of adult orientated superhero films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of dick and jokes and blood, but that's not a good thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me be perfectly frank. There's a very small market for the new Deadpool movie, and that seems to exclusively be teenage boys who enjoy the odd breast, decapitation, and curse word. While superhero films are all the rage today, Deadpool has always been a very niche superhero, and it seems to me like it won't exactly bring in the female crowd (although I could be entirely wrong about that), and it's rated R (mostly due to its gratuitous violence and nudity), so let's just nix the children right now. This leaves a very small window for the movie, but it's success depends on them, and I feel as if it WILL succeed, although it doesn't entirely deserve to."Deadpool" follows mercenary Wade Wilson (a typical Ryan Reynolds) as he is lured into some dark, dingy underground lab in order to receive experimental medical attention in order to cure him of his debilitating cancer. Of course, as if often the case with these superhero films, things to awry, and Wilson is left horribly disfigured, much to his chagrin. This leads him to adopting the Deadpool moniker and beginning his violent adventure to find and kill the man responsible (Ed Skrein). If this sounds overly- familiar, that's because it is. While the movie may want to subvert typical superhero expectations and tropes, it ends up being entirely unoriginal, which is definitely a downside to this otherwise well- intentioned film.It seems to me like the only thing this movie has going for it is its violence and adult-oriented content, but even that is highly unoriginal. I'm thinking specifically of what last year's "Kingsmen" did to the spy movie, or even what "Kick-Ass" did to this very genre. It presents an atypical hero in an atypical movie, full of blood, carnage, swearing, and nudity that you wouldn't otherwise find in a Hollywood blockbuster superhero film. "Deadpool" wants to market itself as a highly original film that's regarded as an intelligent subversion of superhero tropes, but it often falls into the very own tropes that it's parodying that it loses most of its originality and muster. While teenagers will undoubtedly gobble this movie up because it's filled with boobies and gore and swearing (and that's cool for teenagers, specifically boys), everyone else will find it a merely average, watchable movie that fails at its own ambitions.Ryan Reynolds is good in the role, as his typical sarcastic humor fits the character of Deadpool perfectly. It's also genuinely stylish, and some of the jokes are admittedly very clever and funny. I'm thinking specifically of the opening credits, where the usual "directed by," "written by" titles are replaced by funny declarations like "from this douchebag," or other, similar titles. It's an original concept, but unfortunately, the film loses its own way immediately after these credits and devolves into a typical superhero film, just with the odd severed head.For fans of dick jokes, this movie is sure to bring tears to the eyes. But dick jokes can only get you so far, and you can only tell enough of them before it starts to get tiring. Seriously, there's enough jokes about the male genitalia here that it could fill a book and become the Bible of dick jokes. But for anyone who isn't 17 years old, this can get very annoying and unfunny, as it often does. The movie aims for these types of jokes because it isn't what you'd find in a superhero movie, but the film overshoots its own goal and tires its audience out well before the movie thinks it's told enough of them. The same thing goes for the violence. We've seen enough bloody violence in cinema before that these instances are nothing new, yet the movie is so smug and so naive as to think that we'd be amazed at how subversive it is being. It's not. We've seen this all before, we've seen it better, and we've seen it funnier.In the end, "Deadpool" becomes what it is parodying. The movie wants to make fun of superhero origin tropes, but it becomes one in the process. Wade gets bad news, he becomes the guinea pig of some form of experimentation, he gets magic powers, and he fights his way to the big bad in order to stop him. The only difference here is that his path is littered with tits and severed heads rather than handcuffs. If that's enough for you, you'll be thoroughly entertained. For everyone else, maybe you'd best to rewatch "Kick- Ass" and ponder at what could have been.C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most vulgar, ugly, and distasteful movies I have ever seen. My husband and I got up and walked out early in the film. It contained filthy, obscene and crude language and actions in every scene. It was shockingly dark in humor. I can't believe this was a Marvel character. I am appalled at what the movie industry considers entertaining. The character claimed he had a hard childhood and was an "antihero". So he just chose to kill because he enjoyed it? Very sad to know many people find this humorous, but not so surprising in this day and time. Warped and twisted character. If you want to throw away good money, waste your time and be disgusted, then this movie is definitely for you. Not even worth a 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't a bad movie but I came in with high expectations. In the end, the funny moment cannot save a movie without a story. If by throwing in some punchlines and some CGIs, the studio can expect a big pay day, I will be very disappointed of the audience preferences. We should have better superhero movies.In addition, a superhero movie is as good as the villain in the movie, and I will have to say this one is rather pedestrian. Normally, bad people still have their reasons to do the things they do, and it needs to be sufficiently explained and exploited to tell a good story. I am not sure about the bad guys in this movie, there really isn't an epic struggle to be remembered, no matter how much CGI is in the film.</fullReview>

The fact that this film has already been given an 8.9 is, quite frankly, disturbing and one of the many reasons god doesn't talk to us anymore. The casting is honestly terrible and Deadpool should have only ever have been played by Mark Wahlberg. The Fourth Wall is broken too many times and him knowing he is in a film is also one of the other factors ruining the film. The scripting is terrible and the jokes are poorly written. I feel the film has only been given an 8.9 as a tribute to the Director and the fact that he has ruined his career with this terribly bad film. Personally, I would rather scrape my eyes out with a spoon than watch this poorly made, horrible film.</fullReview>
