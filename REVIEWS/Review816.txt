		<shortDescription>Absolutely hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I have seen the original Robin Hood movies as well, but I never had such a good time when watching them as I had with this one. It's just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies (Winston Churchil, The Godfather...).I recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie. To those who think Robin Hood shouldn't be messed with, you're wrong, but you better don't watch it because you'll probably be offended by it. I give this movie an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes a real man to wear tights!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I first saw this movie. I was babysitting for a friend of my mums, and one of the kids suggested we watch it. Thinking it was the frankly laughable 'Prince of Thieves' they were slipping into the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom, What I got came as a shock, a pleasant one I'll admit, but still a shock.Now, you all know the Robin Hood legend don't you? I shall explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, nicking money here and there and giving it to people who needed it, all the while seducing the beautiful Maid Marion, and vexing the Sheriff of Nottingham and prince john. That's the basics! Now, on with the review.This movie was released in 1993, and is a take off of the whole Robin Hood legend and a p--- take of Prince of Thieves in particular.Loosely following the legend, Robin of Loxley is first encountered in an Arabic prison during the third century crusades, and together with a 'Moor' as they were called in those days, he executes a cunning escape with a cellmate, Asneeze.After escaping, Asneeze beseeches Robin to find his son Atchoo, a foreign exchange student in England and look out for him. This Robin vows to do! Robin swims back to England.He returns to his home, Loxley castle to find it being wheeled away on the back of the cart by Bailiffs, and goes through he sorrowful revelation that his father, dog, cat, and even the goldfish are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, he finds the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin sitting on the toilet with a Jazz mag in Braille. The hilarity continues throughout the movie.As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the sheriff of Rottingham, who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on King Richards's kingdom while he's away.Those familiar with the movies Mel Brooks has previously directed will have some small idea of what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for Dracula-dead and loving it and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, which range from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie, with never more than a minute between laughs.Cary Elwes (incidentally the only English man to play Robin Hood in a movie), who many of you will know from Princess Bride brings his cheeky grinning twinkle eyed presence to this movie, and does a wonderful job. From outlandish heroic posturing, to a wickedly sexy glance, he really is amazingly funny. And the man looks better in tights than I do!Richard Lewis is hilarious as the whiny, arrogant Prince John with the ever-changing mole. He gets the sissy-boy behaviour down to a tee, and his whinging American vocalisations are great. All the way through the movie, a mole on his face constantly changes position: it starts on his left cheek, then over to his right cheek, then his chin, then his forehead, before going back to it's original place. This is a subtle joke based on the mole on Alan Rickman when he played the sheriff in Prince Of ThievesRoger Rees as the sleazy sheriff of Rottingham is marvellously slimy and nasty, and has some great lines throughout the film.There are some faces here you'll be familiar with from other Brooks films. For instance Robert Ridgely, playing the hangman in this film also played the hangman in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He likes to add subtle references to his earlier films too; with several in this film that die-hard Brooks fans will easily spot. Those who watched History of the World part 1 will recognise the music to the song 'Men in Tights'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and snogs Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) utters the line 'it's good to be a king', one of his lines in History of the world.The whole cast is wonderfully comedic, even those with only a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humour to themWhat makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my own opinion are all the improvised scenes. Although there was a script of sorts, some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves, such as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) prays for Rottingham in her bed, and he falls through the ceiling, landing right where she wanted him, which was totally devised and thought out by the two actors.There are few special effects, and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerised camera trickery.The soundtrack is memorable, with some very funny songs, and a couple of cheesy love songs. You'll be singing 'Men in tights' or at least humming it to yourself, for weeks.The rating is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the film, except in the use of double entendre, and one utterance of sh!t, and violence is minimal. In fact I'd go as far as to say non-existent, apart from a few comedy fight scenes.A great fun film that adults and children alike will enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a funny film and I like it a lot. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood to a tee. This is, of course, the usual good vs evil with Robin against the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. The humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part, but still works well. A comedy for a night when you don't want to have to think much, it's well worth a rent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is. It's funny from start to finish, none of the comedy is overdone or boring. The music is marvelous, as is the choreography of both dancing and fighting. The acting is pretty much what you would normally expect from this type of movie... Elwes is a great comedian, and makes a good Robin. The plot is typical Robin Hood, more or less everything from the legend is fit into this movie(and spoofed majorly). If you like Mel Brooks, or you're just a fan of silly humor, or you're just dying to watch a good parody of the legend of Robin Hood, this is definitely the film for you. The HBO First Look special on the film is also worth watching, and in that, you may want to keep watching throughout the credits, too. I'd recommend it to any fan of Mel Brooks movies, and to people who enjoy silly humor. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this and Spaceballs are Brooks doing his best "family" films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many a child born in the 1980's, I grew up on the Mel Brooks films that weren't necessarily the 'racier' ones like Blazing Saddles and History of the World part 1 (I saw those, of course, though not as frequently as now), but the ones meant for the "whole family", Spaceballs, and this film. I knew at the time I wasn't seeing great art, but just a campy, goofy, though always laugh-worthy take on Robin Hood and/or adventure movies. But calling it a family movie in quotes means that a) adults really can enjoy it as much as kids, if not more because of the little in-jokes and silly vulgarities, and b) once a kid sees it, when he revisits it, as I have a few times, it's still as fresh but with some things not quite understood the first time around. It's a comedy that is not only filled with jokes at Robin Hood movies and other movies (Godfather of course, as well as little mentions for other movies of modern times), but one that references Brooks's own movies as well; this is a filmmaker who isn't above poking fun at even his own style.Basic story- Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best turns) returns home from the crusades to see things are in peril with King Richard gone, and so goes forth to reclaim his land and to, naturally, rob the rich to feed the poor. Along the way he meets Achoo (Dave Chappelle), butts heads with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the Sheriff, and of course still pines for the love of Maid Marian. This, of course, is the usual clothesline for Brooks to let the comedy run off into the scenes, and while sometimes a joke may not work or might become stale on a repeat viewing, so much of it sticks that it's hard not to chuckle. It also helps that a couple of bits are some of the best in any Brooksfilm, such as the Godfather bit (Dom DeLouise at his very best), Brooks's own cameo as the Rabbbi, Lewis and Chappelle's acting turns, and an endless slew of quotable lines and a couple of tongue-in-cheek songs. Some of it is obvious, yes, some of it just takes right from the pages of Blazing Saddles, sure, but is it a good time for the right crowd? Definitely- and for parents who grew up on the 70's Brooks work, it is a fantastic way to introduce the young ones to his work through this (even the suggestive sex jokes and such are not R-rated, all in good fun).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well. Tracey Ullman co-stars as Prince John's personal witch Latrine who has her eyes on the Sheriff.Will Robin find his merry men? How far will the Prince go to throw his weight around in the absence of his father? Why does the Sheriff hate Robin so much? To find out you'll have to watch ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS!! Check out the hilarious cameo by Dom De Luise who plays the Duke of Jersey.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big! lol) and everyone else!There were some moments of course, the film tried to make a comedic scene out of but you don't necessarily laugh at it,.... but OK.This is the second time Cary Elwes and Patrick Stewart appeared in a film together by the way, they both worked on "Lady Jane" in 1986, and it was fun to see them, 7 years later, older, awwww.It's definitely worth watching, quite hilarious indeed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very funny Mel Brooks movie and probably stands as his last great comic hurrah.Although not up to the standard of his masterpiece "HIGH ANXIETY" it is certainly a better and actually more exciting Robin Hood adventure than that soporific outing for Kevin Costner.It is worth noting that Brooks had parodied Robin before in the short lived US TV series "WHEN THINGS WERE ROTTEN." This is much better though and Cary Elwes scores as a Robin Hood in the style of the great Errol Flynn.Look out too for Matthew Porretta,former star of the excellent syndicated show "THE NEW ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD" as Will Scarlett O'Hara.All in all,a good fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, Mel's been here before.Any of you remember a little TV series Mel wrote and created called "When Things were Rotten", starring Dick Gautier as our man Robin? I do, and the series reran in my mind many times while watching Mel's big-screen take.I guess he had to do this to take a few shots at Kevin Costner's "Prince of Thieves", but this one also takes aim at and makes points of reference to "White Men Can't Jump", Bruce Lee films, Larry King, seders and even brings out the reserves from Mel's projects of yore (McCann, Van Patten, De Luca, De Luise).Some gags work, some don't but as always, Mel tries. Too bad he's working under the restrictions of that darned PG rating. What Mel could have done in his heyday with an R rated "Robin Hood"! Though admittedly, the finale of Robin's (Elwes') serenade to Maid Marian (Yasbeck) earns big laughs. Loved finding out the first name of the Sheriff of Rottingham (Rees), as well. You will, too.As I've said before, any Mel is good Mel. If you've seen any Robin Hood movie, good. You'll get a lot of the references here. Even with the Mafia connections, hot tubs, and the new Club for horses.Five stars. Bless you!</fullReview>

This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!!The musical numbers were so imaginative! EVERYONE when watching any film about that period of time will notice men in tights and realise how different it is to today's attire and how funny we would find today's male population if they wore tights day in day out! The idea of dedicating a song to butch men dancing in tights was so fresh how can anyone NOT laugh!!! (Plus also, seeing hip-hop rappers doing ballet is always hysterical-as a dancer also, I've done ballet and hip hop and danced with men who've had to do both....it still cracks me up each time!!!)I love this film, if anyone hasn't seen it yet, don't listen to the critic above...watch it and then decide for yourself!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bottom of the barrel of Brooks Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks may have produced, directed, and starred in some of the funniest movies since the 1960s, but for his final effort, this movie is really sad.Brooks had fallen into the parity genre by this time and while his earlier effort, Spaceballs, had many memorable moments, this is nothing but a series of worn out and rehashed jokes. The same jokes worked in Blazing Saddles and its successors, but by this time they had lost there way.I hope that people don't think that this is the best of Brooks, take time to see Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or the Producers.Skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo. The characters were all very well planned out and all added their own little quirks to the movie. I highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Brooks' best but still hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993)Robin Hood: Men in Tights is far from Mel Brooks' best film, but it definitely is hilarious. As far as his films that parody other film franchises go, its no Young Frankenstein but it is better than Dracula: Dead and Loving it. Not the greatest acting but few comedies ever do. There may not be any great performances but they are funny performances. I don't think I would have thought that Cary Elwes was the right choice to play the lead in this film, but they made the right choice by picking him. He gave a very Princess Bride like performance that worked out well. Dave Chappell gave a good debut performance, though he definitely wasn't as funny as he would become later on. Mark Blankfield as Blinkin I think is probably the most remembered character in the film and its for good reason, he is hilarious. The film is full of great Mel Brooks style jokes and gags that would make The Marx Brothers proud. Some jokes are misses and are slightly painful due to how unfunny they are but those come rare, its usually consistently funny. It's probably my favorite Mel Brooks movie after Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. Though it is a little less liked and a little dumber, I think fans of those two films will still like this one. Before you watch Robin Hood Men in Tights I would suggest you see at least one other version of Robin Hood, to understand the story they are making fun of. Im sure the film would still be funny who didn't know the story but I think some knowledge of the legend would make it better. Anyone who likes Mel Brooks, anyone who likes Robin Hood and anyone who likes comedies should give it a try. Some people might find it a little annoying and dumb at times but I think most people will at least get enough laughs to like it. 8/10</fullReview>

I must say, what was funny back then is still funny now. The movie gains strength out of the nonsense humor. People who don't like this kind of humor, don't watch. People who want to have a fun night full of laughter en weird jokes with friends (or alone) will surely enjoy this. Have you ever wanted to see someone swim from Israel to England and once arrived, see the name England written, Hollywood style, right of the beach? Or how about a bunch of men dance and sing to the CanCan? A sheriff who "pronounce can't sentence one correctly single" oh I'm sorry, I meant a sheriff who can't pronounce one single sentence correctly. That's just a couple of the million funny things in this movie. I'd say, put your mind to sleep, invite people to come watch, make popcorn and have a good time.

		<shortDescription>So much talent rotting in a stew of poo.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's obvious that Mel Brooks' best days were behind him in this costume comedy adventure that seems to be made for 10 year old boys. Sexy Cary Elwes goes back to "The Princess Bride" territory and finds that he's now in a mid evil Saturday morning cartoon. With Norm Lewis as wicked King John and Roger Rees as the evil Sheriff of Rottingham, Elwes has an easy chance of defeating the bad guys. Amy Yasbeck is a rather lame Maid Marian, while Brooks' toilet humor comes to life in Tracey Ullman's hideously crude sorceress, Latrine. Cameos by various familiar faces, including Brooks himself, can't aid this from being anything more than an outrageously dumb and desperate attempt to capture the success of his '70s masterpieces.Novelty musical numbers may have work when done in small doses in Brooks earlier films, but here he obviously was not prepared for writing a full musical score. Who would believe that less than a decade later he would have a smash hit on Broadway by writing the songs for the for the stage version of "The Producers"? This has the comic equivalent of a 20 minute short that appears to have been rushed together. Broadway had better luck in spoofing British history with "Monty Python's Spamalot" and "Something Rotten" where modern cultural references were actually funny and appropriate rather than just randomly placed and really having no effect. One funny line has Elwes indicate that unlike other Robin Hood's (Kevin Costner, anyone?), he can speak with a genuine English accent, and sure enough, he is right. Elwes is charming and as perhaps the only subtle humor that this film has, but repeat of old gags that Brooks is overused just come off as eye rolling and dated. It simply just is not funny. Comedy truly is a very difficult thing to do, and simply by throwing funny people into an allegedly funny script doesn't mean that you're going to end up with a funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilariously dumb!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film! Although most critics panned it and it didn't do that great at the box office, I honestly think this one of Brooks's best movies. I remember as a kid being a huge Robin Hood Prince of Thieves fan, still am, but I loved the idea of a spoof on the legend of Robin Hood and saw this film for the first time as a kid. I didn't get all the jokes back then, but I thought it was hilarious nonetheless. I'll admit, this isn't the most intelligent comedy out there (still leagues ahead of American Pie and Superbad though), but it's witty in the sense that Mel Brooks knows how to spoof so good he basically invented it. This spoofs a ton of great movies and actors, and while it's cheesy at times (it's supposed to be) it's also funny. Cary Elwes is a great comedic Robin Hood, but he's got a great supporting cast in Aachoo, Blinkin, the Sheriff of Rottingham, and Prince John. Is it typical Mel Brooks? For sure! That's why I love it. It's got random bits of hilarity. My personal favorite is the spoof of The Godfather where a character very reminiscent of Don Corleone is planning the assassination of Robin Hood with the Sheriff. The actor sounds and acts just like Marlon Brando, it was hilarious. It was random, but hilarious. This is a silly comedy. That's what it was intended to be. The thing about Men in Tights is that while it's supposed to be a spoof of Robin Hood, it ends up being a great take on the lore while trying to spoof it. It's another story of the classic legend, just with a bit of a comedic twist on it. I recommend it to fans of Robin Hood, Mel Brooks, or fans of spoof movies in general. Some people might not like it because they want sex jokes 24/7, but if you want hilarious stupidity, this is a great movie to watch. I wouldn't put it on par with Monty Python and the Holy Grail, but it's one of my favorite comedies. Check it out and remember "A mime is a terrible thing to waste."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This *is* Robin Hood - and why not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hold "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" in higher regards than the Costner and Crowe versions, and note that it's closer to the traditional story than either. Yes, it's satirical because of the mere fact that this one is funny, has intentional anachronisms, and has allusions to 1990s pop culture. I did cringe at a few parts: the rap scene, the Nat-X, and a handful of bad jokes, but here's the catch - they are *supposed* to be bad. Mel Brooks wanted me to squirm at the silly puns. That is not detraction, the movie did *exactly* what it was made to do. If comedy is serious business, then this movie is as serious as the IRS, all the while being as silly as... well, as silly as Mel Brooks. It is, however, no less Robin Hood than Costner's (the Costner version left out the beloved archery contest!) and maybe the best all- around Robin Hood movie since Errol Flynn both in spite of and because of Mel Brooks's unapologetic humour from whom none are safe!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Brooks rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks cinema is not meant for everyone, more-over, I feel his non-sense cinema hardly results in hoarders. I am a huge fan, as the cult filmmaker has always made me laugh, in his logic-killing films, which have been parodies mainly. And, 'Robin Hood: Men In Tights', a parody, thankfully ranks amongst his good flicks.The legend of Robin Hood is told in the most bizarre way possible. Men In Tights, and it's easily understood that Brooks is in a chirpy mood. And he is. About a 105 minutes long, this now cult film offers ample laughter to it's viewer, or at least to a permanent Brooks buff.Mel Brooks is sure to go down in history for making such absurdly entertaining parodies. It takes courage to make a film like this that makes no-sense, but Brooks sincerity shines.All the actors are ordered to deliver dumb lines and overact in every way possible. Cary Elwes as Robin Hood, is superb. Roger Rees is so spontaneous as the bad guy. He gets it right from start to end. Richard Lewis and Amy Yasbeck also deliver well. Others enjoy their parts and lend good support.On the whole, only for Mel Brooks devotees. Otherwise, stay away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Mel Brooks. It's a comedy. What do you expect?This is not quite "When Things Were Rotten" (the short-lived series from the 70's based on the Robin Hood story), but it's fun. Cary Elwes is a great choice for Robin Hood. While it parodies many of the Robin Hood movies made, it really "takes the wind" out of the Costner film. Lots of word play and site gags. Just typical Mel Brooks.This is far from Mel's best, but it's still a fun romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even worth a chuckle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are reasons Mel Brooks gave up his directing career. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is one of them. From the man behind some of the greatest works of spoof comedy ever to grace the screen such as Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs comes one of the stupidest, driest, most pathetically unfunny spoofs I've ever seen. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is a spoof of the typical Robin Hood story, chock full of over the top gags that feel more like someone desperately trying to be as funny as Mel Brooks and failing miserably. It is shocking to see how someone can go from Blazing Saddles to this mess of a spoof. Why Mel Brooks? Why? A Robin Hood spoof from the king of spoofs should have been great. There is a world of possibilities when it comes to spoofing a tale as classic as Robin Hood, but this film picks from the absolute worst possibilities and floods us with terrible gags and ridiculously unfunny jokes. You know it is a problem when I literally can't refrain from voicing my opinion during the movie while I watch it alone. It basically goes like this. Robin Hood addresses a crowd and says to them, "Gentlemen! Lend me your ears!" The crowd then proceeds to remove their ears and throw them at Robin Hood, at which point I hang my head in shame and say out loud, "Oh my God. Really?" And this didn't happen once, or twice, or even three times, it happened over and over again. One bad pun after another led me to feel almost sick by the end of this movie. I laughed maybe once during the entire film, something that should not happen when watching a Mel Brooks spoof.Another lesson to be learned here is that the fourth wall shtick is only funny for so long. The scene in Spaceballs where Dark Helmet and his crew watch themselves on TV after putting in the Spaceballs VHS is plenty funny. The entire ending of Blazing Saddles where the entire setting becomes an old west sound stage is hysterical. These gags in Robin Hood: Men in Tights don't work at all. Characters running into the cameras and cameras breaking through windows as they zoom in too close to Maid Marion while she bathes are tired, old, and simply not funny. You have to know when to stop and Mel Brooks just got ahead of himself and took his once clever gag to the point where it was just plain miserable.Robin Hood: Men in Tights is missing one of the essential elements to any comedy and that's the whole being funny thing. It is an underrated element, but in its absence we are treated to an absolutely terrible film. And that is just what this film is. Terrible. I couldn't even force myself to pretend it was funny, much less actually laugh at its idiocracy and puns so terrible they would make cable news anchors cringe. I hope Mel Brooks was ashamed of himself after releasing this movie. I never thought he could so unfunny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Mel Brooks Silliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like Mel Brooks' style of parody then you'll love this movie, because it is quintessentially Brooks. Unfortunately, Mel Brooks has never been among my favourites, and this movie pretty much sums up all the reasons. It's a silly movie, frankly. Now, there's nothing wrong with that. Silly, mindless fun can be good for the soul, I suspect. But the thing that makes the silliness work is that it has to be funny. This really wasn't. Admittedly there were a handful of scenes that made me chuckle a bit. The fight between Robin and Little John was humorous, as was Blinkin explaining the fate of Robin's family after Robin's return from the Crusades. But those funny scenes were few and far between. For the most part the silliness of this movie was just that - silly. It was clear from the start that no one involved in this project was taking this very seriously. That's no criticism. This isn't intended to be taken seriously - not even by the actors I'm sure. Cary Elwes was fine as Robin of Locksley. There was nothing particularly wrong with any of the performances. The movie is filled with quite intentional future anachronisms (references to Pablo Picasso, Winston Churchill, George Bush and Mark Twain spring to mind) and even pokes some fun at Kevin Costner's performance as Robin Hood in the 1991 movie "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," as Elwes notes for all the world to hear that this Robin speaks with an English accent! Brooks makes sure that he gives himself a part as "Rabbi Tuckman" - this movie's version of Friar Tuck.Yes, it's all in good fun. It's just a shame that the good fun couldn't have been funnier. But it is typical Mel Brooks. His fans will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched this film, all I could keep asking myself was "Hasn't this been done before?". Then I remembered the old Mel Brooks' TV series "When Things Were Rotten", which also skewered the Robin Hood legend...and this movie proves that Mel did it before, and did it better to boot.(As a side note, there was also a made-for-TV movie called "The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood", starring George Segal and Morgan Fairchild. I seem to remember it favorably, but it's been so long since I saw it that I don't feel I should try to make any comparisons at this time.)The casting was better than the plot; Cary Elwes was a believable Robin Hood and I felt that Amy Yasbeck played a reasonable Maid Marion, considering the way her character was written. However, ten years from now will anyone understand why we had a group of black homeboys rapping the introduction, or why David Chappelle's character (Ahchoo) wears his hat backwards?It's an OK movie...but Mel Brooks has done much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite Mel Brooks Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While most people wouldn't call this Mel Brook's best, I personally adore this movie more than I could any other spoof - it is hilarious, witty, and Carey Elwes gives a spectacular over- the-top performance of the ever-so-sexy friend-to-the-poor. Amy Yasbeck's Marian is absolutely hilarious (to begin with), although her breathy, "Ah'm so HEPPY!" can get a bit annoying. And, of course, the roll-in-the-aisle script makes this billionth remake of the classic tale the best of the lot!It begins in the land of the Arabs, where Robin of Loxley is imprisoned for loyalty to King Richard. With the help of fellow prisoner Asneeze (imprisoned for jay-walking), Robin manages to escape. Asneeze helps him back to England, only asking him that he find and look after his son, Achoo (heh). Robin finds Achoo, but right after he does so, he finds that his father, mother, brothers, dog Pongo, goldfish Goldy, and his cat have all died, and his lands have been repossessed by the wicked Prince John. Thus, Robin begins to fight for his rights, along with Achoo, Blinkin, the blind servant, Will Scarlet (O'Hara), and, of course, Little John, who, in real life, is very big.Featuring such cameos as Dom DeLuise as the Don, and Mel Brooks himself as Rabbi Tuckman, Robin Hood: Men in Tights is my absolute favourite Mel Brooks creation, and, by far, my favourite Robin Hood ever! 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike other Robin Hoods I do it with an English accent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very enjoyable spoof, but when watching it one thing stuck in my mind. It was when Robin said, "Unlike other Robin Hoods I do it with an English accent" which of cause was said as a joke to Kevin Cosner's "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves". But as I was thinking of other past Robin Hoods, I was reminded of two other Robin Hoods without English accents. One was Dick Gutier on a TV show called "When Things Were Rotten" and the other was George Segal in a TV movie called, "The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood". Both projects were produced by a short Jew from Brooklyn born with the name of Melvin Kaminsky. I wonder if Mel Brooks knows of this man.</fullReview>

The talented ensemble cast bring great performances and comic timing to perfection and the script is tight and clever. Richard Lewis is very good as is Mel Brooks, Amy Yasbeck and an hysterical Tracy Ullmann but the standout performance is Cary Elwes' smart, funny and suave take off of Robin Hood. With his boyish good looks and charm he epitomizes swashbucklingly sexy. For another sexy Cary Elwes film see The Princess Bride.

		<fullReview>Words cannot describe how much I love this film. Mel Brooks struck gold when he decided to create a spoof of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Elwes, to be frank, makes a better Robin Hood than Costner (to be honest HIS best moment was in Dances With Wolves). Chock full of hilarity, jokes and gaffs and one liners, if you're looking for laughs, you'll certainly find them here.All the cast are clearly having huge fun with the material, though hats off to the Sheriff of 'Rottingham' who stands out here and was the absolute highlight of the film. Prince John should also get a mention and Patrick Stewart has a short but memorable performance as King Richard.General craziness includes Prince John's ever moving mole, Latrine's life size cardboard cut out of Rottingham, remote controlled castle doors and highlighted exit signs, a Mexican wave at the archery contest, and swimming from Jerusalem to Dorset...to name a few.There are also some classic quotes:Prince John: 'And why should the people listen to you?' Robin: 'Because unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak with an English accent.'Friar (to Rottingham): 'Mervin? Your name is Mervin?'Mel Brooks has done a wonderful job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Godawful film! When Things Were Truly and Utterly Rotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is on Epix right now. GODDAMN what an awful movie. I like Mel Brooks. In a list of the top 10 funniest movies I have ever seen, I would probably place at least 3 of his films: Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, and High Anxiety. (Have never seen The Producers - the original with Wilder and Mostel - but I understand it is great, too.) So what happened here? Mel Brooks has simply forgotten how to be funny. I knew something was starting to go very wrong when I saw Spaceballs. It was the beginning of the end. While there were a few chuckles and 1 or 2 inspired bits (the endless ship at the beginning comes to mind) overall, it was a series of really bad puns and humor that few over the age of 12 would laugh at.Robin Hood - Men in Tights just took this drivel to a whole different level with bad writing, excruciatingly bad and embarrassing performances, and is just agony to watch. Retreads of old jokes, ("It's good to be king", "Hey, Abbott!") and truly unfunny parodies of what I'm still trying to get my head around calling a genre. (While the Robin Hood legend has been told and retold countless times, I'm not sure that qualifies it as a "genre") The sad thing is that Brooks himself did the whole Robin Hood thing much better in his mid-70s TV series, "When Things Were Rotten." There should have been an additional qualifier in the title of this waste of celluloid: "Robin Hood - Men in Tights - When Things Were Truly and Utterly Rotten"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those men of Sherwood and the women who'd like to love them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Robin Hood legend and swashbuckler films in general get the Mel Brooks treatment in Robin Hood: Men In Tights. What that means is that a lot of movie clichés are broadly winked at, conventions are smashed and lots of laughs to be had.Robin Hoods from Douglas Fairbanks to Kevin Costner probably saw lots of potential for a few winks themselves that Cary Elwes saw here. Our Robin here is all that one expects from a hero, brave, loyal, and true, a great fighter and would like to be a great lover if it weren't for that chastity belt that Amy Yasbeck as Maid Marian wears. Way back in those days many a maiden was put in one and I wouldn't be surprised if that was also a gift from King Richard to Errol Flynn for Olivia DeHavilland. Like a true Mel Brooks hero, Elwes is also a bit thick.Kevin Costner's Robin Hood had a black cast member kind of grafted into the film so Brooks goes one better, he has two. A very hip Moor played by Isaac Hayes gifts charge of his son an 'exchange student' to a returning Elwes to England. A rapping Dave Chappelle is a nice addition to the mix.Two of my favorites were Tracey Ullman as a witch and Mel Brooks as Rabbi Tuck. As King Richard himself gives the bride away in the end, all we can do is quote from another classic comedy, "a royal wedding, Mazeltov". It's a Mel Brooks film so you know it will be great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, I remember back in the Summer of 1993 when I was a kid. I was in the kitchen with my sister, I was probably home alone with her. She had the T.V. on, and since this was a new movie at the time, she was watching like a documentary or something on T.V. advertising this movie. I remember around the same time when I was also alone with her in the kitchen, and we were watching another documentary advertising a movie that came out around the same time, Dennis The Menace. I don't remember this Robin Hood Men In Tights Documentary I saw with my sister that well. I do remember how the documentary showed a memorable comedic scene from the movie, where Robin Hood knocks all those knights/suits of armor down domino style. Anyway, I didn't see the movie back then and I wouldn't look into it until over 20-years later. So far, I've seen it twice this year. This movie isn't talked about that much, and I wouldn't really think about it, until that time of seeing the documentary on T.V. with my sister somehow came back to me, and also that scene where he knocks the knights down domino style. I decided to look into it, and have seen it twice on T.V.Again, this movie doesn't seem like it's a movie talked about so much. I don't remember anybody talking about it or seeing friends watching it, as I wouldn't really think about the movie for 20+years later. I told my sister, the same sister I watched the documentary with about seeing this movie, and she remembers how she saw the movie a really long time ago. Also, how this movie stars Cary Elwes I'd see my college friends watching probably the movie we are most familiar with him in, The Princess Bride.About Cary Elwes, he is a great and likable character in this movie playing Robin Hood. The only other movie I can think of that I've seen him in, is Twister. I'm sure I've seen him in other movies, I saw Liar Liar a long time ago, but don't remember him in it. Seeing how comedic he is in this movie, and a character we'd like from Princess Bride, along with a hero in both movies, I feel bad that Twister turned him into a character we weren't supposed to like. He seems like he's too nice of a person to fall under that category.Now about watching a Robin Hood movie, you might ask is this supposed to be an action movie featuring Robin Hood, an educational movie about who he was, or in less likelihood, a Comedy? You could probably guess with the title of the movie, Men In Tights, it's a comedy. The whole movie is comedic from start to finish.What really makes this movie funny, this movie is supposed to take place in the 12th Century. However, they intentionally have so many modern day references throughout the movie. It seems to make a movie more entertaining if they take place in the older days, but include modern references where you see people in ancient clothing and ancient backgrounds doing things like rapping as we see in this movie. The modern day references in this movie were very well done, enough for me to not believe this movie is over 20-years old. It doesn't feel that old with all the humor and modern references that clearly work for today, over 20-years later. It also is a pretty happy movie, it will keep you laughing, but also make you feel good. The humor in this movie also seems like humor we get in Austin Powers movies, only the difference this time is the hero is Robin Hood.So, I have to say it took me 2 decades to check this movie out. If you haven't seen it, I'd strongly recommend you see it. You'll get good laughs from this movie, and it will probably leave you feeling happy inside. I'm sure you'd also think this movie doesn't seem so old with all the modern references that clearly work for today. This movie isn't my favorite movie, but it's a good underrated comedy, that ought to be better known.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is Academy Award winner Mel Brooks' take on the famous Robin Hood story, especially on the Kevin Costner film from shortly before. I am not too familiar with Brooks' other works, but I kinda liked these 105 minutes here. There were a handful really funny scenes and some also that were not so entertaining as for every decent comedy. Maybe it was a bit too long for its own good, but then again they may have cut some of the scenes I liked the best if they had kept this shorter. I am not really familiar with the actors in here except Richard Lewis who I knew from "Curb Your Enthusiasm", which is usually a problem as I like seeing familiar faces, but here it worked well nonetheless.It is tough for me to point out a favorite scene or joke in here, but I preferred the action-based jokes more than the plays on words with one character for example constantly, as a recurring joke, messing up his sentences by mixing up syllables or words. That became repetitive at some point. The spoof scenes are possible the best aspect of this film. I have only seen the very old Errol Flynn movie when it comes to Robin Hood, but it's easy to see resemblance on many occasions. Overall, I must say that this was a pretty good watch, certainly one of the better comedies of 1993 I'm sure. So yeah, this film is over 20 years old and even if Mel Brooks was already in his late 60s back then, he is still alive and kickin'. He turns 90 this year and I am positive that his film here is one of his finest efforts. Even if it never reaches true greatness, I give this one a thumbs up and recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Turn back time 10 years or so and ask me, a kid in his early teens, what his favorite movie would be. Surely Robin Hood: Men in Tights would be his answer. A huge Mel Brooks fan growing up (and still am), this very movie was my favorite Brooks flick. I just loved all the silliness and weirdness, especially when the characters broke the fourth wall. Still really funny, I've certainly grown tired of some jokes. This mostly because I've seen it waaay ton many times by now. Also my "thing" with the fourth wall has sort of died out. Still, this certainly is an enjoyable picture with lots of memorable performances and jokes. Cary Elwes certainly stands out - he surely is the perfect Robin Hood, but nonetheless: the main fast overall is really fun to match and makes for a really fun film.Favourite performance: Cary Elwes as Robin Hood Favourite quote: "Because, unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak with an English accent."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and entertaining Brooks film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a parody of the Kevin Costner vehicle Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves from 1991 and 1938's The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Errol Flynn. Cary Elwes even bears a passing resemblance to Flynn, seen even more with the copying of Flynn's Robin facial hair and costume: a leather yeoman's vest, white shirt, green leggings, and a feathered cap. Everything a medieval forest outlaw needs besides his sword and longbow. Like Costner's Robin Hood, Robin in this movie escapes from a prison after being taken prisoner while fighting for Richard the Lionheart during the 3rd Crusade. He escapes with help from Moorish prisoner Asneeze (Isaac Hayes), who tells Robin about his son, Achoo (Dave Chappelle), who's a student in England. Robin makes it back to England, where he meets Achoo after saving him from a roadside beating from a group of the Sheriff of Rottingham's soldiers (a la Rodney King). Robin invites Achoo back to his family estate but finds it literally being repossessed due to unpaid taxes along with his family and pets having died of various ailments. His manservant Blinkin, an insulting portrayal of a blind man shown to be also intellectually disabled, is Robin's only link to the past. He flees into Sherwood Forest where meets Little John and Will Scarlet O'Hara along with the other Merry Men.Robin crashes Prince John's feast with a dead buck as a gift where he meets the Sheriff and the enchanting Maid Marian. Robin and Marian share an immediate connection. He successfully fights off an attempt at an arrest with help from Achoo, John and Will, while receiving Marian's favor and the enmity of the Sheriff of Rottingham. Robin and his Merry Men return to Sherwood, where they recruit and transform themselves through a silly song and dance routine about dressing up in the Robin Hood uniform, emphasizing the green pantyhose legging which come in giant over-sized plastic egg shells (L'Eggs). Robin and his Merry Men wage war against the unjust treatment of people and harsh taxes, striking from the forest at wealthy travelers and sharing the loot with the poor of Nottnghamshire.This a typical Mel Brooks film, it has the feeling of a musical but only has a handful of songs in it. Cary Elwes and Dave Chappelle are a good on screen pairing but they're no Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder. Frequent Mel Brooks collaborators, Dick Van Patten and Dom Deluise, appear as the Abbott and Don Giovanni from the Channel Island of Jersey. It lacks the adult humor and biting satire of a Blazing Saddles but it's definitely entertaining in a Looney Tunes family style way. The biggest problem with this film is the portrayal of Blinkin, a blind servant, whose intelligence and blindness are used for intended humorous sight gags, with him falling off ladders and running into walls. It's sobering to see how difficult it can be for a low vision or blind person just to make it down the hallway of a building to use a public restroom.</fullReview>

I don't tend to believe in "dated" as a criticism, but you really need to have your head in '93 to appreciate many of these gags.No, the stroke of genius on Mel Brooks' part is his choice in cast. It's a list of players who aren't afraid to laugh at themselves, gamely staring down the barrel of such hackneyed material and making something really funny out of it. Elwes, Chappelle, Lewis, DeLuise, Yasbeck, Ullmann - there's not really a weak link here. I didn't laugh at the jokes so much as the actors' reactions.

		<fullReview>A quick note.There are two scenes well worth waiting for in this lesser work of Mel Brooks.One is Dom DeLuise' Marlon Brando. The guy is perfect. He mumbles away and finally removes cotton from his mouth, having just come from the dentist. Most of his impressions are from "The Godfather" but others from Brando's ouevre insinuate themselves into his performance. Brooks wisely gives DeLuise his head.The other scene is Cary Elwes as Robin of Locksley singing "The Night Is Young And You're So Beautiful." The number is staged as comic, with an audience watching the silhouettes of Robin and Marian projected on a sheet and Robin's sword thrust out aggressively from his hips. The song itself is an oldie, lushly orchestrated, but it's sung in a gut-busting tenor by Arthur Rubin, who was one of the men auditioning for the part of Hitler in "The Producers." His impossible high notes will stand your hair on end.The rest of the movie has its moments. Maid Marian's last name turns out to be Ba-GEL, and Brooks' Rabbi Tuckman, remarks, "Locksley and BaGEL? How can it go wrong?" Much of it seems a little tired and suffering from a case of pattern exhaustion but it's redeemed by a few genuinely funny scenes.</fullReview>

Returning to England, Robin rescues Ahchoo (Dave Chappelle), the son of Asneeze. Prince John (Richard Lewis) is in control with Richard fighting in the Crusades and he's taking LoxleyHall literally. Prince John has a witch named Latrine (Tracey Ullman). Robin's blind family servant Blinkin (Mark Blankfield) tells him that his family are all dead. Little John (Eric Allan Kramer), Will Scarlet O'Hara (Matthew Porretta) and Rabbi Tuckman (Mel Brooks) join him to battle Sheriff of Rottingham (Roger Rees). He falls for Maid Marian (Amy Yasbeck).This is a Mel Brooks spoof. His brand of humor has grown a bit old. There are simply not enough funny jokes. Dave Chappelle is a great find and he has a few good laughs. He has the majority and the biggest laughs. On the other hand, Amy Yasbeck has no laughs at all. Maid Marian may be funnier as an idiot. Cary Elwes is game and has good timing. The silly names seem to be half of the comedy. It's a mix bag with some good light silliness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical slapstick Mel Brooks comedy. Unremarkably executed, but enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with most comedies, whether you enjoy Men in Tights is a matter of taste. People get a sore throat and an abdominal workout from some comedies, often without knowing what it is about themselves that makes the movie appeal to them. Other times the same people will watch another comedy and think, "How the heck is this supposed to be even remotely funny?" Your sense of humor just something that's wired into you and nobody can control it. That said, if you aren't a fan of Mel Brooks humor. find something else to watch. This isn't a comedy that has other elements in it like the Ocean's Trilogy or many Robin Williams movies. Nothing in this movie is done for any reason apart from getting laughs out of the audience, so if it doesn't tickle your funnybone, Men in Tights will just be a waste of hundred minutes. The rating certification for this movie is listed as "Off color humor", and there is certainly a fair amount of that. I found that this was the main detracting area of the movie. Call me whatever derogatory name you want for it, but the sexual humor just didn't really sit well with me. Despite that, there is still enough cleaner humor to make it enjoyable for (insert plural form of derogatory name mentioned above here). It references the original Prince of Thieves, among other things, to an extent, but not so much that those who haven't seen the original Kevin Costner film won't enjoy it. The references that are made are pretty good though (e.g. Unlike some Robin Hood's, I *can* speak in a British accent). Some of the lines are just ridiculous like Asneeze's "On the count of kick" line. Other jokes have a witty Monty Python feel to them. The lines feel well placed and well worded for the most part, which is the only area where execution comes into play in this sort of comedy apart from the acting, which is fine. Otherwise, as long as it makes you laugh, the execution isn't a problem. After all, comedies are supposed to be enjoyed, not debated. Nobody writes essays about dynamic characters from comedies. There certainly aren't any of these in this movie, though each main role is well established. Robin Hood is an overly gallant and dashing soldier that exits all of his encounters on top, usually after humiliating the Sheriff of Rottingham. The Sheriff is a cocky, though blundering character that is very good at making a fool of himself, though somehow retaining an air of superiority. His sidekick of sorts, and my personal favorite is Prince John. His lines are excellent and the mole that teleports from one spot on his face to another in each scene is pretty funny. Maid Marion is a tragic red-head that has a few good lines namely "'Twould be . . . "Tweriffic". The other main roles lie with the Merry Men. First to be recruited is Achoo son of Asneeze. He brings a modern touch to the Middle Ages setting and he also has some pretty good lines, many of them emphasizing his being a black guy in the middle of England. The next recruit is Blinkin (Did you just say Abe Linclon?), the blind man. He is somewhat of a klutz, being blind, but that does not detract from his verbal humor. Finally, Little John and Will Scarlett join the ranks. Little John sort of leads the Merry Men and is made to be kind of an all brawn and no brains sort of character, exemplified by his introduction at the "river". Will Scarlett is not really developed, but does have a few scattered one-liners. To conclude, Men in Tights is a very slapstick comedy that, while hitting many areas of comedy, may not be well accepted in any given group. The movie is extremely quotable, which can be a bad sign to anyone who knows someone who really likes it. So in a nutshell, its worth a rent, but if you question whether you're going to like it after about twenty minutes, it may not be a good idea to continue. Overall Rating: 8.2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hilarious Spoof!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the best comedy movies ever made and is certainly one of Mel Brooks' finest films. The movie is hilarious if you can get the humor in the story of and characters in the legend of Robin Hood. Men in Tights is basically an exaggerated look at the tale - it's a funny, funny spoof and spin on Robin Hood in particular "Prince of Thieves" starring Kevin Costner.If you get odd-ball, slapstick and semi-dry humor and have a love for the story of Robin Hood plus comedy films then Men in Tights is sure to get you laughing out loud at the crazy non-sense you are watching on the screen. The movie is as dorky as dorky can get and that is what makes Men in Tights a top-notch comedy.The tagline for the movie reads "The legend had it coming..." and isn't it the truth. I agree with the tagline and I am a fan of the legendary figure Robin Hood.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Mel Brooks Classic, Even If Second Tier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spoof of Robin Hood in general, and 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' in particular.How do you beat the combination of Richard Lewis and Cary Elwes? That is pretty hard to do. Although, I suppose one answer is Cary Elwes and Andre the Giant and another answer is Mel Brooks and Marty Feldman.And that is why this film is a "second tier" Mel Brooks film. While far from his worst, it is also not his best. Over the years it has developed something of a cult following, and I freely admit to having watched it a few times and enjoying it every time... but it will never be "Young Frankenstein" or "Blazing Saddles" no matter how many times we re-visit it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Costner had it coming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gleefully mocking the execrable Prince of Thieves this Robin Hood movie provides lots of laughs. It's good entertainment which is more than can be said for the Kevin Costner vehicle. Cary Elwes is a better Robin Hood than Costner could ever be. Elwes has the personality, the swashbuckling style. And a deft comedic touch as well. Mel Brooks hit the jackpot casting Elwes as the star of this movie. But Elwes is not the only standout here. Roger Rees is hilarious as the villainous Sheriff of Rottingham. Amy Yasbeck is a great Maid Marian. Richard Lewis plays the whining, sniveling Prince John splendidly. There's even a young Dave Chappelle in his film debut playing Ahchoo, son of Asneeze. Ahchoo? Asneeze? Well, nobody said this was going to be a film filled with highbrow humor. But it's not all cheap, lowbrow humor either. It's a pretty smart script as silly parodies go. Brooks took that script and let his great cast go to town with it. And they produced a movie that will have you smiling throughout. What more do you want? The movie tells the Robin Hood story we know so well but tells it in a way we've never seen before. The plot, such as it is, really only exists to set up jokes, gags and songs. The hit-to-miss ratio as far as the humor goes is outstanding. Very few of the jokes fall flat. The material is excellent and the cast sells it beautifully. From the big star in Elwes down to all the little cameos, Dom DeLuise being a particular highlight, everyone was on top of their comedic game. Brooks himself even gets into the act playing Rabbi Tuckman. Yes, Rabbi Tuckman. This movie does indeed provide a unique spin on the Robin Hood legend. A uniquely hilarious spin. It may not be a comedy classic but it is at least worthy of being a cult favorite. And if after watching the movie you're not singing the Men in Tights song for days afterward there's something wrong with you. When you're in a fix just call for the men in tights!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am starting to find these movies really unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached this movie with a large amount of scepticism. I am not much of a fan of Mel Brook's movies and quite recently have lost interest in the send-up genre of comedy. There were some aspects of this movie that were redeeming but in general my opinion remains the same; I am not a fan of Mel Brook's movies.The characters in this movie I thought were good. That is until Prince John came into the picture. That guy's acting (I don't know who it was) was atrocious and really lowered my opinion of a movie that I had little of in the first place. On the redeeming side of things, I thought Carey Ellis (I believe his name to be) really suited the role of Robin Hood and in a way, thought he would have been much better in a serious movie that in this. The blind butler Blinkin and the Moor Achoo were also cool (though the Achoo joke stretched quite thin by the end of the movie).Comedy (here I go, spoiling the movie by critically examining the comic features of the movie ? well I don't care because I am not that thrilled with it anyway). There is the stock sexual humour, though not as much as some movies, and in this movie it tends to be much more blatant. There is also a lot of anachronistic humour ? basically saying things that obviously cannot be around in 12th century England. As this is a send up, the other Robin hood movies are also sent up. I guess this can be summed up in on line; "unlike some Robin Hoods, I, have an English accent." And a very fine one at that. Just to finish it off there is also the stock toilet humour that one cannot get away from (though in my humble opinion, I prefer toilet humour to sexual humour).My gripe with the movie comes very much at the end. Sexual humour and chastity belts aside, it was the abolition of the marriage vowels that really put me off the movie. A marriage is not a simple, "I do, I do," it is a promise that you will be there for each other until the day one of you dies. A marriage is a life long commitment ? something of which this movie was making a mockery. In my honest opinion, if you can't keep the commitment, then don't get married. If all you want to do is bump pelvises, then, in my humble opinion, all you are doing in just using the other person for your own perverted pleasures.Now that I have offended half of the population of this planet, I wish to finish by saying that other than that, Robin Hood ? Men in Tights, was a reasonable movie and is probably good to watch once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not Mel Brook's funniest movie it is a very good one. Cary Elwes plays a returning crusader who discovers his family castle has been repossessed by a loan shark, played by Avery Schrieber. Richard Lewis plays Prince John and does it extremely well. The Sheriff of Nottingham is played by Roger Rees. He does his usual good job as a foil for most everyone. Dave Chappelle plays a black man in England???? This is the hottest I have ever seen Amy Yasbeck, she plays Maid Marian and she looks very nice in her chastity belt. Patrick Stewart, aka Captain Pecarde, appears at the end as King Richard. He restores things to the norm, gets to kiss the bride and exclaims in a great line "It is good to be the king". Mark Blankenfield plays the faithful but blind, servant Blinkin. Unfortunately he is not that funny. Tracy Ullman plays the witch and while she is not pretty in real life she is super ugly here with the make up, at least I hope it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Hood: Men in Tights stars Cary Elwes, who is definitely one of my favourite actors thanks to this movie and The Princess Bride.This movie is completely silly, but its awesomeness knows hardly any bounds. It never fails to give me a giggle, whether I'm actually watching it or not. I can just think of it and start snickering to myself.This film is a fixture in my DVD collection! And one very good reason for loving it is just how fun it is to sing along with the main theme song - "We're men (manly men!), we're men in tiiii-iiights!"Plus, who could forget the sheer brilliance of a witch called Latrine who requires testicles of a newt to brew up an evil spell?There's just so much goodness to talk when it comes to this movie, about and so little time in each day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly a bull's-eye but still watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly twenty years ago, this movie was one that my brother &amp; I deemed worthy enough to pick up on home video (VHS, at the time). Neither of us knew anything about "The Producers", "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", so to us Mel Brooks was just a name. Now, knowing better, I decided to rewatch the movie to see if it really had any merit.In case you couldn't tell from the title, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is a spoof of movies based on the Robin Hood mythology, chiefly the classic "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and the then-recent hit "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves". That's not a bad starting point but the script is a hit and miss affair. Some of the jokes are pretty corny and some then-timely references haven't aged particularly well. It's not all bad, though.The cast is pretty good overall, considering the general mediocrity of the script. Cary Elwes makes out alright in the lead role, though his similar role in "The Princess Bride" is much more satisfying. Tracey Ullman is easily the best of the supporting players in her role as a witch with the hots for the sheriff. Others have their moments, though, including Dave Chappelle (in his first film role), Patrick Stewart (in a memorable cameo) &amp; Dom DeLuise (contributing a credible Godfather impression).Visually, the film is nice and colourful with above average direction from Mel Brooks. The special effects are unimpressive but at least they only see minimal use. Musically, the film's not too bad, either. The theme song ("Men in Tights") is the best of lot but good use is also made of "The Night is Young and You're So Beautiful". As for "Marian" &amp; the "Sherwood Forest Rap", they're decent in a stereotypical sort of way.Ultimately, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is watchable but it's a far cry from Brooks' best. It's a decent diversion for a couple of hours, though I would recommend familiarizing yourself with "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" beforehand. In fact, I'd suggest watching "The Adventures of Robin Hood" regardless of whether or not you're interested in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the end for Mel Brooks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, Mel! What has happened to you? To think the comedic master that brought us such timeless treasures of comedy like "The Producers", "Blazzing Saddles", "Young Frankenstein". Has now been reduced to handing out schlock like "Life Stinks", "Dracula dead and loving it" and this cinematic suppository "Robin Hood, Men in Tights". I went to this movie with such high hopes and expectations, feeling confident that in the hands of a master like Mel Brooks, he would surely pull of another scathing parody like he has done so many times before. However, after seeing this movie it felt like I had been cheated. Not only out of my time and money but by something even worse. My trust had been violated. This movie was so lackluster and mediocre that it must have been a doppleganger of Mel Brooks. It felt like some hack had stolen Mel Brooks' name and was pawning off for his own twisted use. Alas, no it was Mel's creation. More the pity. I feel the biggest problem with this script is that it had absolutely nothing fresh to it. The set-ups, gags, even jokes were written and executed so shabbily that you could see the punch line coming a mile away. Another thing happened that had NEVER happened to me watching a Mel Brooks film. I got bored, in fact I even started to wonder how much more of the movie was left and even contemplated skipping out. This movie would be just another forgettable comedy except it still bares the name of Mel Brooks and that makes it all the more painful. Thankfully, after the 1990's Brooks was smart enough to realize that he was way past his prime and went back to Broadway to revive "The Producers" and "Young Frankenstein". Just please, please, PLEASE, Mel. Never bring this movie to Broadway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arrow Flynn Robin Hood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks used the basics of Arrow Flynn's The Adventures of Robin Hood for his own take of the infamous thief, if you watch that then the whole Mel Brook's version is just better. Down to Robin Hood barging in on Prince John's feast with a pig instead of a deer to slam on Prince John's plate. There are some elements of Prince of Thieves that Mel makes a joke of like the life servant to Robin played by Morgan Freeman except it is the gentleman's son Achoo, and also the blind servant that is left of all of Robin's family possessions. It is safe to say that Mel did a great job integrating these two movies. The beginning is very Kevin Costner and the rest is Arrow Flynn. Even Carey Elwes had Arrow's goatee. Even down to the clothing of Robin Hood Mel Brooks dressed Robin similar to Arrow Flynn, in Prince of Thieves Maid Marion was this ninja sort of fighter who was able to really kick butt. Arrow Flynn's Maid Marion played by Olivia Dehavaland was a damsel in distress, which Mel used for his Maid Marion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I was sceptic about spoofs and didn't expect much. After the movie my opinion changed.Mel Brooks, one of the masters of comedy, has done it again. Witty remarks, goofy actors and clever ideas provide fun and hilarious moments through out the film.Of course the plot it self is nothing special and the actor performances are not at level of an Oscar degree, but then again it's a spoof. "Real" critics may say that this was trash and bad and rock bottom, but it's all in the way you look at it and the attitude you have while watching it. It's all part of the fun. You can't review a spoof just like you would review a Oscar nominee movie.I give this movie 8/10. It's worth watching but remember to leave the strict and all serious attitude at the closet.</fullReview>

Dave Chappelle, who became a big name later, makes his first major role in this one playing Ahchoo.The late musician Isaac Hayes plays his father Asneeze.Matthew Porretta does great work as Will Scarlett O'Hara.It's great fun to watch Patrick Stewart playing King Richard.Dick Van Patten is terrific as The Abbot.Dick's son James Van Patten is seen as Villager.Eric Allan Kramer is great as Little John.Robin Hood and Little John fought on a bridge.Which one won? Dom DeLuise is hilarious as Don Giovanni.Dom's wife Carol Arthur plays Complaining Villager.His son David DeLuise plays Villager.Brian George is Dungeon Maitre d'.Director Brooks himself plays Rabbi Tuckman, a Jewish version of Friar Tuck.This movie shows the medieval times as it has never been seen before.Sure Mel Brooks has come up with better stuff in the previous decades, but this also makes you laugh.One of the funniest is Dom DeLuise doing his Marlon Brando impersonation where he's a Godfather-like character Don Giovanni.And there's pretty much of other stuff that made me laugh.Robin Hood and Mel Brooks work pretty great together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is very funny. I don't have a problem with a parody of the Robin Hood legend, and I can't imagine a better way to do it then to make fun of the "Prince of thieves", for it was released only two years before "men in tights" and therefore still stuck in everyone's memory. Some of the greatest scenes are when Robin tries to deliver a touching speech but no one really listens. I often feel that heroes in movies act very lofty, and it's nice that this has no effect for once. There are some pretty flat jokes in this film, too. But I admire the way this film manages to parody the "prince of thieves" so to the point and still be full of new ideas. If you are looking for a movie to watch when you are in a bad mood and don't want to think to much, this is your film! I've seen it about five times and I still laugh almost without a break.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobody is Safe from Mel Brooks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my review of "Spaceballs," I wrote, "Even for those who have never seen a "Star Wars" movie, (Mel) Brooks made the whole affair ludicrous enough that they can enjoy it nearly as much as those who have." Now I have proof. "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" primarily spoofs 1991's "Robin Hood Prince of Thieves," which I have not seen (nor have I 1938 Errol Flynn movie). It is not easy to make me laugh, but I did just that loudly and repeatedly for the entire duration of this comedy.Dave Chappelle, who would later be named the funniest man in America and then disappear, makes his screen debut. He plays Ahchoo, the satire of Morgan Freeman's Ahzeem from "Prince of Thieves." Writer and director Mel Brooks fit the character to Chappelle's inimitable comedy style. His show made such an impression on me that I have called McDonalds "WacArnold's" ever since. His unexpected references to stereotypes and pop culture add a contrast to the deadpan characters that few other comedies can boast.The story covers the usual ground. Robin of Loxley (Cary Elwes) is pitted against Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the despicable Sheriff of Rottingham (Roger Rees). The two are usurping the absent King's power and have levied taxes so unreasonable that Little John (Eric Allan Kramer) has to create a toll bridge to feed himself. With the help of Ahchoo (Chappelle), Will Scarlet O'Hara (Matthew Porretta) and Robin's blind servant Blinkin (Mark Blankfield), Robin and Little John set out to depose the evil duo. Their chances of succeeding are high since, unlike Kevin Costner, Cary Elwes can speak with an English accent.As usual, Mel Brooks delivers his jokes from all directions. Frequently the movie appears to be resting between funny parts. Then Brooks nails us with a witty left hook, and we laugh even harder as we realize that he lulled into a false of "security." The noisy guards and the appearance of the Abbot (Dick Van Patten) are the two best examples. Many funny lines do not work, and perhaps were not intended to work. Instead, they keep the mood light while providing important characterizations. There are many "lesser jokes," that only elicit smiles or internal laughs, but are equally vital because they maintain the momentum. Brooks wisely avoids humor overdrive, so it works with equal efficiency at minute 100 as it does at minute one.Elwes is even more unflappable than he is in "A Princess Bride." Remaining perfectly reserved in screwball comedy requires an actor to suppress every urge to act, and therefore suppress his own nature. That is so tough that a majority of actors cannot pull it off. Rees is suitably spiteful as Rottingham, and Lewis makes John look confused and incompetent. Blankfield maximizes that part of Blinkin. Van Patten and Brooks steal the show when they are present, as does Chappelle every time he opens his mouth. Nobody else leaves a strong impression save the surprise cameo at the end.In fact, the acting is at a much higher level than in "Spaceballs" or "Blazing Saddles," but not quite on the level of "Young Frankenstein." As with "Spaceballs," Brooks takes every opportunity he can to spear other movies, including his own, "The Godfather," and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." He appears as Rabbi Tuckman, and gets more mileage from circumcision jokes than I ever imagined was possible. Brooks even outdoes himself with his latest farce of a wedding ceremony. "Men in Tights" does not earn the top spot in the Mel Brooks library, but for most comedy directors it would be the crowning achievement of their career.</fullReview>

This is one of the only movies I can watch at anytime and not be bored in the least bit. However, seeing as this movie only obtained an average of 6 stars, it appears not many people share my opinion. Perhaps it's just because I'm a young male, or no one can properly respect the brilliant humor displayed throughout the film (ha) Watch it, it's at least worth 3 or 4 bucks to rent one evening and sit down with some popcorn and a couple of friends...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Say What You Will; This Movie Was Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoof movies are very hard to pull off in terms of quality. The problem is that comedies, especially spoofs, are so subjective that reviews are generally mixed. I remember Siskel &amp; Ebert panned this movie upon its release, with Gene Siskel remarking that Mel Brooks has "finally lost his touch". Plus, I have read other reviews that absolutely trash this movie.I saw this movie at a movie theater in Boston when I was ten years old. I thought I would hate it, but I absolutely loved it and quoted lines from it frequently. I recently saw it again, and still laughed all the way through it. It was just funny. What can I say? I think what made this movie work was that Mel Brooks almost never reiterated jokes until they grew stale, and he rarely used pop culture references. If this movie were written today by those two of the six writer of "Scary Movie", who wrote and directed the absolutely pitiful "Date Movie" and "Meet The Spartans", the movie would be filled with tired Michael Jackson and American Idol references. The reason I can laugh at this movie now is because although there are a few somewhat dated references (e.g. spoofing Kevin Costner's previous "Robin Hood" movie), the rest of it is just pure universal humor. And it's funny.A lot of people may say that this is one of Mel Brooks' least funny films, and that he just repeats the same jokes he did in his other movies. I for one am a fan of Brooks' early movies, and this one ranks high in my book with "Blazing Saddles" and "High Anxiety" among others. Plus, Brooks found an early superstar in Dave Chappelle, so you know he didn't completely lose his comedic touch. "Dracula: Dead and Loving It", on the other hand, is another story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel may have gone just a little too far here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I usually like Mel Brooks's movies, it seems like he went a little overboard with "Robin Hood: Men in Tights". But even so, it's just great to see them spoofing pretty much every Robin Hood movie (as I never saw "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves", but I've read that it deserved to get mocked). I think that my favorite scene was the knights falling over domino-style.So, if you're looking for a totally trashy, totally silly, totally guilty pleasure, this is it to the max. Cary Elwes, Richard Lewis, Amy Yasbeck, Dave Chapelle, Isaac Hayes, Patrick Stewart and Dick Van Patten (and of course Mel Brooks himself) have lots to be proud of here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, "By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead?"Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the "Claw" or Saw. This movie is worth watching</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review contains *minor* spoilers. OK... So this isn't young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles, but overall, it's a pretty funny Mel Brooks Movie. It is a send up of Robin Hood movies in general, but specifically "Robin Hood Prince of Thieves" in the same way that "Spaceballs" was a sendup of the Star Wars movies.We get the usual Brooks schtick here.... Jewish jokes, (Brooks doing a cameo as "Rabbi Tuchman", Richard Lewis muttering "Trafe" when Robin drops a pig on the table)("Trafe" is a yiddish word for something that is non-kosher) , references to (then) current events and movies, (Dave Chappelle in his movie debut, being roughed up by the royal guard, and saying... "I hope someone is making a video of this", and the archer aiming at Robin from "Ye olde folio depository.) There's even a tribute to "Blazing Saddles", but I won't give that one away. (One other thing..... Only Mel Brooks could find a way to fit a "Malcom X" reference into a Robin Hood Movie.) There's Brooks standard breaking of the "4th wall", (cameramen and crew obviously visible and part of the movie), and Robin announcing.... "Prepare for the fight scene." AND, there's even a big slap in the puss to Kevin Costner when Elwes says.... "Unlike other Robin Hoods, *I* can speak with an English accent." (Trivia note: Out of all the actors who have played Robin Hood, Elwes is the only British actor to do so.) The musical numbers are fun, (We're men, (MANLY MEN!), we're men in tights....... We roam around theforest looking for fights.......) and even though the movie is a bit dated now, (it came out in 1993), it still has enough humor to hold one's interest. Sure, some of the jokes are going to be clinkers, (lend me your ears!!!) but overall, the movie holds up well. The movie recently came out in DVD as a Mel Brooks box set. One can only hope that it will come out as a single DVD soon, hopefully with some great extras. It's not a Brooks classic, but it's one that I really enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic spoof of a classic tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that Mel Brooks is the funniest man alive. He has done several sweet movies like Blazing Saddles and Silient Movie. None of his movies however, match the joke after joke hilarity of Robin Hood Men in Tights. The movie takes classic characters and turns them into complete goofs. Cary Elwes is very funny as the English accented Robin Hood. Latrine is a a classic Tracy Ullman character that is funny throughout the whole movie. Ahchoo is played by a young lesser known Dave Chappelle and probably has the funniest lines in the movie that don't come from Blinkin'. Blinkin' is played by Mark Blankfield who does a terrific job playing the funny blind character. He is by far the funniest man in the whole movie. Throw in hilarious parts played by Mel Brooks, Richard Lewis and Isaac Hayes and then you have the funniest comedy of the 1990's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slighly disappointing Brooks movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to parodying movies there's no denying that good old Mel Brooks is definitely the very best man in it. He's a master and I've always loved his films because he has that amazing ability to find out what's funniest in other movies and then turn it as a bunch of mean, rude jokes. But he has lots of experience: he's been doing it for decades now. He made a biting parody out of Frankenstein ("Young Frankenstein", 1974), silent movies, ("Silent movie", 1976) Hitchcock's works, ("High anxiety", 1977) Star wars-trilogy, ("Spaceballs", 1987) and Bram Stoker's Dracula ("Dracula: Dead and loving it", 1995). Some of these films are quite outstanding, for example "Blazing saddles" (1974) will always be the very greatest western parody of the movie history. Unfortunately some are less good. In 1993 Brooks decided to make a parody out of a hit movie "Robin Hood: Prince of thieves".I've seen Brooks' version "Robin Hood: Men in tights" several times and I have to admit that even though it has its wacky moments it's still one of the worst and most disappointing Brooks films. I love the part where Sheriff of Rotingham tells Prince John his bad news in a nice way. I love Dom DeLuise's witty Don Corleone parody. I love the scene where Rabbi Tuckman played by Brooks himself is in. I love many parts of the dialogue. Let's say 20 % of the jokes are hilarious, 30 % quite amusing and 50 % just naive, annoying and stupid. What does it tell about this film. Well it's watchable but light years away from Brooks' best works. Two years later he directed "Dracula: Dead and loving it" which was one of his most underrated and wonderful comedies. This one, not so good. I hope we'll still hear from Mel Brooks. He hasn't direct anything since "Dracula" and that was seven years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Painfully Sad State of a Great Comedian's Affairs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having garnered a cult following full of excuse-making couch potatoes, this lazily anachronistic airball is one of the more contemporary of Mel Brooks' films, though you'd almost not realize it by watching. Indeed, it reveals how little Brooks' comic manner has evolved over time. The film is a send-up of the 1991 Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, on top of shreds of countless other Robin Hood films. Most of the gags were moan-inducing when this film was new and they haven't enhanced with time. Do names like "Ahchoo" which is invariably followed by "gesundheit," and "Sheriff of Rottingham" amuse you? Jokes bank on an inherent surprise element, to put it very reductively, and if an audience is subjected to it a bunch of times uninflected or it's so obvious that children who still play in sandboxes could have written the same gag, there's zero surprise, scarce laughter and even scarcer joy.Unlike Blazing Saddles, where Brooks does actually utilize such postmodern self-conscious gags to timeless effect, that's as if the same man couldn't have made both movies. This parody, which barely qualifies as such, is unimaginative, worn-out and weakly written. And while one might be swift in pardoning Brooks by observing that he wasn't to blame for conceiving the story, no medieval mobsters held any silly handgun-shaped crossbow to his head. He ran right beside J.D. Shapiro and Evan Chandler on the screenplay, then said the words "Roll camera," when he should've only ever screamed "Cut!" Spaceballs was a major step down for Brooks, though it was still thick with gags, both funny and flat. But this one has even more brainless lines, and also less. There are lingering sections where it just plays like another version of the Robin Hood film rotation. That's definitely the case with the scene in which Robin gallantly enters the castle of Prince John and cuts short his banquet with the Sheriff of Nottingham. Except for the joke of having Robin carry a dead boar to his "hosts" instead of the king's deer, the Flynn version gives off far more humor and liveliness. That's also the case with the archery contest, in which Robin disguises himself to vie for Maid Marian.I was astonished, basically, that someone didn't sever Marian's hand and brandish it as the actual prize. That very sort of shallow dumb-pun humor mechanism is both on auto-pilot and overdrive in this sad state of a great comedian's affairs, whether it's one of the few welcome gags, a reprisal of the "walk this way" gag in which everyone imitates the way that the Sheriff saunters, or a confounding pathetic "lend me your ears" plea that becomes the obligatory occasion for all the peasants yanking them off and tossing them to Robin. It's purely unfunny. "Watch my back." "Your back just got punched twice" is a little funnier, but it didn't take much effort or inspiration to hit upon those jokes, and that's the prevalent trouble with this film.Sporadic lines can be amusing, as when Robin, about to leave the Crusades and return home, meets a black warrior who says he has a son in England, a son who's head strong and cock sure, or is it the other way around? Roger Rees as Sheriff of Rottingham delivers the most laughs. The next most are during a scene in which Dom DeLuise makes a cameo as Don Giovanni in a longed-for off-the-wall slider of a Godfather burlesque, you find yourself laughing quite a lot, but also at this point surprised to be doing so. Alas, when the blind Blinkin asks, "Did you say Abe Lincoln?" and the reply is "No, 'Hey, Blinkin,'" one cannot help but agonize over why Brooks and his writers thought it would help to kill the already desperate joke by redundantly appending such an already obvious punch line. Same with a jailer who's dressed like a maitre 'd and tells Robin he cannot seat him without proper attire, then puts a false beard on Robin. This means you also have to question if some of these gags might've fared better than increasingly depressing dead air had Brooks poked and played with them more. But this is such a lethargic, idle film that takes every path of least possible resistance, and dilly-dallies too long to do even that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mediocre Brooks spoof of the legendary story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSSince the middle of the 1940's, Mel Brooks has written and directed some superb films. With true classics like "Blazing Saddles" (1974), "The Producers" (1968) and "Young Frankenstein" (1974), Brooks is one of those directors that every film fans knows of. In recent years however, Brooks' film catalogue has been considerably substandard. Lacking performances by legends like Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn and Marty Feldman, Brooks has produced a dire space spoof (1987's "Spaceballs"), a humourless Dracula spoof (1995's "Dracula: Dead And Loving It") and this mediocre spoof of the Robin Hood story.Following the basic story of "Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves" from two years previously, Brooks tells the story of Cary Elwes' Robin as he battles the evil pair of the Sheriff of Rottingham (Roger Rees) and Prince John (Richard Lewis). With his friends Ahchoo (Dave Chapelle) and Little John (Eric Allan Kramer), Robin fights hard to defeat his enemies and win the love of the beautiful Maid Marian (Amy Yasbeck).Poking fun at the Kevin Costner film of 1991 with a few tributes to the Errol Flynn classic, Brooks spends almost two hours attempting to make us laugh at others expense.There's little denying that at times Brooks is very clever in his approach to this film. Having Patrick Stewart playing King Richard with a Scottish accent (mocking Sean Connery in the Costner film) is a well thought out, superb idea. Sadly however, like so many other moments in this film, the joke is lost by a weak script.In fact, everything which is meant to be a joke about Robin Hood tends to fail badly. There are so many jokes which are only recognizable if you've seen the primary target that the film falls down hideously at times.As Robin, Cary Elwes is actually in one of his better performances. As the doctor in 2004's "Saw" Elwes attempts to be taken seriously, but he turns in a bad performance which won't help his cause. In comedy though, Elwes lack of acting ability is safely hidden behind a role where he never really has to do anything special except look at the camera groaning. He is also helped by an equally weak performance by his entire supporting cast. Yasbeck, often a decent actress is wistful and acting free as Marian, whilst Brooks as Rabbi Tuckman is irrelevant as he spends the entire time focusing purely on circumcision jokes.The biggest irony about this Brooks film is just how much he needs to use his elder work for support. With one or two tributes to his back catalogue (Ahchoo becoming a black Sheriff and quoting "Blazing Saddles" for example) Brooks is stuck in the past and unable to really make anything new shine.To make a correction actually, the last paragraph is not totally true. There's little doubt that any of Brooks' jokes about Robin Hood are all bad and humour free. There's also no doubt that he does base parts of this film on his earlier work. The one key thing worth mentioning though is his wonderful tribute to the "Godfather" (1972). Featuring Dom DeLuise as a tribute to the late, great Marlon Brando, Brooks has his friend putting on the same voice as Brando's Don and even joking about having cotton buds stuck in his mouth after a trip to the dentist (an idea Brando tried during the original film's filming). This scene staring DeLuise is sadly too brief, but it is a nice little highlight.Making a film about Robin Hood should in theory be an easy task for such a legend as Mel Brooks. Sadly in "Men in Tights", the legend fails. With nice tributes to his earlier films and Coppola's "The Godfather", the film is not without merits. In terms of Robin Hood though, the jokes are far too flat and awkward. Far too hit and miss for such an obvious idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Been there, done that. Brooks running empty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good acting, a parody on previous Robin Hood films and previous Mel Brooks films. So this should be a good film. Nope. It falls flat. Why? Quite simply, it's not funny enough. The jokes are too few and too far between, and we have seen just about all of them in previous Mel Brooks films. Brooks reuses jokes that were not funny the first time around and spends a lot of time presenting them. Several minutes are simply wasted with jokes "the hero has a large sword, not" and "jewish circumcision", which were slightly amusing the first time they appeared in a Brooks movie. Add a whole bunch of old and tired puns and predictable jokes and sorry, the Brooks funny film factory is running on empty. Hiring some new people (comedians or whatever) to add a lot of fresh jokes and gags might very well have saved this movie. If you want too see a funnier Brooks film, see Spaceballs instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Brooks: barely original, not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, you knew that Mel Brooks would skewer a genre with a hilarious parody. He also had quite a good body of completely original comedies.So what happened?We had "Blazing Saddles", which borrowed from every western ever made and knocked down the wall between the audience and the film. We had "Young Frankenstein", which successfully lampooned the Frankenstein films, yet had an original story line and a fantastic slew of performers who, well, performed -- brilliantly. Even the off-kilter and uneven "History of the World: Part I" was hilarious in parts, and was original throughout.But "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" suffers from the same maladies as another recent Brooks film, "Dracula: Dead and Loving It". Its plot is lifted entirely from another movie; in this case, the other movie is "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves". Brooks changes nary a plot line, lifts practically the whole set of characters, and adds maybe 50 jokes. 4 of those are funny.With the exception of Cary Elwes and Brooks himself, the acting is horrible, especially by Amy Yasbeck, who plays Maid Marian. This is no surprise, since she was equally disastrous in "Dracula: Dead and Loving It".Brooks' humor doesn't seem pointed or hip any more, even though his older films stand up to the test of time quite well. He just hasn't got that edge that he had then. In fact, he hasn't had it since before "Spaceballs", which was the beginning of the end as far as I can tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried for a second time to watch this film. It was on TV tonight. Just as the first time when I walked out of a theater in 1993 when it was first released, I couldn't stand more than 15 minutes.Mel Brooks is the only person who thinks he is funny. His signature brand of potty humor is so childish it is nauseating. I think this film sunk Cary Elwes' career.Among some of the early-on gags in this film are a scene where Robinhood returns home to find his family castle is being repossessed by "H &amp; R Blockhead". You have to be kidding, right? "H &amp; R Blockhead?!" A five-year-old could come up with that. Then as the castle is being dragged away off its foundation, it reveals a blind man (wearing sunglasses of course, so we know he's blind,) sitting on the toilet reading a girlie magazine in braille, complete with a raised relief, drop-down centerfold of a female figure. The acting is so goofy it's like, "Look ma! I'm in a funny movie! I'll say anything to embarrass myself and ruin my career!"Dave Chapelle is in this. Look how long it took before anyone heard of him again after this film. I saw Mel Brooks recently interviewed. When asked, "Are you the best judge of your own comedy?" he didn't hesitate to insist, "I am the best judge of my own comedy. I AM the best judge of my own comedy." Enough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks has established himself as a great comedy director. Not many will say that "Robin Hood: Men In Tights" is one of his best. And it may not be one of his best, but it is very enjoyable. The Robin Hood story has been done many times, and that makes it open for parody. And Mel Brooks goes for it, and does it fairly well. One can see references to just about all the Robin Hood movies, from the Errol Flynn version to the Kevin Costner (including his lack of English accent!). You could probably see a better Robin Hood movie, but it's definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Hood: Men in Tights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'We're men...we're men in tights...YES! we roam around the forest looking for fights!'A strange choice for Brooks I think, he seemed to move into historical legends in the 90's along with his take on Dracula. The tag for the film is accurate I guess, this legend did have it coming for sure with so many variations out there at the time...most notably and laughably the Kevin Costner debacle. Also not forgetting the Patrick Bergin Robin Hood flick that was emulating Costner's version!Of course being a Brooks film the cast is made up of all his regulars...and I'm sure if his older regulars weren't dead he'd have used them too. Amy Yasbeck begins her brief Brooks career here as Marian before rejoining Brooks for Dracula. Dick Van Pattern is back after working with Brooks in 'High Anxiety' and 'Spaceballs', Megan Cavanagh and Matt Porretta both went on to Dracula along with Yasbeck and finally the magnificent pair of Dom Deluise and Robert Ridgely are both Brooks film veterans.Naturally there has been many liberties taken with the plot...well actually its based around other Robin Hood movies really, nothing to do with the actual fable at all. Its clear to see the classic Errol Flynn version and the classic animated Disney version are the two main influences here. Brooks pretty much follows both of these films scene for scene whilst adding his own unique brand of spoofery. This whole approach does actually work well in all honesty because you can enjoy the cartoonish tomfoolery and it also kinda harks back to a different age of cinema. Whether this was intentional or not I'm not sure, it probably just happened because they were spoofing two classic films but the quaint visuals, simple effects and colourful characters are very appealing.There is a thin line between the silly childish humour and the slightly more risky adult humour which I think is handled well. I say adult humour but its not really that bad, just a touch of toilet humour. Whilst most of the laughs fall flat I can't deny there are some nice chuckles to be had and some clever imaginative send-ups. The usual blend of visual slapstick and cheesy dialog is to be expected but much of it is all in the delivery and luckily this movie does have some noteworthy comedic performances.Its quite a surprise that Elwes does actually put in a solid funny performance as Robin Hood, what's even more surprising is the fact he does have a slightly similar resemblance to Flynn...a blonde Flynn. His little tufts of facial hair, the fact he's British, that wry smug smile of his when he fights and all tied together in the classic green and brown attire. At the same time Richard Lewis is also a great Prince John! I loved how his mole kept moving across his face in each scene and his 80's mullet hairdo, plus this guy can deliver a funny line. He has this great whiny nervous tone to his voice which really comes to life when he panics and cries 'hurt them! hurt them!!'.I also must confess to enjoying Brooks small cameo as a Rabbi, could of gone another way but the old ones are the best ones I guess. Eric Kramer is also surprisingly amusing as the towering Little John, not so much to say but he is good with the visual comedy side of things as was Blankfield as the blind 'Blinkin'...sounds utterly cringeworthy I know but it does work. It was only Rees as the Sheriff of Rottingham (*groan*) that seemed to swing and miss for me, clearly trying way too hard to hammer those funny lines in. Same could be said for Tracy Ullman as the witch who didn't even really need to be there.As I'm sure everybody knows by now a film like this is all about the delivery, the comedic performances of the actors, if that aspect is nailed then the film is reasonably secured. Its not about the effects or sets or costumes...although its nice if they look good but end of the day its whether you can laugh with the film and not at it for being crap. Personally I think this movie just about makes the grade, its earned somewhat of a cult status over time and I can see why. There is a lot of embarrassing crud in here this is true (Dave Chappelle), some visual gags are terribly simple bordering on downright infantile whilst some of the visuals are very basic. But (and its a biggish but) there is also just enough solid cheeky clever lampoonery and dialog along with performances to make you smile. Although it doesn't have the overall sheen of Brooks follow up vampire flick.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' epitomizes the second half of Mel Brooks' legendary career. It's an amusing and energetically acted comedy, told in classic Mel Brooks fashion, but it's not nearly as sharp or inspired as his best work. To that end, I'm not sure if the Robin Hood legend was the ripest target Brooks could've picked here, but just as he did with his four years too late satire of 'Star Wars', he milks a rather dry teat for just enough laughs to make it worthwhile.Though none of the cast are in the same league as Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman or Madeline Kahn, they clearly did their homework and do their best to fill the shoes of former Mel Brooks Players. It's a very specific type of comedy that requires just the right actor to pull it off. Thankfully, Brooks' eye for talent had remained very keen, and this cast help to make the too often stale material seem fresher than it is.'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' may not be on par with Brooks' best work, but it's a bit of good natured amusement for a lazy Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't Deliver on the Big Laughs, but not Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parodies are usually good or really bad. I'd say it is a rarity that someone is talented enough to pull of a parody that is well received. Off of the top of my head I think of Scary Movie, Hot Shots and maybe a couple of others that I consider good. Mel Brooks tried his hand at directing a few parodies, this being one of them.This Mel Brooks directed film is a spoof of the very popular Robin Hood Prince of Thieves starring Kevin Costner. As is Mel Brooks' custom, he poked fun of relevant themes and popular items of the day: i.e. the movie White Men Can't Jump, the clapper, the club, the Patriot Missle and the Florida State Tomahawk Chop. The movie was OK. There were the bad puns, a couple of music ballads and slapstick comedy. I think Spaceballs and of course Blazing Saddles were better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting in Robin Hood, Men in Tights was great. Robin Hood was funny, Chapelle was funny and the blind dude "Blinky" was very funny as well. Acting by the bad guys were really good too: the king and the sheriff did a very good job. The lady in love (Marian) with Robin Hood was great. Mel Brooks shows why he's one of the best, if not the best, comedy writers of all time. The costumes were nicely done. I laughed a lot of times. I now plan to watch "Monty Python and the Holy Grail," because it looks funny too. I recommend this movie to people who want to laugh a lot. The movie met my expectations. Wow why do I have to write 10 lines in this review? it's crazy. Can IMDb please lower the requirements?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't hate, its funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't understand why people hate on this movie. I found it quite funny. Cary Elwes is amazing. If people stop taking everything so seriously, then maybe they can just sit back and actually enjoy a movie. Sure its not in my top 10, but i would recommend watching it at least once in your life. It isn't a regular movie, and does not require much thinking. The funny parts aren't what you would regularly call funny. It takes a different form of comedy, which i liked. Some may find it insulting or whatever, but don't take every little thing to heart. It's Hollywood, its a movie, thats the point. Just watch it and don't hate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We've come a long way from Porky Pig and Daffy Duck...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time, and it's use of Cary Elwes as Robin Hood was great. I've long hated the Robin Hood story (mostly since the recurring Daffy Duck and Porky Pig version came on cartoons when I was little), but when I saw the scene where the jailer made Robin wear a beard for conformity, I fell in love with this movie.I haven't seen many Mel Brooks movies (this and Young Frankenstien are it), but Rabbi Tuckman in a bit of a spoof on the fact that he's Jewish (okay, a lot of a spoof), I loved. After first watching this movie, I sang "Men in Tights" for at least a month, and when I made my friends watch it, they did too.You can't take this movie seriously at all. I mean, Blinkin reading Playboy in braille and thinking the statue is Robin has a tendency to not be very historically accurate, but you must remember that the entire story, spoof or not, isn't known to be true (they still haven't figured out if Robin Hood even existed). Don't worry, and laugh a little, or, if you're like me, laugh until you cry and then some.If you liked Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail (another spoof of an overdone story), you'll love this one. If you hated it, don't even bother watching Men in Tights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks' spoof "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" keeps the gags coming at such a pace that if one doesn't work for you (and some won't), another probably will. It seems unfair to give the best gags away - but trust me, there are some excellent ones. Cary Elwes plays Robin, and he is as perfectly cast as an actor could be. Elwes is anachronistically gifted at playing dashing heroes, and fans of his work in Rob Reiner's classic "The Princess Bride" will likely appreciate him here as well. The comic swordfights catch the film at its most high-spirited."Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is good for quite a few laughs, and a laugh is nothing to be sneezed at. And speaking of sneezes...is that Dave Chappelle playing Ah-Choo?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Hood stole my funny bone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who thinks Mel has "lost his touch" with Men in Tights has a screw loose somewhere. This ranks right up there among some of the funniest movies of all time. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is a refreshing breath of Mentos-flavored air on an overused and overdone theme. How many times do we have to see the same old rehashed Robin Hoods do the same fighting against John "Softsword" and Sheriff of Nottingham before it becomes too much to handle? Traditionally, all Robin Hood movies must have three things:1) Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham oppressing the good people of England.2) Several standoffs between Robin Hood and the Sheriff.3) A final climactic battle scene where Robin fights for the cause of the people of England and triumphs over overwhelming odds and numbers.Look at the movie and tell me it doesn't have at least those bare bones.Now look at some of the improvements Mel Brooks made. He turns John into a neurotic, insular husk with some, dare-I-say, Jewish tendencies ("traif"). A dyslexic Sheriff of 'Rottingham' (played by Roger Rees), who is constantly running from the pursuit of Latrine (Tracey Ullman). A band of merry men ('faygelas', perhaps?) including his blind steward Blinkin', the oh-so-much-more-than-token Black guy Achoo (bless you) and Will Scarlett O'Hara. Robin Hood himself is more credible...unlike other Robin Hoods, he can speak with an English accent. Top it all off with the urban hip-hop minstrels for a more refreshingly modern taste to a tale going sour. Seriously, how many times can one person listen to English minstrels before going crazy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When things were rotten....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I swear I read all the newspaper reviews of Men in Tights, saw all the TV interviews and have just combed all the Internet critiques. And NOBODY has made an obvious comparison with this movie.Folks reach far back to Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles or not-so-far back to Spaceballs. They bring up non-Brooks films such as Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Hot Shots.But am I the only one who remembers that Mel Brooks actually parodied Robin Hood PREVIOUSLY? He produced a TV series in 1975 titled "When Things Were Rotten." It is amazing that nobody, not even Roger Ebert, has compared Brooks' earlier foray into Robin Hood lore with the most recent one.So I guess it's up to me. The earlier treatment was, of course, episodic. This was a one-shot film. The earlier one drew from the legend itself while poking fun at TV sitcoms in general. For example, the real legend didn't feature a set of twins -- one working for Robin Hood, the other for the sheriff -- but that's the kind of cute thing that TV does. (When Brooks' writers had an episode explaining how the brothers split up, it was less funny afterward.)This outing draws a great deal from Hollywood and in particular the Costner pic. Brooks keeps Prince John, a character in the Errol Flynn movie and other treatments, even though Costner removed the prince from his tale.In the TV show, only the sheriff and his chief lackey spoke with English accents. This time, they make a point of an English-accented Robin.Both featured Brooksian sight gags and visual puns. But I think they worked better in the TV show. Maybe they were just fresher. Brooks' humor was insane and hilarious when contrasted to the starchy confines of 1970s TV. But now his work is getting stale. There were some cool gags in Men in Tights, such as the quarter-staff fight and the Everlast chastity belt, but far too much of the parody is aimed at a single previous movie. And a good parody goes for general conventions, not specifics.Rabbi Tuckman, though, was a good touch. Pure good ol' Brooks! Interesting that Dick van Patten, the TV show's Friar Tuck, gets to play the Abbot this time with a similar allusion to Abbot &amp; Costello.And I think for Brooks, 1975 WAS when things were rotten. Because not enough people were watching his show. It lasted one season. Despondent, he went out to make a Silent Movie and left TV for good.... </fullReview>

The actors pull it off effortlessly, this is a great team of well-timed performers and I can't believe they haven't made another film together, they're excellent.

		<fullReview>This show, directed by a person that did a lot of comedy, Mel Brooks did it again in this funny show. All the acting is pretty funny, from a sword fight, to a love sequence. This movie is made to be funny, which it succeeds, but I feel as if it has too much romance. There is a whole lot of parts that I feel was unnecessary, and disturbing, for example, the part when Robin sings to Marian announcing his love, his sword comes up looking like a ....., and when Mervin, the Sheriff of Nottingham tries to force Marian to have ... with him, and I assume you can if you try, fill in the gaps. I feel those parts should have been left out. Also, there are parts that were a little on the boring side, like the talk Mervin has with this guy, I forgot his name, but I found that, as well as my friends, a little boring. Other than that, this is a truly hilarious movie that everyone should see at some point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Hood: Men In Tights (Mel Brooks, 1993) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is regrettable that Mel Brooks' reasonable talent has deteriorated into the obvious (and commercially safe) lampooning of cinematic legacies; at the height of his powers, this yielded undeniably inspired classics like BLAZING SADDLES and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (both 1974)?but the formula would gradually run itself into the ground with the 'repetition' ? one only has to compare FRANKENSTEIN with the similar Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING IT (1996) to realize the difference in quality. This, then, takes on the exploits of "The Bandit Of Sherwood Forest" ? to echo the title of a much earlier (and better) straight effort, and which would follow my viewing of Brooks' film in short order ? which had just spelled big box-office all over again thanks to ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES (1991); coincidentally, history may be about to repeat itself with the imminent release of the Ridley Scott/Russell Crowe version of the legend. Anyway, given Brooks' predicament as already explained (not to mention the predictably overblown results of the Kevin Costner vehicle mentioned above), I had not bothered with this one back in the day except for brief snippets when it occasionally turned up on TV; still, since I was consciously catching up with a number of comedy titles from the 1980s and 1990s which had somehow eluded me during the current festive season (to say nothing of a handful of other Robin Hood outings), I decided it was time to finally check out MEN IN TIGHTS. In the end, the film proved harmless enough though, typically, the gags are so on-the-minute (i.e. spoofing the latest incarnation above all) that it feels instantly dated; with this in mind, someone who did not care for PRINCE OF THIEVES would find this doubly disappointing! Another instance of Brooks' diminishing status within the movie business is the undercasting involved here: Cary Elwes is hardly star material in the lead role, while the only notables among the other cast members ? all relegated to very brief appearances ? are Brooks himself (playing Friar Tuckman, the popular character having unsurprisingly undergone a Jewish makeover), Isaac Hayes and Patrick Stewart (again, a clear send-up of Sean Connery's own bit in the 1991 film that would simply go over the head of anyone unfamiliar with or who had forgotten the 'original')! Curiously, the vulgarity usually associated with Brooks' output is barely in evidence in this case: saddling Maid Marian with the proverbial chastity belt seems a desperate measure under the circumstances!; for the rest, Prince John (whose facial mole is forever changing its place) and the Sheriff of Nottingham (given to garbled speech and romantically pursued by an ugly witch) naturally constitute the brunt of most of the jokes. In typical fashion, we also get a few interpolated musical numbers: however, these are none-too-elaborate affairs ? once more stressing the down-sized budget ? compared to the director's past work. I may have sounded inordinately harsh on the film in my comments but, going into it without expectations, one is sure to be entertained to some degree by the ongoing silliness (and swordplay).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather funny spoof making fun of Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really the last Mel Brooks movie that I know of that was rather funny. Much better than the later Dracula Dead and Loving it, as this one does not get no where near as boring as that one did. Cary Elwes is great in this movie as is all the cast. The main problems stem from the fact the movie seems to run a bit long for a spoof and it is almost a scene for scene type deal doing Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. Though it did have a very funny scene spoofing the stick fight. I also liked Lewis' moving mole and the witch made me chuckle too. The story as I said is basically the same as the movie it spoofs, with a great more detail to the craziness of it all. Like Robin's return to his homeland. The original movie hit him hard with various bad news, and this one takes it the extra mile with all the tragedies and people dying (pets to I might add). There is a rousing musical interlude, an arrow contest which is one of the few scenes that spoof Robin Hood movies in general rather than just the Prince of Thieves. With all that is good though the movie suffers from the fact there are no super funny jokes. Just ones that make you chuckle and on more than one occasion simply fall flat. Still, it is worth a watch as it is the last Mel Brooks movie that came out that is worth watching.</fullReview>

The one change I liked is when they have Asneeze(Issac Hayes) and Ahchoo(Dave Chapelle). Sounds like these characters need a hanky! In the other part of the jolly mob, I liked the character Blinkin(Mark Blankfield) who seems to miss his mark. The musical part of the movie was great. Starts serious at first they the men at like "fairies" in the middle. Mel Brooks plays a rabbi who seems to be brutal when it comes to circumcision. More like castration to me. This movie is like the middle age version of "Blazin' Saddles". Unlike "BH", the people of Rottingham were a little more tolerant when they got a new sheriff. However, they did respond, "A black sheriff?" I wonder how Asneeze would have taken it? Other than that, a great cast, superb score, very upbeat, and more happy than unhappy actions there. I loved it!4.5 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin of Locksley or better known as Robin Hood (Cary Elwes) is been fighting with King Richard (Patrick Stewart), which he's far away from his home land of England. Robin has escape from the prison, he's been placed in with the help of Asneeze (Issac Hayes). Which Asneeze wants Robin to find his son Ahchoo (Dave Chapelle). Ahchoo is a exchange student studying in England. When Robin goes back to his homeland, he finds everything completely changed. The law has turned upside down there and they are forcing poor people to pay unfair taxes by King Richard's brother Prince John (Richard Lewis). Robin finds his land taken away from him and his family's castle as well. Now Robin, Ahcoo and Robin's loyal servant Blinkin (Mark Blankfield) are trying to get things change as they used to be. Prince John is trying not to change the laws with the help of "Sheriff of Rotingham" (Roger Rees) are trying to kill Robin before it's too late. But Robin form a team of warriors like Little Jon (Eric Allan Kramer) and Will Scarlett O'Hara (Matthew Porretta) to help Robin to win back his land and making things peaceful like they used to. But Robin puts himself in Danger by falling in love with Maid Marian (Amy Yasbeck), which it makes Sheriff of Rotingham extremely jealous.Directed by Mel Brooks (Blazing Sattles, Dracula:Dead and Loving It, Young Frankenstein) made an enjoyable comedic spoof to the "Robin Hood" movies and the classic stories of the genre. The cast members seems to be having a great time with this film. Elwes relishes the part greatly, a young Chappelle has some funny moments of his own, so does Lewis in his villainous role. But it's Rees that steals the show in the movie, he has many funny scenes and great comedic lines. This film wasn't much of a Box Office success back in 1993. Especially comedy spoofs like "National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1", "Hot Shots:Part Deux!" and "Fatal Instinct" were not really doing well in Theaters as well. But these kinds of movies did play better on Video. But it's "Robin Hood:Men in Tights" is the better runner-up of these jokey comedies. In my taste, anyway.DVD has an clean anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 4.0 Surround Sound. DVD includes an vintage making of featurette "Hosted by Cary Elwes", original theatrical trailer and four trailers of Brooks' classic comedies. The comedy in the movie doesn't always work at times and it seems forced as well. Brooks (Who also has a bit part), his cast and funny production designs makes-up for most of the flaws. There's funny cameos by Don DeLuise as "The Godfather", Dick Van Patten, Robert Ridgely and Stewart as King Richard. Besides Rees, the scene stealing as well is Tracey Ullman as "Latrine". Which there's some priceless moments, she shares on-screen with Lewis and Rees. Die Hard fans of Brooks' films will find this more amusing than others. If you like this kind of comedies, don't miss it. Screenplay by Brooks, Evan Chandler and J.D. Shapiro (Who adapted from the sci-fi book that turned into a Camp Classic and One of the Worst Movies of All Time "Battlefield Earth:A Saga of the Year 3000"). From a story by Shapiro and Chandler.

He has turned out some absolute classics throughout his time with us, and this is one of them.Among his works are Spaceballs, a parody of Star Wars; Young Frankenstein, a parody of the entire run of the Universal Frankenstein line; High Anxiety, a parody of Hitchcock's Vertigo with some zany BDSM play thrown in for good measure; and History of the World, Part 1, a parody of just about everything that was BCE.This work is hugely funny, with some great one-liners, and a running gag throughout. I love this for its zany antics and a really fine cast who contributes their all.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parody takes a considerable amount of genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It always strikes me that - to write a parody of something - you've really got to know where to fit the comedy into a script, and you've certainly got to know the story backwards in order to do it properly.Robin Hood, of course, is a legendary figure, and (having also seen Dracula - Dead and Loving It) I can't think of anyone more perfect to parody his story than Mel Brooks. I've never met anyone yet who admitted to hating this film, and if I did I would suspect that they were lying. Even the names of these characters are funny - everyone just thinks of the Sheriff of Nottingham as being "the Sheriff", and what an opportunity that is to give this Sheriff a terribly embarrassing first name. Excessive innuendo usually annoys me but the reason I think it works in Men In Tights is that the main characters, Marian and Robin, avoid it in their dialogue, so that it's left to the minor characters (in particular the wonderful Latrine - I had no idea that was really Tracey Ullman - and the Sheriff) to entertain us just enough with it.Another strength I found within this film is the decisions that were made about where to parody elements of earlier Robin Hood films within this one. Azeem (from Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves) has become Achoo and Asneeze - personally, I could never have invented two characters names like that. The traditional character of Friar Tuck becomes Rabbi Tuckman - and why not?Everyone should watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haven't seen most of the movie, but enough to comment on it. Very funny, but not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Hood is a very funny movie, such as Fletch. However, Fletch actually has a good and interesting storyline. Robin Hood just makes the storyline and the characters amazingly stubborn and dumb that it is funny. I liked this movie, especially the part where Robin and John fight on the bridge and they both break their sticks to the last centimeter. Also, the black guy told them that they could skip over the river, it wasn't even a river. All in all, great comedy, but don't rent it. It's not one of those movies that inspire you towards a better life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Brooks hits an in-the-park homer!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, I saw this film--again--on television and taped it. The sight gags, one liners, and the clever dialog/lyrics of this movie made me smile or laugh out loud. Talented Mel Brooks wrote the story and the song lyrics, played a part in the film, and directed it. Amy Yasbeck is a cutie as Maid Marian. Cary Elwes (Robin Hood), Dave Chappelle (Achoo), Tracey Ullman (Latrine), and Richard Lewis (Prince John), do yeoman service, but Roger Rees steals the show as the Sheriff of Rottingham. This film is a take off on The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938 w/Errol Flynn) and a SLAM DUNK of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991 w/Kevin Costner). It isn't quite up to Spaceballs standards, which I own and love, but it is in the ballpark.</fullReview>

Robin must train his nose-picking band of merry men to fight Prince John and the sherrif, while doing his best to win the heart of the fabulous fiery-haired Maid Marion. Watch out for hilarious jokes such as the stealth catapult, the Everlast chastity belt, and Mel Brook's classic line "It's good to be the king!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Brooks was sometimes funny spoofing other films...not this time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The humor in ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS is all on such a juvenile, potty humor level that it seems crass and coarse when applied to a legendary story like that of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. And surprisingly, the film got an award for Outstanding Family Motion Picture Comedy, when it goes for cheap laughs about chastity belts and plenty of double entendre lines with sexual content. ("It's not the size that counts, it's what you do with it!") and typically Jewish jokes about circumcision, thanks to Mel Brooks who wrote the whole thing.He did a great job of spoofing Alfred Hitchcock films in HIGH SOCIETY, but fails utterly to give any sort of charm or wit to his spoof of the Ancient Robin Hood Legends, or any dignity as the Flynn/de Havilland version did in the famous 1938 version. Instead, he opts for lowbrow humor at every turn, brings blacks into the scheme of things as some of the Merry Men, and turns the whole exercise into a gaudy vaudeville show with only CARY ELWES bearing any resemblance to what the Robin Hood characters should look like. Elwes bears an amazing resemblance to Errol Flynn, courtesy of costuming and make-up and his own similar facial features, and at least has the good sportsmanship to play the part with some sense of dignity.It couldn't have been easy for him. The low laughs aren't up to Brooks' usual standard and only occasionally is there a trace of wit among the many jokes and one-liners.Anyone fond of the more legendary Robin Hood films would find it hard to appreciate the humor in this obvious and rather coarse spoof. Most of the "funny" lines are delivered by actors who have no real comic flair, which only makes things worse.Summing up: CARY ELWES and PATRICK STEWART (as King Richard) are the only actors who manage to come out of this without shredding their reputations to bits.</fullReview>

Instead, we have Cary Elwes(Liar,Liar,Twister)in the title role as Robin Hood. We also have big name stars in the other roles. If you saw the Costner one, you will love the spoof!!It also has cameos by Patrick Stewart(Star Trek:The Next Generation,Dune, Conspiracy Theory) and Dick Van Patton(the TV series "Eight is Enough").

		<fullReview>I thought this film was hilarious, it is a definite classic. I just saw it again, after watching Robin Hood Prince of Thieves and noticed it was a spoof on the 1991 film. Robin comes back from the crusades, and they did a spoof on the sand-kissing scene. Achoo appears to be Azim's spoof. When Robin says, "And unlike other Robin Hoods *I* can speak with an English accent" this is a total attack on Kevin Costner who sounded like he just came form a yankees ball game. Latrine is Mortiana's spoof and they share the egg-cracking scene. That wierd boy who was screaming and running from the Sherrif's men.There were more but I forget them, so be sure to watch Prince of Thieves first and peel your eyes for the connections. It will make you lmao, and if you don't laugh at the scene where Rabbi Tuck tells them what circumsision is then you may not laugh during this movie at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not very complicated stuff, a parody on Robin Hood and his gang of outlaws who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. The movie takes situations from being actually very funny to being a bit too stupid. As when a blind man sits on a toilet and doesn't hook that the castle he's sitting in is being removed - or when the blind man is fighting with a sword against a wooden pole. Or when Robin Hood swims all the way from Arabia too England. Or when Robin Hood flashes down seven bolts. Or when a camera breaks a window...it's very silly in reality, but it's funny.

		<fullReview>In the spirit of "Spaceballs", a spoof ala sci fi, we now get the story of Robin and his Merry Men. Both the heroes and villians alike are chuckle inducing goofballs, and there is subtle and outright humor at every single turn.For example, I almost peed myself laughing when Rottingham says "Men, walk THIS way!". There are few jokes I can emulate for you here, for the most part you must see them to get the full punch.Recommended, even if you haven't seen Prince of Thieves.</fullReview>

Nevertheless, the very gorgeous Cary Elwes is wonderful in this.Very sad, I know, but living right next door to Nottingham, I'm a bit of a Robin Hood connoisseur. You have to go way back to Errol Flynn to find a film that's done the legend justice. Prince Of Thieves was hilariously camp ? I adore Alan Rickman's pantomime villain of a Sheriff, and I thought the film in general was great if you took it all with a pinch of salt. Okay, a bucket. But I'm getting off-topic here. Men In Tights is side-splittingly funny, Mel Brooks is a genius, Cary Elwes is underrated both as an actor-actor and a spoofy-comedic-actor, and Tracy Ullman is a goddess. Watch it.</fullReview>

Also you gotta love them checking the script to make sure Robin gets another shot. Also: 12th Century Fox.Any bad stuff? The rappers at the beginning and the end seem rather out dated. The songs were rather lame. One time while watching this movie, I could think out a few more times when they could have thrown in another joke or 2.

		<fullReview>If you don't like Mel Brooks, you won't like this film. That's a given. Why anyone wouldn't like his films is unknown to me, but for those who can't see the light, just avoid it.Everyone else: This is a classic. The entire cast is perfect: Carey Elwes is a dashing, clever, BRITISH Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck overacts appropriately as Marion, Richard Lewis is his usual distracted, annoyed self, Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of fluster and violence as "Mervyn" the Sheriff of Rottingham, and Dave Chapelle, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield, and the sadly underused Matthew Poretta are the perfect Merry Men.There are similarities to Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles...and every other Mel Brooks movie. But why would you want him to change his style when it works so damn well? The pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be funny again...from the view of a 16 year old, at least. It's complete and utter parody, every second a play for a laugh. Some of them don't work, but most do, and well. I discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time I watched the film!Of course, if being barraged by constant visual and verbal gags isn't your style, you wouldn't like this. This isn't an Academy Award winner, it's Mel Brooks. You know what it is when you're getting into it. If you want nonstop laughter, surprisingly well-developed characters, and catchphrases to last a lifetime, watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Robin Hood: Men in Tights back in 1994 in the cinema. I went to see it because I always liked Robin Hood and I saw the trailer of this movie and thought it was hilarious. After I saw the movie I must say it was even better than I thought. Not only is it very funny, it's also a very well made movie with beautiful sets and costumes and a very beautiful score by Hummie Mann. The acting in the movie is also good, Cary Elwes is funny as Robin Hood and also Tracey Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, David Chapelle, Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks himself are funny. But the best part in the movie is played by Roger Rees as the evil Sheriff of Rottingham. He has the best scenes in the movie and also the best dialogue ("King illegal forest to pig wild kill in it a is", which stands for "It is illegal to kill a wild pig in the king's forest").He somehow mixes up all the words and speaks out a sentence that nobody understands. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is in my book one of the best Mel Brooks films to date and I can't say that I have laughed as much about a film as this one. It's just non-stop laughing.</fullReview>

Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie. What makes this movie special you say? Throughout the movie you see blinken and acuhu walk beside each other becoming great friends as Robin Hood's sidekicks. But, it Blinken is never told or fails to grasp that he is black, until the crowd says " a black sheriff", Blinken replays "He's black". That is a timeless scene. Simple one of the most enteraining movies of our time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the FUNNIEST movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; "We're Men in tights!" If you have a good sense of humor, you'll LOVE this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Mel Brooks Style comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that this is a terrific comedy. It has everything that you want in a comedy.This movie pokes fun at The Robin Hood movies (prince of theives,etc)I saw the trailer in theaters and I had wanted to see it for some reason. My mom rented it for me when it was out on video. The movie isn't that funny when you're 6 years old like I was but the older you get the jokes get funnier. Total Mel Brooks style.Note: Don't see this film unless you are familiar with Mel Brooks' previous work. See the earlier stuff first like spaceballs and Young Frankenstien.Robin Hood: Men in tights is a must see. Rent it or see it any way you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Best But It's Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks is a great writer,director and actor, but once in a while even he can have a klinker. The beginning of this starts out almost basically just meeting one character after another.You have Cary Elwes who's charming and talented, but he can't do comedy. His expressions into the camera show that even he can't believe the inanities in the script. Richard Lewis looks bored and distracted throughout without much to do and Amy Yasbeck is stuck in high-school acting mode. Dave Chapelle shows great comedy range mugging and hamming for the camera and Mark Blankfield is mostly stifled in the role of the blind man, but then he does still manage to show great comedy range. Eric Allen Kramer doesn't have much to do, but the few scenes he does have are binding. The best roles are those of Roger Rees, Tracy Ullman, Megan Cavanaugh and Brooks for when he does appear. Dom DeLuise has a funny turn as a Mafia Don employing a Clint Eastwood lookalike, but on the minus side, some of the jokes aren't very funny while some of the really funny ones seem stolen from Mel's other movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks has really outdone himself on this movie. No one can deny that Blazing Saddles was a classic, and a breakthrough in this style of comedy film, but Men In Tights has become the apex of his creative genius. This movie is a definite must-see. If you enjoy this movie, I would also recommend Space Balls and History Of The World. The same goes in reverse. If you have seen any of these movies, then Men In Tights should be next on your list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious? Of course. Unusually well-developed characters? That too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like all of Mel Brooks' other comedies, Men in Tights is hilarious. But in seeing this as an outrageous comedy, I think many fail to realize that the reason the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves are acted so well. Elwes is the well-spoken former British noble, Lewis is an eternally annoyed king (I hope it's worth all the NOOOOOOIIIISE!), DeLuise is a FANTASTIC godfather, Roger Rees is a worried and cynical sheriff.... The actors and actresses are so loyal to their parts that the jokes flow forth with ease. Yes, we've seen this kind of comedy before, but the only comedy to achieve better character development, in my opinion, is The Big Lebowski. Very very funny.</fullReview>

The action is also funny. It's a very amusing. And that's why I like it. It shouldn't be the real thing all the time. This is the best Robin Hood movie I've ever seen. Really!

		<shortDescription>A Knee-Slappin Good Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? The guy gives us "Blazing Saddles" and "Young Frakenstein" as classic slapstick films. But the best was yet to come. When Director Mel Brooks wrote "Men in Tights," I can't even fathom what he was thinking. And I'm saying that in a good way.Cary Elwes (Robin Hood) gives a great performance with excellent comic timing and a wide-range of voices. The classic "Unlike some Robin Hoods, I can speak with an English accent" pokes fun at the myriad of Robin Hood films ever made. Richard Lewis played Prince John and I must say this was his finest work. The mole- oh, the mole- in a different place every scene ("I have a mole?") and the stupidness he exerts in his role is not one to go unrecognized. The fact that he is Prince of England yet has NO English accent whatsoever adds to this insane display of comedy.As for the extensive characters and cameos, we see Rabbi Tuckman (Brooks), the circumcizing Jew with the sacred wine; the Abbott (Dick Van Patton) and the annoying "HEY ABBOTT!"; the Godfather wannabe (Dom DeLouise) and his lizard and tongueless assistant; and Blinkin', Little John, Achoo, Will Scarlet O'Hara, and more.I must say however, one of the most well-known parts of the film is the classic song and dance number with all the guys singing "We're men, we're men in tight, TIGHT, tights" is the funniest musical parody I have ever seen. So whether your mood is good or bad, you will walk away smiling and not able to get that song out of your head. You'll hide a grin when hearing "Chastity Belt" and you won't be able to forget the song and, actions, that occur behind that sheet hanging up in the woods.Congrats to Brooks and the cast on making one of the most intelligently-written parodies of our time and a film that will go down in history as.....ridiculous. In a good way. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Hood Men In Tights ruined Michael Jackson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has, since I first saw it, been by far my favorite comedy and I used to claim that I thought it was Mel Brooks' best work. I only recently realized, thanks to IMDb, that this is one of the few Mel Brooks films where he had no hand in the writing. So how did Men In Tights come to be? The answer is an ironic and, unfortunately, in no way a funny one.The writer and original conceiver of the film is Evan Chandler. For those who immediately recall the name, you will undoubtedly understand the disdain I feel. For those who don't know, Evan Chandler is the father of the boy who originally brought up child molestation charges against Michael Jackson (Since the death of Michael Jackson, he has confessed that he lied about the charges.) As part of the settlement for the case, Michael Jackson was required to get one of the child's father's screenplays produced. That screenplay was Robin Hood: Men in Tights - it is notable to mention that Evan Chandler and Jackson were "friends" prior to the allegations and Chandler had hounded Jackson to produce one of his screenplays, which Jackson had repeatedly refused. Motive??? If you'll notice, Evan Chandler appears as both writer and associate producer for this film.This movie unfortunately ran a higher price than most films, blockbuster or not. This movie cost one of the greatest entertainers, philanthropists, and world empathizers this generation has seen his reputation, career, and in some ways his life. It shocks me that so many notable and respectable figures such as Mel Brooks, Cary Elwes, Dave Chapelle, among others would knowingly agree to take on a project spawned from the destruction of another man's dignity.Though this is still one of my favorite movies, I believe it is important to recognize the pain and suffering caused by its production and I think that this is information any fan of the movie should know. Please, don't just take my word for it...research this more for yourself, and discover a little piece of human greed and corruption at its worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest and wittiest movies ever produced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One person said that he didn't find this movie funny and then went on to site the only part in the movie that he DID find funny: the part where Robin and Little John are hitting each other's hands with the sticks after they broke. First of all, if this is the only thing he found funny it indicates a really immature sense of humour. For most (intelligent) people it is the spoken lines in the movie in tandem with the good comic acting, that makes it so hilarious. And yes there is a good deal of physical humour. The only way I can understand that person's statement is that he must watched the movie without any audio.Also, I can only explain the low rating this movie got by concluding that most of the negative votes were cast by Americans who found the film threatening (to their precious prince of THIEVES).I gave the movie an 8 out of 10 rating because despite it's comic brilliance, it had a few unfortunate flaws in it which clearly reflect Hollywood clawprints. The most annoying one is the fact that "King Richard" was made to kiss Maid Mariam and to give her a much bigger kiss than Robin Hood gave her.Sounds petty? But that's why it doesn't get a ten for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Usual Mel Brook plot line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most Mel Brooks spoofs, "Robin Hood:Men in tights" wasn't exactly family comedy. Expect the usual double innuendo jokes that reminded some people of the "Black Adder" series.That said, this is one of Mel Brooks better films. Young, dashing Robin of Loxley returns to find his ancestral home towed away, and gains a new enemy in the Sheriff of Nottingham who has a penchant for spoonerisms.Will he be able to get back his castle deeds, win the seemingly modest maid Marian and retain some modicum of respect from the villagers after his dreadful Winston Churchill speech? There are plenty of pop culture references that took on the movies of the decade (this was the 90's after all) such as Home Alone, White men can't jump etc. Expect to groan and laugh at any familiar looking scenes . (I know I did) It was the impressive leading man though that really made this fun to watch. Cary Elwes carried off his role as Robin of Loxley a la Errol Flynn style. Which was definitely better than Kevin Costner in the original film...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Hood: Men in Tights in my opinion is Mel Brook's most under rated film. I've watched Robin Hood a million times and I still laugh as if I were watching it for the first time. It has great jokes and typical Mel Brooks humor that works so well. The cast just clicked and made Robin Hood into one of the greatest slap stick comedies! Of course, Robin Hood: Men in Tights parodies Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. It stars the first actually British Robin Hood, Cary Elwes, hence the great line "Because unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak with an English accent". LOL! My favorite scenes include the witch praying for the right man to come into her life and the Sheriff of Rottingham comes crashing through the roof and she says "Thank you!". Not to mention the wedding between the Sheriff and Maid Marian, when we find out his real name is Mervin.Every line, every sight gag is so memorable that you can't help but fall in love with Robin Hood. Especially the song "Men in Tights" just makes you almost die of laughter. Please watch Robin Hood: Men in Tights, it's a great Mel Brooks film! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What The Hell Happened To Mel Brooks???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can scarcely believe that the same man...the same Genius...that directed "The Producers", "Young Frankenstein", and "Blazing Saddles" can possibly be the perpetrator of this...this...ABORTION! The aforementioned are some of the most profoundly hysterical films ever made by anyone. "High Anxiety" and "History Of The World: Part 1" weren't on that level, but were still exceptionally funny for the most part. I really, really liked his remake of Lubitsch's "To Be Or Not To Be" even though there was a much cruder edge. It was a step back up. I knew something had really changed, though, when I first saw "Spaceballs". For every joke that worked...and many still did...there were at least 4 or 5 that didn't. Then came the horrendous "Life Stinks" and I knew the downhill slide was rapidly accelerating, but until I saw "Robin Hood: Men In Tights" I hadn't realized how far he had fallen. Even going into it with low expectations I was flabbergasted. The "jokes" fly fast and furious, but they are so juvenile, so infantile as to be deeply embarrassing. I can't imagine that adults...actual grown people are supposed to find this funny. The abysmal puns and snickering smut jokes I would've laughed at when I was 5 or 6, but would've already been cringing at by the time I was 9. Knock-knock jokes are on a higher plane than this excrement. It's almost as if Brooks actually sat down and purposely collected the tiredest, lamest, most moronic, most cretinous, and just simply the WORST jokes he possibly could. It's almost as if he actually set out to make a bad movie. I can't think of any other explanation unless the man has just plainly and simply lost every shred, every vestige of his once mammoth talent. Loathe as I am to say it, but this seems to me the case. I have never seen "Dracula: Dead And Loving It", but if it's as bad as this...or even worse as per the trend I never want to, and I most definitely never want to sit through this sad, sorry excuse for a Mel Brooks film EVER AGAIN! Sad, sad, sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This flick is a perfect example of just how fickle the Comedy Muse can be. She is not a very faithful or reliable companion and can abandon even a most gifted comic writer, director and producer of TV shows and films like Mel Brooks. While she was definitely "all over him" during his creation of comic classics like the first season of "Get Smart" (Yeah!), "The Producers", "Blazing Saddles" and my all-time favorite Brooks concoction, "Young Frankenstein", she made herself pretty scarce on Brooks' other projects like "High Anxiety", "Spaceballs" ? and this disappointing exercise in "how to make a comedy movie that's not very funny". What could have ? and should have ? been a Mel Brooks howler turns out to be nothing more than a boring yawn. It's little more than a compendium of clichéd and hackneyed one liners and slapstick gags and rehashings of things expropriated from Brooks' other more successful works. In fact, one of the lines from this clunker is "well, it (this gag I'm trying to make here) worked in 'Blazing Saddles'?" Yeah, well, unfortunately "it" didn't work in this film and only underscores the fact that it's dismally unoriginal.And when I say this flick was a disappointment, I mean Disappointment!!! No one loves parodies of classic action and adventure movies ? swashbucklers in particular ? more than I do and the great title of this flick really promised that it would be a real laugh riot. But, the Comedy Muse just wouldn't give us fans a break and bless Brooks with the inspiration ? and material ? to do justice to a subject which literally screams out for a good spoofing.Now, though the Comedy Muse was "out foolin' around' with other guys" during Brooks' work on this film (seems she really had the HOTS for Jerry Seinfeld at this time), she did drop back in on Brooks every so often so there were a few bright spots like Brooks, himself, as the Jewish Rabbi-in-place-of-the-Christian-Friar-Tuck and Dom DeLuise as a shady and effete "ferren" nobleman ala The Godfather (I admit to being really biased here as I like Dom so much, just seeing him appear on the screen doubles me over?). Even the usually lukewarm Richard Lewis does a better-than-expected job of portraying a mealy mouthed and bungling Prince John and delivers a few choice lines which managed to pry a twitter from my otherwise closed-in-deep-disappointment mouth. But these three characters really were much too little and much too hit 'n miss to save this turkey. What should have been a comic masterpiece turned out to be just another comic flop ? thanks to Ms. Comedy Muse deserting Mr. Brooks at the worst possible (for us "lovers of good parodies") time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Watching Old People #!@%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's my own private theory that the decade between roughly 1966, and roughly 1976, represents not just a sea-change/high-point/Belle Epoque of the arts in this country, but the duration of a force-field imposed by aliens who briefly took over our bodies and spent a long arts and crafts holiday here, giving us 2001 and REVOLVER and BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS and CLOSE TO THE EDGE and CHINATOWN and much more in the process; and when they left at last for their home world, the bodies they inhabited reverted right back to their true selves. In the case of Mel Brooks, through whose corporeal shell the Visitors had crafted THE PRODUCERS, BLAZING SADDLES and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, that means a pushy, tiresome, obnoxious hack.Well, it's as good an explanation as any, right? Brooks so totally lost the plot from the latter half of the 70s on that bodysnatching aliens and Faustian bargains spring naturally to mind as reasonable explanations: that's how fast, and far, he fell off the cliff. There isn't a single funny moment in his ROBIN HOOD spoof, but this is far worse than simply "unfunny". Few things in life are as painful to endure as third-rate comedy performed badly, by incompetents incapable of timing a gag or delivering even a throwaway line without stepping on the joke. Not that this is measurably worse than the half-dozen or so lead balloons Brooks made prior to this. On the other hand, it's every bit as wheezingly unfunny as they were. If it wasn't, would Dick van Patten even be in this? Yeah.... when I think of freewheeling, anything-goes absurdist satire, Van Patten's the first name that comes to mind. Oh, yeah....about those jokes. They're about on the level of a Bob Hope Special from 1971, only with the racier, edgier material cut out."And this is my friend Will Scarlet." "Well, Scarlet's my middle name. (pause) My full name is Will Scarlet O'Hara. (longer pause) We're from Georgia."That's one of the better ones, folks. And even though the joke as written is terrible, and could never be made funny no matter how it was read, the tortuous Pasadena Playhouse pauses actually make the thing even worse than it already is. Which is pretty much this movie in a nutshell - bad ideas, made worse by terrible writing, further doomed by an unsuitable cast, all of whom flail away helplessly without any sort of competent direction. If you must see this, see it on basic cable so you'll at least have the cell-phone and diet soda commercials to look forward to. And maybe you, too, will wonder how it was possible anybody ever thought Mel Brooks was a genius, and how in the world did he keep getting money to make these godawful comedies. I can't help you with the second question, but as far as the first goes, trust me; it was the aliens.</fullReview>

What with BLAZING SADDLES (Crossbow Productions/Warner Brothers, 1974) doing Westerns, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (Crossbow/20th Century-Fox, 1974) Horror, SILENT MOVIE(Crossbow/20th Century Fox, 1976) the Silent Screen and HIGH ANXIETY (20th Century-Fox, 1977)) Hitchcock; he has certainly proved the popularity of these Parodies, as well as his own special skills in writing, acting, directing and producing same.POKING fun at such a well known and oft made story as the Robin Hood Legend in ROBIN HOOD, MEN IN TIGHTS (Brooksfilms/Socete de Etablissments de Gaumont/20th Century-Fox, 1993) is the sort of job that Mel could merely "phone in". The very notion of this 'Rob the Rich' Champion of the Oppressed of the Middle Ages is in it self so much Bigger than Life, that it borders on a parody of Knighthood, itself. All that is required is just a little old American Fracturing; and fracturing Mel did. Starting out as a real gathering of old., experienced cast, the thin storyline only needed to be tweaked, just a trifle, ALL of the usual Robin Hood situations seem to be represented in this great burlesquing. Robin's meeting up with Maid Marian, confrontations with the villainous Sheriff of "Rottingham"*, the evil and autocratic Prince John's plot to keep his brother, Good King Richard the Lion Heart captive in continental Europe and even the trap set for Robin with the Archery Tournament are all represented; albeit in various fractured and gag-ridden versions.OUR personal favourites are Mel Brooks appearance as not Friar Tuck; but rather Rabbi Tuckman, Purveyor of Fine Clerical Wines (and a handy, little do it your self medical machine. Next to that we really enjoyed the ensemble song and dance of the "Robin Hood, Men in Tights" title number.ALTHOUGH the original story is credited to J.D. Shapiro and Evan Chandler, Mr. Brooks collaborated in writing the screenplay and Mel's hand is apparent. As we look over the Mel Brooks resume of his work in both Television and the Movies, we make note of his short-lived project from some years earlier. The project was WHEN THINGS WERE ROTTEN (Paramount Television, ABC TV Network, 1975). We're sure that there was surely a plethora of Medieval, Knighthood in Flower and Robin Hood gags left over from episodes proposed, planned and ultimately axed.THE cast is at least more than up to the task of bringing the episodic, even sketch-like scenes into a single, coherent continuity. The players included: Cary Elwes (Robin Hood), Amy Yasbeck (Maid Marian), Richard Lewis (Prince John), Mel Brooks (Rabbi Tuckman), Patrick Stewart (King Richard the Lion Hearted), Eric Allan Kramer (Little John), Matthew Poretta (Will Scarlet O'Hara) and: Dom DeLouise, Isaac Hayes, Dick van Patten, Tracy Ullman, Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, Ronny Graham, Wayne Littleman and a cast of thousands! (Not really) WHILE not considered to be an outstanding example of the Brooks' Output; it is always amusing, never boring and worthwhile taking in at least once or twice NOTE:: * This 'un surely sounds like a Mel Brooks special, probably a left over from the above mentioned WHEN THINGS WERE ROTTEN Brooks TV Series!

		<shortDescription>very excellent spoof of Robin Hood!!!very funny!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Hood : Men in Tights is a very excellent spoof of the blockbuster hit movie "Robin Hood:Prince Of Thieves" with Kevin Costner. Instead, we have Cary Elwes(Liar,Liar,Twister)in the title role as Robin Hood. We also have big name stars in the other roles. If you saw the Costner one, you will love the spoof!!It also has cameos by Patrick Stewart(Star Trek:The Next Generation,Dune, Conspiracy Theory) and Dick Van Patton(the TV series "Eight is Enough"). This movie has other stars , but I cannot remember them all!!Mel Brooks directing is great , as is the cast!!!The movie is very funny from the start to the end!!!A classic of the 1990's!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been a great family film. The ratings board wasn't kidding when it was rated PG-13 for off-color humor!There were some truly hilarious moments in the movie, and I wished that I could share it with my children (teenagers), but there is no way I could do that in good conscience. If only the writers would have focused on writing a hilarious script instead of choosing to make it full of sexual innuendo! If they had kept it clean, they could have had a classic hit like Princess Bride. Cary Elwes is charming in his role of Robin Hood, reminiscent of his role in Princess Bride, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aims low, with hilarious results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby Stereo SRBasically an updated version of director Mel Brooks' fondly-remembered TV spoof "When Things Were Rotten" (1975), ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS emerged at a time when American comedy had become dominated by the influence of no-holds-barred entries like AIRPLANE! and TV's "Police Squad!" (both of which owe a debt to Brooks' trailblazing work since the 1960's), and while "Robin Hood"s style is resolutely 'Brooksian', the film's scattershot approach reflects contemporary attitudes to this particular subgenre. The plot is remarkably faithful to (and respectful of) the 1938 classic THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, as Robin (Cary Elwes) returns to England from the Crusades to find the throne usurped by a villainous pretender (Richard Lewis), forcing the handsome hero and his Merry Men to take arms against their enemies. Along the way, Robin falls in love with Maid Marian (Amy Yasbeck) and is lured into a final showdown with England's oppressors after being cornered during an archery contest, allowing King Richard (a surprise guest star) to emerge triumphant during the final reel.Brooks may have been considered past his prime when "RH:MIT" hit theaters, but this a joy from start to finish: Dom DeLuise acts up a storm in a scene-stealing cameo as the Brandoesque 'godfather' Don Giovanni (accompanied by his cohorts Dirty Ezio and 'Filthy Luca'!), and there's a couple of hilarious song and dance routines (Elwes sings a WONDERFUL ballad to Yasbeck during a romantic lakeside vigil, during which the notes reach such a pitch they threaten to blow her away!), while Brooks' script (co-written with Evan Chandler and J. David Shapiro) makes a number of mocking references to the Kevin Costner 'epic' ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES which had enjoyed box office success in 1991. A bland presence in so many movies, Elwes displays a remarkable gift for light comedy here, playing a delightfully daft Robin Hood, and he's matched throughout by Roger Rees as an equally silly Sheriff of Rottingham. The period art direction (by Roy Forge Smith and Stephen Myles Berger) looks surprisingly cheap in places, but the film's tatty production values simply add to the spirit of threadbare anarchy. Brooks co-stars as 'Rabbi Tuckman', alongside such familiar faces as David Chappelle, Isaac Hayes, Dick Van Patten, Tracey Ullman and many others. As with all such enterprises, the results are pretty hit or miss, but Brooks and his cast try SO hard, even the misses are a lot of fun. It's nice to see a movie aim low and hit the bullseye virtually every time!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible!! Very Disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was abysmal. Mel Brooks went very sloppy on writing and directing this movie. It was as if he wrote the script in like 3 days. The man just wrote down any joke anything that popped into his head.I have been a Mel Brooks fan since I was about eight. Mel Brooks is my idol. I used to love watching "Young Frankenstein,""The Producers" and "Blazing Saddles", but this film has lost the traditional Mel Brooks touch.I have also noticed upon watching this movie that some of the jokes have been used in some of the earlier Mel Brooks movies, (e.g. the 'It's Good To Be The King' joke has been taken from the "History Of The World part 1" movie).So to all Mel Brooks fans. Don't attempt to watch this movie, it would only fill you with disappointment. Take my word for it, I am a die hard Mel Brooks fan, I have experienced on watching this movie and it is a total waste of time.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my certified least favorite movie of all time - bar none! It was almost embarrassing watching the degeneration of Mel Brooks' talent - starting with Spaceballs, continuing with Life Stinks and culminating in a collection of the most pathetic excuse for jokes ever that is Men in Tights. There is not a single funny moment in the entire movie, and more often than not I was left thinking, 'what the hell's supposed to be funny about this scene?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The script is better than the horrible casting and execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the script for this movie and it is funnier than the movie turned out to be. The casting is horrible. I like Cary Elwes but he's a dramatic talent and not a funny man. I can see him as a serious Robin Hood in a serious movie. Here, however, he is simply not funny and his dignity never seems to break, also not good for a stupid humor movie. Amy Yasbeck also seems like a dramatic talent but, for whatever reason, she keeps getting stuck in comedy movies and comedy TV series. You can almost read her mind going, "This material is so stupid. What am I doing here?" Chris Rock would have been funnier in the role of Achoo. Dave Chappelle is considered very funny by many people but he's just dull in this. The Blazing Saddle element was attempted here but Chappelle does not have the life in him that Clevon Little had. Richard Lewis as Prince John and Roger Rees as the sheriff are the only two bits of good casting in the flick. Lewis is boring here and not nearly as nervous as the part called for, strange because he is what one thinks of to play a nervous comedian. The movie's lone bright spot is Rees as the sheriff of Rottingham. He is very funny in the part and gives it the ridiculous portrayal that a movie of this type needs. The guy who played Blinkin is a funny guy but, instead of a loving parody of blind humor, the movie comes off as being cruel. The "rap" stuff also isn't good. If you want to produce rap, go all the way and make it real, not lily "white" rap. There is also a part in the original script where Achoo launches into a gigantic anti-white tirade. This was excluded from the final film for obvious reasons. Nothing subtle here from Brooks. He simply wanted to pick a topic and mail it it. Maybe he needed the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The WORST Mel Brooks film by far. Cringe-o-rama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks has made some great comedies. Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Dracula - Dead and Loving It etc. He's also made some stinkers and this - Robin Hood: Men in Tights - takes the crown as the worst of them.The movie setting of olde England is almost irrelevant as there are so many anachronistic elements thrown in as to make the time period meaningless. What's worse, these elements are included only for comic effect, which works the first time they appear, but then are just nerve-gratingly awful throughout the rest of the film.Jokes and sight-gags abound, but are of such a peurile and childish nature that they'd only get a laugh out of a two year old. Even worse, many of them are so telegraphed and obvious as to lessen any impact they might have. Either that, or they are drawn out to an extent far beyond any comic value they have (The Mexican Wave scene, for example).This movie reminds me of a mediaeval Airplane. The comedy is of a similar, but vastly inferior, nature. Sadly, like Airplane, this sort of comedy is just not amusing anymore. I challenge anyone with an IQ of more than their shoe size to find this film remotely funny at all. It just makes you want to cringe into your seat in embarrassment.Only the presence of Cary Elwes as the lead adds any credibility to this film, but even that is foiled by Amy Yasbeck's awful Maid Marian. Never before have I wanted to slap someone so much as her. She's just dire!To summarise then, this is an embarrassing turkey of a film and not worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Blazing Saddles. Mel Brooks should be ashamed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Robin Hood Men in Tights' is supposed to be an attempt at telling the tale of Robin Hood through using a lot of crude humor. The film was released after the success of the 'Robin Hood Prince of Thieves' film. Unless you like the sense of humor, do not bother watching this one. You will either love it or hate it, depending on your sense of humor. If you enjoy crude humor and watching a bunch of guys running around in tights, then this film is for you. If you could not imagine anything worse, then certainly do not watch this film. I give it a 1/10 because I do not like this sense of humor and I found nothing praise-worthy about the film at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't see what's so funny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see a lot of reviews claiming this is the funniest movie ever made. Apparently, I saw a different movie. I just watched this for the first time last night. I had always heard how hilarious this movie was and I am a big fan of other Mel Brooks movies. I was prepared for a laugh riot but I was very disappointed. I don't understand what is so funny about having almost every joke spelled out for you. Most of the jokes were so juvenile that I can't see anyone over 15 finding them funny. And some were just so drawn out (the "godfather" scene). I don't think I let out more that a mere chuckle throughout the entire movie. I suppose it all depends on your sense of humor. I have no problem laughing at something if it's funny, but this movie was just not. Go ahead and judge it for yourself, but I don't ever want to see this garbage again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides "Weekend at Bernie's," this is the only major film I've ever walked out on. I LOVED "Blazing Saddles," "High Anxiety," "History of the World, Part I," but this absolute train wreck was the sure-fire sign that Mel Brooks's days were long behind him. Oh, to think that this was how comedian Dave Chappelle, one of the funniest comics out there got his start. He performed some really un-funny rap and one can only hope he was handsomely paid to do so. This is one of those films so bad the film studio should've paid viewers to watch. As far as movie bombs go, this one was a 50-megaton one. I don't believe I got one single laugh from this film.</fullReview>
