		<shortDescription>Clarke is adorable and the critics get it wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can so many people get this this movie wrong, especially the critics? The high point of the film is the performance by Emelia Clarke. She is hair-brained, and scatty, completely adorable and wonderful.The camera-work is gorgeous and the soundtrack is second to none.Lou (Emilia Clarke) gets a job as a carer to a man (William) who is paralyzed more or less from the neck down. A budding friendship/romance develops; and this is 90% a feel good movie.The criticism of the movie that it depicts a life with profound disability as almost worthless is completely mistaken. The movie depicts William's life as worthwhile and precious. It is William's own judgment that his life cannot go on as it is, and that he would prefer to die.With regard to this, the movie does tend to downplay the pain and suffering that William experiences. Instead it focuses on the good times and precious moments he spends will Lou. And as already stated, the character of Lou is completely adorable. I am in love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tear-Jerking "Me Before You": Reminding Ourselves of Living Boldly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thea Sharrock's film adaptation of Jojo Moyes's "Me Before You" is one of those hidden gems, which we should all watch rather early than later. First, the talented British cast is impressive. Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Janet McTeer, Charles Dance, Matthew Lewis, just to name a few, beautifully create an emotional journey, which is more than just a heart-breaking love story. Challenging our life perspectives every step of the way, these actors invite us to live boldly and seize the opportunities passing by. Louisa Clarke (Emilia Clarke), a naive 26-year old English woman, lives in a peaceful village where nothing seems to be happening. Supporting her whole family financially, Lou has a dull life working hard without ever leaving our native city. When she loses her job at Buttered Bun Cafe, her world is turned upside down. Desperately looking for a new job, she goes to the local job center and is proposed to work for a despicable 30ish-year old quadriplegic man called Will Traynor. His desire not to get help makes him look miserable and frustrated. However, with time, Lou pierces his shell and unveils Will's true colors. She starts showing him how great his life could be. But one revelation changes their relationship forever.Best known for his roles as Finnick Odair in "The Hunger Games" series, Sam Claflin's portrayal of Will is exquisite. It is almost inconceivable to imagine him not being a part of this movie. The physical and psychological challenge of playing a quadriplegic man, who needs to feel like a man again, elevates the English-born actor to Hollywood's acting A-list. In "Me Before You", Claflin convinces us that words are way more impactful than being good looking. Through his presence on the screen, Claflin inhabits one of the most powerful quotes of Jojo Moyes's original story, "You only get one life. It is actually your duty to live it as fully as possible". Playing opposite Claflin, Emilia Clarke ("Game of Thrones") shines through with her naivety and authentic, clumsy attitude on the screen. Her unique facial expression, while crying and laughing, makes us fall even more for the quirky, innocent Lou. No one could have ever filled the role better than the Mother of Dragons herself. Emilia Clarke is LOU CLARKE! From her crazy outfits in the movie to her charming personality, Clarke has it all. "Me Before You" will be the catalyst in her career, so let's be ready to see some more of this bumble bee.On a final note, we should be grateful to Jojo Moyes for questioning us on the reality of assisted suicide and physical disabilities.There are not lots of writers who have been able to make such a statement and shake the status quo when it comes to life and death, but Moyes did it beautifully. The only thing left to say is: GO WATCH this movie! You will not regret it! It will make laugh, cry, but most importantly push you to embrace life fully!P.S. Bring with you some tissues! You might need them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claflin and Clarke where to perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is getting mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed it. A very bittersweet film that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. I never read the book that which this film is based on. But sometimes movies are never has detailed has the books they are based on.A beautifully well made story, it about Louisa(Emilia Clarke) a 26 year old who finds a job taking care of Will(Sam Claflin) a young billionaire who is permanently confined to wheel chair after an accident two years earlier, the use of his arms and legs are gone. At first Will does not want Louisia there, and she does her best to put up with him. But soon the form quite a friendship, she teaches him to enjoy life again, and he shows her to be adventurous in life. But the question is will this last? I like the chemistry between Claflin and Clarke, at no point it feels forced. I really bought the affection they feel for one another. At times Clarkes performance feels overly cartoonish, but still good in most of it. Claflin is believable, and the question is how would you feel if you where in his shoes. I don't care what the critics say, this was a perfectly well made bittersweet film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet love story for those who wants to get lost in the moment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that I have read the book and so when the movie came out, I just HAD to go see it. So I drag my poor husband and we went to watch a late show that was relatively full. I didn't tell him anything about the movie and I watched him watching it. He actually really enjoyed it. The movie was lovely. The movie itself was beautiful. The scenery was set somewhere is rural England. There are green pastures, a castle and beautiful stone walkways. We first meet Lou, a beautiful,charming, bubbly girly girl who is a strong character but maybe a little too comfortable with her current life and then we have Will. Dashing Will! Sarcastic, funny, a little mean at first. They are world apart but through fate ( and Will disabilities) they met and slowly realize what one possessed, the other needs. Even if they never really knew it. As the movie progress, they falls for each other and we all fall for them. I loved Emily as Lou and Sam as Will. They played their roles perfectly and the chemistry between then was undeniable. I think everyone should go and watch this movie if you love romantic comedy. It is hilarious at times and yet sweet. I assure you that you'll feel every emotion out there with this movie. It's so beautiful. Go watch it and judge yourself. For me, this is an amazingly beautiful love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adorable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie really was adorable! I knew exactly what to expect since I read the book, but I loved the adaptation. What helps the movie most is that the novelist, Jojo Moyees, wrote her own screenplay. She did a great job transitioning the story from paper to screen. Little things that were left out of the novel weren't really needed to move the story along. Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Clafin were excellent. Her facial expressions were amazing and her insane eyebrows deserve some type of award all on their own. I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack as well.Don't listen to critics and go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a pretty cute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Felt very derivative of Intouchables I did however really enjoy the romance that was in this film.Emilia Clark has the most expressive face I have ever seen on camera.Watch her eyebrows! That's all I have to say. You could almost watch this entire movie just staring at her eyebrows? I had a hard time not doing that.I really enjoyed her character. She is a silly, eccentric, perpetually happy girl. With a pretty eclectic sense of style.Emilia Clarke was perfectly cast for this role.She ventures far from her intense power house character the Mother of Dragons from Game of Thrones.At times it was hard to tell if Emilia Clarke the actress is just extremely expressive with her face, or if it was something she was doing for the role? which I suppose speaks to how well she did.Because I'm thinking she was exaggerating it, therefore she played the part marvellously.The male lead is Sam Claflin, who you will more than likely recognize but not be able to place. His largest role as of late is the water proficient fighter from the Hunger Games.I also feel he played the part very well. No complaints, He has a great smile, or smirk, that he does through out, which allows us to empathize with him a little more when he seeming unlikable.There are a lot of light moments, actually the whole movie has a very light tone to it? it's a serious topic, but with Clarke's character it's hard for anything to be too serious or solemn. There are those sombre moments, which is, I'm sure, why I was given a tissue box at the advance screening.There were only a few editing aspects I didn't enjoy. There were far too many cuts in certain scenes? Emilia walking up to the mansion for the first time and her conversation on the bench with her boyfriend. They were distracting. This was sprinkled throughout the film to greater or lesser degrees.I think the film looked pretty, great locations. And a wonderful set, really. The house Claflin's character lives in looks very nice. I loved all the walls that opened when pushed on. Very modern, and expensive I'm sure.There is a little treat for any Harry Potter fans! Neville Longbottom, all grown up and looking fit, he plays the part of Emilia Clarke's boyfriend. I hope to see him in more roles, maybe even a lead one day.As for family friendliness, this movie is a G, it is good to go. In the opening scene Claflin is presumably being intimate with his girlfriend, they are obviously naked, but nothing is shown, they are under sheets.There is no cursing or obscenities in this movie worth mentioning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hokey, manipulative and overdone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. I like a weepy, romantic chick-flick as much as the next guy. But this one is so manipulative and over-the-top that I felt myself getting hostile about a third the way through. It took self-control not to make rude comments at the screen.Part of the problem is Emilia Clarke. He character is modeled after the Brigit Jones style of self-consciously, klutzy, heart on her sleeve heroine that holds appeal to many viewers. Clarke's acting is filled with so many facial tics it almost becomes unintentionally comic. If you shaved Ms. Clarke's eyebrows, she'd convey no emotional range. But with them, she'd be a natural silent movie actress. Her eyebrows literally stole every scene they were in.The music, especially the segments used between scenes goes beyond intrusive. It is downright offensive. If a character is about to die and is falling in love, do we really need an overwrought vocalist singing "Oh poor me, I'm falling in love, yet I'm about to die." This is like a Greek chorus with one eye on the AM playlist. I'm exaggerating here, but the point is real. We don't need treacly vocal music to mimic what we've just seen. Most of us got it the first time. You need a break between scenes? Instrumental segues would work just fine, thank you.I've given this a "2" out of 10. In every way this big budget film deserves a rock bottom "1" for its manipulative and overdone approach. I've given it the extra point for the lovely location shooting. At least the castles don't have eyebrows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't like sappy movies, but I really liked this sappy movie. Clarke wins again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emelia Clarke's work on Game of Thrones is the only reason I watched this movie in the first place. She is occasionally transcendent in that role, where she must keep her eyebrows restrained, and I wanted to see what would happen if her amazingly mobile brows were set free ... free as her dragons.There are a lot of solid things about this movie. The story (of a young woman who cares for a quadriplegic young man) is strong, the direction and cinematography good though not exceptional, the screen writing also good-not-exceptional, the supporting cast (especially Janet McTeer and Charles Dance)and leading man (Sam C.) quite good, and the emotional notes it hits, though all predictable and often a bit overwrought (cue swelling, heartwarming music...), ring true enough for an unabashed romance.So, not really my type of movie. But I am happy to say that I was (almost) completely taken by Clarke's performance. Her character here is nothing like her GoT role, but is in many ways an equally fantasy-based role (but with clumsy shyness and striped leggings instead of fireproof skin and dragons) -- and Clarke manages to pull this character out of romantic fantasy into believability as effectively as she brings to life her role as Mother of Dragons. She has the combination of charisma, physical beauty, character-acting chops, and inner luminosity to pull a fairly nice, 7-of-10 heartwarmer up to a 9-of-10 charmer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It stayed very true to the book and I love the book. I think Emilia Clarke was born to play her. I feel like she was just playing herself cause she has a personality like that in real life. It was pure joy to watch her play Lou. The expressions she makes, the way she talks and most of all, her amazing clothes! I loved every single outfit she wore. This film made me laugh and it made me very emotional, just like the book. I think Sam Claflin was also born to play Will. They had an amazing chemistry throughout the entire film and the rest of the cast is also spot on. There are of course some parts from the book that were left out but nonetheless, this film was still amazing. I also want to point out that the soundtrack of the movie is amazing as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Live Boldly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't consider myself the target audience for these romantic dramas. In fact, I'm usually turned off by the overabundance of forced clichés and unnecessary plot devices. While Me Before You definitely falls victim to some of those unfortunate young adult tropes, there's far more charm than harm here. The film stars Emilia Clarke (Lou) and Sam Claflin (Will) from Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games respectively. I've enjoyed both of their works in the past and they both make the most of the script that was given to them. Their budding charisma on screen is by far the highlight of the film. It's nice to see Clarke take on a lighter and more exuberant role than she has played in the past as it mirrors her off-screen personality as well. Clarke's likability as Lou is put a test as she has to deal with the stern and far less cheerful, Will, who became paralyzed after a motorcycle accident. If you didn't guess it already, yes they do grow to live with each other's quirks and inconveniences and maybe even share some affection for each other. It's pretty much the basis for all of these romantic novels adapted for film, but if you're film has enough likable qualities to it, the overused plot points and clichés can be forgiven.The main qualm for these characters are Will's questionable wishes about his future living as a quadriplegic and Lou's inability to fulfill her potential and aspirations due to her commitment as the breadwinner for her family. The way Lou effortlessly deals with these issues is what makes her so likable. It's also why you root for her and Will to become romantically involved as the film gives us compelling enough reasons to desire it. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with how the romance is depicted. Everything is earned and not forced.I think my only real complaints with the film involve its tendency to veer into clichéd territory. I'm not a fan of when romantic films play popular songs that tell you exactly how to feel as an audience member. Or when a certain character is written specifically to give us someone to dislike and is used a plot device more than anything else. On more than one occasion, Me Before You does that. But it's when the film attempts to take an original and realistic spin on the romance that the film really shines. It's because of the ladder that I think Me Before You is definitely worth a look.+Clarke's undeniable likability+Charm and chemistry with the Lou and Will dynamic+Romance is earned not forced-Popular songs tend to ruin the big moments-A few clichéd characters and plot devices7.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfortunate tail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never read the book so did not know the ending of this story (which I will not give away). I suggest however, that nobody watch this film without at least reading the synopsis so they know how it ends - it may change your mind about watching it in the first place or at least prepare you for one of the most tasteless endings in a film ever. The problem is that the movie is so sweet and monotoned that the depressing ending both assaults you and offends. It is not giving anything away to say that the male character is contemplating Dignatas' services. With no judgement whatsoever on this it is important to note that this is a compassionate organisation, but according to all media far from luxurious. The book may have dealt in detail with the realty of disability so deadly or degrading that the sufferer feels deeply they need release. However, this movie treats the illnesses associated with the male character's disability as intermittent blips in an otherwise improving quality of life. It leaves such a bitter taste in the mouth because the conclusion is that a valuable life must be expansive and in an able body! Being close to parents, loving unconditionally, life unexpected are failures. It is a shame as the performances are great - if the movie was a real romcom with a joyful ending or a serious drama with a tragic twist this story could have worked - unfortunately, it was neither; rather it was an amusing film that meandered off the side of a cliff with a thud...</fullReview>

Will has every thing going for him, a great job, a fantastic girlfriend and a rich family. His life changes in a fraction of a second. He becomes bitter and reclusive turning away his girlfriend until she leaves him for his best friend. Will is a wimp of unbelievable proportions. "Oh poor me, I'm rich, have two living and supportive parents, a job to return to and a girlfriend (Louisa) as hot as they come, who loves me unconditionally. I'm not the man I once was. My only option is to kill myself." Oh, give me a break. Who is the same person they use to be? This movie had an opportunity to have Will realize what he had to offer his family, friends and Louisa. Where was the creative people and writer on this one. I will close with one word, Stephen Hawking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>for the hanky-loving crowd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't enjoy a good cry in a dark movie theatre? The first feature film from director Thea Sharrock is taken directly from the tear-jerker novel by Jojo Meyes (who also wrote the screenplay). Although I try to avoid using the term very often, it's very much a by-the-numbers chick flick ? complete with the heart-of-gold working class girl trying her best to "save" the handsome rich guy to whom life has dealt a tough hand. For fans of the book and the genre, it should deliver the desired effect ? the studio even provided movie logo tissues for the screening.For most of us, the effectiveness of this type of movie comes down to the characters. Luisa is the effervescent working class girl hired as a personal assistant to the extremely wealthy quadriplegic Will Traynor. Emilia Clarke ("Game of Thrones") does everything in her power to make us (and Will Traynor) like Luisa. To describe her as optimistic is like saying Eric Clapton can play guitar. Calling her perky would be like saying Donald Trump has hair. Both statements are true, but hardly capture the totality of reality. In stark contrast, Sam Claflin (The Hunger Games: Mockingjay) purposefully underplays Will ? the one time cliff-diving, James Bond birthday video type now confined to a wheelchair.Lu is a constant toothy smile complemented by expressive and active eyebrows that somehow overshadow her chatty bedside manner, and kaleidoscopic and geometric clothes and shoes ? all encompassed with an ever-bouncy step that would make Tigger envious. Lu mostly shares the screen with Will and the personal nurse and therapist Nathan, played by Stephen Peacocke. The camera certainly loves all three of these faces, and director Sharrock wisely adds Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's parents. They bring a regal presence to what otherwise could have played a bit too cutesy.Despite the heavy dose of "awww", the story deserves credit for touching on the "right to die" or "dying with dignity" debate. While those closest to Will selfishly proclaim they don't understand his plan to head to Switzerland, it's Nathan who says it best ? 'who am I to judge'. While a full on discussion of the topic would be out of place here, the film does a nice job of not shying away from the process.Other recognizable faces in the cast include Jenna Coleman ("Doctor Who") as Lu's sister and confidante, and Matthew Lewis (Harry Potter series) as Lu's fitness freak boyfriend who isn't very understanding ? of either Lu or her job. There's also an odd but welcome wedding cameo from Joanna Lumley. My biggest issue with the story is that I just never understood how or when Lu fell so deeply in love with Will. Sure, I get the appeal of the castle, the concertos, and the tropical vacations, but where was the real personal connection? Was it simply that she thought she could charm Will into changing his mind on the big decision? That's not really love. Another piece that's difficult to take ? the numerous musical interludes seemingly designed to make sure viewers are in the proper state of melancholy. There was another segment that I found not just ironic, but actually annoying; however, discussion of the "Live boldly" advice would give away the film's ending ? something I'm not sure even matters since it's made pretty clear throughout, but it still goes against my movie code.</fullReview>

The 2 main characters have great chemistry and Emilia Clark is simply adorable .Its a simple story told well.The director of the film did a good job overall however there was 1 problem with this movie and that was the soundtrack they used . Except the 2 bits of classic music the rest of it was simply abysmal and it really hurt the movie . It gave that cheesy soapy feel of a telenovela episode.But getting past that i really enjoyed this movie more then i thought i would and i would recommend watching this . Have fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Emilia Clarke does not disappoint. The acting truly was brilliant. Both on her part and on Sam Claflins part. The film reminded me of The Untouchables a bit. It was a very pleasant sight to the eye to see the bond forming between Will and Lou. Decent amount of humor as well, found myself laughing quite often in fact. It is nice to sometimes be able to empathize with the characters as well. I can't really think of anything negative at this point either. Maybe that most of the movie was kind of predictable. The ending, however, might not have been as predictable. I didn't want to go to this movie myself, but was asked to see it. In hindsight I'm glad I tagged along, because I did really enjoy watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about 2 bad people that have a Fling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy a good romantic comedy or 'chick flick' that tells a tale of complicated people falling in love in even more complicated circumstances... when those people are actually decent people. That is not the case here. Lou is in a relationship with Patrick, a seemingly nice and decent guy. He's active, fun, appropriately funny, ambitious, sweet, and he truly cares for her. They've been together 7 years! Then she meets Will. Will is a complete asshole. No really... there is not 1 redeeming quality about him as a person. He's dull... he speaks in a completely monotone voice the entire movie... he's not funny, not even a little bit... he's insulting... he's selfish... he's suicidal... he does nothing to even attempt to make anyone elses life around him better. The only thing that this man has going for him is that he is RICH AND HANDSOME. He even admits that he would want nothing to do with her if he was still able to walk, and this doesn't phase her one bit. We're supposed to give him a pass on all of those things just because he's in a wheelchair? No... sorry... just no. She falls for this guy and you could say "oh, but he was sweet and he gave her compliments" but NO. She clearly falls for him well before that. Everything she falls for is superficial. She loves the adventure... she loves the money... she loves the feeling that she gets from taking care of him as it makes her feel needed. There is nothing about him as a person that she falls for! So she throws away 7 years with a great guy for a fling with a rich and handsome asshole. WOW! And this was the movie that somebody decided to make. WOW!!! This woman deserves to end up alone and the only redeeming quality about this movie is that she is alone in the end and I can at least imagine that this fling that she threw away everything for will torture her for the rest of her life as she tries to find another rich and handsome man that can fill Will's shoes, which in reality she never will. This movie is a tragedy, not a love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jojo made me cry ... again ... Loved it regardless!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on here so bear with me please. I actually don't view this as a romantic movie/story. For me this is a movie about life, choices and the influence we have on one another.I understand that the main topic in the story is sensitive and controversial to say at the least. I also get that some people will be offended by the outcome of the story. However, I do think that as much as those people are entitled to their own opinion (as am I and anyone else who has seen or read the story), so is everyone else in life in general, which proves the point that Will is entitled to his own opinion and choice in life.First let me start off with the fact that I read the book when it came out and it had a huge impact on me and the way I thought about the value of life. You see ... everyone has dreams, goals and to some extend expectations of the life we want to lead. When for some reason all of that is taken away from us, I can understand that it would be difficult for a person to find a positive way of viewing an impossibly negative adverse situation. I love (really love) the fact that there always will be people like Lou who find a way to make any negative into a positive and that they will do their utter best to spread their love of life and positive attitude(even if they're not aware they do it). I also love that Will, even though his mind is set to end his life, appreciates and respects the effort Lou is making to make him stay and appreciate the little things (or the big ones like her love for him) in life. What really got me thinking is that everyone would think that Will is selfish for wanting to take his own life. Generally speaking if someone takes the easy way out it would be viewed as a cowardly thing to do or a selfish act. However this is not really that simple, because Will is in a situation most of us will never be able to comprehend. Yes, there are definitely examples of people (Stephen Hawking) who have found a motivational way to live through such a tragedy, but not everyone is the same. Not everyone is able to move past their feelings, the physical discomfort and the limitations placed upon the person by such a situation. Come to think of it, isn't it selfish for everyone else to want Will to stay alive for them, while he is in pain and has no way to live the life he has always wanted to live? Isn't it just as bad to not respect someone's wishes when we can never know how it feels to be them?Generally I believe that the story had a positive outcome for everyone involved. Even though Will chose to let go of life, something positive remained. Something that will have Louisa pursue life in a different way than she had ever thought of before.Anyway ... I can go on and on about the different themes, motifs &amp; symbols in this story. It's rich and it certainly gave me plenty to think about. I hope that many people will get to fall in love with the story (just like I did), even though it's heavily loaded and most definitely hard to take in.Thanks for taking the time to read this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is one of the things wrong with the world today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you can tell I'm not a fan of this film just by my title and score. The movie itself is okay at best. Emilia Clarke does a well enough job with the role because the character she is playing is pretty much who she is in real life; in other words, this role didn't require Emilia acting much and that is a good thing because people are slowly figuring out that she has a very limited range when it comes to acting. Towards the end of the movie is when her limited acting range becomes apparent thanks to the crying scenes, most of the scenes she does with tearless crying which help to take you out of the movie. Don't get me wrong, her acting isn't bad until the end when she is forced to show another emotion other than bubbly. I should note the director does an excellent job of hiding a good amount of Emilia's emotional scenes by having her hug someone and then showing mostly the other person's face. I can write a whole book on Emilia's overrated acting chops but I'm not here to do that so let me carry on with this review. If it wasn't for the ending, where we finally learn the real message of the film I would have ranked the film about a 6 out of 10. But halfway into the film we learn the quadriplegic character made a deal with his parents that he will end his life after 6 months. During the film we learn this guy is smart and etc, etc. Someone even points out that he could go back to work if he wanted to but this guy is hell bent on killing himself for the simple reason of which happens to be that he misses his old life so he is giving up on this life. And apparently that is a good enough reason to let the man kill himself. Great message to put out there into the world. We recently lost Muhammad Ali. We all know about Muhammad Ali's condition and we all saw the impact he had on the world both before and in spite of his condition. He fought until the bitter end and became more of a legend because of it. This movie encourages people to take the easy way out. Now, I can understand how depression can play a role in all of this but this character is a pretty boy with a sh!t load of money.. and on top of that he found the love of his life and she is more than ready to be with him forever. But his reasoning is that he would only be a burden on her living her life. So yeah, this movie pretty much matches the materialistic and self- absorbed nature of what these modern times have transformed into. Whatever, the movie is a chick flick at best so I don't care. Apparently suicide isn't frowned upon when a quadriplegic is concerned. Moral of the story, you have nothing to contribute to society once you become paralyzed. Maybe this movie was funded by the government as a way of reducing the cost of people with disabilities on healthcare. Euthanasia for the win! Frankly, a disgusting message and an even more disgusting movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninspired &amp; Unoriginal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why critics are raving about Me Before You, but they clearly did not see the same film that the rest of us did, the one about a silly 20-something year-old girl who's hired by a rich couple to take care of their paraplegic son.This film suffers from the same ailments that many American biopics and romantic comedies do, namely a lack of originality and a dull, formulaic structure - regardless of whether or not it's an "adaptation of an award-winning novel." From the second the movie began, I predicted every single "emotional" beat in the film and when it would happen. Nothing caught me off guard or left me thinking, "Wow! I've never seen that before!" or "I never saw that coming!" This film is a testament to the concept of "Safe Filmmaking" which pervades our entertainment industry. The main character, Lou Clark, played by Emilia Clarke, has no admirable characteristics other than she wears unorthodox outfits and likes shoes. She outright admits it herself in the film: she lacks intelligence. I suppose one could argue that she's an immensely compassionate individual, but what motivates her compassion? There's no depth to her character - or any of the characters for that matter. Despite being financially unstable, Lou's sister and parents are happy as can be. She takes the job caring for the paraplegic, Will Traynor, played by Sam Claflin, to help keep her family afloat, but there's never any pressure that there family might be worse off if she didn't take the job. Nothing bad ever happens at all in the entire film, actually, except for at the end when Will tells Lou that they cannot be together, despite their love, and chooses to die. There's barely any conflict, Lou is never really put to the test, she never learns anything, she never overcomes any obstacles, the whole entire plot is a giant pile of emotions and obsessions (shoes for example) mushed together into a 110 minute pile of banal Oscar-bait. I'd like to mention that this film has seen the screen in a different form before. A form that was much more enjoyable to watch, because it didn't take itself as seriously. I'm referring to the 2011 French film, The Intouchables. Perhaps the filmmakers behind Me Before You should have taken a few ideas from Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's playbook.When all is said and done, I came out of the theater very sad. I gave it a shot, hoping with all my being that Me Before You would challenge me or catch me off-guard with some serious wit or humor (despite knowing it would not), but instead, it was just another, average romantic drama to be filed away with the rest. It did not impress anything upon me. I did not leave the theater wondering about all the symbolism and imagery in the film and what it could mean, because there was none. Even the production design was lazy and trite - a sad misfortune indeed.My advice to the Average Joe going to see this film: Go into the theater with zero expectations. Sit down with your popcorn and your significant other and prepare to shut off your brain like you do when you watch HGTV, sports, or sitcoms. You won't be carried away on a mystical, thought-provoking journey. No, not all. If that's the kind of experience you expect, you will be sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emilia Clarke's eyebrows make this movie unwatchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tired to watch this movie I really did. But I quickly realized that Emilia Clarke CAN'T ACT. And made the movie unwatchable.What I do with movies is skip through them a bit just to get a feel of what the movie is like. Too many movies I sit through about 10 mins and I feel like 'I wasted 10 min of my life I will never get back!' NEVER AGAIN! So I skip and within a few minutes can tell if I should even BOTHER watching the whole movie. I did this with this one and saw there was nothing worth watching. Just a pile of dung really.So basically, as most people can tell by the current state of cinema, that it's not really the movie that is important, it's what is behind the scenes. Like take the recent Suicide Squad. Hyped as all get out. And it turned out to be a dud. I have not seen it yet, but I am not shocked. The REASON that movie was made was to cash in on the popularity of superhero movies. Avengers, Justice League, Bat/Super/Spider man, etc.Now to the reason this movie was made: THIS movie is a VEHICLE to try and launch the career of these two actors. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Emilia Clarke is famous for the same reason Sasha Grey is, to put it lightly. Emilia Clarke appeared totally naked in the basically soft core p0rn TV show + gore that is "Game of Thrones". That is all really. The only reason she is in this movie is to make her look like a 'serious/real actress'. Nope, sorry girl, you are just a piece of meat, you wont fool me. And Sam Claflin, sorry, you can act, but you just can't carry a movie. You will ALWAYS be ONLY a SUPPORTING actor. Sorry. I thought we learned that lesson in the failure that was "Love, Rosie" (2014). Lily Collins ALSO can't carry a movie. WHY are we making the same mistake in THIS movie????It was painful watching Emilia Clarke try to break her type casting as the 'hot girl' playing a 'nerdy girl'. REALLY? Painful to watch just painful. She can't act, and the movie is just trash. The story as well. I mean it's like insult to injury. Imagine a sick old hobo just lost control over his bowels and bladder, in a dumpster where he was digging for food, and you throw a dead body on top, vomit, throw some dirty diapers in there, and top it all off with medical waste. That is a good way to describe this movie. From bad to worse. 1. Bad actress 2. No leading man 3. Bad plot 4. bad .......well you get the point.Good movies are just good movies, there should be no ulterior motives. Just make a movie. I don't even know what I fu(&amp;!ng expected from this movie it was so bad. A nice little rom com at least. Nope just a pile of tripe. STOP making movies for reasons other than making a good movie!(p.s. her eyebrows were Emma Watson level bad)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing I had in mind after watched this movie is that money can buy love. I'm not sure this one is made by Hollywood or not. Cos if it's made by Hollywood then I need questioning them how they can make this creepy movie like this. The story line was just so standard, it just remind me of soap opera from South America. the actors and actress just have bad performance the dialogue was so standard, no words that show the feeling of loss, hope or joy the only thing that good was just the soundtrack. It so wasting my time, I really don't understand how so many say that's a great movie. If I would have known it would end the way it did I would never of watched it.</fullReview>

Expect to feel warm and heartbroken at the same time in the movie. It's been says after watching it, I still cant stop thinking about this movie. You'd better watch it with someone who could provide a shoulder to cry on for you... :)) My favorite (which seems to be everyone's favorite as well) is during the wedding ceremony where Will seemed so alive again. My most heart-breaking scene is when Will said "will you be here?" on the last scene. That is when I burst into tears a lot. like A lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting the usual American love story, but that's not what this is. I have neither seen nor heard of these actors prior to seeing this film. That said, I usually don't go to see films like this.What a wonderful movie! The acting was so well done. My heart broke where it needed to break, and it laughed where it needed to laugh. For those who need help working on their empathy, or the opening of the mind, this is a very good movie to see!It's very thought provoking and I would even suggest to professors (philosophy,english,cultural perspectives in science, sociology) that they have their students write a paper on this. There are so many issues involved here. Great for discussion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have already read the book, so I decided to most definitely see the movie. I think that they did very well on a book to movie adaptation, because they didn't change too much from the book. The movie was beautifully made, and fit just what I and others who have read it in my city had pictured for the movie.The casting was brilliant, as with the portrayal of Louisa and Will. Both characters were charismatic, and enjoyable, and matched the dialogue of the book, which I thought was great.The movie itself was heartbreaking, hilarious at points, and just and lovable. The story itself is well thought out and great. One of the best things about this, is it is not just your usual love story. The real love doesn't take over the whole plot. It isn't fully made to feel intimate, but just to feel real.So I say: Go see it. If you are a boy or girl, it doesn't matter. This movie is memorable for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me Before You is an outstanding adaptation of Jojo Moyes' novel about Louisa taking care of the moody and pretentious Will Traynor. The book itself is very detailed and gives you all the specifics about their relationship and this is also seen throughout the movie. I had waited a long time after reading the book to find out that the movie is coming out featuring Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke. What more could be better than Finnick from the Hunger Games and Daenerys from Game of Thrones? Their chemistry for one another is astounding. Even though some may see this as a cliché movie where Louisa finds Will love and expresses it throughout the movie whilst adding a lot of humour, it's the ending of this movie which changes a lot of views and perspectives. For me especially, I found it very emotional as did many who watched it because you expect there to be a happy ending. Even though the ending was still very good, I feel as if the movie is very rushed and you'd expect there to be more. I feel like a whole lot from the book could have been added to give the audience more awareness as some things were confusing and you'd have to read the book to understand. Nevertheless, the movie was amazing and heartbreaking to say the least and I do think it is a special thing for everyone to watch.</fullReview>

To me she just seemed wet and a constant pushover. I wasn't a fan of her or her family. It bugged me how she couldn't just tell her boyfriend why she was doing all the things with Will she was doing.A lot of people say this is a feel good movie - to be honest I just finished watching and I feel kinda depressed by it - he wanted to die and nothing was changing his mind, that's it really.

		<shortDescription>Utterly blunt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, sure it is a sweet loving and touching story but I was totally surprised by Clarke's performance. I found her giving a lot of effort to be a sweet/innocent/naive little girl/woman. During the film, she never stops smiling (sometimes it gets really awkward), her relationship with that other guy is far away from any other 7year old relationship according to her choices and generally how she deals with it.Claflin is wandering from scene to scene and I truly found it difficult to feel his situation. He is also - oh yeah - smiling inexcusably throughout this film and I overall thing that this movie came to an end with a really immature way in a point that the film really underestimated any viewer's sense of logic.Just give it a try on a Sunday evening but in my opinion it's inevitable for you to attach yourselves with these characters, feel any sympathy or a feeling for cry. Just a blunt mediocre film. Pity for Clarke. I was expecting far more from her.</fullReview>

She has a very unusual fashion sense, yet she wants to study fashion. Fortunately, the guy, Will, is very amicable and likable.

		<shortDescription>It's time to live boldly with Will &amp; Louisa in this terrific feel-good love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really hard for me to not spoil the surprises of a movie like "Me Before You". For general moviegoers, they'll be expecting another love story about two people who fall in love until one of the characters has a dark secret that could tear them apart. For fans of the book, they will love the fact that it's incredibly faithful to the Jojo Moyes novel (See "The Fault in Our Stars", "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" and other true-to-the-book movies for details), but they will also get so much more out of it. I recently read the novel last month before the film came out and I found the book affectionate, funny and surprisingly uplifting. I think the key to any book-based movie is to find the right actors to have not only good chemistry, but to make sure that audiences will remember the characters in their hearts. Boy, have they lucked out with two immensely charming actors in this terrific film. "Me Before You" tells the story of Louisa "Lou" Clark (Emilia Clarke), a 26-year-old happy-go-lucky woman who has been trying to find the right job to support her working-class family. That is until she unexpectedly finds one by working as a caregiver to Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). Will was "The Man", that guy who had everything at the palm of his hands until an motorcycle accident left him an quadriplegic. Now he's sarcastic, bitter, moody and thinking of really dark thoughts. How did his heart turn to ice? Anyway, Lou refuses to be put off by a man who lost everything and gave his friends and everybody, as Lou calls it, "the (crappy) treatment". Suddenly, it starts off being an antagonistic relationship to a rather healthy one as Lou, with the help of her sister, Treena (Jenna Coleman), tries to help Will understand that life is definitely worth living for. And, yes, they do start to fall for one another, until Will has that secret that could end it all. I like the movie, but I do have a couple of minor problems: The first one is that the movie is not exactly as deep and sometimes dark as the book was. However, I give it points for letting the book and the movie asks the two questions: "Can you fall in love with a person but disagree on what their opinion of life is?" and "Can that same person change your life, even when it's least expected?" The second one is that first-time feature film director Thea Sharrock moves the film a little too fast without giving us a moment to understand Will's plight and Lou's cheerful earnestness while trying to get to the best parts of the story. But those problems did wash away with the help of Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Clarke, best known as the Mother of Dragons on "Game of Thrones", should've been a breakout movie star with that last Terminator movie. Here, that title suits Clarke well as the character of the quick-witted but sometimes vulnerable Lou. Claflin, in his first movie outside of "The Hunger Games" series, has the most challenging role, so far. But he is remarkable as the stubborn but sincere Will. Their chemistry together is amazing. The supporting cast is also good too, with Janet McTeer and Charles Dance (also from "Game of Thrones") as Will's parents who are constantly worried about him and his safety, Stephen Peacocke as Will's nurse, Nathan, Matthew Lewis (Hello, Neville Longbottom) as Lou's boyfriend who is completely uncomfortable about Lou's job, Brendan Coyle and Samantha Spiro as Lou's parents and there's also a really funny cameo from the "absolutely fabulous" Joanna Lumley. Credit must be given to Jojo Moyes, who adapted her terrific book to the screen (she also wrote the sequel book "After You") with some witty dialogue, tender emotion and sometimes dealing with real themes, although it's not as deep as the book. "Me Before You" is a simple story, sure. But while it probably won't be in my top 5 of the best love stories ever, I still found it to be in the same old tradition of tearjerkers, the one where you laugh, you cry and you'll come out feeling good. By the way, it's a lot better than "The Choice".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adapted by Jojo Moyes from her 2012 novel of the same name, 'Me Before You' is a moving love-story, that touches your heart. Its got its emotional moments, but its the film's lighthearted tone, that makes it work.'Me Before You' Synopsis: A girl (Emilia Clarke) in a small town forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man (Sam Claflin) she's taking care of.'Me Before You' is about living life &amp; how love, can actually make things better. Over here, our leading-man is paralyzed, but he finds some hope when our leading-lady offers some hope &amp; also love as their journey progresses. Even though the happiness doesn't change the leading-man's decision to eventually leave the world, he beautifully quotes to his love "live well &amp; consider your possibilities in life as luxuries". Now, isn't that beautiful &amp; so true. Jojo Moyes's nicely adapts from her own novel &amp; delivers a genuinely affecting tale about love &amp; loss. Thea Sharrock's Direction is restrained. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is decently done. Art &amp; Costume Design are fabulous. Craig Armstrong's Score is top-notch.Performance-Wise: Emilia Clarke &amp; Sam Claflin are the life &amp; soul of 'Me Before You'. Both deliver heartwarming performances. Sam makes you feel his pain &amp; how life has done him wrong, while Clarke steals the show as the innocent &amp; kind-hearted young girl. Their on-screen chemistry, also, is quite good. Janet McTeer &amp; Charles Dance are remarkable as Sam's parents. Matthew Lewis is superb as Clarke's dim-witted boyfriend. Steve Peacocke lends wonderful support as Sam's care-taker.On the whole, 'Me Before You' is definitely worth watching. It makes you smile as well as makes you cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Special But Sweet Nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging by the trailer for Me Before You, you already know the kind of ride you're in for. It's a tear-jerker about a quirky girl who takes up a job looking after a cynical paraplegic. It's not long before they fall in love with one another, despite their differences, and it either ends happily ever after or in tragedy.I won't reveal which of these endings are true, however I must say that despite the predictability of this film, there are certain themes in the movie that I wasn't expecting to delve into. Without exposing too much, the issue of euthanasia crops up and whilst it's a polarising topic, I think the film deals with it in a very fair and two-sided way. Both sides of the coin are justified and it's a very complex theme that doesn't have a simple answer.The acting is effortless and real between the two main characters. Lou Clark is played by GOT's mother of dragons Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin plays Will Traynor, who you might recognise from The Hunger Games franchise and Love, Rosie. The film is actually based on a New York Times bestseller by Jojo Moyes who also wrote the screenplay. I'm a big fan of novelists writing their own screenplay adaptations as I believe that no one knows their own story and vision like the person who wrote the original text.This isn't a film that you can expect big things from, but it tells a sweet story that's funny, sad and inspiring in some ways too with many a lesson to be learned.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A question that often goes around is "What is art?". And looking, throughout history, what was considered "art" it seems we are far away from the consensus on this question. But most people would agree around a general notion that art is something that makes you feel, that makes you think, that sparks a fire inside you, that transforms you. And this movie, in my humble opinion, does all of that, therefore deserving to be called "a piece of art". In the age of information overload where we usually forget what we had for lunch two days ago, this movie will stay with you for a long time after you leave the cinema.

		<shortDescription>Movie Vs. Book: Me Before You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A girl in a small town forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man she's taking care of. It's easy to be cold and cynical these days, but we should never lose sight of the simple, cathartic pleasure of a good cry at the movies. At first, I didn't want to review this novel ? nor the movie ? because I knew I would want to re-read it. Which might seem perverse if you know that for most of the last hundred pages I was dissolved in tears? Based on the best-selling 2012 novel by Jojo Moyes who also penned the screenplay. This story will feel familiar to anyone who sniffed through Love Story or The Fault in Our Stars. Surprisingly it's better than both. Me Before You is a love story, a family story and above all, it's a story of the bravery and sustained the effort needed to redirect the path of a life once it's been pushed off course. This is also a story that is eloquent not so much in its delivery as in its humanity. The set up is the same as many of classic (and non-classic) romance: a poor but cheerful young girl meets a rich, grumpy gentleman and begins working for him. But what makes Me Before You different and quite interesting in principle is that Will Traynor is physically broken as well as emotionally.You'll forgive the movie's clichés because of its surprisingly winning performances. As the film goes on and the frost between both protagonists melts, both actors give their stock roles unexpected emotional layers. On a basic level, it is engaging watching Lou enter this new world for which she is entirely unprepared. Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke stars as Louisa, she's like Love Actually-era Keira Knightley, crossed with a Hello Kitty doll. Clarke's sincerity doesn't just win Will's heart, it wins ours too. Will Traynor since he's played by Sam Claflin, whose Finnick Odair was one of the best things in the Hunger Games series, isn't just killer handsome or impossibly good- looking even if his condition has left him bitterly depressed and cuttingly sarcastic in a wheelchair. The actor is good as Will, working well with the physical demands of the role and even bringing a gentle flirtatiousness to his character, as he develops his relationship with Lou. In fact, his grin, with its slight touch of a smirk ? creates an unmistakable echo of a young Hugh Grant. Sam Claflin makes Will a broken man with a powerful life inside him. Plus, Will's character makes me think of Mr. Rochester in Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre; with his rudeness and temper. While Louisa is so Jane Eyre: "One of the invisible". Lou has never lived; Will has, but no longer can. You don't have to be Nicholas Sparks to know where this is heading ? that these two opposites will end up attracting, and that love, at least for a while, will prove stronger than death. Lou is not heroic and her male counterpart may be nobody's idea of a leading man or Prince Charming, and yet with both of them, Jojo Moyes created an affair I will always remember.Me Before You is a heartbreaker in the best sense. Employing emotional truth to bring the reader to tears. And yet, unlike other novels, tears are not gratuitous. Some situations, the author forces the reader to recognize, really are worth crying over. Furthermore, people can take an awful lot of sadness if you can be funny about it. Jojo Moyes is a literary stylist. Just a storyteller. And a really good one. She manages to draw on the skills she owned as a journalist to create a clear, candid picture of the practicalities of Will's situation. While the novelist's mind casts an illuminating light on her character's reactions. Moyes makes them coming together extremely tender, both sweet and real. But there's a deadline. One that haunts their love story haunts the novel. The author is masterful, in not shying from the complexities or shading the agony of choosing between life and death. It's achingly hard to read at moments and yet such a joy.Screenwriters choose to lose the "Maze" scene when Lou recalls a sexual assault when she was younger. Often when you read about rape in fiction, it's the defining event of a story. And cutting it from the movie, I think, was a good thing because the scene is very opaque in the book, and putting it on film would have given it far more weight than it has in the book. Plus, it would have eventually change the mood of the story. However the "Birthday Dinner" scene, at Louisa's home, hits a particularly high note, offering the most poignant moment both in the book and the movie ? its soul, really ? as well as a pitch-perfect hilarious one. Finally, my favorite part of both the film and the book is when Will and Lou go out on a "date" to a concert. She wears a dress of sexiest scarlet, and as they are in the car ready to go home, he confesses in a very Hugh Gratian manner: "I don't want to go in yet. I just want to be a man who's been to a concert with a girl in a red dress." I know a good British rom-com reference when I see one.Overall, Me Before You doesn't try to reinvent the genre. We've all seen some version of this movie before, but that doesn't make it any less effective. It knows what it is and embraces it. "Tell me something good," Will says to Louisa at two transformative junctures of the book. This story at its heart is about two people who properly listen to each other, it is something good. Now if you'll excuse me, I have something in my eye. It's allergies, I swear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning!!! The film deals with heavy themes that may contrast with your religious or personal views, or be personal triggers, such as: suicide, assisted suicide, emotional and physical disabilities, and the inability of coping with said disabilities. It's bound to rankle feathers.The film is charming, quirky, and depressing. It's definitely a film to watch with the girls, the beau was only mildly interested. Like many romances, Me Before You follows the basic formula, but hits the right notes to sucker punch you in the feels. Rich boy meets quirky/normal girl, girl attempts to "fix" boy, they fall in love. But there's a twist, girl can't "fix" the crippling pain and massive amounts of self-loathing boy experiences.Verdict: "Glass of wine, tissues, and a girl's night in" kind of movie, nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile, moving film with much more edge than it may first seem to have</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reasonably, this film (based on Jojo Moyes's book and screenplay) is indeed 'romantic drama' more than 'rom-com", which is not to deny its comedic elements. But all should know that there is a powerful, demanding current capturing this film, which draws in part on the case of disabled British rugby player Daniel James and the question of his parents being charged for accompanying him to Switzerland's Dignitas clinic (in the end they were not). In the (full) cinema I was in, there really were few dry eyes in the house. I'll concede that mine stayed dry (not always the case), though I still find the piece affecting and thought-provoking and unquestionably worth seeing.2 big questions concerned Emilia Clarke's chances of getting beyond (and above) Danaerys, and Sam Claflin's ability to portray someone who combines near-total physical disability with marked vulnerability to infection - the double whammy that convinces our hero that his life really and truly and literally is not worth living.To my mind, both questions can be answered affirmatively.Claflin's character Will Traynor is good-looking, rich and still influential. He has a commanding personality (if mostly initially grumpy and arrogant), a sharp mind and a capacity to develop Clarke's character Lou(isa) ... Clark (yes, really). That begs A LOT of questions (not sidestepped) about the contribution he can still make, not least because he has support (moral and financial) from loving and well-to-do parents - nicely done by Janet McTeer and Charles Dance. And of course not least because he makes Lou Clark love him, even though she at first has a relationshp with Patrick (played by Matthew Lewis), which is not getting very far, but is genuine, affectionate and definitely physical, if also sustained by Clark's decency and supportive nature. Patrick is by no means a failure (he's been Entrepreneur of the Year). He's a bit dull, but not stupid or unkind, and of course he's a triathlon-type athlete. Yet he can't quite offer Lou what Traynor can (a huge and demanding thought in itself).And Emilia Clarke does indeed offer a convincing and often-touching portrayal of that growing love (as mirrored in her character's personal development in terms of interests and style and maturity - though emphatically not basic kindness, decency, humility and optimism with life, given that this is manifest from the outset and never wavers).This is actually then a demanding role. So much emphasis is placed on Clark's eccentric dress sense that one might start to write her off as a bit oafish. But that does not pan out. Clark is (over-?) loyal to her family, helping out financially, and so taking jobs below her potential. But she does what she does with conviction and optimism, puts all her heart and soul into each of her jobs, and she does know who she is. Hence her metamorphosis in the film adds new dimensions, but not at the expense of the old ones.Emilia Clarke is great at all this, and she proves well able to portray inner beauty increasingly augmented by outward beauty in the more conventional sense; and when Clark looks at - and touches - her nearly immobile charge, an audience-member not made of stone is going to feel the power of the affection, and also the restraint associated with the inevitable non-physicality and asymmetry of the bond.At at least one point in the film a comparison with Stephen Hawking is made, and this is not an idle one. There are also references to "My Left Foot" and that film's real-life Irish hero Christy Brown. Hawking steadily lost abilities, yet espoused technology to fight back and contribute. He wanted to understand the universe, and he has lived longer than anyone else ever with his disease. Christy Brown taught himself to do great and wonderful things with the limb he could still control (hence the title of the story). At first glance, Traynor has fewer aces than Brown (whose story in fact ended unhappily with his death aged 49 in 1981), though more than Hawking (whose amazing story continues). Yet Traynor wants out and is committed to that idea with a devotedness that even Clark's love cannot shift.In spite of the chocolate-box pretty Pembrokeshire, Buckinghamshire and Mediterranean locations, this is not forgettable movie-candy. One does indeed return to the subject. And the person I saw it with came back at me a while after with the suggestion that Traynor and Clark could have married, had a kid (not necessarily even adopted?), and been worthwhile and useful and good parents making a contribution to the next generation, all the more so given further years of support from his parents and also her family (portrayed sympathetically enough by the familiar Brendan Coyle, Samantha Spiro and Jenna Coleman). And while that would have involved sacrifice and risk (given Traynor's endless susceptibility to disease that would presumably have done for him soon enough), it would have left a legacy.There's really no answer to that, given that Traynor chooses to eschew such options; and - as the film emphasises again and again - that's his sovereign decision in regard to his life. One gets the feeling that Clark's mother would not accept that choice, but the other characters come round to the idea - with great reluctance, but nevertheless.This is then a modern and radical film in a pretty and often traditional setting, but - as the above, nuanced references in it make clear - it is not judge and jury, at least not 100%. That role therefore falls to us, and this is as always a precious thing a (better) film can offer its audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet, sorrowful film, beautifully presented; some viewers will not feel comfortable with the ethical issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the South of Britain, near Wales, a young businessman, Will (Sam Claflin) has just kissed his girlfriend goodbye on a rainy morning. He tries to hail a taxi but, unhappily, he is struck by a motorcycle. Meanwhile, Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) has been a waitress in a nearby café for six years, where she proved to be a friendly asset. Unexpectedly, she is given a pink slip and a month's wages. At home, the Clarks hear this news with dismay, for Papa Clark has been laid off and Lou's salary has been supporting them all. Undaunted, the fetching, zany-dressed young gal goes to the job center for new leads. There's one promising one. It seems a mother, Camilla (Janet McTeer) is searching for a nurse's aide to help her paralyzed son. Yes, its Will, from the movie's beginning, who is now confined to a wheelchair with little motion below his neck. Will's family, the Trainers, are the richest folk in the area and live in a modified castle. In short order, Louisa gets the position, for she is chatty and gregarious, despite her lack of nursing experience. But, wait, Will greets his new caretaker with undisguised rudeness, asking her to "not talk" to him and stay out of his way as much as possible. A roving nurse, Nathan, though, tells Louisa he is delighted she is there and assures her that Will is rude because his situation is so bleak. In time, things change. Will does become more communicative and is cheered by Lou's weird clothes and infectious manner. When his former girlfriend comes to break the news that she is engaged to a man who was once W's best friend, Louisa is there to help Will from falling to pieces. In fact, Lou and the nurse decide to put forth a list of outings which will, hopefully, change his view toward life. This involves going to the horse races and a symphony concert. Indeed, Will does seem cheerier. But, oh no, Lou overhears Will state he agreed to give himself six months of living for his mother's sake, at which end he hopes to go a euthanasia clinic in Switzerland. Can this really be, when Lou has started to love Will and he seems to being feeling the same way about her? This sweet, sorrowful movie will have its viewers in waterfalls of tears. Yes, there are moments of humor and fun, but, the tale is always a story of a wheelchair bound man, formerly very active. who struggles to accept his new reality. The cast is great, with Claflin, Clarke, McTeer, Charles Dance, and all of the others doing fine work. Mr. Claflin, who also appeared in Love, Rosie, will hopefully not be confined to roles in love stories, although his handsome face is swoon worthy. Then, the setting is superb, a lovely glimpse at a little known part of Britain. Louisa's costumes are "sublimely ridiculous" amid a well clad cast and the script, from a novel by JoJo Moyes, is carefully, poignantly written. Finally, the direction is somewhat slow, at times, but hits all the right marks for its presentation. As stated above, some viewers will not like the film's stance on euthanasia, as it strongly supports personal choice. Therefore, listen to this caution. However, most viewers, especially fans of romantic drama, will welcome the opportunity for a sweet, sad cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a great film. Funny, Sad. Can't wait for the Blu-ray Release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw the trailer and knew I really wanted to see the film, but kept putting it off as I was worried the trailer had shown all the best bits and the movie would be disappointing...but was I wrong! The movie was funny in some parts, serious in others as well as sad in other parts. Emilia Clarke is hilarious in this movie and I absolutely love the character's dress sense, in which Will Traynor likes to mock. Sam Claflin plays the part amazingly which reduces you to tears by the end of the movie. Clarke and Claflin's on-screen relationship is one of the best things about the movie, in some parts it makes you laugh, others cry and a lot of the time you have a smile on your face when they're together. The movie overall was so much better than I thought I and cannot wait for the release on Blu-ray, I will definitely be buying it! I don't understand all the negative reviews, this film was absolutely brilliant. It was so good, that when I heard there was a book, I instantly bought the eBook and I've started reading it. Do not listen to the negative reviews and do not hesitate to see this movie, go and watch it while it's still in the cinemas or if you're reading this after the DVD release, go purchase the film and give it a watch, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when I found this trailer months back I fell in love with it straight away, I love how everything in the film fell in to place Louisa is a funny and loving girl that just wants to have make people smile care about everyone. will is your typical man, love to travel and is bloody hot! after will having a accident his mum decides to hire Louisa after losing her job and had some bad times in other jobs. after his accident will become very cold and angry at the world for making him how he is now. but Louisa comes along and changes him VERY slowly! Louisa finds some information out and wants to make will excited about life again and so then she plans lots of different trips and days out for him finally get out of his house. The film goes on and this is when your tissue become handy, the 2 fall in love and Louisa doesn't know what to do because months back she found out that will promised his parents 6 months and then wanted to end his life to end the pain. the film really shows that if you meet the right person time doesn't matter and sex really mean anything to a relationship if you love that person so much. Louisa thought by doing all the trips and days out she would change his mind but she didn't however he said he would go on one last trip and really have the time with her the last couple of weeks.the film goes on and gets even more emotional when Louisa gets really upset on there last trip because will wont change his mind and after they land she leave straight away. she finally take will decision and goes to see will at the clinic in Switzerland and spends his last couple hours together with his parents. the film ends with Louisa in Paris where will told her that this was his favourite place in the world with will over the top reading the letter he wrote for her....I really do love this film and shows so much that I didn't know about how life is in will shoes and how people that have the same struggles live. the actors were perfect for the film and played the characters so so well! I would totally say to anyone to see this film but take your tissue because you'll need them!!!</fullReview>

People are saying that he should not have done it, but i think it was is choice, and everyone should respect it, but however he should have give it a harder try. In conclusion is a great great movie, well casted and beautiful environments too. I cant possibly imagine what people whom are disabled go trough. Sam gives a solid performance as a disabled person, in the begging is a smart-ass but then he becomes really cool, which means that Sam is a good actor, and Emilia is great with that goofy look on her face and always chating and smiling,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>23 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Me Before You. When quirky Lou Clark loses her job in a tea shop she is left desperate to get a new one to help support her family. Along comes the Traynor family. Will Traynor, a quadriplegic needs a carer although he doesn't think he wants one, at this point Lou comes into his world and turns it upside down. Will is set on ending his life, Lou discovers this and embarks on a scheme to make him change his mind. Adapted from a book (which I haven't read yet) we are introduced to two very different kinds of people, Will who yearns for the old life he lost and sees every day as an empty glass, and Lou who's bubbly personality and infectious smile lead her glass to not only be full, but positively overflowing. This is a story of hardship, and of hope and also introduces us to the ethical and very personal struggles of people not only considering assisted suicide but also the family and friends who have no say in the matter but want very much to get involved. It was a very emotional journey, there were many light hearted moments and a very fitting soundtrack. One more point, I noticed I the credits that the producers assistant was Peregrine Kitchener-Fellowes, son of Downton Abbey Writer, Julian Fellows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I were very impressed at the beginning of this movie, and through the middle. We grew a bit uncomfortable when the young girl finds out the fellow in the wheelchair has decided to kill himself (through assisted suicide). At the end of the movie we both felt very let down. Not only did she not succeed in changing his mind, she actually becomes happy about it as if life is only lived for moments when you can really experience something.Sad, sad, commentary on life, and very narrow minded. First, I know a couple people who have been injured and confined to wheelchair, quadriplegic or otherwise. They took the time to adjust, and one has been that way for near 40 years and has a wonderful life. He did not quit or give up on life, just because his life before the accident was so "Tremendous" or whatever it was the wimpy dude said in this movie.If you want to make a movie about someone with redemption or about overcoming adversity, then you had best not have the person quit at the end, like a whiny cry-baby and try to convince everyone out there that "The world is better off without me because I hate my life now, but loved it before..." That's a cop out, totally and completely. It's not an ad for assisted suicide, it's just a dramatic interpretation of a dude who gave up, and let everyone down.We gave it 8/10 for acting. But, the overall movie is a 2 since the premise and the interpretation are so wrong. So, it gets a total score of 4/10 compromise from us.</fullReview>

Yes, 10/10 is very presumptuous of me and may be a slight exaggeration, but personally I loved every second of the movie and was anxiously dying to watch it all over again the second it ended! This movie makes you think in different ways and to think in their shoes, which I LOVE. I also might love this so much because I can relate due to my brother having a born disease where he cannot walk. When people see this film, some of Will's ways of thinking are very unorthodox to some and viewers may think the character is crazy, but understanding the life that handicapped people live, I thought it was perfectly executed. This film was a fantastic movie! The location, the actors, the music scorer, etc. It all blew me away and I loved it!!!!! 10/10 would recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice little 3 hanky tear jerker with a very abominable message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the director of a movie has stirred an emotion in a viewer does that make it a good movie? I think 'yes' because the viewer has been touched within and the story connected with that person, on some level. Unfortunately for Director: Thea Sharrock and Writer: Jojo Moyes the emotional connection for this viewer (me) was negative and borderline angry. But the movie is a good 6 or 7 stars worth to me because I found it well scripted, acted and photographed.The plot is so British class oriented I was gritting my teeth. We have Will Traynor an upper crust society rich boy who is able to afford any indulgence he so desires. He lives in a mansion and owns an ancestral castle. Has had top line education and was a multi-talented sportsman and is exceptionally handsome. Mr upper crust Will is arrogant, self centered, and oh so superior. Then there is Lou Clark a working class former shop girl living in a small bungalow with her family. Her father is currently unemployed and cannot find a job. The family depends on Lou's income to make ends meet. She looses her shop job and applies as a companion aide to the now disabled (quadriplegic) Will Traynor. His mother is so charmed by Miss shop girl Lou's cheerful and quirky attitude she hires her. So there's the first problem - a working class person having to survive by being 'in service' to an upper society family. What a good little Brit she is! And of course the Traynor's feel it's their duty to provide for the lower classes so they hire Lou's father as a 'castle facility technician' - read 'grounds keeper for the castle'! Then there is the ever available Nathan who supplies the muscle to move Will from bed to chair and back, plus keep account of Will's borderline health. It's never explained how Nathan is always - on call! Can't keep the 'superiors of society' waiting!The title "Me Before You" is also an issue with this viewer! We are never given a definition of this title. Which of the two main characters is 'Me' and which is 'You'! Think about it ... as the relationship between Will &amp; Lou warms up the easy answer is Will as the 'Me' because of his death wish and to hell with the now close emotional bond between Will &amp; Lou. (by-the-way if Will so wanted to die why didn't he give in to his lung infection when hospitalized? It surely would have easily killed a quadriplegic)On the other hand it's not too difficult to take Lou as the 'Me' because she has dedicated her efforts to 'change Will' and bring him out of his self imposed reclusiveness and bitterness toward life. Lou is determined to make him change his mind on being euthanized. So there's the conflict - neither one actually respects the emotional bond &amp; love that has developed between them. Will hates his physical existence and wants death as a release. Lou can only focus on how happy she is being with him. Both are not thinking about how the other one feels.My other problem with this story is very simple to grasp. Will has everything a person could want and the intelligence to create a new life for himself but chooses death because he cannot live as he did before his disability. The producers of this story are implying a disabled person is less of a human due to a disability, is permanently unhappy, and not capable of contributing to society thus death is their best option! If Will was fine physically but emotionally depressed and wanted to be euthanized would the viewing public be as enthusiastic about this movie? Definitely not!The subconscious messages in this story are shameful but go completely unnoticed because they are wrapped up and hidden in a sweet &amp; tearful tragic love story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me before you stars Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin and its the story of a woman (Emilia Clarke) and her story of how she falls in love with a man that cannot move either his legs and his arms. Emilia Clarke is amazing as her character, she completely became her character. I cannot think of another actress that will portray her character, well Daisy Ridley can because Emilia Clarke's performance did remained me of her. Sam Claflin was serviceable, he can easily be replaced. The story is really what drives this movie to the top. The relationship between Lou and Will is great, you really believe that they are in love. The music is used appropriately, only one time it annoyed me but it was once and it did not take me out of the film. The cinematography was great as well as the production design. The biggest problem i have with this film its is 3 act. It is really cheesy and makes the cliché that one person gets mad with one another, and you know they're gonna get back together and its just lazy writing. Its not awful but it ain't good either. Also since Emilia Clarke is so fantastic as her character, its really distracting when she is not in a scene, and you kind off get lost in the story. Other than that, I found that Me Before You was a great film about love, relationships and letting go. Beautiful visuals and an unique script made this film the best love story of 2016 (so far). 8/10</fullReview>

Then Louisa find out truth that he is only going to live certain period of time and then decided to take his life out. She keeps trying and loves him even more despite all that but his foolishness and selfishness is beyond every limit. We are humans and we tend to life no matter how hard it will be there so no human with right mind to kill himself because he can't do something and doesn't feel valuable anymore. And that is just unacceptable and probably all people need to agree with this and see that there is a problem with taking your own life. Only thing that will happen you will bring pain to other people. Twisted and disturbed thinking of individual like Will should not be accepted as right. Despite all that ending was somehow peaceful with mixed feeling that were tending to happiness. 6.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bawled My Eyes Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Me Before You consists of a very sensitive subject and for that, has received a lot of criticism. Putting my own views aside, this film is so charming and touching - really, one of the most moving films I have ever watched (can't remember one as emotional as this). Lou, the main girl, is Daenaryus (spelling?) from Game of Thrones and her role couldn't be more opposite but I'm glad that it is - she is a total nerd, quirky yet witty and lovable all at the same time. *Spoiler* One of my favorite scenes was when she opened her birthday gift from Will and was absolutely shaking with excitement at the bumble bee tights he gave her. Her reaction was seriously heartwarming and hilarious and not to mention the beautiful smile it gave Will was enjoyable.Will, the main guy, is so believable - from his depressed, bitter and sarcastic attitude in the beginning to the inspiring and witty man he becomes after meeting Lou. He doesn't smile often due to his unfortunate circumstances but when he does, boy, it lights up an entire room honestly. Love that guy!I bawled my eyes out in the end, almost sobbing uncontrollably it was so moving. This film has stayed with me long after I'd first seen it and will continue to long after I move on. I only discovered it last week and have watched it three times already. Of course, this is my favorite genre and so it's very appealing to me. I also just got my eyelash extensions done and have had to be very careful in how much I cry. Lovers of the romantic/comedy drama will not be disappointed and will absolutely fall in love with this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought I'd watch a movie and laugh and cry at the same time. I don't know how the actors were selected but I must say the combination is a miracle. I wish I knew Emilia Clarke (Lou) personality to figure out the gap between the real her and the character she played in this movie. After watching this movie, I became so emotional. I felt love and loved. I watched it alone and wish I did with my girlfriend. Although the ending got me nervous, it was cool. I couldn't think of something better. Big thumbs up for the whole Me Before You crew. You guys did it. I wasn't a big fan of love stories but now, that's where I'm heading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that Emilia Clarke is a way underestimated actress!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a guy, and by definition I will act as one, meaning: no movies about complicated love ever... But if you have to watch one, watch this one (that's what I did and I don't regret it for a single second).Why? I'll tell you why: Emilia Clarke's portrayal of "Clark" is amazing; she's sweet, caring and above all: she makes you feel peaceful. Her role as Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones prepared me to anything but not to this. You laugh with her, cry with her and most importantly: live with her. Her eccentric dresses, her smile and especially her eyebrows radiate so much sincerity that it makes my heart ache with happiness. Pace by pace, step by step, you follow her difficult journey through her life as the caretaker of a young, rancorous, disabled young man who just wants to stop living. She's able to give him a taste of what life good be and what good it still could bring. This movie moved me with tears, but the good kind; the kind that leaves you wanting more of those movies, the kind that takes your breath away,, the kind that will make me watch all of the next Emila Clarke's movies.I sincerely hope you'll enjoy this movie as much as I did, because it was magical and unique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not my first choice for cinema type of movie, but it was end of the month and had to spend last movie club ticket or losing it. I went out shocked about casting because I was used to see him as Finnick and she was something like -I've seen her before but not sure where..., won't tell you exactly because she has a great looked change after her previous work, specially her colorful role in this movie. The story itself, it's well a known one, with some modern notes that brings it close to our reality and I meant it because her boyfriend style of man, any similarity with someone you know it's on purpose, how she reacts to that leaves room for discussion undoubtedly. The sister paper is key to her decision making process, kind of a fairy role. Landscape and situations spots are a must have for the story as usual requirement of a love comedy, also completely covered the steps of such an illness and character reactions to it, technology is also a fundamental key on this part. I proudly say, I almost cried at some point, despite I knew I would and resisted to, and that's exactly why I recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was totally ready to get into this story and enjoy it. I'm afraid this movie is terrible.The first thing is Emilia Clarke which did a terrible terrible acting job. She always had the same smirk on her face in any situation, sad, happy, annoyed. The director did a terrible job of directing her.I also did not buy for a single second their supposed love story. The third act is not working at all. You don't understand her motivations, her feelings and it just didn't work. You don't understand why she does the things she does. Actually the movie progressed in a way for the first 3/4 of the movie that I could not see them fall in love in anyway. And it was not clear if she fell in love and if yes why etc etc..Very disappointing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the movie first, then read the novel and watched the movie again as I was about to finish reading the novel. I really love the author, Jojo Moyes. I love her writings and it is a great combination of humor, romance and life lessons. There are many scenes that would just make me burst into laughter. I love the casts! Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke is a wonderful match. They look so great in this film. I think one important part in the novel that shouldn't be left out in the movie is when Lou decided to move in with Patrick. I think that's quite a big point where we could see Will wasn't able to hide his feelings anymore. I think it can build more tensions b/w the characters. And the tattoo part probably should be in the film as well. It's really adorable. Anyway, really enjoy the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not much for romance, but so many people complained they didn't like the ending and Emilia seemed charming enough to watch. Yes, it suffers a few clichés, but i enjoyed it. You might say the pain was downplayed but we saw the story from Lous perspective and not Wills. And as someone who has recently struggled with severe depression I connected to it. I connected to that strange feeling of enjoying some of your time, laughing, enjoying a person you love and at the same time feel horrible. I saw my boyfriends reactions and pain in Clarkes reactions to his pain. I felt this movie. On the other hand, Sams performance was a revelation. I vaguely remember him from The Hunger Games, found him very boring and bland in it. But here, he shined. I believed him in his blank stares, happiness, pain. Not many actors pull that off for me. And of course Emilia's and Sam's relationship is great, they worked wonderfully together.It has problems of typical romance films, but the story that looms behind it, and pops out is very strong, and well done. We are taken off into the charming romp com world only to be snapped back to the reality of his disability and pain he is in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** MAJOR SPOILERS *** I thought the acting was great. I adore Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. My objection is it seemed to me to be promoting the assisted suicide movement. I am strongly opposed to that way of thinking. People have the right to make movies about it, I just didn't agree with it.I was hoping for an uplifting message of true, lasting love overcoming all of life's possible challenges. This had the potential to be full of inspiration. I loved the relationships with family and other characters and how their lives unfolded.I hope to never have to be a part of anything remotely near to Will's situation. I am vehemently against taking ones own life. God brought us into this world and we must rely and depend on him in all situations to the very end. If Will had faith in his heart, the outcome would have been different and he and Louisa could have led a live filled with love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film is a work of art. An author's expression, the director's creativity, the performer's charisma and the captivating music can embrace a person and touch some of those primal feelings, hidden deep within vaults in our heart. At its base is a very simple story requiring some astounding performances to make it come to life. The film focuses on the feelings of innocence, simplicity, commitment, loyalty and love. How true are you with the people around you? Will you stick around at a trying time of another's life? The film makes you dwell on the unpredictability of life.

		<fullReview>Me Before You They're called wheelchair ramps but you rarely see people doing jumps off them.Hopefully, the paralyzed person in this romance gives it ago after their melancholy.Years after a road accident left him wheelchair-bound, ex-financier Will (Sam Claflin) continues to suffer from depression over the loss of his former lifestyle.Lou (Emilia Clarke) is an unemployed waitress who agrees to become the primary caregiver to the posh playboy.Although her pep and his self-pity don't mix, when she learns of his suicide pact, she plans to dissuade him by showing him the beauty of life with or without mobility.While the leads have enough chemistry to pull of the love/hate angle of this adaptation of the British bestseller, it comes off as craven and insensitive when faced with the touchy issue of euthanasia. Nonetheless, it's still hard to tell if someone's dating a handicapped person just for the parking privileges. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well..It was a very cute and pretty movie..and need not to mention amazing performances by actors But since i have already seen a 2010 Bollywood movie Guzaarish (www.imdb.com/title/tt1438298/),,the Me Before You didn't appeal to me that much.. Since both movies have a quadriplegic lead and a caretaker , a hospital appointed nurse in case of guzaarish ..both asking for euthanasia..and budding romance between them.. they are almost similar.. But guzaarish is very beautifully shot and romance actually feels very real and other character are also well established and there is no way u won't cry 3 or 4 during this movie.. so after watching Guzaarish it wasn't a very money worthy experience for me since i kept on comparing both movies and me before u wasn't better even though it has 6 more years of advancement in filmmaking..</fullReview>

We all know where it should go, but in other hands we have to realize it might not get handled in the same manner. So many other similar films just do not come off with the level of care this one does. It's only 110 minutes long but plays longer, but none of it seems forced or protracted.

		<fullReview>I went for an unplanned movie in the cinema's yesterday and chose Me Before You because the trailer looked good and I wanted to see Emilia Clarke star a whole different role at least once. Since everyone, including me, knows her from the Game of Thrones series on TV, playing a real war-chick, it's hard to imagine her playing something so delicate. In the first 30 minutes of the movie, I already saw this was going to be great. Emilia can show so many emotions in her face without even trying, which makes it clear why they chose her. The way she lived Lou in the movie was just amazing, real and definitely sincere.This is a must-see movie, not only today, but tomorrow, next year and in 10 years as well.Rating : 10/10 for sure!</fullReview>

Some people say bad things about Emilia Clarke and her acting, but yet again, unsurprisingly she was perfect. Through my heightened sense of empathy, I could imagine how a paralysed man would feel, and Sam Clafin performed the role to perfection. For a soppy romance movie, this was great. 8/10, it's missing two for the silly reason that it is a romance film, I rated The Flash a 10, so rating this 10 would go against my core values. In conclusion, even is this movie is not something you'd usually watch because of its genre, I'd give it a chance anyway, because...Emilia Clarke, even in her dorky dresses was absolutely sublime, and it's worth watching just because of her, well, it was my reason anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big expectations waited of the best-selling book adaptation of Jojo Moyes on the big screen, attributing it the label of dramatic film of the date, after the emotional "The Fault in Our Stars" broke hearts around the world; surely, you will require a box of tissues, nevertheless, the film does not provoke enough tears for utilize more than one. The romantic film goes through a fatiguing period, tired of the renowned "clichés" of the genre; implausible is find feature romance films like the stories written by the talented Nicholas Sparks - " The Choice ", his last invention does not achieved good receptions -, apparently, this film genre will be condemned to the adaptations or reboots of Hollywood, nevertheless, occasionally, small underutilized gems come to light.Emilia Clarke - Yes, the blonde girl of "Game of Thrones" and Sarah Connor of the massacred "Terminator Genisys" last year - plays Louisa "Lou" Clark, a eccentric young lady, who lives with her working- class parents. Lou loses her job in the coffee shop of the village, which puts her in a delicate matter, lack of money. Her only employment opportunity is to be caretaker of a 30-year-old man suffering paralysis of the shoulders down - owing to a motorcycle accident -, that handsome man with sense of black humor, sarcastic attitude, million euro in his bank account, hardened heart, and possessor of a perfect smile is Will Traynor (Sam Claflin has acuity to make to cry ( remember to Finnick Odair of "The Hunger games"). With a black and white striped coat, dresses with butterflies and vegetables, psychedelic heels and other strangenesses of the fashion, Lou invades in the life of Will to superficially transform his thoughts, thoughts decided to practice his assisted suicide at a clinic in Switzerland. Striking, cloying and sentimental plot, dispenser of laughs, tears and doctrines do not focused."Me Before You" does not get away of the habitual absurdities of a romance novel, perfect for lovers of the genre, but tedious and repetitive for the general public. Despite the exhausted use of romantic elements, Moyes, Neustadter and Weber know to place and represent every triviality harmoniously, the first kiss, Clark shaving to Will, a powerful storm behind the female lead role and even avoid some recurrences to innovate with own circumstances and phrases (Bumblebee Tights). Repeatedly, we have seen impossible loves owing the difference of social classes, and although the difference of status is present, the film is focused in another type of differences. The script fulfills the demands of any woman in love with chocolate and popcorn, nevertheless, objectively, it violates the real context with impossibilities and events of tales of fairy, hiding the suffering with the beauty, the reality with pink unicorns e hippopotamus, and until certain point is refreshing and requested for the genre, nevertheless, it is its sensitive subject in the ending, which be really affected by the strategy , and therefore, it affects the film in general.Thea Sharrock - writer and film and English theater director - follows the story of the book to the letter, neglecting necessary and original ideas. Who do you wish to listen to Ed Sheeran, while you are on the verge of tears? Pop music atmosphere is profound and even memorable (Not Today by Imagine Dragons), unfortunately, these are located in incorrect times, destabilising the balance and the process of the scene. Furthermore of its youthful soundtrack, the performances hold firm progress of the story, Clarke does not exaggerate her character, and if she does, it has satisfactory effects and thanks to her beautiful and infectious laughter, development gets a decent progress. Caflin is a bit more discreet and without Clarke as Lou, it would have been a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, it is the swift development of a controversial issue which absorbs the negative criticisms. In the plot, Will is decided to die with dignity, (Spoiler: and he did it), the film portrays the life of disabled people as "different" and in certain part it is, nevertheless, the lightness with that they deal the ending is as necessary as negative. Necessary, because they do not turn to the romantic drama of the path towards death, but negative, because they insinuates that the days of a disabled person are useless and the best solution is suicide. "Me Before You" has the function of telling a love story, the film did not want to meddle in dangerous waters, but, unfortunately, it did it."Me Before You" benefits from the chemistry of its protagonists, the idealized environments and some lines worthy of Spark, but the futility of euthanasia in the film, destroys the built and paves the way for finding some errors more. With the quality of the romance films of today, "Me Before You" is a tempting and sentimental proposal, full of corny-romanticism, teaching rewarding lessons as go on, live each moment and question the unexpected turnaround of life.</fullReview>

The movie has one ending but I try to find out another one by watching it many times. I think Im so stupid. I think you will buy the book when watching it or something crazy that you will search for the bumblebee tights.Clark,A few weeks will have passed by the time you read this (even given your newfound organizational skills, I doubt you will have made it to Paris before early September). I hope the coffee is good and strong and the croissants fresh and that the weather is still sunny enough to sit outside on one of those metallic chairs that never sit quite level on the pavement. It's not bad, the Marquis. The steak is also good, if you fancy coming back for lunch. And if you look down the road to your left you will hopefully see L'Artisan Parfumeur where, after you read this, you should go and try the scent called something like Papillons Extr?me (can't quite remember). I always did think it would smell great on you.Okay, instructions over. There are a few things I wanted to say and would have told you in person, but a) you would have got all emotional and b) you wouldn't have let me say all this out loud. You always did talk too much.So here it is: the cheque you got in the initial envelope from Michael Lawler was not the full amount, but just a small gift, to help you through your first weeks of unemployment, and to get you to Paris.When you get back to England, take this letter to Michael in his London office and he will give you the relevant documents so you can access an account he has set up for me in your name. This account contains enough for you to buy somewhere nice to live and to pay for your degree course and your living expenses while you are in full- time education.My parents will have been told all about it. I hope that this, and Michael Lawler's legal work, will ensure there is as little fuss as possible.Clark, I can practically hear you starting to hyperventilate from here. Don't start panicking, or trying to give it away ? it's not enough for you to sit on your arse for the rest of your life. But it should buy you your freedom, both from that claustrophobic little town we both call home, and from the kind of choices you have so far felt you had to make.I'm not giving the money to you because I want you to feel wistful, or indebted to me, or to feel that it's some kind of bloody memorial.I'm giving you this because there is not much that makes me happy any more, but you do.I am conscious that knowing me has caused you pain, and grief, and I hope that one day when you are less angry with me and less upset you will see not just that I could only have done the thing that I did, but also that this will help you live a really good life, a better life, than if you hadn't met me.You're going to feel uncomfortable in your new world for a bit. It always does feel strange to be knocked out of your comfort zone. But I hope you feel a bit exhilarated too. Your face when you came back from diving that time told me everything; there is a hunger in you, Clark. A fearlessness. You just buried it, like most people do.I'm not really telling you to jump off tall buildings, or swim with whales or anything (although I would secretly love to think you were), but to live boldly. Push yourself. Don't settle. Wear those stripy legs with pride. And if you insist on settling down with some ridiculous bloke, make sure some of this is squirrelled away somewhere. Knowing you still have possibilities is a luxury. Knowing I might have given them to you has alleviated something for me.So this is it. You are scored on my heart, Clark. You were from the first day you walked in, with your ridiculous clothes and your bad jokes and your complete inability to ever hide a single thing you felt. You changed my life so much more than this money will ever change yours.Don't think of me too often. I don't want to think of you getting all maudlin. Just live well.Justlive.Love,Will</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Overrated' is an understatement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to the average of more than forty thousand people on IMDb this movie got the rating 7.6? And for what? First, it's pathetic and that's not a quality. It plays cheap on peoples' emotions and that's not an artistic value or any value at all. I'm not the kind of person that likes only those movies which are artistic or make you think, I don't mind amusing cheap movies sometimes as well - but what is amusing about this one? To me, this movie is like a perverted twist (but not in a good way) on Hollywood-style fairy tales and that's nothing new for the movie industry - making you feel good on the account of an unworthy but good spirited girl who in need of good money becomes a cheer-up doll for a prince in the castle who lived through tragedy, trying to give him reasons to live while being payed for it (because - why shouldn't that make him feel good about himself to be in a situation that parents have to buy him female companionship). And since the ending can not be too sad and 'god forbid' any different from all the rest of the Hollywood soapies at least someone has to have a gain at the end of the movie. Since it was too unrealistic for the writer himself that the guy in such a bad state of the body could still have a good spirit driving him forward to survive he still had to make at least somebody happy at the ending and so we get a princess out of the ashes. Congratulations on keeping your stereotypes up to date, successful and popular in the modern world, Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry, there are a lot of bad choices made about this movie which makes me regret the decision to watch it.The story is pretty straightforward - a guessable romantic stereotype created by undeveloped characters.The action is moving in an unpredictable manner, jumping from one stage of development to five stages later in a matter of seconds.On top of that, the awful pop music between the scenes affects unpleasantly my mood and makes the experience even worse.I'm voting with 4 stars only because of the acting, which is the only good thing about this movie. I will leave the work of the director without a comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real and fairy tale at the same time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of these movies that you find yourself trying to constantly remember that this is just a movie and that this is not happening in real life. Although this story is revolving around the serious injury of a person, it's really "light" in the beginning and it actually gets more than some laughs out of you. And I think that when everything climaxes towards the end, this is the reason why you feel even sadder. Clarke was awesome as was her co-protagonist. All the cast was brilliant if you ask me. The questions set forth by the movie and the morals that are "promoted" are irrelevant if you ask me. OK, it's always about living your life etc in movies like that. Doing things while you still can, not wasting time etc. But the thing that stuck with me in the end, is the feeling of this otherwise energetic young man, when he wakes every single day, having dreamed his life as it was before, just to realize that he's still in his bed, not able to walk, or take care of himself. I think that for me, that was the punch in the stomach. And with all this going on, to fall in love with a girl that embodies life itself, in such a unique way. His attitude and how he held together till the end, was the most touching part of the movie for me. The movie was brilliant. If you do decide to watch it, make sure that you're not in a really bad mood cause if you are, I can promise that it will really get you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was successful in making me cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie tells a classic love story of a town girl falling in love with a paralyzed rich boy. The girl is like a ray of sunshine penetrating the boy's cave, bringing him hope and laughters and joy. But instead of miraculously coming back to health and marrying the girl, the boy chose to end his life and inherit a fortune to the girl so she can go to college.I disagree with the religious talks such as"fragile people don't get to make their own choices." or "artificial death is no better than murder". Everybody is fit to make their own choices, especially people with high intelligence and iron determination, like Will. To decide someone else's life or death is the worst kind of arrogance, forced life with give Will endless pain and desperate torture that is enough to drive him crazy. Steven knows that, and Camilla understands that despite the struggle. If not for Lou, Will's life will serenely and naturally ends like a ripen apple falling to the ground. Lou is the alien factor that is added to an originally balanced equation.Lou has potential, but her mind is simple and straight and pure and beautiful. "Because I like him, I will try to save him. It breaks my heart to think that Will have to die." After the seed is plant, she arduously plans all the trips, trying everything she can to cheer him up, insulting the restaurant waitress for him, ordering an hotel with him, falling in love with him, and even running home like a seventh-grade when she finds out that she can't save him. She reserves nothing, Lou packs up all her guts and livers and heart in a box and presents to him, but nothing will change the fact that Will is doomed. It is absolutely heartbreaking to watch Lou going through the process of finding out Will's death cannot be changed by any of her efforts. But the hardness makes this a spectacular movie.Lou comes to life thanks to Emilie Clarke, and all the dramas in her eyebrows. Nobody can play Lou better than the Mother of Dragons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie but romance isn't well portrayed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't read the book before watching the film. I was glad that I didn't read it beforehand but now I'm eager to read the original novel, too. While watching the movie, I was thrilled and fascinated at the same time. Emilia Clarke as Lou Clark, makes the movie wonderful with her outstanding acting. All the eyebrow mimics she uses aren't too much but fit perfectly with her character. I am of the opinion that her role in this movie is precious and far better than her role in GOT. The clothes are carefully picked for Lou and her lovely, cheerful style. The landscape of the Wales, Switzerland, France is well pictured. Apart from the excellent visuals, I enjoyed the flow of the movie. Some people don't get the fact that in a movie not everybody has to act really well whether it is a side character or a man walking in the street. Acting, overall, was okay. One thing I didn't like about the movie is it was supposed to be a romantic comedy. Although there are some scenes that got to me, the all-too-sudden love isn't really convincing. The romance is fairly weak and sometimes awkward. Nevertheless, this movie made me smile and cry, it is very well entertaining yet emotional. However, the ending was a bit obscure. There is a second book called "Me After You" so I'll be waiting for the second movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film doesn't do justice to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to read Me Before You as soon as I watched the first trailer of the film pop up on my news feed. I was excited. Boy, never had I been so eager to finish this book. It was simply marvelous. However, I can't say that the film made me feel the same way. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin did a great job, don't get me wrong! They fit the characters perfectly and shared wonderful chemistry. Unfortunately, I thought they sugar coated some scenes way too much with light jokes and puns and in my opinion they took away so much of the tense drama build-up the book provided. It was more like a sweet romantic comedy with a twist of drama in the end rather than a straight-up romance, like the book. Please excuse the overload of metaphors that are to follow but they're important as I make my point. They invested so much in keeping it light-hearted and sweet, while keeping the worst part to the end. But the book doesn't work that way. The story is hauntingly real.&nbsp;It's a masterpiece but&nbsp;the film is far from a replica. It made me wonder how Harry Potter fans felt watching the movie distort the books and now I know how it's quite gut wrenching.&nbsp;I shed tears of course during the movie but the book broke my heart.&nbsp;It's devastating.&nbsp;It's an emotion that drowns you and makes you believe there's no way to safety.&nbsp;It takes you momentarily to sweet cotton candy like clouds.&nbsp;Just to break out in lightning and thunder and rain on your heart all over again.&nbsp;It's bittersweet. Yet life changing. The book gave me a certain purpose if you will...&nbsp;It made me FEEL.&nbsp;It brought out a type of sadness I had never even known to exist.&nbsp;To feel completely lost and miserable and confused and flabbergasted and simply torn apart. It ruined me in a good way I suppose.&nbsp;And I can't believe someone (author Jojo Moyes) could have that much power over thousands of women who read the book. The book is and forever will be the winner, any time of the day. Do yourself a favor, read the book beforehand. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the love story, where's the drama?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before commenting on this movie I would like to comment on IMDb. Anyone noticed how the majority of the reviews in the first pages are written like paid professionals praising all the aspects of the movie? It almost look like you have to start reading from the ending page of reviews to get a real review. I will be very curious to see if this review will even see the light of day and if not then I will never trust or even come to IMDb for movie reviews.As for the movie... I had great expectations after seeing the trailer but was such a disappointment. First... there is no love story in this movie. The whole movie is about a rich paraplegic man who is so immersed in self pity about loosing his "tremendous" past life that is incapable of any emotions for the people around him. OK... and a girl who gets attached to him... but settles for some money reward for her broken heart. The movie is predictable, pathetic, has no real drama or message. The actors have potential but are not believable due to the lack of a true love story in the script. What a missed opportunity, I could close my eyes and imagine how this movie could have been written to be one of the best, a real dramatic struggle between love and physical pain, rich and poor, life and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great adaptation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me Before You is a fantastic romantic comedy which also includes a quite substantial amount of drama. The plot starts off with Will (Sam Claflin) going to his everyday job only to get hit by a motorbike leaving him paralyzed. The story then cuts to Louisa(Emilia Clarke) who just lost her job that she'd had for years at a cafe and then goes on to look for more jobs. She gets a job as a care giver for a disabled man which happens to be Will. The first couple of weeks Lou has a tense relationship with will to soon find out that Will is giving his parents 6 months more till he kills himself. Lou doesn't want to sit around and watch Will die so her sister comes up with an idea to show how good his life can be by going places and doing things. Will agrees to do the activities with Louisa with their relationship quickly getting better. The acting in this film is phenomenal from Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin with some supporting actors/actress' doing a fantastic job as-well just not to the extent of our leads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fall Hard For Emilia Clarke &amp; Sam Claflin's Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When taking a beloved book from page to screen, it's tough to recreate the magic on screen. Well, the movie version of 'Me Before You' is the perfect adaptation of Jojo Moyes' book. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin simply are Lou Clark and Will Traynor.Me Before You is going to be your new favorite romantic movie. The movie will make your laugh, cry and smile from start to finish, thanks to Jojo Moyes' lovely book and Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin's stellar performances.Me Before You is the film adaptation of Jojo Moyes' 2012 novel. Lou Clark (Emilia) becomes a caregiver for Will Traynor (Sam). Will was once action man, who sought out adventure each and every day. However, he was paralyzed from the chest down after a shocking motorcycle accident.Lou's job is essentially just to cheer him up. Lou is bright and shiny, while Will is brooding and dark. Despite a rough start, Will's hardness begins to fade away with Lou's help. Together, Lou and Will discover new adventures and experience life in a way they never thought possible.Lou falls hard for Will, and she believes she can make Will happy. Will, who will never accept his new limitations, thinks he's keeping Lou from living her best life. But that's not how Lou sees it.I'm just telling you now, the ending of Me Before You will make you ugly-cry. Lou and Will's star-crossed love story will break your heart in half. I didn't think it was possible to love Lou and Will more, but Emilia and Sam did it. When Emilia smiles, you smile. When she cries, you cry.Emilia and Sam gave their heart and soul to the roles of Lou and Will. Emilia's Lou is nothing like Daenerys Targaryen, and the role shows a new side of Emilia's incredible acting skills. Sam embraces Will's physical constraints and adds even more layers than were present in Jojo's book.Their chemistry is electric, and it's bound by something more than just sexual tension. Because of their marvelous performances, Emilia and Sam elevate the emotional complexities of their characters even more on screen. Me Before You works on every single level. Even if you haven't read the book, you'll inevitably fall in love with this movie. And you should. It's that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly Manipulative, But Tears are Earned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be hard to hold back the tears, once 'Me Before You' moves along the emotionally-charged course of its unevenly laid-out entirety. Imbued with charismatic flair and some ravishing sentiments, the Emilia Clarke and Sam Clafflin starrer, is every hopeless romantic dream. It is bound to recreate the familiar 'heaven and earth' trope, with all its utter predictabilities and tiring cheesy clichés, but here, the tears are mostly rightfully earned.Clarke's Lou, emerges as the brightest asset of this manipulative drama, her buoyant demeanor creates an affectionate atmosphere for this whole fairytale-ish attempt whose often leaning towards emotional tragedy is ever screaming at every turn of the proceedings. Her sprightly charm makes an indispensible compensation for the largely stale performance pulled by Clafflin who plays here, a quadriplegic near real-life prince, who enlisted the service of Clarke's caregiver character. But together they conjure magic, enough to sprinkle their often predictable storyline with heart-crippling charm.The biggest flaw of this film, perhaps, is how it seemed written to manipulate. That is not to say it isn't effective, because in fact it often works, but you would still think, and wonder, how more beautiful it would have become, had it been written with pure authenticity. Be that as it may, you've got to give it to those at its helm for molding an extremely poignant drama, that even if its often undermined by its easily recognizable motives, isn't devoid of wit, humor, and charm, and jaw-dropping glamor from two of the most beautiful faces to ever star in such romantic tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed 'Me Before You' much more than I had anticipated. I was originally interested upon its trailer release (and I mean, it is easy to sell me when you attach an Ed Sheeran song to the trailer, but that is besides the point.), but now that I have actually seen the film, I am more satisfied in the result of my viewing than expected and also very interested in reading the book series. To start, Sam and Emilia were excellent. I see a very strong transition from TV to film through Emilia Clarke. Especially going from playing a role like Daenerys from 'Game of Thrones' and even the strong personality role of Sarah Connor in 'Terminator Genisys' to the sort of ditsy, sarcastic, soft, and kind role of Lou Clark. Her character had me honestly laughing in multiple scenes as she had hilariously awkward interactions with some other characters on top of her constant sarcasm. Sam Claflin was nothing short of hilarious as well. His equally sarcastic character of Will Traynor was frequently sparking laughs among the crowd as well as his relentless strong personality that transitioned from his able-bodied self to his handicapped self. On a different note, the chemistry between the two worked very well. Nothing ever felt forced, in my opinion. Everything was smooth and easy-going. It was very entertaining to follow and the story as whole was something elegant yet heart- rending all the same. For a romantic-drama, I enjoyed this film very much so. I recommend this for all audiences as it is much more than the typical romantic feel-good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night myself and my mom decided to go to the cinemas to see the new movie Me Before You. Me Before You is a novel turned movie starring Emillia Clarke and Sam Claffin and tells the tale of a young man named Will Trainer(Claffin)who has it all. His got a nice flat and a nice girlfriend,until one rainy afternoon his life would change forever as he ends up being paralyzed from the neck down and is confined in a wheelchair thanks to being hit with a motorbike. We later cut to a young woman named Lou Clark(Emillia Clarke)who is living with her parents and her sister and has an athletic boyfriend named Patrick(played by Matthew Lewis from Harry Potter fame). She's working in a coffee shop only to be told from her boss that its not working for him to keep her on in his coffee shop. So with no money to help her get through her life she goes to a job centre where she is looking for a job. Turns out this well off couple wants help with their son(who happens to be Will of course)and Lou decides to take up the position as a Career for Will.And from here on in you can pretty much expect what is going to happen. The two don't get along,they later start to become friendly with one another,and of course they fall in love. But will he get help with being confined to a wheelchair or will he decide to end his life ?Also starring Brax himself former Home &amp; Away star Steven Peacocke as Nathan(the assistant nurse that helps Lou with Will and a brief cameo from Joanna Lumely,this touching romantic drama will leave you either laughing and crying or both. For mom and myself we both found this film very good. The acting is very good I liked the guy that played the young man Will he reminded me of James Marsden for some strange odd reason and him and Emilla Clarke had great chemistry. The music was very good and as for the ending, well I won't give away too much on the ending but I knew that it was going to happen about the 2nd half into this flick and trust me you will want Kleenex tissues after it. Overall I loved this movie and I was glad that I dragged my mom(who also wanted to go and see this with me last night as well).My rating is a 9/10 and I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.BVery good flick It actually reminded me of a cross between The Fault In Our Stars(one of my all time favourite movies ever)and that Julia Roberts flick Dying Young.

		<fullReview>I'm guilty, again, of not reading the book of which this film is based on, written by Jojo Moyes; so I can't compare or discuss irregularities or about the comparison of the adaptation, but I can say Jojo did write the screenplay so we can be rest assured it's how the source author should have wanted it on the big screen.&nbsp;There's not much about Director Thea Sharrock apart from a couple of TV series and this being her first main feature. She does a great job, really capturing the moment and atmosphere of a very British backdrop; the picturesque Pembroke Castle in Wales being very much the central location.&nbsp;Sam Claflin famed for playing Hunger Games' flamboyant, charismatic Finnick, plays the larger- than-life, suave business man Will Traynor, who, after a brief motorcycle accident, unfortunately becomes a quadriplegic confided to his parents mansion in the Welsh countryside. Faced with a completely different way of life we see the frustrations and the bitterness that takes hold of him.&nbsp;In walks in Lou Clark, a colourful, cheerful and sweet local lady played by Emilia Clarke who's down on her luck and becomes unemployed, looking for her next vocation. With little else out there she reluctantly accepts employment from Will's parents, played by Janet McTeer and fellow Game Of Thrones Star, Charles Dance, as carer for Will whose sole duty is to cheer-up the depressed and angry Mister Traynor.&nbsp;She's met with hostility in the form of blunt sarcasm and general unwantedness but slowly and surely a relationship forms between the two and it's only her perseverance and pretty positivity that managed to eventually break down Will's stubbornness and get him out the house.&nbsp;Harry Potter's Neville Longbottom, Matthew Lewis has come a long way and does good playing Clark's current fitness freak boyfriend and Hench-Hugh Grant look-a-like Stephen Peacocke is great support as Will's manual handler and I suppose friend.&nbsp;Craig Armstrong does a good score as he usually does, (Love Actually, World Trade Center, Far From The Madding Crowd) but it's the soundtrack that is quite outstanding with a mellow remix of X Ambassadors' 'Unsteady' and tracks from Cloves, Ed Sheeran and Jack Garrett.&nbsp;It's a great Britrom/com with all the same ingredients, sitting next to hits like Love Actually and About Time, but it isn't the tear-jerker I was expecting. Though hearing a lot of sniffles in the audience it didn't quite hit me as hard. There's some great scenes, it's superbly structured and well paced, it's touching but not quite the emotional train-wreck I thought it was going to be even with the controversial ending, which seems to gloss over the debate. I'm not faulting the film because it's probably most likely me.&nbsp;Now the big controversial debate as this film has caused quite a stir within certain groups and I can understand why, but it's not about 'a people', nor does it represent 'a people'&nbsp;but be about a relationship between&nbsp;two people and nothing else and I think it boldly tackles real life issues without damning or belittling anyone's life, disabled or not. Regardless of circumstance we all face life's hurdles with different approaches and attitudes, and to reflect badly on this is to assume all people never face such thoughts of suicide&nbsp;which, with current&nbsp;statistics I find very hard to believe and euthanasia would not even be a word. I'm not saying if it is right or wrong, just acknowledging the fact it does exist and is real, and is a thought that haunts many people regardless of circumstance.&nbsp;Running Time:&nbsp;9 The Cast:&nbsp;9 Performance:&nbsp;9 Direction:&nbsp;9 Story:&nbsp;7 Script:&nbsp;7 Creativity:&nbsp;8 Soundtrack:&nbsp;9 Job Description:&nbsp;5 The Extra Bonus Point: 10, Emilia Clarke is simply amazing. Beautiful and funny, she's such a joy to watch on scene, her smile and glossy eyes just gleam wonderment and excitement.. I've said too much.82% 8/10</fullReview>

I've watched this movie 2 times in the cinema first time with my friend, second time with my family and they all loved it. Not a single dry eye out from the cinema I swear. It's so touching, funny and all in all it was awesome and the best movie I've seen in 2016, no, best movie in terms of romance, touching-ness after The Fault In Our Stars. Seriously, this movie reached the deepest place in my heart.The cast, the sceneries and also the storyline just blew my mind. There are beyond words on how great the performance of Sam and Emilia was, really. If you haven't watched it, I strongly recommend you bring your love ones (and also a box of tissues) to the cinema and watch it, it won't disappoint I swear!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cringeworthy Movie Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film without any premise of what the book was about. However, I did watch it with someone who had read the book and was able to compare and contrast the two mediums. Though the scenic locations and setting for the movie is iconic, this movie was so unbearable to watch based on the relationships alone.Firstly, the whole movie pays so little attention to exactly how bad Lou's boyfriend is, that any sane person would take his side. Therefore, the entire film is about cheating, half-truths and seduction rather than romance. Lou's shallow character archetype of the "quirky" girl in bright tights serves only to reinforce the idea that she is naive and selfish. After being in a relationship for 6 years with her bf, - who at this point trusts Lou's support in his fitness dreams - Lou suddenly drops it all for a hidden love affair with a "broken" heart throb. The birthday scene alone was so unbelievable that she would pay so much attention to this mysterious man rather than her boyfriend across the table that it left me wandering how come no one warned her about what she was doing. Oh yes, her sister talked to her about it...but suggested arranging lap dances for her patient instead?! Doesn't her sister know she is already attached to her boyfriend Patrick? What lousy advice there!No more than 20 minutes into the movie, every romantic scene turned into a scene of betrayal and hidden intentions. The book may have gone into more detail regarding exactly how much of a douche Lou's boyfriend Patrick really was, but this movie glazed over it so superficially that I ended up feeling sorry for the poor guy. He did not even lose his temper or have a big dramatic scene. His character was just swept under the rug for the conclusion of the movie to happen.Horrible movie, unless you are a romantic sap who condones betraying those who care about you, or you are easily impressed with Emilia Clarke's go-to scrunched up 'sad' face and dancing eyebrows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic drama. Nothing less, nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was not bad, but nor was it anything new. It was by the numbers, with a script that could just as well have been written in the 60s (and at times it felt so)The biggest stars of the film are, of course, Emilia Clarke's eyebrows. I dare anyone to give me any other reason why they chose to see the movie. Either it was Khaleesi or maybe Dr. Who's companion that drew you to watch it. It certainly weren't the 5 seconds of screen time that Charles Dance had and it wasn't the age old story of the poor girl that falls in love with the quadriplegic prince.While the film ends on a bitter sweet note, I didn't find it terribly entertaining, while the characters had an infantile morality that made me unable to relate to any of them. Absolutely average in every respect, except of course Clarke's eyebrows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's sappy, and forgettable. So much so, that I watched this movie about 10 days ago, and I am having a really really really hard time figuring out what the movie was about. That tells you how memorable it is (not). Me Before you is the story of a girl in a small town that forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man she's taking care of. He is dreadful to deal with in the beginning, but the girl needs a salary and the guy is really well off. So she sticks it out, and surprisingly enough, the man opens up little by little to her. Soon they find themselves behaving as if they were inseparable. I again have to admit, I remember little more about it, so I give it a 5 due to indecisiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I 'd like to say that I like these movies. I really do. All the heart-breaking love stories and the obstacles the heroes have to overcome... But this one didn't live up to any of my expectations. So miserable and manipulative, it got on my nerves at some point. I could predict every emotional moment before it was even implied. and when these moments did came, I was like ''are you kidding me now? Come on!!'' all the time. It shouldn't have been this way. But let's take the things from the start..As our main characters are introduced , you expect to learn a few things about them, about their past, their story.. I mean they are not teenagers, they are grown-ups and surely they have a background. The film makes a descent effort about showing us the pre-accident life of Will Traynor but not enough for sure. I mean give it five more minutes, you show us he has a girlfriend and he gets out in the rain and boom. Poor! As far as Lou Clark is concerned, we literally don't know anything about her. I admit it, at first I even thought Matthew Lewis was a best friend or something. Those who have read the book know that Lou has a strong past, definitely worth mentioned in order to understand all the reasons that kept her in this town caring for her family and not leaving to chase her dreams in Manchester.I have some serious questions. Firstly, how can the parents of a paraplegic-man trust so easily the care of their son to a random waitress girl? Secondly, why is the life of disabled people presented so miserable? Thirdly, you want to make a romantic movie, so why did you not???? You have everything you need, beautiful characters, descent actors, overwhelming story, so why destroy it with this miserable approach. The point in life is not taking the easy way and commit suicide because this is exactly what we see. A young 30-something year old disabled beautiful man who finds a nice girl , they fall in love and he starts having some light in all his dark but he prefers to die because nothing seems to satisfy this ''boy'' anymore. OK I get that his life and his care are very demanding but this is just not a right message for the viewers. When the whole romance thing starts to lighten up, is it my idea or does it seem so one-sided? Lou is trying so hard to make him happy, to help him in every way she can but Will does nothing at all. I mean, he wants to put an end to his hard life but look in front of you, this woman actually changed your freaking life. I don't mean to alternate the end of the film as it is based on a novel but give him some joy. She really wants to show him the bright side of all this but is seems like he doesn't want that, like he doesn't even care. So where's the romance? Because personally I don't find it romantic at all. This film is trying so much to make us feel sorry about Will and the euthanasia thing but in the end I only felt sorry for Lou.We see two or three affection moments where our characters kiss but why didn't they make love? Lou is the one who states in the film that he can do it, so show us. This would really help with the intimacy thing that is obviously a problem between our characters. Will is presented so selfish and self-centered, spoiled like a 13 year old boy. A pair of bumble bee tights is cute indeed but not enough. Even in the end that Lou reads the letter, it's like he has written it to a dear friend that was by his side at difficult times. Come on Will, you don't even say you loved her (isn't that what we all expect from these kind of movies?). He doesn't give her a reason to feel that nothing she did was in vain. Money? Was money what she really needed? Seriously? Pathetic at least.Finally, I think the choice of protagonists was okay, could have been better, especially for Clarke as it really seemed she had zero chemistry with Clafflin. She's not a good actor cause as you can notice all her acting skills are moving her eyebrows, I believe it was a heavy plot and she was a little out of depth. Sam Clafflin's acting was more than satisfying. I was very disappointed... Very pretentious, don't waste your time and your money. I could have said more but most of it is already pointed in other viewers' reviews. I give it a 3 to 10. At least it was wonderfully located. All the credits to the castles and L'Artisan Parfumerie. Next please.</fullReview>

Two people who shouldn't have met, and who didn't like each other much when they did, but who found they were the only two people in the world who could possibly have understood each other. And I told him of the adventures they had, the places they had gone, and the things I had seen that I had never expected to. I conjured for him electric skies and iridescent seas and evenings full of laughter and silly jokes. I drew a world for him, a world far from a Swiss industrial estate, a world in which he was still somehow the person he had wanted to be. I drew the world he had created for me, full of wonder and possibility."</fullReview>

A cameraman should be review himself how he destroyed that film by his stupid records, like while we need to see how characters feel each other, and th&#x1b0; viewer only can see their back. Acting by Emilia is not good enough, I can't feel the hurt that she should have. Voice of main male character should be more improved, it sucks all moments of love...

		<shortDescription>Great movie worth watching and finding life lessons within</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that made me cry almost at the beginning when the protagonists have met. The girl is so kind that it makes me think of an angel. But there is nothing wrong with it since a movie is supposed to teach us the way we should be and what we dream of instead of who we really are... The movies and art in general teach us the best of who we were meant to be in the first place. It is a sad movie if we take it from the perspective we are used to look at life. But, if we are able to get beyond all the "happy ever after" and understand that life is just a passage in the most truthful way it is supposed to be seen we understand that the very concept of the movie is showing us the best we can do with our lives. Everything is meant to last just for a while and we should do the best with what we have... That's all life is about. If there is something after it it's just an unexpected prize or incentive. But then let's do the best with what we have now! Tomorrow's another day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional ride taking a serious subject a little too lightly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Went to the movies recently and saw Me Before You, the film based on the novel with the same name by the author Jojo Moyes. It is about the eccentric girl Louisa Clark who lives in an English village with her working class family. After getting fired from the small café she works in, she desperately accepts employment as a caretaker of the paralyzed young man Will Traynor. He is a wealthy ex business man who got paralyzed when he got hit by a motorcycle. Will is bitter and unpleasant towards everything and everyone around him. Me Before You is directed by the relatively unknown Thea Sharrock and this is her first feature film. Emilia Clarke, known from Game of Thrones plays Louisa and Sam Claflin, mostly known from The Hunger Games series, portrays the paralyzed Will.First I want to say that Me Before You is really a British film. Working class meet upper class, they clash and break down social barriers. I also think that Louisa is a pretty typical British "film girl". She wears extremely colorful clothes, is constantly happy, a bit weird and often quite oblivious to the serious situations around her. When she meets Will it is at first very tense, he mostly ignores her and she desperately wants to get out of there. They of course soon become attracted to each other because they really are each other's opposites. She is fascinated by his world, his personally and also in my opinion a bit by his disability. She in turn for him becomes a happy, clumsy and carefree girl like no one he ever met before in his organized and sterile world.The director Thea Sharrock relies very much on close-ups and reaction shots. This is good, and sometimes not so good. Too much close-ups on a face can easily remove the body language and also make us interpret every single facial expression as something very important. Sometimes we stay to long on Louisa's face. Her smile and her tilted gaze always seems to want to say something and I wonder if that really is what they were aiming for. However they succeed very well in a certain face shaving scene I consider as one of the best ones in the film.Me Before You is a very heavy film and touches a very sensitive subject that shall remain unknown because it is a major spoiler. I do think that the filmmakers take this too lightly and offer a very simple answer that in reality should be a lot more complicated. Also, the film doesn't go all the way and actually chicken out during what I believe was a very defining moment. A bit weak actually. But the film and especially the author should have credit for daring to speak about it. The overall impression is that they actually manage to finish the film in the way they planned. Our entire emotional register is played out during these barely two hours. We laugh, we get angry, confused and we cry. Not a dry eye in the theater. But for me to become more involved and drawn to the story, it would require more focus on the sensitive subject. Offer no direct answers, ask us the audience questions and let us sit by the end of the film with our heads filled with thoughts. That would according to me have given the film more depth. Also the clichés and the music would have to be toned down. The music was at times very bombastic and tiresome.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good sad romantic film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my first time ever to have seen Emila Clarke in a film. I still have to see Game of Thrones because she is such a brilliant actress! Also it was good to have seen Janet McTeer (Watched the Songcatcher recently), Matthew Lewis (Harry Potter) and Jenna Coleman (Doctor Who). You wouldn't suspect such a underrated cast like them would be appearing in this but, it was a great to know it actually happened! Anyways onto the movie, it was very good and no, I didn't cry as I thought I would.I liked Clarke's and Sam Claflin's chemistry throughout the movie. Although, I would've rather if they made Clarke's character more sympathetic when Claflins character announced he wants to die legally to Switzerland as he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life being sick, and handicapped. I felt they gave Clarke's character too over the top, she should've been acting more caller. It's not Emila Clarke's fault but the way the character was developed, was a little bit ridiculous to be honest...That's just only my criticism to this movie but other than that, it is really flattering to watch and even though it's sad, it gives you that feeling of hoping for the best with your own loved ones! Thats how I've seen it but other people may have a different opinion when they do get a chance to look at it! I give this movie a 8/10 because of its good actors, story line, the settings and of course, giving you a great amount of emotions!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had butterflies in my stomach and Emilia Clarke was not the woman who caused them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of Emilia Clarke or Sam Claflin. Don't get me wrong; they are talented performers, but I didn't watch the movie to see them. Jenna Coleman is the only woman, both in the acting world and in my own relatively boring life, who can make me feel scared, excited and nervous all at the same time. I think she had far too little screen time and Katrina's story was only very vaguely hinted at. Apparently she has a son but they never explained who the father is, or how she was coping and judging by how young Jenna looks (she's thirty but I think she looks at least five years younger), I wouldn't be surprised if Treena's son was the result of a teenage pregnancy. Treena wanted to go back to college but that's only mentioned in one scene. Despite having too little screen time, Treena and Lou really did seem like sisters. It wasn't as good as Anna and Elsa's beautiful bond in Frozen but that was only because the story didn't give Treena enough attention.The ending was sad but I knew Will was going to die before I even watched the movie. With that said, it does lead to questions about whether one should assist in a suicide and it was brave to tackle this controversial matter. Is it murder when one wants to die? I don't know and while Lou and Treena's mother stated that it basically was, that is just one woman's opinion. The film itself doesn't really say whether it's right or wrong. I also noticed something else, actually from a trailer before I even watched the film. Lou said she became a whole new person after meeting Will and her dad said that you can't change who people are. Some could see that as inconsistent writing, but when I think about it, I think it works because Lou and her dad are two different people with different points of view.While it's a good movie in its own right, it was predictable and the only reason I wanted to watch it at all was because Jenna's in it. I had similar feelings about Doctor Who ever since the casting of the talented but overrated Peter Capaldi. Now that Jenna's left, Doctor Who has lost most of its charm for me. With that said, I mistook Treena for Clara at one point because Jenna can disappear into her character when she's playing Clara to the point where, for a moment, I saw Clara playing Treena instead of Jenna playing her. It was like Jenna was playing two characters simultaneously. But I digress; Me Before You wasn't really my kind of movie but for what it was, it was good. If Jenna wasn't in it and I still watched it, I'd give it 6 but I'm giving it 7 because I freaking love her. And hate that I love her. And I'm driving myself mad over her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a very beautiful love story about the connections that people make over their lives. It's actually funny how the movie's premise is about how short life can be and that it should be lived to the fullest, yet it tells a story about how certain people can have an effect on you that can stay with you forever.And what I love especially about this movie is that it's not a traditional formulated love story that usually is spoon fed to the mainstream. I'll take a guess that a lot of that has to do with the star power of Emily Clarke in the lead role. I heard some people did not like the idea of her doing the role. I can see that. After all, she plays a strong female character on Game of Thrones. The movie gives more of a stereotype of what a strong female character is, especially for a Romance film, but Clarke is so good in it. She's just so cute and it's wonderful to see the energy she brings to the role on screen. Plus she had good chemistry with the guy from the Hunger Games films, so you can't beat that. I tell people I'm not a fan of Romantic films, but I did like what was going on here. It's not going to bring you to tears but it does touch you with it's message on life.</fullReview>

As a whole the film flowed very smoothly. Nothing dragged on or felt too rushed. There are also some laughs in there which add a little bit of light-heartedness.A beautiful story with packed with emotion and a bitter sweet ending.

		<fullReview>Me Before You, is a romantic drama that paves a light-heartedness throughout a confronting, profound context. Luisa (Emilia Clarke) is breathtakingly charming as caretaker for a recently-paralyzed, Will (Sam Claflin). While the story has its predictability's, it also surprises within them. Notable nuances by Clarke, and Claflin shift this film from tolerable to pleasurable.The stand-out performance would go to Clark, with her vulnerability palpable, due almost exclusively to her extensive, engaging facial expressions, and mannerisms.While some are calling this film controversial, in regards to the under-laying topic of euthanasia, I simply see it is as an account, a version of a story, of a characters mindset, and their decision regarding their own life.In a society so quick to take offence, while being so offensive ?? I conclude that it depends on your intent as a movie-goer.If you're open to characters making their own decisions in a film, I'm sure you'll find that Me Before You, puts you first.By Rocio Belinda Mendez***/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a beautifully sugar-coated but tragic story with a deep message that increasingly demands a societal response</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In movies, as in life, appearances can be deceptive. The trailer for Me Before You (2016) promises a sweet romantic comedy but the film is an emotionally challenging confrontation with the moral dilemmas of assisted dying. It is a beautifully sugar-coated but tragic story with a deep message that increasingly demands a societal response. Full of fairy-tale allusions, including a castle with a fallen prince and a poor girl in strange clothes, together with brilliant casting and tear-inducing imagery, the film is one of a growing number that address euthanasia themes.The storyline is simple. Working class girl Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) takes a six-month contract to be a carer for quadriplegic Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). He is under the guardianship of his wealthy parents who want a fresh bright face for Will, and Louisa is delightfully quirky, chatty and absolutely zany in her dress sense. Despite a fractious beginning, they soon become deeply attached as she learns of his plan to end his life in a Swiss euthanasia clinic within six months. In the time they have left and within the constraints of his condition, they do many of the things that young lovers do, including a tropical island holiday. The most painful part of this film is the absolutely finite nature of its impending finale and the respectful resolution shown in particular by Will's parents and the transformative effect this has on Louisa.Emilia Clarke's performance is the beating heart of this film. As Louisa, she is simply beyond gorgeous. Her face can speak volumes without opening her mouth while her eyebrows alone have a vocabulary spanning all human emotion. Will is her perfect match, with an expressiveness that glides seamlessly from brooding stoicism to irascible charm. No doubt many audiences will be happy to enjoy a bitter sweet love story told well, without dwelling on the deeper message of assisted dying. Others, however, will be struck by the force of three words that are repeated several times in the film, "it's his choice". They will grapple with how a person can reach such an unbearable point in their existence where they find absolutely no reason to live. As a tear-jerker rom-com, this film is right up there with the best of them but it is so much more than that. Sure, the narrative arc is laid bare right from the start, but sometimes you just have to let a movie have its way with you, as this one did with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mother of Dragon's goofiness save the day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romantic dramedies of this sort rise or fall depending on the chemistry of the couple. It is a foregone conclusion they would fall in love but they will have to earn the right to fall into each other's arms. There is no need to give me new twists to the familiar turns; just sell the couple to me and hopefully make me tear up at the end. On that note, Me Before You scores beautifully. I love watching Emilia Clarke, the Mother of Dragons. Her goofiness, all-out spunk, total honesty, awkward behavior and gaudy sense of fashion lift the chick flick slightly higher than it deserves. It took me 10 seconds and suddenly I don't see the Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Breaker of Chains and the Mother of Dragons. I couldn't take my eyes off her twitching eyebrows which have a life of their own. Sam Calflin plays his character with the right amount of sarcasm and levity; he is believable as a quadriplegic, a man who knows he couldn't ever be the same man again. Both of them turned in authentic performances. The story goes through the usual paces and there really weren't any surprises, but who cares. The theme of euthanasia wasn't handled with a searing depth, but the theme of living life to the best of your ability rings true. Yeah... We cried but we weren't a mess like we were with The Fault in Our Stars. Me Before You isn't breaking new ground nor did it try to, but it just felt like good comfort food. Sometimes I long for that.</fullReview>

The minor characters get enough exposure in the film to tell the story so that it all makes sense. Lou's quirky style of dress and personality was superb. While the performance may not receive a major acting award, it is nonetheless engaging and moving.The interplay between Will and Lou is balanced and nuanced.

		<shortDescription>Looking at the bright side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie - I gave "8" to it in the rating section but much more because the last movies available, my God, what a bad vintage of movies! Someone ought warn Hollywood that the Earth has been invaded and destroyed by aliens from space non-stop since maybe the 50's!!! Moreover, it also seems that "The Exorcist" has been reincarnating in other 100 movies too, last one "The Conjuring"...please!!! Come on!! Anyway, back to "Me Before You", I usually take these movies with a grain of salt - maybe two grains. First of all, the cliché of a millionaire good-looking guy whose life changes after an accident. It is romantic, it is OK, but it is cliché. Secondly, the movie is too predictable. I watched it today. And today, June 12, 2016, it is Valentine's Day in Brazil -- I am Brazilian, I live in the USA though. My wife read the book and of course the book was much better. The movie is "by the book" indeed, but not literally, got it? It is a romantic by the book type - happiness-drama-joy-drama-happiness-drama-lovely message in the end. Enjoy but don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie today and was not disappointed. The acting, especially from Emilia Clarke, who played Lou, was brilliant. I also thought Sam Claflin, who played Will Traynor, did a very good job. I note that someone has commented that it wasn't as good as the book. I disagree. There were a couple of small parts that were left out but they certainly did not detract from the movie. It has been a long time since I have seen a movie that I have loved as much as this one and would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a laugh, but also be prepared to have a cry as well. I also noted that, from an ethical point of view, someone gave it a one star rating. I find that very unfair because the movie was excellent. That is the person's view because of their religion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic way to be entertained and educated about each individual right to choose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning, Me before you, grab my attention and engaged me in its well presented drama. It is amazing how Emilia Clark is able to be light, funny and very real at the same time. Her acting is superb in every way. She goes into the seriousness of the story convincing us with her authentic performance. My youngest daughter Michelle was born without her left arm, she has 30% below the elbow missing from birth. My experience with her change the way I saw individuals with disabilities for ever. Movies with individuals with disabilities touch me very deeply. "Me before you", caught me by surprise, because I went to see a comedy. And the impact of the depth of the story push me to the moments when I was dealing with my daughter darker moments, which were a few. If you are sensitive to the pain and suffering of others, go see this movie, it is entertaining and it gives you the opportunity to see two young actors reach a level in their careers which place them in a category with great performers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first review that I write because people needs to be seriously warned of how bad this movie is. I decided to see it based on the good scores and reviews it had here plus hearing someone saying that "it wasn't the typical Hollywood chick flick" let me tell you that is not only the typical chick flick is just a compilation of corny fake clichés, the script is awful, the actors are terrible and Emily Clark's acting it's the most obnoxious thing I have seen in years on the screen. Her "acting skills" are moving her eyebrows with this annoying stupid face which is a mix between "I want to cry and I want to go to the toilet". If you want to spend your money in entertainment seriously don't do this. I even left before the end cause I couldn't stand so much crap together. I really don't understand how so many say that's a great movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving In Spite of Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Me Before You" was made to appeal to the lowest common denominator. In spite of myself, though, I was moved by and I enjoyed this film. "Me Before You" is a romance between a perky, poor, not spectacularly beautiful girl and a rich, suicidal, model-handsome quadriplegic. You may have begun gagging already. I understand, and believe me, everything that you fear may be wrong with such a film is wrong with this film. It talks down to its audience. Its play with dangerous ideas is a child playing with matches. And yet, I cried. I think two things save "Me Before You" in spite of all that's wrong with it. Sam Claflin plays the part of Will Traynor, the rich, handsome, suicidal quadriplegic. Claflin is young, ripped, and handsome enough to be in a toothpaste commercial. He is really good. I believed everything he did. I was right there with him. I felt his pain and desperation. Janet McTeer, a multiple-award-winning actress, is the soul of the film. She plays Will's mother. She is given very little to do, but she pops in and out regularly. There is an infinite sadness and terror in her eyes. I'm a former nurse's aide and I'm very familiar with dealing with family members of afflicted people. Janet McTeer is superb. She shows the exact strength, vulnerability, and hoping- against-hope of the loved ones of the wounded and doomed. "Me Before You"'s plot doesn't do anything you wouldn't expect it to. If you go to the movies to be surprised or intrigued, stop right now. But you already knew that when you saw the movie poster of the perky girl sitting on the lap of the very handsome man in a wheelchair, as they gaze lovingly into each other's eyes. "Me Before You" takes place in the England that exists only in the imagination of fans of Masterpiece Theater, Jane Austen adaptations, and Merchant Ivory films. This is very much not the England of Sadiq Khan and Brexit or even of royal family scandals. There are very rich people who also have good taste. There are poor people who are warm, simple-minded, and humble, not at all resentful or bitter about their place. Sort of like Hobbits. There is sweeping, green countryside defined by rambling stone walls and trout streams. There is a big, fat castle ? yes, really ? overlooking everything. Weather? It's either blue skies, burgeoning lilacs and hydrangeas, or gently drifting snow outlining the castle battlements, or perfectly formed autumn leaves. Thomas Kinkade is the meteorologist. Louisa "Lou" Clark is a cutie pie poor girl. Emilia Clarke, who plays Louisa, telegraphs how adorable Lou is in every scene. She is constantly dimpling her cheeks and wriggling her eyebrows as if they were migrating caterpillars looking for a leaf to pupate on. Look, if you wanted to smack Emilia Clarke during every scene of "Me Before You," could you please send me a Facebook friend request? Does the word "subtlety" appear in Emilia Clarke's dictionary? Or "teamwork"? In every scene she demands attention. Actors should never work with babies, animals, or Emilia Clarke. Lou is supposed to be really poor. Lou never wears the same item of clothing twice. Her clothes are unique designer finds. Her shoes alone would go for a few hundred bucks. Oh, but she's this noble poor girl. Yeah, right. The filmmakers here keyed their film to teenage girls who love clothes more than life itself and who have short attention spans. My utterly subjective estimate: no scene in the film lasts for more than ninety seconds. You think there's going to be a serious discussion, or even three consecutive lines of dialogue, about the issues at play here: can afflicted people live worthwhile lives? Is suicide ethical? Will this film encourage the handicapped to off themselves? But that never happens. It's safe to guess that Will's quadriplegia is, to the filmmakers, merely a plot device. Tweener girls find guys attractive, but are anxious about real physical intimacy and all it entails. Also, tweener girls don't want to be obliterated by masculinity. They want to exist in a world where they are the center. And, tweener girls are anxious that they aren't pretty enough. Thus, "Me Before You" gives tweener girls a very handsome, ripped hero who couldn't engage in physical intimacy even if he wanted to. And he is so needy and so isolated that the tweener girl's cuteness and spunkiness and fashion choices become the center of his world. And she doesn't have to be beautiful to be the center of the universe to this handsome guy who, if he were not a quadriplegic, would be the hottest date in town. Yes, it is all pretty awful, right down to Lou's boyfriend, who is an endurance athlete obsessed with his physical performance, but insensitive to Lou's emotional needs ? he is meant to contrast with the lovable quadriplegic. One man can run but can't feel. One man can feel but can't walk. Oh good grief. And yet I cried while watching this film. In spite of everything, Claflin's and McTeer's performances opened my heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Reviews are Lies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of the reviews that I have read about this movie in the secular press have been artful lures to suck people into watching a movie that comes to a despicable conclusion. It is very, very difficult to find a review of this movie that includes the fact that the film is an advocacy piece for assisted suicide for disabled people. My wife's friends from Church took her to this movie, thinking that it is akin to a chick flick. They wanted to help her see a lighter side to life, a mere 16 months since our older son took his life as a result of his mental illness. Needless to say, this movie is not the right antidote for that. But, who would have known the truth from reading the reviews of the movie? No one. It is as if the producers and marketers of this movie were in a cabal to hide the real intent of the film. Diabolical, to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sets back perceptions of disability by decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, and presumably the book on which it is based, commits a triple whammy. First, it portrays disabled people as miserable. Second it perpetuates the idea that they need rescuing by a vivacious non- disabled youngster. Third it presents disabled people as still so miserable, despite being 'rescued', that they have to go to Switzerland to be euthanased. Prince Harry must be tearing his hair out after all his efforts with the Invicta Games to portray disabled people positively. The film is nothing more than propaganda for the really dangerous Swiss death machine Dignitas. It is ghastly and should be banned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bowl of clichés served with Emilia Clark's overacting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first half an hour, you'd think that this is a changed version of The Intouchables but as you move on it makes you wish it were. Progress is very predictable like if it was written with a recipe. It's really hard to believe that this movie is based on a book. It's even harder to believe that this is a British Comedy. The boyfriend character! In every five minutes the author points out how stupid and selfish he is. Everything is told by yelling in this story, everything is exaggerating Emilia Clark's awfully overreacting. Probably the best proof that her career will go down as soon as Game of Throne's over, can't keep up with Sam Claflin. If you haven't seen The Intouchables, better spend that 2 hours watching that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Tearjerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Me Before You", starring Emilia Clarke-Game of Thrones_tv, Terminator Genisys; Sam Claflin-The Hunger Games movies, Pirates of the Caribbean:On Stranger Tides; Charles Dance-Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Game of Thrones_tv and Janet McTeer-Insurgent, The Woman in Black.This is a romantic movie that will have it's target audience-ladies- grabbing for a tissue. Yep, a real tearjerker. Sam plays a banker from a wealthy family. He has a girlfriend-not Emilia-but looses her after he is hit by a motorcycle and is paralyzed from the neck down. I guess she was the shallow type, because she ends up marrying Sam's best friend. Emilia is hired by Sam's parents, Charles &amp; Janet, to help take care of Sam; nothing too physical, just mostly to talk to him and keep him company. Emilia has a boyfriend but you can tell that they are not meant to be together and he won't be around at the end of the movie. Sam was real active physically before his accident so he is really depressed now. He even tries to kill himself-which is hard to do when you are a quadriplegic-and he tells his parents that he will go to Switzerland to do the job right, but he gets talked into waiting 6 months before saying his final goodbyes. That is where Emilia comes in. Emilia has a perky personality, always talking and she dresses in bright &amp; outlandish styles of clothing, and she hopes to change Sam's mind about his death choice-when she eventually finds out about it. Like most romantic movies, they don't get along at first but soon..... It's rated "PG-13" for thematic elements and sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 50 minutes. It's a descent movie for what it is, not one that I would buy on DVD-I'm not the target audience, remember?-but a good rental, if you like these types of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Me Bore You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it just me, or are we all sick of the rich, handsome guy always wooing the girl with his wily charms, his full head of hair and an allowance that exceeds most people's rent? Granted in the case of Me Before You, the man in question is Will Traynor (Claflin), a quadriplegic with a death wish. If the movie was in the hands of people who actually knew a thing or two beyond weepy romantic tropes and clichés, they could have come up with something worthwhile. Unfortunately makers of this film seem to think that simply replacing Hugh Grant with a younger faster model and reciting the hackneyed romantic dramedy formula for the umpteenth time, makes for a unique experience; umm...nope.The film takes place in a quaint little country town in England and concerns the life Louisa Clark (Clarke). She's a bit of a flake but amiable enough to follow around for two hours, thus when she's left unemployed we feel her exhilaration when she manages to stumble into a job as a professional caretaker. She then meets Will, the local blue-blood who after a tragic accident is in no mood for friends and family, let alone a person who's pretty much hired to be his friend. Oh yeah, Will also has a nurse (Peacocke) thus guaranteeing that the messy realities of having to take care of a severely handicapped person is left off screen. After the first half-hour to forty-five minutes the pair grow acquainted all while the audience sits patiently, waiting for the actual plot to kick in.When it finally does kick in, the story devolves from being harmlessly, predictably enjoyable to being a contrived travelogue/bucket list that feels less tethered to the story than an attempt by director Thea Sharrock to visit exotic locales. The message of the film: "live boldly" and "follow your dreams" are laudable ideas, thus the film repeats them either visually or comes right out and says them again and again just in case you missed them. Personally I found such lofty ambitions a little hard to swallow coming from a man who inherited a private jet. Meanwhile the personification of those same ideas; the obligatory rival played by Matthew Lewis is the dimwitted pack animal to the story's muleskinner.For their efforts both Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke do a good job filling their roles as Lovebird #1 and Lovebird #2. Clarke especially has a certain way about her that can emit pure giddiness without trying too hard. Too bad her character is stripped for parts by the story and deprived of her very agency and character growth by virtue of an expense account. If anything, Me Before You is confirmation that the young ingénue can have a successful career beyond Game of Thrones (2011-Present).For the sake of filling seats Claflin does well based solely on the power of his chiseled cleft chin and naturally toned physique. He's the dreamboat genre fans have been clamoring for ever since Dylan McDermott and Patrick Dempsey became too old to play leading men. But lest you think his casting decision is a shallow attempt to placate fans while undercutting the character's handicap, he does sport a beard and a nasty flop sweat on more than one occasion to insure he doesn't always look like Superman.No matter how you slice it, Me Before You is a predictable and boring film that wears its cutesiness like a badge of honor in the hopes that no one notices our leading lady doesn't evolve and our leading man doesn't know how good he's got it. It adheres to an old formula with little regard for changing tastes and it's one attempt at uniqueness is treated more like a plot device than a genuine attempt at characterization. If that's what you're looking for in a movie, take a stab at Me Before You. Frankly I think it should have been titled Me Bore You.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adorable yet terrible tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually write reviews, but I thought I would for this one. My wife and I saw the trailer for this film months before it's release and were very excited to see it because the trailer makes it look like a very sweet love story. We were lied to.I have not read the book and so I don't know how similar it is, nor do I know if this was based on a true story, but if the movie is representative of the book, I probably don't care to read it. Why? Because this film is not a romance, nor is it a tragedy. It's a strange mix of both. The girl gets the guy, but not really. Here is what I mean: The story is all set up to be this cute romantic film where a girl comes to the rescue of a torn disabled man and they establish a relationship, fall in love, (sound like beauty and the beast?) and live happily ever after, right? WRONG! He has his mind set for killing himself because he lost the ability to do so much of what he loves. Instead of him fighting the odds and accepting his changes and living life the best he can, he gives up and ends his life and leaves the girl behind. WHAT THE F***?? Who does that?! I spent a long time as an aid for a disabled man and I had to feed him, dress him, brush his teeth, shower him and so forth, and I watched him go through a similar process. I don't know what it's like to live like that, and chances are, neither do you (the reader). However, I know what it's like to watch someone like that fall into a deep depression. I had to keep him from trying to kill himself every day. I get that it's hard. very hard. I get that it feels as though it would be better to die. But I do not believe that that is the answer. We love stories of hope and stories of triumph! They inspire us to beat the odds and to never give up. So if this was meant to be a true romance, I think he would have chosen to stay with her and have a wonderful life together. Let's say that they went with a true tragedy, then I think he outcome would have been different. Anyway, I think it's a fun movie to watch, but it just ends in a terrible way. I think it would have been a huge improvement if they would have stayed together. Haters gunna hate, but that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know anything about this movie when I agreed to go and watch it with a group of 8 friends. Well what can I say?? Amazing acting by all involved in a deeply thought provoking story line. An absolute emotional roller-coaster!! The movie is done so well you can literally see it from all perspectives. Although we all had a massive cry in the dark, every single one of us loved this movie... I noticed for the first time in a long time a huge amount of people remained in their seats after the movie finished just regathering their thoughts and emotions.. That's how powerful this movie is. If you hadn't read the book and didn't know what was coming, (as in my case) then you really don't see the emotional bombshell coming and which direction this movie is going in. Not your usual predictable happily ever after story which in itself is brilliantly refreshing.. Highly recommend, however remember to take some tissues with you as I believe even the toughest of you will shed at least a tear or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a guy friendly movie but it's not so sappy that it can't be tolerated. Emilia Clarke is in fine form but miles from her role as Mother of Dragons in Game of Thrones. You can barely recognize her. But she's effective as the always cheerful companion to a rich but paralyzed young man played by Sam Claflin.It was actually Claflin's performance that I found the most interesting. This guy starts out briefly as a young stud, enjoying his lively life. But then he is paralyzed very convincingly; he even seems slightly thinner as if he hasn't gotten out of bed for months. As a guy I tended to sympathize more with him while my wife was more taken with Emilia's role.Anyway, it's all fairly entertaining. And next time it's my choice what we see.</fullReview>

The clothes and shoes are interesting.Basically it's a right to die story. So who is more selfish the afflicted person who can't live like this anymore or the people who love him and don't want to let him go. If you've seen the trailer you know where this is going. You know you are going to cry and you will.The movie stands up well against others in the you know where this is love story is going genre. The right to die issue gives this a bit more of an angle. While the movie looks good on the big screen, it will play well on a platform in the comfort of your home. Enjoy it and be sure to have the Kleenex handy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't about the normal love stories, although it includes some clichés, but overall it was good. The storyline is amazing, and people would love this movie. This movie contained a strong message to all people as well, and the ending, although unexpected, was dedicated to the message of the movie. Now the casting. I thought that Emilia Clarke tried too hard in this movie, and when she laugh or cry, it almost seems that it's fake. But her character is the most likable out of all in the film. Sam Claflin was decent as Will Traynor. Steve Peacocke was alright as Nathan, although his accent seemed hard to understand at first for myself and some viewers. The rest of the casting was not that important because it was basically revolved around those three characters. Book Viewers. Honestly, this movie kept up with the book, although they missed out on a lot of things. They took out huge parts of the book, and that's why the movie doesn't care about characters such as Camilla, Thomas, and Katrina, etc. It's like they don't exist in the movie. Viewers who do not read the book will not know who Thomas is to the family and why Katrina is so important to Louisa's life. They also do not include Will's sister. Patrick was literally no one in the movie. He's Louisa's boyfriend in the movie and that's it. They didn't explain why Louisa dated him for years and how he was before he became that selfish prick. So overall, the movie get a B- . It was not as good as I expected, but it's worth the money and time to watch it. P.S. If you're a crier, bring some tissues cause this movie is a tear jerker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from movies, literature, and music my other great passion is theatre and around twenty years ago I saw Janet McTeer star as a memorable Beatrice opposite Mark Rylances' Benedek which is more or less one for the So What department except that in this movie she has a featured role as the mother of the male lead, which is yet more so what until we remember that Benedek and Beatrice were the prototypes for all the great movies in which a male and a female began by disliking each other and wind up as an item. That is not quite true of this movie; the man certainly begins by resenting the girl but then he resents most people; as for the girl, she is in it for the money. As she is something of a kook it's not to hard to see why he eventually falls for her - this is one of those parts that slightly off-beat actresses can score big in - think Audrey Tautao in Amelie - but then cannot really replicate, but it's more difficult to see what someone in a steady seven-year relationship should forget it virtually overnight and fall hook, line and sinker for a quadriplegic. Well again not quite, did I mention that not only is the guy very good looking but also seriously wealthy. Just once it would be refreshing, if not a tad more like the real world if the girl fell for someone who looked like Arthur Mullard and lived in a council flat and especially in a film like this that is addressing a serious subject, assisted suicide but trying to have it both ways by giving it gloss of a Doris Day-Rock Hudson rom-com of the 1950s. The two leads both turn in fine performances and the manipulative writing and direction does, in the majority of viewers, attract the hoped-for tears but it would have been nice if we could lose the chocolate-box elements and trust the audience to respond to the situation rather than the budget.</fullReview>

Right from the start, just from seeing the title of the movie on the screen I began crying with excitement .loved every bloody minute of it. This movie will make you laugh, cry, lose your self in the room, and most of all- pray for a goddamn sequel movie (there is a following book named "after you"- highly recommend it). I cried like someone (god forbid) died or something! Trust me, some will say it's a classic chick flick, but I say screw it. "Me Before You" is the best romantic movie ever to exist. The actors were wonderful, the screenplay was the same exact lines from the book which I loved for the fact that it kept its authenticity, and the choice of background music made it even better. definitely will watch it again in a dark room with a box of tissues.</fullReview>

And, at least for the first half hour, that's exactly what I got, however the great thing about Me Before You is that it gets a hell of a lot better with every scene, ending up as a very enjoyable, if not generic, romantic drama.However, before I get into the best parts of this film, I'm going to start with the first act, roughly half an hour wrought with problems that I expected to continue on through the whole movie. First off, this film is a textbook example of a bad first impression, in the form of Louisa, played by Emilia Clarke. With the benefit of hindsight and her character arc, I can see that Clarke's performance at the beginning wasn't her own bad acting, but rather a symptom of simply poor writing and directing.As the film begins, Louisa is presented as a nice but pretty clumsy and dim young woman, who lucks into a job caring for the rich Will Traynor. However, despite all the smiles and brightly-coloured outfits, her ridiculous luck in the first act meant that she just wasn't a particularly lovable character for me, leaving me continually frustrated for the best part of half an hour.That, combined with all the inevitably cheesy and insanely generic chick flick tropes, meant that I had no hope going into the second act of the film. However, as the story develops, we get some great character development for both the leads, and, thanks to Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin's excellent chemistry, the film becomes very charming, pleasant and simply enjoyable.I'm not going to ignore the fact that the story follows an very formulaic route from start to finish, but what I really enjoyed about the film was watching Louisa and Will's relationship develop, simply because the two lead actors worked so well together, and gave very convincing performances that, especially in the case of Emilia Clarke, got less and less cringeworthy as the film moved along.Put simply, I eventually came round to really enjoy Me Before You. Despite an awful start, the film's pleasant and positive atmosphere, combined with Clarke and Claflin's fantastic chemistry, had me smiling and enjoying myself by the end. It's by no means the emotional roller-coaster of a love story it aims to be, but as a simply enjoyable and pleasant watch, Me Before You does the job pretty well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love So Lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606; out of 5) THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: There are disabilities aplenty in this sappy screen adaptation, mostly in its politically- correct thinking.GRADE: C-SYNOPSIS: A beautiful caretaker falls in love with her handsome quadriplegic patient. JIM'S REVIEW: There have been much talk and many catchy phrases about the subject of love that have been set to music: "Love will find a way. Love hurts. Love makes the world go round. Love will keep us together. Love the one you're with. True love never runs smooth." These pop ditties are never heard in the insufferable tearjerker of a movie entitled Me Before You. Still they do form the basis for the relationship of two mismatched beautiful people who become soulmates amid love's many obstacles. &#xfffc;The story goes like this: Recently unemployed Louisa (Emilia Clarke) becomes a nursemaid and companion to handsome but clinical depressed Will Trayor (Sam Clafin), once a rugged sportsman and successful executive, the whole package, and now a disheartened quadriplegic. Will has no will to live but Louisa, or Lou as she is lovingly called, is Little Miss Sunshine personified, a kooky supposedly adorable waif and perhaps the perfect antidote to Will's bouts of suicide. At least Will's rich parents hope that Lou will be the cure-all to lift Will's spirits and change his mind and mood swings. It didn't change mine.&#xfffc;With an abysmal screenplay by Jojo Moyes and based on her best-selling novel (which I fortunately did not read but am told the book tackles more serious themes), the film shies away from any semblance of reality and settles smack dab in the soapiest of waters. I guess every generation needs its own Love Story, but is it too much to ask for some darker moments to help us relate to Will's physical condition? One only hears of, but never sees, Will's pain and suffering.&#xfffc;Yet Will isn't the only one suffering here. Any moviegoer in their right mind would want to pull the plug on this claptrap. Truthfully, the whole ethical issue of patient's rights and euthanasia deserves a fair better and more honest treatment. (That was done in a film called The Sessions. View that excellent film instead, dear readers.)&#xfffc;But this is suppose to be a love story, the equivalent to a pulpy romance paperback novel. And on its own terms and genre, the movie fails miserably, mostly due to insipid directorial debut by Thea Sharrock, who searches out for the tritest of images and succeeds in making the bad even worse, laughably outrageous "exotic" costumes by Jill Taylor, and the hammiest performance by one of the leads. &#xfffc;Try as he must, Mr. Caiflin does bring some poignancy to his poorly written character. How he was able to keep a straight face throughout this film and watch Ms. Clarke overdo her acting in the most ridiculous of outfits and hair styles would be challenging enough for any actor. The actress is not helped by her director or costumers. She is seen in the most garish of garb, from fuzzy colorful sweaters and busy ugly prints, in outfits any fashionable 13 year old would instantly reject. Her hair styles range from braids and pigtails to Frau Brucher Germanic up-dos, which telegraph more emotion than the actress can muster. We are suppose to be enamored by Lou's quirkiness, but the overall effect is an off-putting goofiness. Who could blame Will for ending his life...suicide would be anyone's choice after experiencing Ms. Clarke's cutesy performance!If nothing else, there is fine supporting work by Charles Dance, Janet McTeer, and Brendan Coyle, all distinguished British actors who would be wise to omit this film from their resume. Also, Stephen Peacocke, resembling a young Hugh Grant, literally does some heavy lifting and delivers a nicely nuanced performance as Will's full-time doctor, Nathan, one of the few subtlest contributions found in this film. (By the way, in retrospect, everyone is so inexplicably darn good-looking in this movie.)&#xfffc;With all that is said and done here, writer H. L. Mencken's ultimate quote of the subject of love may succinctly sum up everything that is wrong with this silly film: "Love is a triumph of imagination over intelligence." Me Before You has neither of those valued commodities.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not read the book. When I saw the trailer, I thought the movie was going to be boring, but I was wrong. To regard it as "one of the best romantic films of its time" is a mistake, but to say that it is bad is not exactly right either. While there isn't something breathtakingly new about the film, I could, however, easily recommend it to someone who's tired of watching films with endings which only aim to satisfy most of the audience's desire.One quirk of Emilia Clarke that kind of distracted me with her acting is her overly expressive eyebrows. She is beautiful and lovely, no doubt about that. But her eyebrows stole the show in some scenes from time to time. I'm not entirely sure either if it was meant to be that way, but the wardrobe they had for Lou (Emilia Clarke) was terrible. I mean I get that her choice of clothes was supposed to make a statement about her personality, yet I was hoping for them to achieve that without making the character look silly.With regard to the ending, others find it ironic that Will (Sam Claflin) is instructing Lou to do something that he himself intends to defy. But what I think these people fail to realize is that Will and Lou's life conditions are not the same. The challenge Lou faces in her life is not on par with the difficulty being suffered by Will. I believe the lesson to be learned from Me Before You* is to do something significant with your life. And if you pay close attention to what happened in the ending, you will see that both characters were able to accomplish just that.*Better than "The Fault in Our Stars"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uniquely controversial, but a little over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story that JoJo Moyes produced is certainly a unique one. I appreciated how truly realistic the situation was, that unfortunate things happen and not every love story is a fairy tale.What I mostly enjoyed was how the love story between Louisa and Will took a backseat to their developing friendship and the hardships everyone had gone through within those six months. The relationships that Lou has with the other characters are also relatable.I had binged the book before watching the movie, which, now that I think about it, I probably shouldn't have. (I'm one of those people that want to read the book first before watching movies.) Anyway, much like many book adaptations, huge chunks of the book were not included in the final cut. Knowing there were more in-depth scenes that would have further developed some of the characters took a little of the wonder from me. I'd gone from viewer to critic.The build-up to the climax wasn't as dramatic or smooth like in the book. Admittedly, there were many tears shed. However, in the end, I felt that although both book and movie were executed beautifully in their own ways, Me Before You was really too over-hyped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll tell you something good: I really enjoyed this movie. Now I'll tell you something not so good: I probably should not have. Me Before You is all about encouraging young adults to #LiveBoldly and share with the world what they value in life. Done in the fashion of The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns, this romantic book-to-film adaptation becomes this summer's great tearjerker.It all starts with our male lead, 31-year-old William Traynor, played by Sam Claflin, who is living the great life of water skiing and high-diving. But then disaster strikes at the blink of an eye: he comes face to headlights with a motorcycle, and he becomes struck with a lifelong condition called Quadriplegia.Quadriplegia is a condition that permanently paralyzes the spine, arms, and legs, causing all sorts of symptoms such as: Loss of bladder and bowel control Pressure sores Blood clots Respiratory problems Autonomic dysreflexia Muscle spasms. It is a very limiting condition that bounds you to a wheelchair and forces you to rely on others for aid in all the little things.Here is when his new caretaker enters the picture. Will seems to be living fine in a wooden apartment with an assistant for his wheelchair, but he needs someone else to help with minor tasks such as eating and getting medications. Her name is Louisa Clark, played by Emilia Clarke. Louisa is 26 and desperate for work. This job requires no experience, so she is quick to accept the position.Here is the film's greatest strength: the way the relationship between these two is developed. Both players are beyond exceptional in their roles. Emilia puts on the sweetest, most adorable facial expressions?watching her wide smile and nervous eyebrows will leave you tumbling in laughter. Sam isn't as strong as his co-lead, but he beautifully contrasts from her lively, exotic personality with his slow, Debbie downer attitude which gradually opens up more as he becomes more comfortable with his caretaker. Even when he's just staring at the castle outside his window like a senior citizen, he makes it so easy for you to connect with him.Everything else that happens to these two is just pure sweetness: he talks her into watching a foreign film with him, she helps him to shave off his facial hair, she tells him about these ridiculous bumblebee tights she always wanted, she struggles to get his wheelchair out of mud, she attempts to get him into a high-class dining restaurant that he doesn't even like, and best of all, they get their moment to dance at a wedding. It's purely believable to see their relationship grow from distant to intimate over six months.That being said, the story needed major alterations. The book's original author Jojo Moyes adapted Me Before You to the screen, and it's clear she doesn't know how the process of an adaptation to screen goes. Her intentions for the emotional aspects of the script are in their proper place, but many of the important moments, particularly in the beginning, are skimmed over and barely given any detail, and it shows more in the rather clumsy third act. In addition, the picture's editor, John Wilson, simply did not let various scenes last long enough to get the full emotional effect.But that's not the worst part. No, the worst part of this film, and the book in that matter, is the message. Without spoiling anything for those of you who haven't read the book, the overall theme justifies suicide as a path to freedom from lifelong suffering. Suicide is often talked about as if it were a decision to live an alternate lifestyle, saying that if someone chooses to kill himself, you just have to let him do it. But how much truth is there to this?Coming from my own experiences, my autism has been an enormous stumbling block, just like Will with Quadriplegia. But what I learned over time, is that what I thought was holding me back was actually setting me up for something better, such as my book on growing up autistic that currently has a 4.5-star rating on Amazon. But it doesn't end there. Do you think Stephen Hawking would have inspired others had he decided to end his life after losing his muscular capabilities? Do you think that Roger Ebert would still be remembered as a well-respected movie critic if he killed himself after losing his jaw? What about Abraham Lincoln? Would our nation still be a slave-free country if he chose to end it after meeting a failure on the job? The devastating thing is, this movie proves that people don't quite understand the value of a disability.Now, Jojo Moyes is right about one thing: you can't change people or the decisions they make. If they choose something beyond the extreme, you're not responsible. But contrary to what Moyes is trying to say in her work, life is always worth living in the very end, even if certain things may momentarily make you feel otherwise. Thus I probably wouldn't recommend the book or the movie for this very reason. But you can go ahead and read and see each of these highly enjoyable works if my praise entices you. Just be aware that no matter what crap you may go through, life is always worth it!Overall Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Thea Sharrock directed the movie Me before you about Will Traylor (Sam Claflin from The Hunger Games). Will, born and brought up by rich and stylish parents Camilla and Stephen, is a handsome, happy man who meets with an accident and is paralyzed. Emily Clarke(Game of Thrones) as Lou Clark takes up job offered by Camilla to keep her son Will happy and to bring in cheer to his gloomy, bitter and angry personality. Stephen Peacock as Nathan , Will's therapist is caring and professional. The story is beautiful and the title is perfect. Life is a journey and if not happy from within, the course has to be changed. Enjoyed the conversations between Camilla and Lou Clark. There is perfect understanding between employer and the employee. Lou Clark's conversations with her sister Katrina (Jenna Coleman) makes sisterly love and caring very precious. Samantha Spiro as Lou's mom is emotional, stable and caring. My favorite scenes include Lou's birthday celebration with Will as a guest and the restaurant scenes where seating is for premier membership only. Lou handles disappointments well and takes advice from her loving family for her happiness. Will enjoys one day at a time and knows what he wants from life. I enjoyed the simple and realistic script. Needed a little editing. Perfect title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great landscapes, but typical story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the book before knowing there was a movie coming out about it, I knew the whole plot. And knowing the whole plot made this film unexciting to watch for me. I just didn't feel like it was anything special. It might also be because of the story itself. I've outgrown romantic comedies, and though this does have a ending that isn't usually in romantic comedies, it still progressed as one. The characters are typical and not that interesting. Though having said that, Clarke as Louisa does a good job of bringing out her character's quirky and bubbly personality. Clafin's character on the other hand, is your typical rich boy with lots of baggage, and it's up to the girl to make the boy whole again. Not my cup of tea. Also, movies like these perpetuate the idea that boys and girls cannot remain in a platonic relationship if they are in close proximity to each other. While the characters are typical, the acting did the film justice enough. The characters were brought to life, and there is good chemistry between Clarke and Clafin, although it was somewhat awkward.The cinematography is well done, as it does a good job of showing the landscapes in the area. The sweeping and aerial shots of the castle gives audiences the impression of how big the space actually is. Also, wide shots of cities like Paris, is nicely done. However, I did not like the many close-up shots of the characters. I felt too close and intrusive. I'm not sure why people cried while watching this. OK, I mean I am quite detached from emotion when watching things, but I did not feel that there was much emotional buildup. Could have just been me. Overall, this is a well made film, but was a little boring to me.</fullReview>

It is about a man who even though he found love, it wasn't enough to fill the void and depression he constantly felt. Is he selfish for doing it? Yes. But at the same time he saw the potential Louisa had to go out and do something with her life and he didn't want to hold her back because he knew that she would contently sit in a room with him for the rest of his and her life. His decision to end his life has to do with the fact that he had control over the situation since the traumatic event took away most of his ability to make his own decisions.It is fun to watch them fall in love, and it is heartbreaking to watch him make his decision, but it isn't about to medical aspect of things. It is about the fact that he is able to make this decision his on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent romance if a bit tone deaf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the few romance films I'll make it to this year, Me Before You is based on a novel of the same title by Jojo Moyes. The story tells of a young woman who struggles to find consistent employment to help her family and is employed by a wealthy son of an English family that was paralyzed after being struck by a motorbike in the street. Emilia Clarke continues to attempt to branch out from her starring role in the hit HBO series Game of Thrones and the failure of Terminator Genisys and plays Lou Clark. Sam Claflin play Will Traynor the moody male lead after several roles in movies like the Hunger Games and the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean.Clarke is better as the goofy smiling caretaker than as the Queen of Dragons. She sports her natural brown hair in place of the Targaryen blonde in which she achieved her fame. Claflin is moody and sarcastic as he is upset with his circumstances. The supporting cast included Charles Dance who unfortunately will never encounter Emilia Clarke in the world of Westeros but runs on and off the screen for a few parts here as Will's father. Janet McTeer plays Will's mother who hires Lou to take care of her son. Matthew Lewis appears as Clark's boyfriend, a fitness buff, as he looks for work beyond his days as Harry Potter's Neville Longbottom.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry but this movie has several problems. Story is about a paralyzed man who falls in love with a young local woman hired to be his companion/help mate. However he wants to commit suicide because of the pain and inability to live normally. The Trainers are supposedly the most prominent and wealthy local gentry family and yet they appear to have no servants at the manor house. Really? I mean people like them would have at least a few flunkies doing chores. It was laughable that Mrs. Trainor would answer the door herself to let the "shop girl" in to interview for the companion to her disabled son job. Normally when people are interviewing for a job like this with well to do people, a maid would let them in and allow them to be seated in the hallway and go in and tell the lady of the house she had a "person" to interview for the job. The local upper class upon calling would be shown into a sitting room and then the lady of the house informed of their presence. Also in a small village, the Trainers would likely have found someone by "word of mouth" and not gone through the employment office at all. Furthermore it was mentioned in passing that the disabled son had been a corporate raider in London prior to his accident and yet he shows no compassion nor remorse for the jobs he has cost working stiffs nor companies looted and destroyed.It is hard to feel sympathy for such an unrepentant sleaze ball. One last point: Was it really necessary to jet off to Switzerland for "voluntary euthanasia"? In real life a hefty overdose of morphine or bottle of sleeping tablets and whiskey together would have done the job with much less fuss and trouble and trauma and upset for the parents. Apparently the handicapped young man really did put himself before and above everyone else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sadly disappointed with this movie. I feel that there was an agenda to make killing one's self romantic or heroic. Clearly, this movie is an attempt to making an emotional movie that softens and dumbies the general person watching the film, whose "feelings" get in the way of hard realities of life and trying to find positive endings. There was no positiveness end, only a glorified death. So, instead of helping a disabled person see that they have so much to live for and see their value as a human person, we instead see a depiction of a disabled man who would rather kill his self than live with what inner joy and dignity he possessed. A film like this, does not contribute to the beauty of all people regardless of their ailments. I found it sad and over done with a manipulative story line. The acting was good but not great. The filming was very good. Definitely will not see this again! No hero. Just a movie to isolate further those with disabilities! I wish I could get my money back!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I initially went to see this in order to kill time on a rainy Sunday afternoon. And, also. because even the world's oldest comic book fanboy can get overloaded on superhero movies. But, to my surprise, I actually found myself liking this!For starters, it has a male lead who's actually a complete unknown to me! Sam Claflin, as Will Trainor. A 21st century aristocrat with an MBA who becomes quadriplegically paralyzed in a traffic accident. His gradual transition from self-pitying fatalist to relatively cheerful Charlie, over a period of six months, is due mostly to Louisa Clark.Lou, as she's known to family and friends, is played by Emilia Clarke. Picture the looks of a pre-WITCHBLADE Yancey Butler with the emotional range of Moira Kelly (from THE CUTTING EDGE) and the lovely accent of Rachel Weisz (from CHAIN REACTION and the first two MUMMY flicks). But, with the fashion sense of Reese Witherspoon's character during the first ninety minutes of LEGALLY BlONDE! It's this arsenal of qualities that brings Will out of his morbid funk. Even if only temporarily. I refuse to spoil the rest for you. Suffice it to say; any guy wishing to impress his girlfriend, with how sensitive he is, will succeed beyond all expectation if you take her to see this film! Fair warning, though. If you make the mistake of not bringing a whole box of Kleenex, then you'd better bring at least two of those (otherwise useless) boutique cubes of them. Because you'll definitely need them!</fullReview>

I want them made to be romantic without death or the old tropes! I think this can happen when we look at WHY the tropes that hurt us or offend us exist and then work on changing them!So where does this lead this Me Before You, this rare glamorous and romantic depiction of what I, and others, live through with disability and chronic pain? I dunno. Maybe Emilia Clarke will win an Oscar. (Hopefully, because you know, I hear she's so short and almost ugly. It was so nice of Hollywood to give her that role. Maybe they Hollywood can stop congratulating themselves for hiring "non-supermodels" and start hiring disabled actors, writers, directors and they really feel morally superior like the 90210 kids. ) As for me I'll be watching Game of Thrones. This mama loves The Mother of Dragons. She is literally a guilty pleasure, this tiny blonde girl that mostly rescues brown people. I know there are people of color that hate this about Game of Thrones. They should. We all should keep challenging writers about the harmful tropes.But, I will end with a Game of Thrones plot point: Last week was probably the third The Queen of Dragons/ Khalessi burned rapists and demanded liberation for all women and slaves.

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - emotionally lightweight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me Before You is a box ticker. It has a very simple story and it goes through the motions, easily sticking to the standard 'tragic-romantic- drama' template as if it was gospel. Shame it never goes beyond that to make it a more personal, unique experience.Based on the bestselling novel, and adapted for film, by Jojo Moyes, I expected something more interesting. It's surprisingly lightweight considering the subject matter; the plot is incredibly padded and while most of the dialogue is natural and realistic, some moments are awkwardly clunky ("it's actually your duty to live life as fully as possible"). Where it really suffers though is the acting.The minor characters are unspeakably bad, but they're the least of the problems. I like Emilia Clarke, but her performance is less subtle than her uncontrollable eyebrows and mindless smile. I like Sam Claflin too, but his character had even less personality than physicality. Their relationship seems pretty innocent and sweet on the surface, but if you think about it, what possible reason does he give her to love him? The only convincing moments are when people are standing around Will nervously, as if they don't know what they're doing. Perhaps debut director Thea Sharrock created that atmosphere on set too, but she really needed to do more to make the acting less in-your-face and amateur.On the plus side, the music choices and score (although still pretty standard) did fit very well with the colourful and middle-of-the-road cinematography and tone. The final act does have a hint of emotion (which it suits a lot more than the badly delivered humour earlier in the movie), although it was a lot less moving than it should have been. It's not a bad film, but it needed to carry a lot more emotional weight to handle its themes, which movies like 'Untouchable' did so much better.3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesus Christ this is terrible. Point (1) Emilia Clarke is possibly the worst actress of all time, including in Game of Thrones. I get it, she's a lovely likable real girl from the real world, but she can't act and this needs to stop. Please.Point (2) Another problem with this movie... the disabled character, is a 30 something year old man, who acts like a 12 year old boy, is filthy rich, completely spoiled, and Point (3) makes the job of CARE GIVING look too easy. I think this movie is pretty much insulting towards the care giving profession.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me Before You is a forgettable romantic comedy drama that really doesn't make its mark. Though it was a good attempt for a story like the fault in our stars, it doesn't quite stay with you nor stand with the success of its book. After so many skipped important scenes and dodgy actors for the mother and father of lou, i found myself feeling quite frustrated that the book was so lovely and Me Before You could not compete. Emelia clarke was such a true match for lou but unfortunately, will not so much. Me before you does have its perks. You will find yourself laughing here and then and you may even find a tear trying to escape heading towards the end. Overall, Me before you is enjoyable, but you probably wont find yourself falling inlove with it as much as you did with the novel by jojo moyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potential Inspiring Story Ended Up as a Love Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is thought to be an inspiring love story revolving around a caretaker trying to motivate a disabled to begin a brand whole new chapter of life but sadly it turns out to be the other way round. Focusing more than half of the running time in glib romance, there are some funny moments between the main characters that are enjoyable but the development of the plot has wasted several important thought provoking themes - controversy of the suffering between the disabled and the people around, struggle to live and find courage to regain confidence with physical impairment, sensitive subject on committing suicide and self willingness to survive as well as care, support and inspiration from a true love. Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin deliver their performance well while the choices of songs are pretty beautiful including the powerful scores composed by Craig Armstrong yet all these are unable to compensate the poor character and relationship developments. Perhaps the story should have reorganized by adding on more depth into the sufferings of the handicap, further converting into some positive inspirations rather than just steamrolling the value of life.</fullReview>
