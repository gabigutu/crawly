		<shortDescription>An ambitious but flawed film that is average at best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regrettably, the great genre of film that is the Western struggles mightily in our present time. Most Westerns are now low-budget, like The Duel, but that does not mean that it should be written off (I was pleasantly surprised that the recent release Forsaken was a decent Western). There are some positives in this film, yet negatives are rampant and I will note the primary ones.This film features a decent cast and an interesting story which involves an investigation surrounding missing people and an occult leader that has come to control the hearts and minds of the people of a small Texas town. However, besides a respectable performance by Liam Hemsworth, the cast is mediocre and forgettable with Woody Harrleson topping the list as being a cliché villain with forgettable, pretentious faux-intellectual dialogue.The action is average at best, and above all else there is a feeling that the writers or producers wanted to inject their opinion regarding the current treatment of Mexicans (something a reviewer on Roger Ebert's website noted) into a script already bogged down with murder, missing persons, revenge, a husband-wife relationship, a mysterious town, and a religious occult leader. It is subtle. However, it seemed out of place and unnecessary but that does not stop Hollywood from forcing a narrative or agenda into a movie, does it?Overall, this is a movie that had promise, but sub-par acting and a feeling that it did not know which plot point should receive the most attention weakened the film as a whole. If you like Westerns, you may find it more alluring because of the genre. Nevertheless, it is a one time watch that struggles and does not contribute anything of great worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Top Five Positives: 1.) Story moves like a Louis L'Amour western novel - fast &amp; hard. 2.) Actors do a fine performance. Nice job Kerry Cahill. 3.) Scenery, costumes, and props seem authentic. 4.) If you're into blood count, there's enough to slake your thirst. 5.) Interesting timing of release with political tensions around Mexican immigrants.Top Negatives: 1.) Woody can't act. His character is the same in every movie/show since Cheers. 2.) Hey! It's Jim from the Office, what's he doing here? 3.) Wait. Is this the short story "The Most Dangerous Game"? 4.) Snake handler church were in Appalachia not Texas. 5.) There's no compelling reason for Marisol to leave her husband. Likewise, there are several scenes that show Kingston's passionate love for his wife but he leaves her behind. Incongruity. 6.) Double tap all zombies. Who doesn't finish off a villain? - Dumb movie characters, that's who. Don't worry though, a surprise "cavalry" saves the day. Who sits next to a villain and falls asleep? Step back a few yards, Son. 7.) The protagonist, Kingston, is a confused little boy. He says, "I'm not here for my dad, I'm a Texas Ranger" but at the end, he goes off into the woods as a sort of lost soul and doesn't return to report in at the Ranger's office. I get Rambo going off into the jungle b/c he's disillusioned with the government. What is this poor protagonist wrestling with in his head that he'd leave the and love of his life and job after winning the battle? The weight of Kingston's soul doesn't add up with the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Acting's as fine as you can except it from someone with talent just phoning it in for another paycheck.The script is a piece of sh*t.The plot's thin, shaky character motivations established by shitty exposition, nothing is really resolved (or for that matter, even interesting). Turns out the villain's kinda vilanious. Turns out the hero's just the sort of meathead you'd root for. At the end, a lot more people are dead, but really, none of them seemed to have any redeeming qualities at all. Also, the terrible deus ex machina at the end really ruins it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Total Waste of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat through to the end. It deserves two stars for that. But what a muddle of a movie. Some of the ideas were good--mysterious town, Texas ranger sent undercover to investigate. Weird religious guy and slightly spooky people all clearly under his spell. That was all reasonably done. But... where do I start with the rest? You know a movie is going to go seriously downhill when it's clearly promoting an agenda from the get-go. Wives in the late nineteenth century didn't go about with their hair cascading down their backs. Sure, the actress might have liked the look, but it's jarring. Then when asked if she's religious, she replies, "I'm spiritual?" Huh? So anachronistic that I almost stopped watching there and then, but I stuck with it. Then she forces her Texas ranger husband to take her on his undercover mission. Huh? (Again) Maybe next movie they make we'll have a Navy Seal taking his wife with him on a mission. Why not? A woman must be just as capable as a guy who's fought his whole life on the border, been in the Indian wars, as well as the war with Mexico and is now a trained Texas ranger. But it's all cool. Let's not forget the agenda...Of course he'd take her. So, they get to the spooky town and for no reason whatsoever she turns against the husband and takes up with the old, weird, bald religious guy. I'd have gone off him the moment he handed me a snake (yes, snake handlers in Texas), but hey, what do I know? At the end she appears to be sucked into a sort of house for the black-clad widows. Hey, I'd given up trying to understand this mess of a movie by then. There were one or two bits that kept me watching -- some great vigilante moments; people getting shot in the face, that kind of thing. And thank God for tiny, half-dressed girls. One saved the hero's life at the end. Sheesh. They don't make Westerns like they used to, do they? Oh, wait, they do. The Salvation: a Western as they should be made. Go watch, then weep for this utter garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We cannot separate ourselves from sin anymore than we can sever a limb from our bodies." There has been a rash of unexplained deaths In the small town of Helena, Texas. With no clue as to what is going on, David Kingston (Hemsworth), a Ranger is sent to investigate. When he arrives he discovers some strange characters including Abraham (Harrelson). The more David investigates the more he questions what is happening. This is a movie that had a chance to be really good. The cast is A-list and the plot is interesting. Where the movie fails is the pacing. This is just agonizingly slow that it made it really hard to pay attention to and I was really starting to drift and lose interest in. There are some interesting parts in this but a lot of the drama was lost on me because I struggled to stay involved in what was going on. Overall, a disappointing western that had a chance to be good but was just too slow and boring for me to get invested in. I give this a C-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>woody does it for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good film that ticks all the boxes in all the right places. It's not exactly fast paced but it's always moving forward. The actors all do their part and Harrelson runs the show. I like Harrelson A LOT so i may be a bit biased with any movie that's got him in it. BUT this film did need him and he really does play this kind of role well. It's his eyes letting you into his soul.It's a good circular kind of movie. I wonder if the spiritual side of things could have been explored more or if that would have deviated away from the plot. I mean i really wanted to know some things about how Harrelson is so nutty. However, the fact that it doesn't delve too much into it keeps you thinking and lets you draw your own conclusions as the movie moves along at a bit of a trot. It does gallop at times and those are the best moments. Someone is going to get shot. A good western genre style movie with the added mysticism of Woody's crazy-self. How to end a movie like this? Ride off into the woods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty boss Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think most people would have expected more form a movie starring Woody Harrison and Liam Hemsworth,both who were in The Hunger Games together, but it was a pretty plain, low budget kind of thing that happen to have a really good story to it. Hemsworth plays a Texas Ranger who is sent after a man killing Mexicans in a small town he runs, and just by coincidence, this same man killed his father 20 years ago in a strange ritual of code of honor from the town they are from. Making matters worse is the fact that this Texas Ranger brings with him his Mexican Wife just because she complained about having nothing to do around the house while he's gone, and she ends up being put under the religious spell this man has got on some of the townsfolk.Hemsworth plays a decent cowboy. Not as dashing as his older brother, Chris as he goes for more of the Clint Eastwood type. Woody Harrison is a good villain in the film. It's similar to his work in the film, Out of the Furnace.But I really like the grim story that the Western told about the treatment of the Mexicans after the borderline for Texas was created.Overall it was a brilliant western that had no frills just a great story with some good actors telling the tale</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrelson and Hemsworth Are Both Excellent in Psycho-Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, "The Duel" is a classical western in the style of "High Noon." But the main interest in not the traditional melodrama of hero and villain. Rather, it is a subtle psychological drama that explores deeper personal values in the two leading characters.Woody Harrelson is good as a character known as "The Preacher." He is a megalomaniac who has exerted his charisma and total control over a small town in Texas in the post-Civil War years. The traditional "stranger" who rides into town is a Texas Ranger, and the role is given a fine, understated performance by Liam Hemsworth.The twist on this familiar plot is that the Texas Ranger is on a secret mission to spy on The Preacher, who has been wantonly killing Mexicans who have crossed over the border. But Hemsworth's character David has a second interest in The Preacher, who killed his father two decades earlier.The film is effective in offering some depth to David's motives. Is he a dedicated Texas Ranger performing his job, or is his true motivation to revenge his father's death? The film never completely answers that question, but leaves it to the viewer to decide.But there are other loose ends in the film that are both unresolved and confusing. The depiction of David's marriage to his wife Marisol is never fully developed in the film. Marisol was wedded to David without her consent when her father's life was saved by David. At the beginning, it appears as though they have a happy marriage. But the transformation of Marisol, who is won over to the side of The Preacher, seemed strained and unconvincing. And the film never even bothered to wrap up the narrative by informing the audience of what happened to Marisol! Obviously, "The Duel" is not a perfect film. The historical backdrop of the development of Texas in the mid-nineteenth century was also superficial. It was almost as if the film could have been set in any historical period with a different set of costumes. Still, it is worth seeing for the excellent work in cinematography and the two fine performances of Harrelson and Hemsworth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not for everyone Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Texas Ranger David Kingston (Helmsworth) is sent undercover to a Texas town to investigate why Mexicans are turning up dead. What you will see: Marisol (Alice Braga), David's wife, insisting she go with David on his undercover mission, bloody hand-to-hand fighting, a variation of The Most Dangerous Game, a town under the grip of Cult Leader Abraham (Harrelson), an unexplained betrayal, a prayer meeting where snakes are handled by everyone, and pure racism.I was overjoyed at the prospect of seeing another western, but I didn't expect the cruelty. This has to do with a variation of The Most Dangerous Game and you will be as shocked as I was. I am always surprised at some of the really sick things people do to others. There seems to be a tendency for Hollywood to go beyond normal good guy- bad guy plots and this is what we get. The acting all around is very good, but we didn't expect the script to center around a variation of The Most Dangerous Game. This is where a good western turns into something not so good. And the unexpected betrayal seemed well out of place. (Aren't betrayals always unexpected?)Notables: William Sadler as Governor Ross; Emory Cohen as Isaac, Abraham's brother; Raphael Sbarge as Dr. Morris; and Sue-Lynn Ansari as the Saloon Woman. Sad to say, but this is a not for everyone Western. (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, some not too often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't find a single redeeming quality for this movie- maybe there were some in the final 45 minutes or so that I decided weren't worth my time to watch. I started with reasonable expectations with opening scene knife-fight, although it also lacked the attention to detail we've come to expect from well-shot scenes with today's technology. Here's what was bad to horrific: Acting(Hemsworth appeared to reading cue cards and was wooden and shallow; Harrelson completely unbelievable and seemed to really be acting only to bolster his wackadoodle personal life legacy),script-dialogue, pace, premise. Other than that, a fine effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wanted To Take a Shower When it Was Over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in 19th century Texas, this very deliberately paced film does offer an air of tension throughout, and the two leads Liam Hemsworth and Woody Harrelson are well cast. However, as we find out answers to why certain things are happening, I felt the movie took on a real sicko flavor, that was most distasteful to me.Hemsworth portrays a decorated Texas Ranger who is being sent on a dangerous undercover assignment to try and find out why many Mexicans are being found murdered near a small border town. The town is run by a psychopath preacher (Harrelson), who killed Hemsworth's father in a challenge knife fight, some 22 years before.However, when all is revealed, and it's obviously intentionally racist, it went way beyond my own particular tolerance levels, and just seemed to want to elicit shock value to the audience.Overall, as mentioned, when this seriously violent film was over it just left a bad taste in my mouth and I felt like I wanted to take a shower afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A versatile plot carried well by two renowned actors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(The only spoiler in this review is in the fourth paragraph) The Duel is a low budget western starring two big actors. I personally really enjoyed the movie. I felt at the beginning it was very slow paced, and this may be the case for the majority of the film. However this slow pace is necessary for the plot building at the start, which evolves into tension filled scenes that have a great action filled release.With the revival of western movies recently, I feel there are some high expectations and people want the same thrilling response to the movies of this genre that used to be achieved in the golden age of western movies upheld by John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. I feel these expectations are what prevents people from enjoying simple enjoyable movies like The Duel.The movies plot is a very common one of protagonist vs antagonist, you can see this from the movie poster. However the story behind this plot, and witnessing the relationship between the two key characters evolve in this movie is full of tension, suspense and mystery. Liam Hemsworth and Woody Harrelson both deliver convincing performances and accents. Woody Harrelson's character in particular is a villain which the movies mystery revolves around. (spoiler in this paragraph)Although the movie is not without its flaws. The movie is successful in achieving mystery, however, Woody Harrelson's character, 'The Preacher', is the component of the story from which a lot of the mystery and suspense is resourced from. There are rumors surrounding him one of which is that "He is touched by God". His divine powers are never really evident except when he knows the protagonists true identity, and his interaction with 'Marisol' (the protagonists wife). I don't know if he knew David's (the protagonist) identity the whole time. I can't tell if he is the reason for Marisol's fever, why he is so interested in her, why she ends up turning on her husband and what happens to her when David leaves. At the end is she the preachers new wife? And why was she so allured to the preacher after he first visited her, does that weird symbol he painted on his eye have something to do with it or did he seduce her?. It's just that there is no clear cause for these events and no clear answer to the end result. You don't know if The Preacher has powers, or if he just brainwashes the town and the cult he leads into believing it. It is one small aspect that I just have too much curiosity towards, and it spoiled the movie on me slightly. The only other curiosity I have is the ending; David goes off into the brush and isolation and no one knows why.(spoilers over) Other than the issues I addressed above, I really enjoyed the movie and was really engaged throughout. I feel that's the key with this movie, if you can stay attentive and pick up on the small details throughout, the action filled ending is a larger pay off and a more satisfying release of tension. I wouldn't say this is a movie I loved so much that I really want to see it a second time, but it is definitely worth the watch. Although if you don't like slow building plots and get bored easily in movies, this one may not be engaging enough, but if you like western movies, action (pretty violent), and suspense, then I think you will definitely enjoy The Duel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a short review because it is a simple adaptation. Like Outland was High Noon in space, The Duel is Apocalypse Now in the old West.I will admit that I am a big fan of Woody Harrelson. As usual, he does not disappoint.The rest of the cast is passable. There are faces here and there that you will recognize, but otherwise it seems the money on this movie was spent on Harrelson and Hemsworth. Honestly, I cannot tell if the writing is not particularly engrossing or if it seems uninspired because we know the story.Either way, if you want a fast paced Western, this is not for you. If you want a slow, methodical and unnecessarily convoluted story featuring a good actor...you might like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrelson bad copy of Brando</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a pity for Mr. Woody Harrelson that Marlon Brando made the Colonel Kurtz a lot of years before ("Apocalypse Now", 1979), otherwise his play could appears with a shade of originality. The copy of some camera shots doesn't help too much. The argument about a soldier/ranger sent to take control over a miscarried colonel/general with another environment, may appear as something original for people that have no idea about previous film making, and the efforts of Harrelson to build a character bounces against the solid brick wall built by Brando. If it was intended to do an homage to Coppola and his film, well, actor and director fails badly.</fullReview>

Very fun.They need to make more Westerns these days, the times, men, women, culture, heck, even the landscape was entirely different. A simpler time with rough rules for those out in the bush and disconnected from the bigger towns of their day.Nice to see a decent Western vigilante movie made, once again. The acting was superb and a very nice mix of revenge, justice, betrayal and action.

		<shortDescription>High Quality Modern western with Woody and Hemsworth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie truly deserves an eight, but I am pumping it up because it has such a low score. Well, first of all, I am a fan of Woody and of Westerns, so that sort of explains my enthusiasm with this movie. But, there are flaws, and because criticism is much more interesting than compliments, I'll start with those just after a brief summary. Texas ranger is sent to investigate the killings of numerous Mexicans, close to the border with Texas at Rio Grande (this is set around the time there were land disputes between Mexicans and Americans). He is told that these deaths may or may not be due to a ruthless man which the ranger knows to be the same that has killed his father in the past when he was just a boy. He takes his wife with him and soon learns that the ruthless man is a small town's preacher and that everyone living there is pretty much under his influence. Liam Hemsworth plays the Texas ranger and I have to say his acting is spot on to what you would expect from this character. Harrelson, while no Brando (which would have been awesome in something like this), is very entertaining playing the part and rightly appears first in the movie's opening credits. To be a fair judge, I do think Woody could have taken the opportunity given to him in this movie to further explore the range of his acting capabilities. Alice Braga, although a Brazilian like me, falls short of doing anything memorable or even a believable role playing.. The script is kind of a hit and miss. On the upside, there is lots of action which makes perfect sense as the story unfolds. On the downside, there are many facts that doesn't make much sense like (spoiler alert): why was the woman so sick, and why would she be so influenced by the preacher? Ultimately, why did the ranger decide to take his wife with him? Ending my review with the movie's positives. Characters were well written, above average acting, very nice costumes and overall recreation of the time period. The score is very good and leads whoever is watching to the moments of tension. The way the two main characters stand out from the rest is very meaningful, and is purposefully portrayed so that the focus of the movie remains in its title, "the duel" between these two men. They are very different, but when it comes to acting under stress they behave in a very similar manner: they become savage beasts. And few things are more entertaining than watching a high quality modern western with Woody and Hemsworth on opposing sides, both animals waiting for something to trigger their savage side. They both know it will soon happen.</fullReview>

This is a GREAT western movie. It's a good strong story, although not entirely original, its stands up well. The acting is very good, Liam Hemsworth I thought was very convincing after originally thinking he was going to be a bit crap, how wrong I was, he was brilliant and played the role very well. There are a couple of slightly wooden bits from bit part players but that's to be expected I think! Of course you know what you're going to get from Woody Harrelson, he was also excellent.

		<shortDescription>Straight cut with no frills for the ride on the edge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns for me is such a distinctive genre as owing to a specific time in history and being rooted in its universal themes that has been explored almost exhaustively.It's surprising then that one should come along with a kick to the teeth in the guise of a movie that's packaged lightly in terms of visuals and score. The story follows a young ranger and spouse as he has to face a man, who killed his father in a duel in the past, and now reigns supreme in a small town near the Mexican border.Harrelson is cut out for this role as a man who is on a self-righteous path of carrying out the will of the divine by means of brutality and chances of fate. He is a force to be reckoned with and overshadows all else around him but Hemsworth's Kingston is well versed himself in taking the law into his own hands. Almost too mechanical by way of showing how it's done but believe you me it's a slice of justice being dished out, nothing fancy, and enough to sit you down.The intrigue of spirituality that leads people on down a dark road is only touched upon as being an inexplicable power that makes few connections with the actual clandestine going ons that has brought the characters at odds with one another. Something as easily abused is often mistaken for something else but no one could possibly deviate from the course when Harrelson's fierce eyes are keeping watch.</fullReview>

It is really difficult to apprehend this was once America, I mean who would of ever thought God could ever bless this Sodom and Gomorrah hell-hole not less than a hundred or so years. Whores, chemical euphoria, gambling, killing, robbing, plundering, slavery, God really blessed this place? Jesus! The racism alone is so thick its palpably cognizant. The film was a true masterpiece that should last amidst the great in time immemorial. The rhythm and ca dance felt like an eerie dream wading through the welter of god-awful people as we get a feel of what its like to lope on a big horse at random intervals, with no particular aim, doubtless for the sole aim of a lil' entertainment as the footfalls leave the horseshoes muddy. If you are fortunate enough to chilax and watch this flix, do yourself a favor take whatever creepy elixir Woody has for you, and just relax and open up your mind with a lil' snakey religion and accept this work of art for what it is, what it is trying so delicately but so profoundly attempting to say. There is no way in one viewing one can grasp it all but in time and a lil' musing, perhaps a lil' writing on this masterpiece and one can come to terms with some of the most enigmatic questions which fall at our feet today, lest fear keep you from entering into such endeavors. I don't think I can get past the racism, the bigotry, the slavery, the dehumanizing of women, the everything! So for me, it will just be one viewing, but I tell you, it was awesome!</fullReview>
