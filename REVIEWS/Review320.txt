		<shortDescription>Not bad at all once you get pass the fact that all the kids are annoying stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Strung was not the movie I planed to see, but the projector was broken on the movie I paid money for and I had limited options, so I gave it a try thinking the movie was this generation's version of Fame, but it looks and feels more like a spin-off of the Step-Up Franchise. First off, I really need to vent on how ticked I was that they thought Romania was a good replacement for Manhattan. This vent is actually important to the film's content cause as unrealistic as it is to see young and poor college students living in a Loft that looks like it cost 500 dollars a minute to live in, it really annoys me that this is suppose to be the poor rough section of Manhattan. I would not want any upcoming dancers to see this movie filled with stock footage of New York Landscapes inter cut with Eastern European streets and be inspired to come to the city and find the same thing.One of the lead characters named Johnny Blackwell is a Brit who was inspired to come to New York to be a violinist. This character was kind of lame. He was a pretty white boy with a chip on his soldier who wanted to bring the Violin into contemporary times, as if though no one has ever done that before, His Edgy attitude made no sense for a dude living in such a seller loft in Manhattan. Maybe it was the Multi ethic dance troop he live above that ticked him off. These cats were living and breathing dance. The only character that did not annoy me when she first came on the screen was Johnny's love interest, a good girl ballerina similar to Julia Styles in Save the Last Dance, who is at an art school in Manhattan on a dance scholarship. They were smart to keep whatever background on the character short, because the little I knew the more I like.Then came the point in the film when a "dangerous" street gang got into a break dance battle with a group of New York city Construction workers, and that's when I realized, I'm taking this movie far too seriously.I realized that all I'm doing is watching a large dance recital being composed with string instruments, just like the recital at the end of the movie, which Johnny enters at the end of the film to use the cash money to stay in the country. Once I got that into my head I began to enjoy the movie for what it was.It was fun to watch the dance numbers, this combination of ballet and modern dance, once again the concept is not original, but they had some cool dance routines going on.I wish I could say that I loved the sting instrument part as much as I loved the dancing, but more so, I really respect that High Strung seemed to use more original composing than contemporary radio hits, which is far better.So in the end, I could not help but to laugh out loud in my seat at the Archetype characters (They even had the spoiled little rich girl with dark hair who hated the blonde good girl and the preppy White dude who thought he was better than "street hood" white boy because he had money (did I mention Johnny has a cute little beauty mark on top of his puffy lips?), but the main focus is on the dancing mixed with the music, and that was enjoyable</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A budgeted version of all the parts of step up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer and it was of the genre i liked and so i thought, why not, let's give it a try. I knew going in that it would similar to all the dance movies that i have seen but boy oh boy i was disappointed. The lead male tries to play an angry guy but utterly fails. It is a big competition with 25 grand prize money and scholarship but only three teams enter it (sign me in the next one dude) :P Even in center stage turn it up we saw how big the competition was.... The room mate is very badly depicted. One minute she is continuously partying the next minute she is all redeemed after hearing that all we dancers do is dance, lol. I can write a better script than that guys. And the dance crew had no ambitions? It's like they were all sleeping and one day someone said you should enter this competition and they just accepted. I mean making a name for themselves shouldn't they be on the look out for these sort of events in the first place? And how does the lead actor even get the gig? I mean shouldn't it be university students only or such. Even step up had to show that the guy was spending his community service hours. And the crew did not go to the university either. The acting, the directing all of it sucks. You would do well to avoid this one. I assure you i am a fan of these dance movies and even i consider my time wasted by this one. Save the 96 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that make you look at the cast &amp; crew list to see if the actors and directors/producers are related because there is no way that his movie is actually good. At all.As another review said, these "poor" dance school kids live in ridiculous lofts in Manhattan. I mean gorgeous. And even the ones with multiple teens living in them are spotless. Seriously, they would be cramped dark and filthy if this were true to form.There's a scene with a West Side Story wannabe dance "fight". Even the subway platform that this took place on had floors so clean and shiny, there's no way anyone ever urinated on them. Smh. The acting was atrocious, the music playing was truly horrifying at time. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars and not 1 is because I think the downstairs dancers were pretty good.It was a really poor version of a compilation of Save the Last Dance, Step Up, and Stomp the Yard.Final note: this may just be an homage to the fact the the main female character, ruby, can pull her leg past her head. Because she does that gratuitously and often. Ugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a gem of a film. I wasn't expecting much when I hit the 'Play' button, but as I kept watching, I was surprised at how good it turned out to be. It was predictable at times and yet I found myself still rooting for the main characters. Have you ever started watching a movie and during the opening credits, you start scrolling through your cell phone? That's what I did in the beginning. After hearing the music, I looked up, put my cell phone down and stared enjoying the scenery in the 1st few minutes. I was hooked after that. If you have seen a lot of dance movies (Step-up, Save the Last Dance, Stomp the Yard) I suggest you give this film a chance. It might surprise you, like it did me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Underdog Story with 'Refreshments'!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a surprisingly interesting movie with beautiful dancing and music playing, which (music playing) I have been solely missing in other such movies. It is the classic underdog story but with new and fresh moments. The violin was amazing and the movie's ballet-oriented dancing delightful and strong. Of course the boy-meets-girl-and-they-fall-in-love cliché was present but no major "tragedy" between the main leads was portrayed right before 'the decisive moment', and that was both refreshing and much appreciated. Additionally, there was no big drama around joining the competition and the crew did not fight.The final dance was astonishing, so beautiful for both the eyes and the ears, I was at a loss of words!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable and Inspiring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a well worn genre and story line. There have been many other dance movies with the same set up. Unlike others, the main dance character played by Keenan Kampa is the real deal. Unlike Flashdance, in which the climactic dance scene actually too three different people to pull off (a male hip hop dancer, an Olympic gymnast and a dancer), Keenan is the real deal. That's what made the movie for me. The Brit is a heavy character played weakly, Keenan's delivery is a bit too soft and sweet and there is certainly no Black Swan drama. Nonetheless, I feel the artistry, I connected with the desire to be different in a world expecting compliance and the final competition scene is worth the wait. The music is great and the dancing wonderful. There is no doubt, this movie is playing to a main stream audience. It is careful to avoid anything too cruel, rude or violent. So what, I enjoyed to scenery, the dancing and the music. Be inspired even if it is predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yo, we need more hip hop violinists!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's right, yo! Hip-Hop violin is where it's at! It's dope. And fresh! Funky street style, yo, and down with the old-school.I'm glad to see that they FINALLY made a film about this highly under-rated hip-hop instrument. Cause...it's all about Hip-Hop, dawgs! Hip-Hop saved my life. Hip-Hop has always had its fingers on the pulse! Which is saying a lot, cause it doesn't actually have fingers. But that's the monstrous and overpowering strength of Hip-Hop! Hip-hop can, should, and WILL be applied to each and every form of expression which exists. It's already taken over dancing, music, poetry, and fashion, and Hip-Hop isn't done yet! No it isn't! Not be a long shot, beeeeeeeyaches! Hip-Hop's next hostile takeover will be food! That's right, no more boring dishes, Hip-Hop is going to throw its own unique style of gravy all over that ancient food your granny liked.But wait, Hip-Hop ain't even CLOSE to being done yet. Noe what's next? Finance! Yep yep, the world of money bout to go Hip-Hop, y'all. Are you ready? You betta be! Trips to the bank will never be the same. Hope you got yo baggy pants on.And just when you though Hip-Hop was tired, and needed a tall glass of iced grape drink, it's gonna do a back-flip and infect gynaecology with its immense and tart flavor, my nukka's! No more boring-azz trips to the doctor, after Hip-Hop revolutionizes the current and stale snatch-quakery!And why? For what?Hip-Hop don't have to answer yo dumb questions, so stop askin! Soon, everything will be Hip-Hop. Everything you do, say, feel, ask, and imagine will conform to the Hip-Hop regime. Hip-Hop wont stop until there isn't a single thing under the Hip-Hop sun which isn't ruled by Hip-Hop.Don't resist Hip-Hop, it is futile.Have a wonderful Hip-Hop day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank goodness someone finally made a dance film that fits the bill as entertaining, artsy and family friendly. The two leads (Keenan Kampa and Nicholas Galitzine) are new comers to Hollywood but they do a wonderful job, have amazing chemistry and are certainly attractive to gaze at! I especially enjoyed all the twists and turns of the plot but the dance is what really shines in this film! There are numerous styles of dance from Hip Hop to Tango, Irish Dance and Ballet. It is rare that a movie can capture dance but the scenes are brilliantly edited and directed so that you feel emotionally connected. The original score is an integral part of this movie and it weaves it's way through the film in a seamless blend of classical and current music. The final dance scene will have you cheering and crying while you are on the edge of your seat! I was really surprised that even my husband flipped over this film. If you want to see a wonderful "feel good" movie that is appropriate for the entire family, you will be in for a treat with High Strung!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I recommend you to watch this *-*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best movie I watched this year, and I've watched a lot! The acting isn't really satisfying since they seem acting; the main actress and few of the sub-actors aren't really fluent (speaking of acting here).Now,the plot is good, little bit predictable, but very good for a romance-drama-musical movie. At the beginning, the movie seemed familiar and I almost stopped watching it, but the main actor is just cute *-* and after around 30 minutes, some twists appeared, and it became really interesting to watch. The pop dance steps, the violin musics and the ballerina swings were all good, original and different since the main instrument is the violin.I rated it by 9 stars because after the magnificent last performance, I wished they lost to change the routine of THE MAIN CHARACTERS ALWAYS WIN, but they didn't, and they won. Surprisingly, and as much as it was expected to see them win, I was so happy when they were announced as winners. It is what the end made me feel that made me rate it by 9 stars. You will enjoy watching it, if you're the type who likes fluffy cute stuff. PS: it is the material you would watch with your family, it has only few kissing scenes.</fullReview>
