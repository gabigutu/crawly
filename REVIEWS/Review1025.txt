		<shortDescription>Enormously Funny And Surprisingly Touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know most people who love PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen are furious about this movie even existing, let alone being successful. But I actually liked it a lot!I know the original classic fairly well (I'm a former high school English teacher and a current college librarian) and I was astonished almost from the very beginning at how much of the dialogue comes direct from Jane Austen's novel. All of the issues that really matter and the conflicts that draw the reader into the novel are still very much alive in the movie. It's just that they are juxtaposed against the horror of the walking dead. I can't say enough about the good looking young (and not so young) cast members. I was absolutely blown away by how seriously Lily James and Sam Riley took the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Both of them are so skilled at projecting courage and integrity combined with deep feelings and hidden pain. They never seem silly even when they're doing very silly things, i.e. cutting each others' clothes to bits in a sword fight. Bella Heathcote and Douglas Booth as Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley are almost as good, and I have to say, visually they are absolutely perfect as the characters from Jane Austen's novel. And the supporting players are absolutely outstanding! You just cannot go wrong with Charles Dance as Mr. Bennett. His performance is exactly what you would hope for in a serious adaptation. Though that's true of every actor in the cast, really. Lena Headey is an exquisite Lady Catherine DeBurgh, though her character is ultimately just a little more sympathetic towards Elizabeth than she is in the novel. Even Jack Huston, who has been a hero of mine ever since his epic role as disfigured World War One veteran Richard Harrow in BOARDWALK EMPIRE, is an effective villain as Mr. Wickham. Best of all is Matt Smith, who takes the thankless role of the hateful Mr. Collins and turns it into an irresistible Peter Sellers style comic explosion. He's that good. Let's face it, a Jane Austen zombie movie is not for everyone. But if you're willing to be open minded and you enjoy great acting, comedy and romance, this just might be for you. The sword fights are exciting, the love scenes (including the arguments) are authentically romantic, and the blood and guts are never really that gross. Oh, and if you do go and see the movie, make sure to stay through the closing credits, because the last joke of the film is really the best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so fun and so campy. Is it winning any awards?...no. But the acting is good. It's got a great cast and they do a really good job. I was very pleasantly surprised with Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.It's a romance. It's horror. It's comedy.Go for the fun of it and don't take it seriously. This is not a classic Victorian novel and this is not a true tale of zombies like most die hard zombie fans think of them (ie. The Walking Dead or the more classic Night of the Living Dead). I am a true zombie lover. I loved "28 Days Later", "The Walking Dead", "Zombieland", etc. This is not one of those, so if you don't expect to see that when you go to this movie, I think you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My disclaimer is this: I tend to rate a bit high because I rate almost purely on how much I enjoyed a film; I'm as far from a critic or 'movie snob' as one could possibly be. My rating reflects pure enjoyment and if it's worth spending the money to see at the theater. In my opinion, it is!The movie is truly Pride and Prejudice...and Zombies; it follows the basic outline of the P&amp;P novel, even some of the same dialog, but throws in zombies. Personally, I loved the book and I loved the Keira Knightly film and I will admit it took me about 10 minutes or so to adjust to what I was seeing; but I quickly became immersed. The action is very well done and if you're a fan of women being in charge in an action movie then you will really like this!If you're a fan of Matt Smith then this is a MUST SEE, i've never watched Doctor Who, I'm not a fan of him (just b/c I haven't seen him in things) but he stole every scene he was in, he was excellent. I purposely try to keep my reviews vague so as not to give anything away; the bottom line is this: if you're in the mood for a fun night with a movie with a crazy premise and some good action then I highly recommend it!I am quite surprised by the low rating currently (5.4); I imagine it is people who don't like seeing the novel turned into something with zombies. At the end of the screening I was attending there was audience applause and everyone genuinely seemed to enjoy it!p.s. the current voting breakdown has 18%(!) of 1 votes! So take that into consideration.p.s. if you don't like horror, I personally wouldn't classify this as "horror" but more "action"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't listen to the bad reviews!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really feel like the people that rated this movie poorly either didn't see the movie and just wanted to give it bad press, or had no idea what the movie was about. The acting and effects of the movie were beyond my expectations, and as far as the storyline, it was Pride and Prejudice. I love the book and movie Pride and Prejudice, I also love zombie movies so this movie was the perfect fit for me. That being said, I feel that this movie would appeal to anyone who enjoys the zombie genre. I had a lot of fun during this movie, I was pleased that it didn't take itself seriously, yet I enjoyed the depth of the characters. I equally laughed and jumped at the shocking moments throughout this movie, and enjoyed every moment. I also must include that I almost didn't see this movie, because of the bad reviews. However, I am very glad that I didn't listen, because I feel like since this is a beloved classic book with zombies people may be upset that this movie was made in the first place. I am a huge Jane Austen fan, I find it a refreshing fun take on the storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddly enough... very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This honestly surprised me. It goes without saying I was not expecting much from this movie. I have seen various Pride and Prejudice movies before today and did not enjoy any of them out of sheer boredom. Nothing against those movies or their quality but it just wasn't my kind of movie. I assumed that this would be no different and that it would just be the same exact story with a few zombies sprinkled in. And to an extent, it was exactly that, but there was much more depth to the zombie plot than I anticipated. The zombies were a very large part of the story and even when there was romantic drama there was still a close focus on the zombie aspect. There is always that underlying tension that zombies will strike. The visuals were not the best but were still very well done. The make-up and effects for the zombies were much higher quality than I thought they would be. And the atmosphere kept a good mix of an old Pride and Prejudice feel while also adding a new element of dark zombie-apocalypse tension that I loved seeing. There were a few parts that I rolled my eyes at, especially when things got a bit too dramatic between the lead characters Darcy and Elizabeth, but all in all it was a good movie that I enjoyed. Very surprised to say I give this movie an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. For those high school Literature teachers struggling to get their students to embrace the classics from writers like Jane Austen, this movie won't help much. However, chances are good that those same students will enjoy this blending of 19th century British class warfare with "The Walking Dead" ? likely one of their favorite shows. The zombie apocalypse has landed in the middle of Austen's prim and proper story, including the repressed attraction between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.Anyone expecting the serious undertones of Ms. Austen's1813 novel will be disappointed ? but the title should have provided a pretty solid hint. While her characters and general story line act as a structure here, it's really based on Seth Grahame-Smith's YA hit novel ? delivering zombie battles and often zany humor. Burr Steers (Igby Goes Down) directs his own adapted screenplay and seems to really be having a great time ? right along with his talented cast. The sets, costumes, dialogue and fight scenes work together to create an unusual movie experience that will generate plenty of laughs while not dwelling on the zombies or violence (it is PG-13). Expect most critics to destroy this one because it's made simply for fun, not for art.Of course, any Pride and Prejudice spin-off (even one with zombies) must pay particular attention to Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. It turns out that Elizabeth and her four sisters are highly trained warriors raised to survive against the undead. It's even clearer for Mr. Darcy as he is billed as a zombie hunter and protector of Mr. Bingley, the rich bachelor hooked on Jane Bennett. Things get muddled by the devious Mr. Wickham, a focused Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and especially the flamboyant fop Parson Collins. The interactions between these characters bounce between loyalty, romantic attraction, emotional turmoil and hand-to-hand combat ? with enough comedic elements that most viewers will find plenty of opportunities to laugh.The talented cast is all in. They play it mostly straight (with one major exception) to achieve the balance between somber and silly. Lily James ("Downton Abbey") and Sam Riley (On the Road, 2012) are both fun to watch as Elizabeth and Darcy. They are the film's best fighters ? both with swords and words. Bella Heathcoate (Dark Shadows, 2012) is "the pretty one" Jane, who is wooed by Douglas Booth (Noah, 2014) as Mr. Bingley. Lena Headey ("Game of Thrones") makes an impression in her limited screen time as an eye-patched Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and Jack Huston ("Boardwalk Empire") is well cast as Wickham. Screen veterans Charles Dance and Sally Phillips take on the role of parents to the five Bennett daughters, but it's Matt Smith ("Dr Who"), who turns the film on its ear with his unconventional twist on the oddball Parson Collins, who pretty much steals each of his scenes. He had those in the theatre laughing out loud more than a few times.Pity is the word that comes to mind for any young man who takes these Bennett girls to the prom ? or more likely to one of the societal balls. The weapons hidden under their formal gowns offer fair warning to zombies and handsy suitors alike. It's this element of strong women (physically and emotionally) that might even allow Ms. Austen to appreciate what's happened to her characters ? were she alive to see it.Even though the film offers plenty of fun with laughs and action and romance, let's hope it doesn't kick off a new zombie-adaptation trend. Here are a few titles that we hope never see the big screen: Sense and Sensibilities and Zombies, War and Peace and Zombies, Crime and Punishment and Zombies, The Old Zombie and the Sea, Wuthering Zombies, Romeo and Juliet and Zombies, and Alice's Adventure in Zombieland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very unexpected and entertaining movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Genreally, I like zombie movies a lot because of their post- apocalyptic vibe.Normally though, I find the genre comes in 2 distinct flavours; serious stuff like "28 Days/Weeks Later" or campy B flavoured offerings like "The Scouts Guide To The Apocalypse".This movie however defies the genre. The closest comparisons I could make would be "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" or "Penny Dreadful" but with more humour. It follows the story of Pride and Prejudice so closely I kept looking for Keira Knightly to appear.The production quality however is what surprised me the most; it's incredibly high with great sets, realistic costumes, lighting and cinematography. There was a lot of attention to detail.This is a very unique and interesting mash-up which I quite enjoyed. I am surprised it's not rated higher on IMDb but I believe it deserves a watch regardless.</fullReview>

The humor is depicted to the audience in a form that doesn't dumb down the dialogue. It's was brilliant and the cast was fluid. Extremely worth watching. The setting is perfect for the world our protagonist live in. The lore is tolerable. I personally distrust zombie movies however I enjoyed every second. Would recommend it to anyone looking to loose themselves in this wild piece of work. Truly a roller-coaster of fun. Please watch with an open mind and leave that pride and prejudice at home you zombie! #PPZ movie!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fully expected this film to be slightly underwhelming but possibly a bit of fun and I never read any reviews on here or elsewhere before watching it. It was very funny, witty and thoroughly absorbing. The acting was excellent - Matt Smith, as others have said is wonderful - and the production superb. The peculiarities of the novel are self evident and, when the zombie influences are absent, you could think you are watching another excellent version of Pride and Prejudice. I have now read many reviews on here and am pleased to find that many reviewers have given the film praise. The low score is disappointing so I can only assume that many people have just written off the film either not having watched it or are just trying to be clever and above it all. Some reviews I've read are really quite pompous in their approach. If you have an open mind, an imagination and, preferably a liking for both Austen and zombies you will find this film irresistible. I have noticed that some reviewers say this is just a Victorian / zombie romance. It's Georgian, more precisely Regency and, although a romance, is a story of manners. Great stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a zombie movie fan but I am a huge Matt Smith and Pride &amp; Prejudice fan so I felt the need to see Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies. I try to retain the image of MS as the Doctor so I haven't watched anything else he has played in but because the two afore mentioned worlds collided I HAD to see this movie and I was not disappointed! I found it easy to look around the obvious plot holes and simply enjoyed hearing the old familiar lines spoken in such a different setting/atmosphere with MS's performance being the icing on the cake. This movie is not award winning but it is very entertaining and I only had to look away a couple of times.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few zombies, much Jane Austen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly better than I expected, with few zombies, not too much blood and much Jane Austen. A fun (and quite accurate) adaptation of one of the iconic novels in English literature, with the variant of the threat of zombies, well-argued, and martial arts fights in which women are the protagonists. With good actors, actresses overwhelmingly beautiful, good settings, nice cinematography (beautiful atmosphere and lighting) and extraordinary locations ?it seems that some of them are the same than the 2005's «serious version» with Keira K.? and an open end that promises more blood, more battles and more zombies (though I doubt that the history can be stretched more). Very recommendable, at least as a curiosity very well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen is among the most beautiful romances ever. The 2005 cinema version directed by Joe Wright is a gem of the cinema industry. The bad taste and lack of respect of "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" by Burr Steers is impressive, destroying the wonderful romance with a brainless and silly version. However, the high-quality of the production, direction, performances, art direction, costumes and lighting is totally unexpected and unusual. It is conflictive, but my vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Orgulho e Preconceito e Zumbis" ("Pride and Prejudice and Zombies")</fullReview>

The material itself never really deviated much from what one would expect from the story (or so I've been told after discussing the film with friends who actually know the background story), so there's that.I thought the movie didn't take itself too seriously and that helped convey a sense of amusement.

		<shortDescription>Silly but Very Fun Movie, Jane Austen would be Proud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a bit of a surprise to me since I wasn't really expecting much from it. The trailers looked alright but I didn't know if it would be something that I would get into. I wouldn't go so far to say that it's an excellent film or anything like that but I did have a lot of fun with this one. The story is straight up ridiculous but if you go into it expecting a silly story with a little bit of action then I don't see any reason why you wouldn't enjoy yourself. The movie is directed by a guy named Burr Steers who, to be honest, I have no knowledge whatsoever of anything he has done in the past. Still, he did a decent job in my opinion. Let's talk about the plot.The title of the movie isn't just a reference to the time period. This story is literally a retelling of the original novel written by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and her sisters live in an alternate version of nineteenth century England where a zombie virus has forced the bulk of the populace behind a wall around London. Elizabeth and her sisters have trained in various styles of martial arts in order to survive in this world. Elizabeth is proud of her ability and refuses to succumb to the temptation of marriage unless her husband respects her wishes and allows her to continue to hone her skills. She soon meets a man named Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) who offends her pride and stands between a successful relationship between his best friend and Elizabeth's sister. Oh, and there are tons of zombies around that everyone occasionally fight against.I wouldn't call this the best cast I've ever seen but they do a decent enough job. Lily James gives us the haughtiness required of any good Elizabeth and she can also show off the fighting skills necessary to survive the zombie apocalypse. I also enjoyed Sam Riley's Mr. Darcy. Once again, nothing too spectacular but he gives a decent portrayal of the character. I like that they made him a bit unlikable which is how I imagined Mr. Darcy when I first read the novel in high school (the original, I mean). One character that does stand out to me is Matt Smith's portrayal of Parson Collins. I found this guy hilarious with they way he was able to make those around him cringe with his actions or just by saying whatever came into his head. He might actually be one of the best parts of the film.There are a lot of spooky looking forests in this movie that help to set the tone pretty well. I did find myself wondering why everyone keeps taking shortcuts through this ridiculously dangerous forest though. I really enjoyed the actual look of the zombies. The zombies that haven't eaten any human flesh yet actually retain the ability to speak which is really unsettling (and a bit comedic) from some of these creatures. The faces of some of them are straight up falling off the skull and they look surprisingly convincing.One thing that I wasn't aware of at first but this movie follows the original story very closely. I thought the title was just a reference to the time period but a lot of this film is straight up conversations made from Jane Austen. They just tweaked the plot to allow for all the zombies and other mayhem going on. I was surprised by this at first but it actually works well. The movie is still silly and is a bit difficult to take seriously but it does have some really fun parts to it. This obviously won't be for everyone but I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I do think it works even better to come into the film already having knowledge of the original story just so you can see how many things they changed and what they kept the same. I recommend it to fans of the original that just so happen to enjoy an average to good zombie flick. It kind of reminds me of that Victor Frankenstein movie that came out a little while ago. Not a fantastic film but still offers a fun time at the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jane Austen fans need not be afraid to see this movie! It was a delight-with much more focus on the Pride and Prejudice story than I expected or dared hope for. The zombies were almost a side story, rearing their ugly heads every once in awhile to be squashed in invigorating fight scenes where our Regency heroes and heroines were as scathing with swords as they typically are with word play. Elizabeth Bennet,admirably played by Lily James, was obviously cast for her Keira Knightley knock off looks. Darcy(Sam Riley) almost resembled a zombie himself with his pale shadowy under eye looks. The duo plays out a hilarious take on Darcy's awkward proposal scene. There is a surprising but interesting zombie oriented plot twist involving the scandalous Wickham that takes up the last quarter or so of the movie. Other than that deviation, I could've been watching a new BBC adaptation of my favorite story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brains, braaaaiiiiiins, and tons of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a truth universally acknowledged that no one really expected Pride and Prejudice and Zombies to be much good. Silly, campy fun, assuredly, but no more than an amusing trifle to mindlessly while away the passing moments. Well, anyone even fleetingly familiar with the works of Ms. Austen would know that to judge a book by its cover is exceedingly naughty, while anyone with passing knowledge of the zombie film would know that a surprising amount are replete with brains in more ways than one. Thus, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies haughtily thrusts its chin in the direction of naysayers, by boldly delivering all the silliness its title proclaims - only with the distinctly Mr. Darcy-like twist of bringing some of the best of its composite parts rather than what first impressions might suggest.For a film seemingly more akin to Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, from the director of two consecutive pieces of Zac Efron fluff,P&amp;P&amp;Z from its opening moments onward, for a film so intentionally campy and stupid, is surprisingly sharp and on-point. Rather than pumping the contrast between its two warring influences strictly for laughs, writer/director Burr Steers is astute enough to realize the laughs need not be forced, but come far more unreservedly by committing to the premise as sincerely as possible. If anything, the film's biggest gag is being more satisfying as an Austen adaptation than zombie flick, as there's nitpicking to be had with the film's P3-13 violence (although Steers gets as gleefully gory as he can within ratings parameters), and running/talking zombies alike. Still, the twinkling aristocratic wit of Austenian England and the weary gallows humour of an apocalyptic action flick blend surprisingly well into one another, and Steers' adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's loving riff taps into the meat of the story, allowing the slog of a zombie war to tease out and accentuate the key elements of Austen's satire and characterizations alike (and let's face it: social faux-pas are just so much more satisfying when underscored with cathartic flip-kicks and decapitations). The novel's most beloved moments (including a slick lampooning of the infamous 'Mr. Darcy white shirt' scene) and key lines are often paired with plucky physical sparring, amidst perfectly timed bloodbaths just when proceedings start to stray more into Pride and Prejudice than Zombies.But Steers doesn't stop there, germinating some surprisingly interesting subtext - subtle aristocratic class distinctions are determined by whether citizens receive their anti-zombie martial arts training in Japan or China, while a sliding scale of zombie sentience allows for a realm of gentrified xenophobia relatively untapped in the genre. It's a bit of a shame that such a genuinely excellent setup slides into somewhat of a disappointingly mundane finish, replete with muddy, abandoned 'Horsemen of the Apocalypse' mythology, and several subplots jumbling together in a messy and unsatisfying resolution. To see the dual climaxes of the novel's swooniness and the make-or-break mass showdown of the zombie war verge on face-planting rather than soaring is a bummer indeed. Still, Steers maintains such a confidently jaunty touch throughout, letting the ball dances lilt and the fight scenes crackle (including at least two unexpected, thunderously loud head shots which serve as riotous punchlines), that the film is almost never less than fabulously vibrant and more fun than it has any right to be.Faced with retooling one of the most iconic protagonists in literary history, Lily James' Lizzie Bennett is commendably feisty and badass enough to firmly sate fans of either genre. Though Austen-diehards might fault her controversial slight teariness (you try having to constantly fend off the undead amidst the claustrophobic constraints of polite society and not feeling a little weepy sometimes), James' steely but playful charisma makes her an ideal, genre-straddling lead. Similarly (though his 70-year-old rasp takes some acclimatizing to), Sam Riley's mournful eyes and steadfast chin lend innate depth to the enigmatically brooding Mr. Darcy, and the commanding Riley swelters and sword fights like the best of them. Jack Huston perfectly blends the debonair affability and sinister unsavoury attributes of Mr. Wickham with a passionately invested energy, while Bella Heathcote and Douglas Booth are each adorably earnest as the tale's 'other' star-crossed lovers, and Charles Dance and Sally Phillips are deliciously slyly witty and boorishly superficial as Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. Still, the film may as well have been rebranded "The Matt Smith Show," as the former Doctor is nothing short of perennially hysterical as the prissy Mr. Collins, his every utterance, every facial expression, every snobbishly prancing step a scene-stealing, belly-laugh-erupting delight, in one of the most consistently pristine comedic performances seen in years.Taking the p*ss out of historical romance and lending substance to axe-in-face escapism, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies blends the pleasures of its twain influences to a surprisingly satisfying degree. It's easily the most charming rom-zom-com since Shaun of the Dead (though, to be fair, the competition leaves something to be desired...) while a deceptively hearty Austen revamp to boot, and hugely enjoyable for audiences endeared to one, the other, or both. In fact, with such good fortune at hand, we're really only in want of one thing: bring on Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters, please.-7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all. You can't watch a movie that has the word "zombie" in its title with high anticipation. With that said, P&amp;P&amp;Z exceeded my expectations. The mix between sophisticated Empire England and braincraving zombies was refreshing. As someone who read Seth Graham-Smiths Pride and Prejudice and Zombies let me tell you that the first 30 Minutes were very accurate. The rest of the story got hoolywood-ized. I guess that was a good choice because you want to see some action and drama if you pay for a "Just-for-entertainment-movie"The cast, expect Sam Rileys, was really fitting. The costumes and setting were fun to look at and the music and fighting was well performed. If you are familiar with former Movie adaptations, you can be sure to have some special humorous moments.If you are not taking the story itself serious and are looking for some simple amusement, I can highly recommend you this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pride and Prejudice and ZombiesIf zombies had existed in Victoria times the wealthy would've just thought them ugly peasants.Mind you, the affluent in this horror movie are fully aware of their flesh-eating epidemic.In the wake of a zombie outbreak, 19th century England's most opulent families are required to send their offspring away to be trained in marital arts. This was the case with Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and her sisters (Bella Heathcote, Suki Waterhouse, Ellie Bamber, Millie Brady).The undead, however, are not Elizabeth's only adversary as she has found an infuriating rival in zombie-hunter Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley).Not as over-the-top as one would expect a pairing of Jane Austin and the living dead to be, P+P+Z is also not as insipid either. Oddly enough, it's the public domain portion of this parody that's more pleasurable than the zombie killing parts.Furthermore, zombies aren't that scary when they're wearing powdered wigs.

		<fullReview>Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies is an excellent overall contribution to the Zombie genre. It is exciting and refreshing to see director and cast surprise and delight watchers with an interesting twist. This film should join other impressive off-the-beaten-path films such as Exit Humanity, Wyrmwood, and A Little Bit Zombie as interesting and sometimes humorous journeys through a contextual world of Zombies. Too many critics lose sight of the context in which these films are created, judging them harshly on criteria that overlook the genius and creativity required to pull this off. The film has quirky acting,amusing dialogue, absurd violence, and interesting historical contexts. It is not aspiring to be anything more than what it is: a funky mash up that above all seeks to entertain without taking itself too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keira Knightly watch out you have been served</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a really good flick. My wife and I saw the Keira version a number of years ago and I gotta admit it was fun and gave you an eyeful of the dilemma women must have had when wealth only passed through sons. I watched this with my wife, and enjoyed Matt Smiths performance but the lead actress Lily James carried this movie. I was not quite sure how on earth this movie was going to play out but in the end it she just rocked. Keep in mind I really enjoyed keiras performance in the original non zombie version. One downer in this film is that sadly this Mr Darcy just did not have the gravitas that several prior MR. Darcy's have had. Perhaps it was because he was so young looking, looking more like 22 than the typical 30 plus actors I have seen in the past that seem more believable when they push back on the elder aristocracy in scenes, they should have pulled in an actor 5 or 10 years his senior. The movie was just alternate universe great for the first 2/3 and then as it moved into the final confrontation it veered more and more from the source material and I think that made it sink to just solidly entertaining movie. SPOILER sort of, stay through the first part of the credits folks.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Story, Cliché's, Gore &amp; zombies. Surprisingly good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film when I went to see Revenant at the Cinema. The trailer looked so intriguing zombies in the 19th Century.So had to go see it. I've never read pride and prejudice so that side meant very little to me. I had no great expectations. What a good film! ( assuming you don't take anything with zombies in it too seriously.)The acting was good, the story was believable, the characters were developed and there was even some humour (Matt Smith added a lot of this). Most amazing of all, it had lots of zombies in it. It really got the balance right of, story, clichés and gore. If (like me) you like the look of the trailer, then you will almost certainly enjoy this film. I've given it 8/10 but would add another point for being much better than expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Mash-Up of Genres</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies", starring Lily James-Downton Abbey_tv, Cinderella_2015; Sam Riley-Maleficent, Law &amp; Order:Special Victims Unit_tv; Matt Smith-Terminator Genisys, Doctor Who_tv; Jack Huston-The Longest Ride, American Hustle and Lena Headey-Game of Thrones_tv, The Brothers Grimm.This is a mash-up of 2 different genres, kind of like what they did a few years back with 'Abraham Lincoln Vampire Killer'. This one is between a Jane Austen book and a Zombie movie. It seems that there is a zombie situation in London during the 1700's, that causes people to take there daughters to China to learn the martial arts and then come back to London so that they can fight the zombie apocalypse-at least that is what one guy does. Lily is the oldest daughter and unlike her 4 sisters, who spend their free time trying to find a husband, Lily enjoys being an independent woman. That is until Sam, a dashing zombie killer, shows up and she starts getting the flutters. Then another handsome stranger, Jack, shows up and her hormones really start going crazy. Of course, she does have to fight attacking zombies, even at fancy dances, so that helps keep her thoughts off love. Matt plays Lily's cousin and Lena plays a sort of famous zombie killer with only one eye-it was taken in battle. I think what makes this movie interesting is that it is humorous but it plays the non-zombie parts straight. You know, two different social classes trying to find love. As the end credits start, there is a scene that sets things up for a possible sequel- depending on how much money this one makes, obviously. It's rated "PG-13" for zombie violence and some sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 48 minutes. I enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the best zombies films I've seen in a while, way better than Scouts guide. The film does take place in the time of the Jane Austin novel, it never comes across like it's a parody of it, staying true to it's material. I also like that it tells a good period piece film, even though it's also is a zombie flick.The zombies are very well played out, better than I've have seen in other zombie movies. It's also very well acted, the characters really surprised me, just when you think there gonna go one way, then they don't. It has great action, and somewhat a good love story. If you are in the mood for a good zombie flick, then give this film a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I loved this movie, it has action, romance, comedy and even some horror. Lily James is a future top star for sure, her acting was great and chemistry with the other actors was wonderful. I wasn't expecting much out of this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. The movie kept us entertained throughout and wanting even more. It had a great story, my only complaint would be as others have stated more zombies. I loved the acting in this movie, like I said Lily James stole the show, but Sam Riley playing Mr. Darcy also did an amazing job. Definitely a movie worth seeing over and over. If you have any doubts about seeing this movie, just go see it, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome expansion from the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the original Pride and Prejudice novel as well as the 1995 series and the 2005 movie. My husband bought me the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies book and I can't say the book was thoroughly enjoyable. So I wasn't expecting too much from the movie, but I was really blown away by how much and how well they expanded from the source material. This is one of the very few instances where I can say the movie is worlds better than the book. Wickham is a proper villain, the zombies are better placed as an integral part of the story instead of just a silly backdrop, the fight scenes are awesome, the zombie war more plausible if you will, and thank goodness they did away with a lot of the silliness like Wickham's weak sphincter muscles and the cauliflower heads (readers of the book will know). I also love the fact that they gave so many nods to all previous multimedia adaptations, from the original Jane Austen book, to PPZ, and even to the 1995 series and 2005 movie! With that said, the movie is far from perfect. It has editing flaws especially when one character is speaking yet the camera is not on them. There were also too many useless characters IMHO (I actually think they should have killed off some of the Bennet sisters) and a few plot holes but it can be overlooked. Over all, it's a very entertaining movie. For an unbiased opinion, it would have to come from my poor husband, who went with me solely to watch The Eleventh Doctor...I mean Matt Smith. He enjoyed the movie too, surprisingly. I suggest everyone give it a try before passing it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pride + Prejudice + Zombies = a great time at the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pride and Prejudice? AND ZOMBIES?? It sounds strange. It is. It sounds like a bad B-movie, but is it? "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" (PG-13, 1:48) has a very unusual premise? but not a unique one. If you're tempted to dismiss this movie as disrespectful to classic literature, or history (or zombies), I'd encourage you to consider the following two movies: In 2005, Indian and British filmmakers got together to produce a Bollywood-style film called "Bride &amp; Prejudice". It was loosely based on "Pride and Prejudice", Jane Austen's classic 1813 novel about conflicts and misunderstandings among young men and women of different social standing. In 2012, "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" created an alternate history by merging the personal background of the man who would become the 16th President of the United States with legends and fictional characteristics of the so-called "children of the night".Worldwide, "Vampire Hunter" earned double what it had cost to produce. Box office receipts for "Bride &amp; Prejudice" tripled that movie's budget. And then there are other alternate versions of history, such as 2009's "Inglourious Basterds", which doubled the money spent on its production, and fictionalized versions of history like 2003's "The Last Samurai" whose worldwide take was three times its budget.What's more, "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" was co-written by Seth Grahame-Smith, who wrote the book on which that movie is based ? and had previously written the 2009 mash-up novel "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies", the book on which the 2016 movie is based. So, if movies like this aren't unheard-of, and they make money, the most important question that remains is whether "Pride + Prejudice + Zombies" (as it's also written) is in the same class as the other films mentioned above.Much like the characters in Jane Austen's original work, in this film, there's a wealthy Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) whose pride is misinterpreted as arrogance by Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James), an independent young woman who tends to let first impressions and unproven stories prejudice her attitudes towards others. Darcy and Elizabeth clash at first, but eventually feel drawn to each other. UN-like Jane Austen's story, this is all happening as Darcy and Elizabeth are trying to fend off the zombie apocalypse.In this film's version of history, Great Britain has become afflicted with a plague brought to its shores from its overseas empire. London has been walled off by the Grand Barrier and is further protected by the Royal Moat, a giant trench which encircles the city as well as an area of farm land known as the In-Between. Britain's undead roam the countryside in fairly small numbers, but are a persistent concern to the country's landowners? and there's something different about these zombies. They're not as fast as the flesh and brain eaters in "World War Z", but they are more intelligent than those in TV's "The Walking Dead". And there are rumors that the apocalypse described in the Bible's Book of Revelations will be a zombie apocalypse, complete with the biblical Four Horsemen and led by the Anti-Christ.For the sake of self-preservation, British families who can afford it send their children (male and female alike) to Japan or China in order to receive training in martial arts and various kinds of weaponry. Elizabeth and her four sisters are especially skilled warriors who are encouraged in their training by their father (Charles Dance). On the other hand, their mother (Sally Phillips) is more focused on marrying off all five of them as quickly as possible ? so they can be protected and supported. At a nearby ball, an eligible bachelor named Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth) sets his eyes on Elizabeth's older sister, Jane (Bella Heathcote). Soon afterward, Elizabeth is being pursued by the awkward and obnoxious Parson Collins (Matt Smith). She has no interest in the Parson, or in the growing affections of Mr. Darcy, especially after what she hears about him from a British soldier named Wickham (Jack Huston), a man from Darcy's past. The relationships just get more complicated and more challenging as the story progresses. This is, after all, a period romance? and an ongoing struggle to avoid getting eaten by zombies."Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" is tough to describe and do it justice. It's strange, but not too weird. It's a B-movie premise that does not play like a B-movie. Production values are high, the acting is strong and Burr Steers' writing and directing tell a well-constructed stylized story. And the movie smartly avoids extremes. The zombie killings are not overly gory and the romance isn't too sappy. The various elements of Austen's tale and the book's zombie story work together remarkably well ? better than most Movie Fans would probably expect. In short, Pride + Prejudice + Zombies = a great time at the movies. "A"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Twisted Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It hasn't been that long since movie goers were treated to the film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's turn on our famous president with ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER. Grahame-Smith has written several novels now that take a well-known subject or book and adds something supernatural to it. That LINCOLN was the first to be made into a film is surprising since the book this film is based on was published first. But with the success of that first film this one has been made. But is that a good thing or bad? The book and film take their source material from the famed classic novel by Jane Austen that focused on the morality and lifestyles of the landed gentry in England, focusing on a family whose daughters are seeking matrimonial partners. As if that wasn't enough of a story this time around the setting is altered in a world where a zombie plague has taken on most of England and those that have survived not only have to deal with the day to day life of noble men and women but the chance of getting eaten by zombies as well.The Bennet family has five daughters all at an age where they are ripe for marriage. Elizabeth, the second oldest child, has the possibility of being courted by Mr. Darcy, a friend of Mr. Bingley who is interested in Elizabeth's older sister Jane. As the courting goes back and forth it also includes Parson Collins, a cousin of the Bennets who has his eye on Elizabeth as well. If this wasn't enough an ex-friend of Mr. Darcy, Mr. Wickham, also has eyes for Elizabeth.Mr. Bingley throws a ball for the countryside and all attend only to have it interrupted by a zombie attack. Rather than become the demure ladies that are expected the Bennet sisters are fierce warriors capable of taking care of not only themselves but those around them as well. Armed to the teeth they take down zombies left and right during the attack.A traitor to his/her own kind exist among the loaded gentry and has sided with the zombies in the hope of some sort of co-existence between the living and the undead. The zombies are fairly harmless until the taste human blood and can exist on pig's blood. But the chances of them never being exposed and what would happen after are the main fear of the remaining humans.So the story here basically moves back and forth between a romance and horror film with comedic elements surrounding both. Does it work? In some cases but for the most part this film has jumped on the zombie bandwagon as the genre is fading from sight. With the exception of the still popular THE WALKING DEAD zombies have once more fallen out of favor and have grown tedious rather than horrifying. The same holds true for the gore effects that accompany these films. They may be well done and offer a few new sights for gore fans here but for the most part they've become boring.The movie has a nice look to it and the set design and costuming are top notch. Unfortunately due to the subject matter my guess is that Oscar will not come calling for those who worked in those departments here though no matter how good a job they've done. The cinematography is excellent and we get clear views of all that goes on even though most evening shots inside are illuminated in the scene by candles only. The acting is well done by all involved and the direction is fine. But in the end it still feels as if something is missing.I will say that my biggest complaint was the sound. Once again we have a movie where every sound involved is blasting from the speakers with the exception of dialogue, the one thing that we want to hear above the rest and as clear as possible. My viewing experience with this film ended up with subtitles running throughout just so I could know what the actors were saying. For some reason this seems to be the norm rather than the exception these days with most Hollywood films. I remember reading how Robert Altman was hailed when he championed this sort of sound mix beginning with his film MCCABE AND MRS. MILLER. For me it becomes a distraction rather than something that helps in developing a mood or setting.Some will enjoy this movie because they love Jane Austen and the romantic novels of her time. Some will love it because they still crave zombie films. And some will find it interesting to watch and see how the two genres are combined, one of the higher points of the film and the novels. In the end though the movie is one worth watching but not something I think I would want to keep around and watch over and over again. It might be worth a rent though and possibly better than some of the alternatives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Pride and Prejudice than Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been great - its a escape movie so I did not take it too seriously. I liked the casting and the costumes in the movie as well, very dapper Old English style.I liked the Pride and Prejudice elements - the setting in my opinion was a bit rushed I did not really understand who was living where and where the boundaries were - rest of England, the in between and London. There was a moat built but I was confused as the zombies seemed to be everywhere anyway? People moved here, there and everywhere so I just gave up trying to understand where they were meant to be based.So the word play between characters is fantastic - very P&amp;P however the zombies did not seem to play a part at all - only brief moments of zombie action. I would have been great to see move, more of the struggle. Overall an entertain movie and hope for some more zombies in the future.</fullReview>

I never really cared for the Pride and Prejudice movies, but I thought this might be good. Costumes and the sets were great, but I didn't care to much for the movie it self. I really didn't like who they chose to play Mr. Darcy. Loved Mr. Bingley though, very cute. Lots of action. I think just about the only thing I liked about this movie was the sisters (Jane &amp; Elizabeth). 1 of my favorite parts was when the sisters were getting ready to go to the party and they were loading up on there knives &amp; weapons just in case there's a zombie attack. My 2nd favorite part was when the sisters were walking back into the party room to kill the zombies and Mr. Darcy &amp; Mr. Bingley are watching like "Dang,they are kicking zombie but". All in all I gave this movie 6\10, because it was action packed, good actors, some funny moments, it wasn't all over the place and it did lead a semi interesting story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A strangely underrated, very stylish,occasionally funny and well-paced movie.While perhaps not breathtakingly original, this movie is well-executed, well-directed, with some good acting and a few passable jokes thrown in. If that doesn't sound ecstatic, it's because this movie isn't exactly awesome, but it's still decent fun and it offers a somewhat fresh look at two genres at once (classic romance and zombie apocalypse). It might be a good point to start one's girlfriend's interest in the zombie genre if you wish.My only real disappointment was that the one character from the original novel that I wished (and expected) to turn into a zombie didn't, but for the sake of spoilers, I won't divulge who it was (n't).Lastly, cinematography, locations, sound and costumes (i.e. "looks and feels") of this movie are spot on. Again, in the age of so many inept, vapid films, this one doesn't deserve its low rating and might be worth a casual glance if you're looking for some, well... brainless... indulgence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this is an odd ball of a movie, but nevertheless very entertaining...if you can bend your mind to your imagination and view this as simple entertainment. This is no Schindler's List (1993) or an epic movie like Gone With The Wind (1939).What this movie has is: (1) Far better acting and script writing and witty dialogue then 50 Shades of Grey(2015). Ask yourself this, if your were drunk, would you want to watch a dull BDSM movie or a kick arse zombie movie? (2) Cinematography: just watch the camera as it has those wide shots of the English manors. Visually the movie well crafted. (3) Cast: Lily James, Sam Riley, Lena Headey and Charles Dance (taking a break from the Game Of Thrones set), and Matt Smith. Good acting and nicely timed comic relief. AND I might add all the actors have not lost the personality of the P&amp;P characters. (4) This is the 3rd P&amp;P adaption in which the P&amp;P cast closely matched the age of the P&amp;P in the books. (the other two being Pride and Prejudice (2005) and Lost in Austin (2008)). (5) Costume: very authentic, however the costume Julian Day designer did do a nice job of blending the period ensemble with practical "modern" updates. Seriously I ain't fight zombies in empire style dress without my leather jeans underneath my skirts? (6) Sets and Location: The movie could of skimped on the location and made sets, but the producers didn't. The sets are real and they give the movie a more realistic look. (7) Audiences need to look at the Lighting in this movie. How the candle light flickers across the actors faces, the contrast between shadows in a room. Watch the dungeon scene where Lizzy and Jane are practicing and check out the blues and whites in the room contrasting with the black/gray shadows.I have read the harsh criticism of reviews, and having seen the movie, it did not faze me one bit. I really found myself thoroughly enjoying myself. I am very glad I did not waste my money on this movie. It provided light entertainment, romance, chemistry between the leads actors is wonderfully balanced and yes.....Lena Headey.So why 10 out of 10 rating....because I can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like zombie movies; I like Jane Austen novels. This doesn't mean I like them together - I also like both pizza and snorkeling, but I suspect trying them at the same time would be a less than satisfactory experience.I am not as offended by this mash-up as many apparently are. Yes, it's a weaselly way to use someone else's (classic) work for money - but, when a book still inspires parodies and pastiches two hundred years later, it means it's still vital and relevant.So, Jane Austen and zombies. Set in an alternate history England overrun by a zombie plague, the movie follow spirited, katana-wielding Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and proud zombie hunter Darcy (Sam Riley) as they meet, clash and fall in love while trying to survive the undead horde. This could have been charmingly stupid, but it required a person of great talent at the helm to make the charming prevail over the stupid - say, Shaun of the Dead's Edgar Wright, a man able to milk every single opportunity for off-beat humour and to get a laugh even from the way he frames someone being offered a slice of cake. Director Burr Steers doesn't bring anything special to the table; set-pieces aren't exciting, horror isn't scary, humor isn't funny. The result is a badly stitched up Frankenstein monster barely limping through its 107 minutes.Even social satire, a promising angle (think of the clash between formal, stuffy upper-class 18th century Britain and a zombie epidemic) is mostly overlooked.Maybe producers expected this would be a perfect date movie, with romance for girls, zombies for boys and comedy for both - judging from its box office results, general audiences didn't take the bait. I guess we may be spared the likes of Wuthering Heights and Werewolves, War and Peace and Aliens, Great Expectations and the Mummy.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In brief, I think the critical response to this movie must be due to people expecting something different. In my opinion I think this is well scripted, well acted, well directed as well as being visually iconic with a great soundtrack. The plot's good, it avoids a lot of tropes, so why the low rating? Well, I think everyone must have expected this to be a big guffaw, an ongoing joke like Zombieland (decent enough), or your average teen movie (terrible). Except what they got was a proper, sound, decent movie. No laugh track or quirky punchlines, just a balance of renaissance dialect, beautiful settings and good ol' fashioned zombie action. The romance plot is (as expected) very good too.Maybe a movie with a plot was just too darned complicated for an audience that expected explosion-kicks and zombie-head footballs? Or too improper for Jane Austen fans? All I know is it was a lot more creative, unpredictable, well visualised and well executed than most zombie, action or even young adult movies I've seen in years.So maybe ask yourself what you're expecting from this movie - put that aside, and enjoy it for the great movie it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people are probably thinking, "If they pull this off, it could really be great!" And they're right. The unfortunate part is that it's fairly difficult. My only true frame of reference is the 2005 film version of the Jane Austen classic. And while it's not my favorite film of all time, I can't deny its technical achievements.This one has completely different achievements. If you're talking about special effects and makeup, then Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is accomplished, sure. But the problems lie in the story itself.The film starts out as a true black comedy. Taking place in the early 1800s, you see quaint young English women preparing their weapons for battling the undead. But first they must brush each other's hair. It's that sort of humor that runs rampant throughout much of the first act of this film. And it's much appreciated. It's not two stories at once, but the classic Austen story featuring a zombie subtext.Though, the irony is only entertaining for so long. Then it reaches a point where everything seems forced, and then the dialogue becomes rushed. It just goes through the motions in order to execute both ideas. The long runtime works for the 2005 version, but this one just tries to cover way too much ground in about 30 minutes less. And it's as though the filmmakers realize that too. So they change it up a bit. 45 minutes into the film we finally get more of the zombie action that we've been wanting. It starts getting good, but then the whole love story suffers because of it. If you can look past the massively uneven tone, you'll tend to enjoy what makes this story unique.The casting here is pretty good. The chemistry between all the lovers isn't quite there, but Lily James is more than acceptable as Elizabeth Bennet. Although, it's almost humorous to believe that she's supposed to be the less beautiful daughter between herself and Jane.If you've never been exposed to the original Jane Austen story before, then you may not even get the humor or, better yet, the story in this one. However, the adjustments made to the classic tale in order to fit into this zombie adaptation actually cause parts of the story to make more sense.Pride and Prejudice and Zombies isn't a bad movie. It's actually quite entertaining at times. And It's not that they failed in what they set out to do, I just simply think it's not possible to accomplish the daunting task of combining the two stories. Perhaps it merely has too much to handle in order to have the freedom to be its own movie.Twizard Rating: 72</fullReview>

It may sound bizarre at first, and it really is, but there's no lack of production value here. The presentation is top notch and the cast, mixed of actors from Maleficent, Cinderella, Doctor Who and Game of Thrones, deliver an air of seriousness beyond that expected from a zombie movie, also with unexpected degree of humor as well.This is still the story of British aristocrats and their so troubled lives in 19th century, though some aspects have been altered to accommodate zombies, even as far as to present backstory with heavy monologue and narration. It doesn't deter the movie from going full drama as the cast essentially creates a drama while acting like zombie killing is as the norm as sipping afternoon tea. These fine men and ladies look astoundingly fitting in the outlandishly bleak universe.Lily James, if born into different time, might be a legitimate princess. She looks comfortably convincing as Elizabeth Bennet, the zombie hunter version of the female lead at least. Sam Riley as Darcy is proper as well, he encompasses the awkward nobility with a fervent passion. These two have strange chemistry, especially when zombies are involved, yet it's weirdly adorably amicable. Matt Smith from Doctor Who fame, can singlehandedly delivers the humor, he's simply too versatile and endearing not to have in old style England.The humor works splendidly, there are times when sarcasm is produced just right against the backdrop of the somber tone. Its playful romance, bantering and even cringe worthy moments are pleasantly delightful. However, the jarring tone can be too distracting at times. The movie screams too hard to set grim horror, a staple flaw in horror genre and on the other side of spectrum, it's occasionally overly zealous in the drama that it becomes wallowing or slow.An odd bite of contrasting drama and comedy, yet surprisingly enjoyable, this seemingly crazy version of Pride and Prejudice can serendipitously attract audience of many different tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elizabeth Bennett, the oldest of five sisters, takes issue with her mother's shallow attempts to marry her off, believing that love and self-esteem are much more important than simply marrying a wealthy and allegedly worthy man, such as the rather stand-offish and disdainful Mr Darcy. Of course, the fact that she and her sisters have undertaken the Chinese ant-zombie training rather than the more socially acceptable Japanese training doesn't help.So this bloke had a brilliant idea: why not take Jane Austen's Victorian novel of romance and social commentary, and mash it up with zombies? The novel was a success (and spawned a number of other genre-mixing novels), so a movie adaptation was inevitable. And it succeeds, primarily because it plays both elements with an absolutely straight face: it's a pretty solid zombie movie, and it also plays fair with the themes of Austen's original.The cast are mostly quite good, with Lily James, as Elizabeth, being impressively athletic when dismantling zombies as well as sporting a bosom which heaves spectacularly in more emotional moments. Sam Riley's Darcy is a bit stiff (ooh, Matron!) but then, he's supposed to be. My only quibble is that some of the geography, zombie history, and martial arts training history were whizzed through so quickly that they were a bit difficult to follow. Otherwise, this movie is peculiar, but rather good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great new twist on the zombie genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never read Pride and Prejudice, or Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, so my expectations for this were somewhat low. I went into expecting a different kind of zombie film, and that's exactly what I got, one that was much better than I had anticipated. This isn't the best zombie movie of all time, and it's not likely to have a huge cult following like the filmmakers probably intended, but it is a hugely entertaining original take on the getting-old zombie genre.In a lot of ways, the fact I am unfamiliar with the story of Pride and Prejudice enhanced my enjoyment of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies from a narrative standpoint. I never knew what was going to happen, which characters were going to make it out alive, and a few minor twists actually took me by surprise. A Pride and Prejudice fan is probably unlikely to be surprised by much that happens on screen, but will still hold up as a strong story regardless. The plot moves along smoothly throughout as everything is very nicely paced, never boring for a second even during the more quiet, exposition-filled scenes. Despite having 'Zombies' in the title, the zombie action, only accounts for about 10-15 minutes of the running time, which would have been disappointing if the film wasn't as engaging as it is. When the zombie action does occur, it's great fun to watch, occasionally scary (fantastic use of jump scares), and nicely shot.One of the reoccurring complaints I see in reviews for Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is that the zombie violence/gore appears neutered for its PG-13 rating. I love zombie carnage as any horror fan, but over-the-top gore would have felt completely out of place here and not mixed well with the overall tone of the picture. While this may be much tamer than an average episode of "The Walking Dead" is, there are still enough satisfying zombie fights to keep zombie aficionados happy. The use of the zombie P.O.V. shots were my favorite. Such a gimmick could have gotten old fast, though since it was used sparingly throughout the film, it remained effective. The opening scene in particular provided a nice jolt to start the movie off right.To the major credit of writer/director Burr Steers, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies largely avoids the laundry list of zombie clichés that often plague these types of films. There's no infected that struggles to remain human as long as possible, there's no scene where a family member cries over having to put down a loved one, and there's no incredibly fast or incredibly slow moving zombies. The zombies go at a regular pace. If there's one part that could have been better, the way the zombies are taken out could have been slightly more inventive. There's nothing wrong with how the zombies are dispatched as it's pretty visually exciting, though a bit of extra creativity could have been used in a few scenes.Other than a few basic nitpicks, I don't have any real hard complaints about Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. All the performances are perfect for the type of film this is, the directing is solid, the special effects are well done, and the tone remains balanced. The film is certainly much, much better than its measly box office numbers indicate. The title spells out exactly what the movie is, and it delivers on all fronts. For those who like Pride and Prejudice and/or those who like zombies, this is well worth checking out. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel compelled to write this review based on the bad reviews I've seen. If you are a fan of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and not a fan of zombie movies, please don't see this movie. If you're a fan of zombie movies but not of Pride and Prejudice, give it a chance and understand that the incorporation of zombies into the original storyline is well-achieved and hilarious. It helps to be a fan of both, but I don't fault you if you're not.It's important to have a sense of humor when going into most zombie movies. This is based on a best-selling novel of the same name, and I believe the movie does it justice. The story never falters: it's ultimately a romance wrapped in a zombie tale, or vice versa. The acting is superb, Matt Smith doing an excellently exaggerated version of the novel's counterpart. The setting and direction is excellent.For the zombie parts of the movie, it never departs from certain zombie canon. I won't give away elements, but a base for the depiction of zombies can be traced through the better zombie movies until this point.I don't expect people to see the movie through my eyes, but I really hope anyone who rated it actually saw the movie and gave it a chance rather than jumping to conclusions without seeing it. It is entertaining, I was invested in the characters, and the story never faltered. If you are reading reviews because you're on the fence based on the poor rating, please please please see this movie. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie adaptation of a great novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read and enjoyed the book, I was dubious that the movie could live up to such a wonderful adaptation of a great classic. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. I will say, for those who are fans of the novel (the adaptation or the original), this does not exactly stick to the storyline of the novel. In particular, the second half of the movie does differ significantly, so don't be surprised to find that you don't know exactly what is going to happen next.There were some parts of the novel missing that I had particularly enjoyed, but you can't have everything. The writers had put together a decent script which I think has surprised a lot of people. Yes, there are a lot of people out there who look down on genre films and that is their right to do so. I am sure that many who believe the only good book is one which is over a hundred years old will be horrified by the treatment of Austen's novel. My only comment on that is that it leaves more room in the cinema for those of us who not only love the classics, but also a good zombie novel.From my point of view, the actors did a good job of portraying characters blended by two authors plus screen writers. The film was beautifully shot throughout and although the story departs from the novel, it is entertaining. There is plenty of action throughout, as Elizabeth and her sisters prove that being female does not mean one has to sit back and wait to be rescued by a man. It means getting out there and killing zombies. That does not mean a woman is not open to the prospect of romance and marriage, merely that the man who falls in love with a woman like this is unlikely to be one who requires a demure wife.I didn't expect the cinema to be full - and it wasn't. We did get the fun of seeing a group of mid-teens watching the movie and apparently encountering Jane Austen for the first time. Watching their reactions to the Jane Austen parts of the movie was almost as entertaining as the movie itself. I can almost guarantee that at least half that group will be reading the original as well as the adaptation to see how they compare. Finally, before anyone complains that this is a film that men cannot relate to, I would point out that my action-film-fan husband came with me to the cinema and absolutely loved it. We have both seen more than one adaptation of Austen's original novel and haven't been over impressed; this was a refreshing change that made for an enjoyable afternoon out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austen Revived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By adding zombies, Seth Grahame-Smith infused a classic romantic comedy with hand-to-hand combat and less misogyny, than Jane Austen could have imagined, in is his retelling of Pride and Prejudice, and Zombies. In a land of 19th century zombie apocalypse a woman could make her own way as a warrior, and not just a wife. Much like the original Mr. Bennet (played by Charles Dance), the PPZ Mr. Bennet encouraged his daughters to learn to think first, fight second and instilled a great devotion to their family. In the original telling the Bennet sisters (played by Lily James, Bella Heathcote, Ellie Bamber, Millie Brady and Suki Waterhouse) were raised to speak their mind and make their own way. The more "practical" Mrs. Bennet (played by Sally Phillips) made every attempt to have her daughters a part of "normal" society. Grahame-Smith's addition of a zombie apocalypse to the storyline, allowed for a leveling of the playing field for both men and women. A twist that I'd like to think Austen would have enjoyed.Austen's romantic comedies were a political commentary and ridiculed the issues women had with upbringing, education, marriage, and social standing. While PPZ keeps these issues at the forefront, the retelling is also able to add a flair of martial arts and 19th century tactical battle.Women, in Austen's time, were expected to marry into status, and men took for granted their standing to woo women who may otherwise not have a choice but to marry.Jane Austen's stories portrayed strong and intelligent women, but even the smartest woman in the 19th century was limited by the confines of society. Austen ridiculed the 19th century woman's dependence on marriage in her several works, which were originally published anonymously. Unknown by many, her comedic works were a satirical depiction of society.You can expect the dialogue of a 19th century novel, which some may not enjoy, but it is interwoven with energetic physical training, witty altercations, a storyline that pushes forward flawlessly. The ending will not surprise you, as it is clearly based on a 19th century novel, but the addition of zombies gives a delightful twist to the plot development. Jane Bennet, on her track to Mr. Bingfley's estate is not just caught in a storm, but is also attached by zombies. Her prowess in combat is shown, yet she still succumbs to the fever that allows Mr. Darcy to fall in love with Elizabeth.Every moment where the viewer might feel the story is slowing down with over developed dialogue and drama, as 19th century novels are want to do, this version of the telling fills the drone with hand-to-hand combat. If Austen could have imagined a world where women were warriors, as well as independent, she might have written this additional plot line. Austen's genre of choice was satiric romance, and Grahame-Smith takes the satire, adds violence and gives the audience fun quips, and great physical interactions.I won't say PPZ is for everyone, but if you've ever read or seen a 19th century romantic comedy and though, "This story could use a lot less misogyny and a lot more violence" then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less Pride, Less Prejudice, More Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people, when I heard about Pride and Prejudice and Zombies being turned into a film, I scoffed. Just the very idea of it seemed ridiculous. But like every idea, with the right talent involved, it can turn out just fine. The film is directed by Burr Steers, who worked on the classics 17 Again and Charlie St. Cloud. Okay perhaps there's a little sarcasm there, but I actually happen to think he did a fine job with P+P+Z. With some surprisingly good visuals, a well developed history behind the story, and some great action sequences, I had a fun time with the film.Lily James stars as Elizabeth Bennet and Sam Riley as Mr. Darcy. James captures the essence of Bennet's personality while also giving the new bada** side of her. The idea that Mr. Bennet trained his daughters from birth to defend themselves against the undead is a great twist. Plus, having Charles Dance play the part is definitely a welcomed bonus. The important aspect to take away from the Bennet girls is that they are not damsel in distresses or clichéd female characters at all. In fact, quite often the saving is done by the Bennet's themselves. Mr. Darcy on the other-hand, is as stiff of a character as ever. I know the point of the character is to not show emotion, and Elizabeth says he "feels less than the unfeeling", but I'm just not interested in a character like that. Nor does his performance bring more to the role than what is asked. All of this contributes to the fact that the romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy never feels right. Really, Elizabeth is one of the only characters you care about at all, and end up rooting for. However, Matt Smith as Parton Collins is terrific and steals almost every scene he's in.I enjoyed all of the little changes they made to the story and switching the gender roles, especially a particular fight sequence between Elizabeth and Darcy. Though, sometimes the appearances of the zombies come few and far between. There are definitely some jump scares, but I can't say I would have moved if the sound design wouldn't have been so abrupt and bombastic. I think overall, it does what it set out to do, and that is to pull off an interesting twist on the classic love tale, even with that romance is actually rather weak.+Great action+Cinematography and landscape was set up well+Matt Smith+Lily James kicks butt-Romance is iffy-Sam Riley brings nothing new to the role of Mr. Darcy6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jane Austen would approve. The movie mixes the best elements of the book and adds the hysterical premise that England is under attack by zombies. In addition to her own personal pride, Liza Bennet has the warrior code to buttress her ego against Darcy's insults. Their kung-fu battle is one of the best scenes in the movie. A fantastic juxtaposition of martial arts and the Victorian battle of wits. I also read the Seth Grahme-Smith that inspired this movie. It was tremendous fun, more faithful to the original book and of course, there was more to the story. The movie changes the second half of the story quite a bit, in particular as regards George Willowby. Anyone who takes offense at playing around with the sacred text and the immortal Jane Austen, should know this is not a cheap take, but a fully tongue in cheek variation. A good time should be had by all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I considered giving this ten stars to help boost the low ratings, but decided to go with what it deserves. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (PPZ) is a fun film with good action and worth your time if you like to think out of the box.Seth Grahame-Smith's novel is an unusual mash-up of Jane Austen's original and the current obsession with the undead. When I read the novel, I thought it was amusing and original in its way, but it was a one-joke premise and quickly grew boring. The premise works better on film. PPZ (the film) has enough action and humor to keep one interested throughout. A couple things make this worth watching: Matt Smith's performance, which is hilarious and quite different from his Dr. Who persona, and shows his versatility; and How well they capture how society would change with a zombie outbreak in the early nineteenth century.The film wasn't perfect. For example, one thing that irked me was how Elizabeth (Lizzie) Bennet was thought to be plain, especially compared to her sister Jane, yet Lily James, who played the character is very attractive. That's typical of Hollywood casting, however, and if you can get past that, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsatisfying at any angle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie adaptation of the best selling mashup novel was not successful at the box office, and I think I can see why. I feel I should admit that I have never read Jane Austen in my life, so I can't say for sure how close this movie is to Austen when it's not dealing with zombies. Maybe the mix of the two genres worked in the book, but it doesn't work in the film. The movie doesn't seem able to mix the two genres in a way that gives the movie a constant tone. Sometimes it seems to be trying to be campy, other times it is dead serious, and other times it tries to be horror exploitation (though the PG-13 rating sure limits the mayhem the filmmakers portray.) I simply didn't know how to take the movie, so it was impossible for me to put any emotional investment in what I was seeing. This may explain why I quickly got bored with the movie and wished it would have ended much sooner than it actually did. It might have worked better as a short subject rather than a feature length movie.</fullReview>

But it immediately reminded me of a 2012 movie, "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter", which I enjoyed a lot.Lily James is great as independent Elizabeth Bennet, one of the five Bennet sisters concerned with finding themselves a husband of means. As well Sam Riley is great as Colonel Fitzwilliam Darcy. Elizabeth has become quite the competent fighter herself.I enjoyed it, I was entertained, and that is all one can hope for in a movie titled "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few flaws but overall a really good film (with zombies)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a comedy horror film directed by Burr Steers who also wrote and adapted the movie from the original novel that came out in 1813. It stars Lily James, Sam Riley, Jack Huston, Bella Heathcote, Douglas Booth, Matt Smith, Charles Dance and Lena Headey. I personally liked this movie a lot, from the acting to the well shot action sequences. It is a whole lot of fun as the movie never fails to deliver on the promise. Lily James is slowly becoming one of my favorite actresses working today. She was perfect in Cinderella, and she is certainly really good here too. She was a strong and motivated character when needed and gave a really touching performance filled with emotion at times. Everybody else is also good on the role, especially Matt Smith who was incredibly funny and never failed to make me laugh. There's unfortunately not that much zombie screen time as I would have liked there to be, but the balance through the beginning between the dramatic pride and prejudice scenes, and the zombie ones was well done. The ending takes more of a drift on the zombie side, but it also ends abruptly. Considering the amount of money that it made, it seems like we're left with that ending forever now.</fullReview>

But, no, no...The plot of the movie was somehow subverted that i can't even call it a spoof, although a spoof would be infinitely better than this.Some performances are risible,Lena Headley's is almost not there, Mrs Bennet, big no no...

		<fullReview>I wasn't so sure about watching this movie, like I wasn't sure about reading the book. I'm not quite a fan of things that involves zombies, or anything with the word 'zombie' on the title (that's not a comedy) But after a hard day and not really knowing what to watch this movie popped up in my mind and I say: why not? After all what am I losing? And I have to say that I'm surprised that I actually enjoyed the movie so much! Of course, it has the base on Pride and Prejudice (a movie and a novel that I love) but I was prepared to see it ripped apart by zombies in a really bad way? well let me tell you that I was so wrong I'm ashamed! It has the perfect dose of weird romance, bizarre and funny (and zombies OF COURSE) stuff and a little bit of action that made the movie quite good, like a deceiver of the seven starts that I am giving to it. (In my opinion of course!!) It's like to see the old and well known characters from a classic novel in a "modern" topic, more like an alternative universe. And it was quite refreshing. About the actors well I like the way that every single one of them do their work, and seeing them in such characters as the ones from this movie was weird but fun. I can't believe that I am actually saying this because I had so much low expectations for this movie, but well, it changed my mind. It's a well recommended if you wanna have a moment to watch a hilarious movie and get away from the typical zombie movie, or from the typical 'a bit of romance' movie too.Happy that I gave this movie an opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm so regretting not seeing this movie in the Theater. The acting and effects of the movie were beyond my expectations, and as far as the story line, it was true to Pride and Prejudice(what I got from clif notes and parts of movies). I love a good Love story as well as action movies with martial arts and I like zombie movies. So this movie was the perfect fit for me. That being said, I feel that this movie would appeal to anyone who enjoys the zombie genre and Pride &amp; Prejudice. I had a lot of fun during this movie, I was pleased that it didn't take itself seriously, yet I enjoyed the depth of the characters. Sam Riley as Mr. Darcy was handsome, out spoken, and the perfect amount of sexy warrior. The anx of seduction between Lily James and Sam was both heart wrenching and beautiful. I equally laughed and jumped at the shocking moments throughout this movie, and enjoyed every moment. I am so horrified by the bad reviews the movie received, surely those viewers must have seen a different movie then I. I know it was great because I cried when I thought Darcy was dead, and cried again when he proposed again at the end. I hope to see the sequel produced "Mr Darcy takes a wife and Zombies" even given the bad reviews. I think P&amp;PZ will do well around the world and on DVD/Bluray and other streaming deliveries. I'd hate to think I'm not going to find out what happened on Liz's and Darcy's wedding night Zombie Apocalypse.</fullReview>

I must confess that I had seen "Pride and Prejudice"'s Joe Wright (2005) like thousands of times and zombies don't bother me so why not? well the movie was just Lovely! Seen this girls as a powerful warriors, seen our beloved Lizzie fight it against zombies without fear, with grace and elegance was great! There are some things make me doubt but is refreshing, have some action, some brains and of course Mr. Darcy the personification of charming prince doesn't disappoint is sexy in his own way.The landscapes are beautiful, some great actors around and zombies are OK. It's not the movie that will change your life but if you are a big fan you're going to smile you'll thrill every time Mr. Darcy and Lizzie's eyes meet and with every interaction. it doesn't matter if are zombies, plants, aliens or whatever. This is one of the biggest love stories of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, I never read the book. surprising as it maybe. Also, I have the admit, i am not overly critical of movie. I have no background in theater or knowledge of what movie critic base there opinion on. I just like being entertain. And this movie did just that. I like the scene, costume and clothing. A few good twist plot. Add a few zombie and I think you got the making of a pleasurable movie.My only annoyances, is the absurd idea that zombie only eat brains. I watch izombie. I did watch The Return of the Living Dead and enjoy it. It was cleaver. But I never thought this idea would linger so long.Thank You for taking the time to read my review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a lot of reviews from Jane Austen fans who were doubtful about being able to enjoy a zombie version of her stories, but were pleasantly surprised to find it quite enjoyable. I reached the same conclusion, but from the other direction! As a certified (certifiable?) zombie fanatic, I watch every zombie movie that comes out. I was extremely dubious about a zombie movie saddled with Jane Austen / Downton Abbey-type characters. But I dutifully sat down to watch it, with the expectation of probably not making it to the end. Wow, was I wrong! This movie works on all levels! It's fun, period. The zombies are adequate to keep the zombie fan in me interested, but I was delighted to find myself sucked into the silly, hyper-formal British melodramatic schtick. (With clenched characters who always look like they're not sure if they just smelled a fart.) I'll admit that I even got caught up enough to find myself saying things like "No! She can't marry this guy, she should marry THAT guy!" Which made me laugh at myself and feel like I was part of the fun, in on the joke. And the whole cast and crew were clearly in on the joke, and must have had a marvelous time making this picture. It was clearly a labor of love. The young ladies are fetching to say the least, beautiful and deadly but still vulnerable and human. The villains range from clownish to everything you'd want in a villain. The chemistry between the cast is obvious, and the comedy is well-written and delivered pitch-perfectly. I wish in retrospect that I had watched this movie with my wife, who would have been coming from the Jane Austen side of things, so that we could meet in the middle and have a fantastic time together. I may still watch it with her anyway, since I expect this movie to offer excellent re-watchability value. I signed up at IMDb specifically to write a review of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. And this being my first review, I gave it only 9/10 so I won't permanently skew my ratings. I suppose there are other movies that I do like better, but not by a heck of a lot. This movie shouldn't disappoint anyone, whether you're a Jane Austen fan or a zombie fan or neither. If you like engaging characters, clever comedy delivered with gusto, a movie that knows when and how to laugh at itself, and which will sometimes make you want to stand up and cheer, then I highly recommend Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. This is the kind of movie that, if you see it in a theater, people applaud at the end. Or at least I would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: the movie that makes you jump You may think you know pride and prejudice (the original story) but do you know it with dead people?!? Yes there are of course zombies. It's the same story line as the original movie/book but it has a twist. SPOILER ALERT there trying to kill the zombies the whole movie. It's a great movie lots of action and a little bit of romance. I would not recommend this to little kids there are several spots in the movie that make you jump. And there is a lot of blood and gore. There was a two year old sitting behind me and my friend in the movie theater! Why would you bring your two year old to a movie with zombies in it? She didn't cry but still. There wasn't anything inappropriate there was blood, gore and some violence but not any sex scenes or anything that inappropriate. But it isn't appropriate for little kids (stupid lady sitting behind me). I really liked this movie it put a twist on the original movie/book but still kept the same story. The same story was still in the movie they just added zombies in the movie to make it seem better (in my point of view).I've been into romance lately and it quite a bit of romance and some kissing. It was the perfect length not to long not to short. It was a perfect length because it didn't go over 2 and &#x2155; hours and it wasn't under that. The romance was perfect for this movie. It made it more interesting and great. There wasn't anything negative or that I didn't like about this movie. Some people have said they hated it or it was the worst movie they ever seen. They just don't really like the movie because it was boring but I disagree. It was very entertaining and exciting for me. I had to go to the bathroom during the movie but I didn't want to miss anything. It was so good. I would go back any day and see it again. It's worth it!There were several love scenes like romantic love scenes. I think that was the best part of the whole movie. There is a scene where the 2 main characters (Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy) almost die and the main girls starts kissing the main guy to wake him up and start crying cause she is scared she won't wake up. Romance scenes are so good cause the way it is it's just so good and watching the scenes makes me want to be like them. It was very entertaining. I gave this movie a &#x2158; stars over all it was a very good movie and couldn't have been any better. It had a great story line and amazing characters.The story line is great because of the romance and the action. The characters are so good because they act so good. Most people who try acting always end up sucking at it. Not to mention the main boy is a freaking babe! I really love romance and I'm not a big fan of action but it worked for this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: A masculine improvement of Jane Austen's novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are asking yourself who (the hell) had the idea of putting zombies in Jane Austen's most celebrated story, well you don't know about Seth Jared Greenberg (aka Seth Grahame-Smith).This young and talented Author had the nerve to violate one of the most sacred feminine realms putting an heavy Y chromosome mark (in the form of an 'end of the world' kind of threat) in the love story between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy. He re-wrote the novel preserving all the original names (and main events) and the present film is a (nice) cinematographic transposition of his work.In the past few years Science Fiction sometimes described a decadent future where all mankind creative resources had been drained off and people are entertained with countless sequels of the same story or subverted versions of renowned classics. Now that it's happening is less dreadful than I thought and is actually amusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parody on "Pride and Prejudice"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (stylized as Pride + Prejudice + Zombies) is a 2016 British-American comedy horror film based on the 2009 novel, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies by Seth Grahame-Smith that parodies the 1813 novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. The film is directed by Burr Steers, who wrote the adapted screenplay, and stars Lily James, Sam Riley, Jack Huston, Bella Heathcote, Douglas Booth, Matt Smith, Charles Dance and Lena Headey.-The film was released by Screen Gems on February 5, 2016 in the United States, and by Lionsgate on February 11 in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The film grossed just $16 million worldwide against a budget of $28 million, making it a box office bomb.--Critical response: -The film received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 43%, based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies manages to wring a few fun moments out of its premise, but never delivers the thoroughly kooky mashup its title suggests." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 45 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B?" on an A+ to F scale.-Rafer Guzmán of Newsday wrote positively about the film, giving the film three out of four stars, calling it "an unexpected and off-kilter treat, thanks to a BBC-quality cast and (un)deadpan humor." -Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club gave the film a C, commenting "That this particular retelling of the Jane Austen novel feels like a Cliffs Notes version is understandable; that its zombie bits are equally rudimentary, though, is more disappointing." -Literary scholar and Austen professor Devoney Looser stated in Entertainment Weekly magazine her opinion of the literary quality of the film in the horror genre indicating that: "I enjoy genre movies that attempt something different -- and this does -- but I didn't find it all that scary. I'd give it a 'B'"? ????????????????????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mix of Zombie and love story; better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I am a Pride and Prejudice fan and the title of the movie itself has attracted me to watch it in a cinema. Before I watched this movie, I thought that it would be a flop. How could you put zombies into a well-known, all-time love story? However, it turns out to be better than what I expected, much better actually. Before I watched this film, I had heard comments that the storyline does not make sense. However, I do think that the storyline follows quite closely to the one in Pride and Prejudice. It might be possible that the audience who has such thought has not read the Jane Austen's work. The zombies scenes are violence, but not too gruesome for my taste (which is great for me as I can't stand too much blood and gore in a movie).I would recommend this movie to those who want to read Pride and Prejudice, but are worried that it will be boring. The zombies will be there to keep you excited and awake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" could have been an instant cult favorite. But it still falls short of greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" (2016) is a fun enough horror- comedy ? maybe not quite as good as it could be, considering all of its excellent ingredients, yet still better than most new zombie movies out there. I'd give it a 7 out of 10.It's a great genre mashup, and I don't just mean combining Jane Austen's 1813 classic book with horror's most grisly sub-genre. (This is a film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's 2009 eponymous satire novel.) It's also a detailed and thoughtfully constructed horror-fantasy. (That opening credits' alternate-history lesson was a nice touch.) Then it tries, with less success, to be a serviceable romance and a mystery.The film has a lot going for it: a fun concept, good actors, mostly competent direction, and a creative team that obviously had a hell of a lot of fun with the source material. Science fiction fans should have fun spotting Matt Smith, Lena Headey and Charles Dance. The movie has outstanding sets, costumes and filming locations ? this was shot on location at historic mansions throughout England. The fight choreography was decent enough, even if it was occasionally a little hard to follow. Finally, the zombies that we get to see are indeed creepy ? they're not Romero-type zombies, but the livelier, chattier, brain-eating, sentient baddies similar to those of John Russo's "Return of the Living Dead" films. The makeup and digital effects for the monsters are pretty damn good.Considering its unique idea, its zaniness and its high production values, "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" could have been an instant cult favorite. But it still falls short of greatness with two flaws that I couldn't ignore.The first is its seeming reliance on a single joke ? the juxtaposition of Austen's proper ladies as badass, feminist heroines in a crazy, Kung-fu, bloody-and-guts zombie war. I believe that's funny and tickles the viewer for maybe 20 minutes. But it isn't enough to sustain the humor for the length of a feature film. It's fun, but badass, wise-cracking warrior women have been a common trope in mainstream horror film and television for a long time. Joss Whedon's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" came to TV 19 years ago, for example; the film that inspired it was five years earlier.Second, for a film with "zombies" in its title, the monsters are a little sparse. I'm guessing the script closely followed the 2009 book, which I have not read ? but this isn't the actioner that horror fans might be hoping for. (And why not? The film falls under so many other categories.) The movie could have been better if there had been less banter and situational humor, and more zombie fighting. Its establishing shots and sweeping vistas were downright beautiful ? I kept waiting for a major land engagement that would knock my socks off. But ? there isn't really a final battle, and the story disappoints a little with its anti-climax. The action sequence that we are presented with is cool, and well executed, but the large-scale period battles you're probably hoping for occur almost entirely off screen.Oh ? one final quibble ? who exactly were the Four Horsemen, outside their allegorical context? And what happened to them? They were nice and unsettling ? one of the movie's few scary moments occurs when we wonder whether they've spotted a protagonist. Were scenes cut from this movie that would have explained their role in the story?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book?I have read it so many times?I have also loved BBC mini-series with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and 2005 movie with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet. I absolutely hate zombie movies?vampires and even werewolves can be OK, but zombies? BIG NOPE! So when I first saw trailer for this movie, I was like: WTF, No!!! At first, I decided not to watch this movie, but after seeing more trailers, my curiosity prevailed?I wanted to know what they did to my favorite love story. Let me tell you, I have been pleasantly surprised?even with the zombies, I could enjoy the way story has been presented. The fight scenes are entertaining, Mr. Collins hilarious and odious as ever, and two main characters have really well on-screen chemistry. I must confess that unusual tone of Sam Riley's voice has sanded my nerves at first, but as story progressed, it became bearable and even added to character of Mr. Darcy. The unbelievably good fight between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, following his first proposal, left me on edge of my seat?him diving into the lake reminded me of same scene with Colin Firth from BBC mini-series(really liked that and other little nods to previous adaptations and other Austin's books?I'm sure any fan of Austin's work and Pride and Prejudice will enjoy identifying them all). Being avid fan of Game of Thrones, I enjoyed seeing two Lannister's on board, Charles Dance as Mr. Bennett and Lena Headey as Lady Catherine De Burgh, can't decide which of two gave better acting. Lily James is absolute revelation as Elizabeth Bennet-action hero, given the fact that her Cinderella was at best shallow (and I really, really LOVE fairy-tales). All in all, this movie is not for everyone, but it is great mix of comedy, romance, action and some zombie slaying, so, in my humble opinion will be enjoyed by most of Pride and Prejudice fan's and maybe even inspire some lovers of zombie genre to read original book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wacky take on the classic novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is based on the Quirk Books novel of the same name, by Jane Austen &amp; Seth Grahame-Smith. England in the 1800s, has been overrun by zombies. Mr. Bennet(Charles Dance) &amp; Mrs. Bennet(Sally Phillips) have five daughters namely, Elizabeth Bennet(Lily James), Jane Bennet(Bella Heathcoate), Lydia Bennet(Ellie Bamber), Mary Bennet(Millie Brady) &amp; Kitty Bennet(Suki Waterhouse). Elizabeth &amp; her sisters have been intensely trained in the main form of martial arts &amp; combat training, to thwart the zombie menace. However, Mrs. Bennet insists that the girls should lay down their array of weapons to kick some zombie butt &amp; get married to the most eligible bachelor in town, as soon as possible. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a highly entertaining film. Jane Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice novel, has been adapted to celluloid, countless number of times. However, Seth Grahame-Smith's decision to add zombies in his Quirk Books version of Jane Austen's classic is gutsy &amp; works wonders for this movie. Burr Steers' screenplay of the novel &amp; his skillful direction, makes sure that this adaptation of the tale of the Bennet sisters, Mr. Darcy(Sam Riley), Mr. Bingley(Douglas Booth) &amp; George Wickham(Jack Huston), feels like a brand new adventure. There is plenty of zombie slaying set pieces. Lizzie &amp; her sisters have never been more bad-ass &amp; attractive. Don't worry, all of you romantics. The spirit of Jane Austen's bestseller has been retained &amp; you do root for all your favorite characters. The viewer really hopes that their story ends, the same way as it does in the original novel. The brand new character of Lady Catherine de Bourgh(Lena Headey) is a welcome addition to the already established characters. Considering how ridiculous the concept of a zombie virus outbreak in Victorian England is, there could have been much more witty dialogs &amp; hilarious scenes in the film. Also, there is not as much zombie dismembering as I would have liked. Lily James is outstanding as Elizabeth Bennet. James' fierce Lizzie, is a far cry from her goody two shoes character of Cinderella, in the film of the same name. Sam Riley is great as Mr. Darcy. Bella Heathcoate is amazing as Jane Bennet. Douglas Booth is great as Mr. Bingley. Jack Huston is superb as George Wickham. Ellie Bamber, Millie Brady &amp; Suki Waterhouse are impressive as Lydia Bennet, Mary Bennet &amp; Kitty Bennet, respectively. Sally Phillips &amp; Charles Dance are effective as Mrs. Bennet &amp; Mr. Bennet, respectively. Lena Headey is awesome as Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Matt Smith is hysterical as Parson Collins. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is not a must watch in theaters. However, go for it if you have some time to kill or, watch it on TV. I guarantee that, you will have a whale of a time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not the best zombie pic I've seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's definitely more Pride and Prejudice than it is Zombies, but it has it's moments of perfection.There was a fight scene between two of the main characters, a lover spat they were having. As they recited lines from the Jane Austin novel, they were whipping each others butts simultaneously, and I thought to myself, this is what the movie is all about, but I felt the flick did not have a lot of these equal parts of Austin and Zombie.Not that the movie was not enjoyable, but I felt it was more about how high society works in the 1700-1800 in Britain, and not enough about the zombie apocalypse that created this alternative society where everyone is required to known how to fight and there is a wall surrounding London to keep the undead away. As a Zombie movie fan, it's not the worse pic in the genre I've seen but it makes the button of my list. I wonder how Jane Austin fans feel about them adding a zombie kill in-between the pages of Pride and Prejudice?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pride + Prejudice and Zombies, what more could you want? Could this be any more fun? Apparently, yes it could. Far more fun.The premise of this film is gold, based off of Jane Austen's classic novel with zombies thrown in the mix - but it isn't nearly as entertaining as it probably should be. That's not to say there's no fun to be had - because there is, and there are several moments throughout the film which are incredibly entertaining - but these moments do not occur frequently enough.The acting in this film is downright bad and the actors merely spew out their lines without any consideration. The script is also similarly quite poor and much of the dialogue seems forced and poorly conceived - which doesn't help the movie when it doesn't really have too much else going for it. Ultimately, Pride + Prejudice and Zombies doesn't fully utilize its intriguing premise, and that leaves it as more of a yawn fest than anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies marks a continuation of the on- screen joke started by Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012). A joke that requires no punchline, nor wit nor effort, just a setup that coaxes you to laugh via hastily formed, idiotic, willfully infantile mad-lib. See I can do it too: Mansfield Park and Werewolves, Jane Eyre and the Golem, Lady Chatterley's Brood of Spider-Babies it's all part of the clever art of mashing things together like a toddler banging Legos with their off-brand counterparts. I encountered the quixotically titled book some years ago and reacted to the trailer much in the same way I did then; a brief moment of mirth followed by an eye-roll and a quick step to the left.Elizabeth Bennet (James) lives on her father's illustrious estate with her four sisters and her mother (Phillips) whom aristocracy is still a big deal regardless of apocalypse. Her sister Jane (Heathcote) is smitten for the young Mr. Bingley (Booth) who has a considerable estate. Meanwhile Bingley's friend, the drab, rich and prideful Mr. Darcy (Riley) becomes enamored with Elizabeth but Elizabeth refuses to acquiesce given that Darcy questions the motivations of the Bennets to see their daughters climb that stringent British social ladder. There's also zombies; the blood- thirsty kind that amble around in search of human brains. They have taken over all of Britain save London and the wooded area known as the In-Between.The original Jane Austen novel for which this entirely disposable piece of garbage is based on, intertwines its themes with cleverness and remarkable universality. Is it any wonder that two centuries after its release it is still among the most popular British novels of all time? The novel speaks of wealth, marriage and a sense of self within an imposing class structure. This movie expressly ignores such themes to shovel lazy fighting choreography in the audience's faces. There is some talk about lower aristocrats training in kung fu while higher classes training in Japanese swordsmanship but after a brief example of Elizabeth speaking Mandarin, the entire idea pretty much disappears amid the damp cellars and drawing room rumbles.But "so what," I hear the rabble cry. It's a zombie movie not an English examination of the lives of landed gentry. How right you are, it is a zombie movie; a PG-13 zombie movie that neither delves into the psychological horror of a zombie apocalypse nor allows its audience the joy of submitting to lewd sensationalism. Its gore is tame, its gallows humor is rueful, its sense of dread, apparent yet constantly undercut by the supposed romance. The satirical possibilities embedded in the genre since George A. Romero are completely absent which is a shame because in my mind it is the only reason something this absurd would exist in the first place. Think about it; nobility and aristocracy constantly squabbling about the economics of marrying for class and stature, meanwhile literally an entire country of mindless, bestial hordes try desperately to take away their titles (and lives).Yeah, nope there's nothing purposefully, subliminally, or even accidentally clever about this movie. Not even its endearing economy remains unscathed though I credit the gaffer for keeping the sets dimmed to cover up their shoddiness. By the third act, continuity is completely jettisoned though it's obvious director Burr Steers was much more interested in maximizing style over telling a story competently.There are moments of attempted humor that go beyond the title, and the protagonists trying oh so hard to play the scene straight. Unfortunately those precious few moments resemble Mr. Collins's (Smith) character; dim, irritating and earnestly overdone. In one scene Mr. Bingley throws a prototypical round bomb at a gaggle of zombies right before a hand reaches for his ascot. He struggles to break free before the bomb explodes in a sequence that would have made Wile E. Coyote proud. That was literally the only moment I laughed; a moment so puerile I felt my I.Q. lowering to the number of my shoe size. See the reality is in the morose, unconscionably stuffy, painfully contrived world created by PPZ there is no need for pride or prejudice; there is only room for stupidity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reasonable zombie may not be a reasonable movie plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it first seem interesting, the movie's plot of mixing in zombie plagues to the classic Jane Austen literature Pride and Prejudice soon become stupid as the movie goes on. It's because the story got it hard to transition between the two opposite polar of story elements of the aristocratic England and the zombie plague. With all those weak buildup, people get easily confused that the movie is still trying to hold on very tightly to the old Jane Austen piece that the zombie thing is just a mere background notch. This made the ending as just below mediocrity as it hasn't have sufficient significance in the story all along. Acting wise, I think Lily James and Sam Riley did enough for their characters, although I blame the story for the lacking of character development. Bella Heathcote, Douglas Both, Lena Headey and the other supporting names did sufficiently in giving live t the aristocratic England vibe, but didn't really do justice for the whole zombie stuff.</fullReview>

I know, I know, what kind of a person who loves to read romances, hasn't read Pride and Prejudice. This girl! And I feel no shame.Even though I've never read the book, I still know the gist of the story from people who have read it, and love it, and have told me all about it. As far as I can tell, the movie followed the main story pretty well. This movie version just included zombies and people battling zombies. But for me, there wasn't enough zombies. All the main fights were shown in the previews. So for me I could have just watched the previews, and put together what I knew of the story, and I would have been in the same boat as when I finished actually watching the entire movie.Needless to say, I was disappointed. The scenes and costumes were gorgeous, The actors did a good job. Although this is just me, but Mr. Darcy's voice really annoyed me. This is not a movie I will say you Have to see, especially to fellow horror movie lovers. And I think the people who love Pride and Prejudice, probably don't love zombies, so I can't recommend it to those people either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that had the potential to be exciting and entertaining but really missed the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The day of the zombie has already broken. Wake and face the light or slumber into oblivion." Elizabeth Bennet (James) and her four sisters are at marrying age. Because of that their parents are putting tremendous pressure on them to find someone to marry. Elizabeth isn't the type of girl who is ready to settle down, and spends more time fighting off the growing zombie population then looking for a suitor. When fellow zombie killer Mr. Darcy (Riley) shows up things become complicated, in love and war. I have never seen/read the actual Pride &amp; Prejudice movie so I can not tell how much is taken from that movie/book. I am also not a huge zombie movie fan so this had a few things going against it for me. I went in hoping for a movie like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter; it was not. The action was good in this and that aspect was entertaining, on the other hand the zombie aspect seemed to be tossed in as an after thought. For me at least there was too much Pride &amp; Prejudice, and not enough action. Some of the performances felt flat and bored. I didn't have high expectations going on, so in that regard it was pretty much what I expected. Overall, a movie that had the potential to be exciting and entertaining but really missed the mark. I give this a C.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a highly entertaining blend of romance and zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We were not sure what to expect with this film but immediately the whole family was entranced. Very entertaining enjoyable hour and a half. Great mix of strong female characters and of course set in a classic novel. We love zombie movies and this brought some nice changes to the usual zombie setup. It was worth it just to see how zombies may have been challenged without any of today's technology.Acting was spot on. It is hard enough to pull of period drama with a straight face never mind with zombies left and right but the cast does a great job. The level of gore was just right but a 15 rating seems a bit high considering there was no nudity or bad language.It was great to hear some of the dialogue straight from the book and a good introduction to the novel for those who would never dream of reading it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wouldn't see it again, but it's a alright watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now some may take shots at this movie for altering a classic novel. But to me this is more like the story taking place in a alternate universe. Kind of like the Marvel Earth-161 to Marvel Zombies universe. At least they didn't try to modernize the book by adding pop culture references and such. It's still a 19th century British drama, that doesn't try to go in the more serious direction. Which actually made it work, since it goes in a more fun direction over the overly artistic style. They made the right decision by going with it in that direction. "The Last Witch Hunter" suffered from it trying to be so darn serious. So I liked the direction they took with this one, with it's comedic elements and humorous banters. It still covers most of the important aspect of the classic novel, except there is a zombie plague and that is one of the source of it's conflict. Watching this movie was like watching "Marvel 1602" the comic book with familiar character except in a bit of a different scenario. Mainly because it has to do with the characters dealing with the zombie plague and fighting a battle against the zombies. If you are looking for a artistic, in depth and clever film you will be disappointed. If your looking for a alright, fast-paced and silly take on Jane Austen novel you might think of this is a okay watch. The reason why this movie won't do so well with some audiences is because it won't reach out to the audiences that are looking for the artistic writing of the original and some audiences that is just up for a mindless zombie killing movie. Because it takes a lot of the elements from the original writing by Jane Austen. Overall, this is a movie that can just go with it and take it for what it is. The casts also did a fine job of portraying their characters in this setting. This sort reminded me of "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" except the fight choreography wasn't as good.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pride and Prejudice...or and there's Zombies in it as well.The story is about a zombie outbreak has fallen upon the land in Jane Austen's classic tale of the tangled relationships between lovers from different social classes in 19th century England.Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is just as ridiculous as it sounds. Just the thought of taking a classic novel and adding whatever monsters you can put in. It's been done before in movies, TV shows and novels. Now we've got this movie and you would expect a film like this to be a fun, gory and just a good time, but sadly that's not the case here, because Pride and Prejudice and Zombies isn't that good or fun.The problem that I had with this movie is that I had no fun at all watching it and the film takes itself way too seriously. A couple of times it dose lose focus on what it's doing and at one point completely forgetting that it's a zombie movie. I know the "Pride and Prejudice" thing is in the title so it would be like that, but zombies are in the title as well.The movie has a lot of interesting ideas (mostly with the zombies), unfortunately those ideas gets brush aside and what we get is less of a zombie movie as it adverse. Yes the movie dose deliver on Pride and Prejudice, but not that much on zombies. Another thing that I was really disappointed with is the lackluster fight scenes, I mean it wasn't anything that special or exciting. Lena Headey and Charles Dance are in this movie and both of them don't do anything. It was a complete waste of their talents and time.There are good things in this movie such as: the make-up was pretty solid, the performances for the most part were good and it was well shot at times.Overall Pride and Prejudice and Zombies was a massive disappointment for me, because it had a chance of being great and enjoyable. As I said before, it had a lot of things going for it with the cast, the director and the fresh ideas for the zombies. This is another movie that couldn't live up to it's title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoiler free: Discounted Classic Lost in Zombieland and Missing the Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and all I can say is, they missed the point, at least half the point and the more important half, which was Pride and Prejudice.Entertaining the audience with an obvious lavishing budget, PPZ could have been taken seriously as a retelling of a classic tale. Costumes were thoughtfully designed, plenty of extras hired with beautiful sets, it would almost seem that Pride and Prejudice and Zombies was of the same rank as the 2005 feature Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley. This zombie infested flake, however, has proved itself to be a discounted classic with a poor man's Keira Knightley, Lily James.Tonally PPZ suffered a great deal of uncertainty as it struggled between being a full blown comedy or a serious classic with a popular cult twist (which could well be rather serious as well). Indeed there have been some moderately comic lines and characters with some mildly nifty shenanigans, it wasn't quite a real comedy nor was it remotely worthy of being taken seriously with the handling of the plot, character and emotions, which by the way should have been the heart of the classic, and also the half-hearted delivery of the timid and iconic moments.It felt like as though the screenwriters were tired of the Jane Austen tale, all the lines that felt introspective, romantic or character building were delivered in the least interesting and superfluous manner possible, not to mention the reservedness of the olden days being half way absent.Going back to the biggest miss of the movie, the handling of the original tale was rushed and sloppy, squandering every acting opportunity for the rising starlet and Mr Sam Riley, they simply read their lines especially with the latter. PPZ should not be surprised by an audience looking for much more than slick action sequences and generic zombies after all, it was the Jane Austen timeless piece in the title, with a storyline that fascinated generations of readers and audience. In PPZ however, it's a bit harder for the audience to relate to the characters and to feel the pride and the prejudice. In fact if one doesn't know of the classic novel, the plot would seem rather forced, which means one thing: someone's being lazy here.Moving on to the actors, although having Keira Knightley's eyes and lips and even her grin, Lily James unfortunately was not given Keira's jawline nor her exquisite nose, which was allegedly a work of surgeons... but mostly importantly, her acting skills were consistently eclipsed by the former, further confirmed in this discounted movie with herself playing the same but discounted character. From Cinderella, the movie star that made herself an international household name more or less, to PPZ, her acting continued to lack depth, in the sense that it looked real to the eye, skillful but somehow soullessly wrapped with inoffensiveness, unlike Knightley in the 2005 film, which was rather engaging emotionally with the convoluted journey to true love. Lily James delivered her forte of inoffensiveness yet again in PPZ, too perfect or too bland perhaps.Poor Mr Darcy was miscast all along with Sam Riley, the mouth breathing actor with the voice of a raven. The eyes might be piercing, but the semi shut mouth (like Kirsten Stewart) hinting to his tiny yellow teeth certainly was distracting. With a barely vocal voice and a face as still as a statue, sadly there was hardly any acting capacity. Studios will find out whether Riley is leading man material soon enough especially after this flake.Matt Smith handled his Mr Collins with a fully comedic approach, which seemed out of place with the rest of the movie while Mrs Bennett played by Sally Phillips lost much of her paranoid and petty comic charm. On the bright side, Jane Bennett and Mr Bingley were aptly cast with the celestial Bella Heathcote and the irresistible Douglas Booth.As a final note, the pride and prejudice in the characters were just as soulless as the zombies while many peripheral characters were reduced into cameos appearances, lacking any significance, relevance or development, especially Charlotte. Sprinkled with loose ends here and there, there were times when these supposed cues in the plot would turn out to not be leading to anything, such as the 4 riders and the undelivered message. PPZ, in the end, wasn't quite an action movie nor was it a real romance and certainly not enough to be a comedy, it didn't really know what it was except from capitalising on the mashup idea of juxtaposing a modern trend with a literature classic, which was quite brilliant to be fair.Let's face it, PPZ only got the zombie part right because the soul in the original Pride and Prejudice is missing. Looking pretty with nice costumes, sets, slick moves and prosthetic makeup is not going to save you.Oh I almost forgot, the music was okay by the way, sadly I really don't remember much of it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>loved the references to classic martial arts movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This turned out to be an unexpectedly serious action picture with a lot fewer jokes than I was expecting. When the opening made such a big deal about Japanese fighting style versus Chinese fighting style I was really expecting a joke on the old --"Kung Fu no good, Karate!" / "Karate no good, Kung Fu!" / "Now we fight! Waaaa!"-- kind of thing, but instead of the predictable joke we got a delightfully subtle reference to the master who snatches flies out of the air with his chopsticks, with Liz as the master. The actual fighting in the movie did a great job with presenting the Japanese trained characters actually fighting Japanese style plus Western style with the Western fencing, and the Chinese trained characters fighting soft style and using firearms that were realistically unreliable as they were in the time period.I really loved the costumes and props, too. I also liked how the movie kept me guessing by presenting what I expected to be clichéd action sequences and then not doing the expected. And I liked how it kept me guessing about the capabilities of the zombies and whether the zombies could be reasoned with, and about who was a zombie. There's at least one character that I'm pretty sure was a zombie that all the characters treated as if she was just a normal sick person, kind of the elephant in the room.The weird 19th century dialogue, which I presume is a holdover from the original Pride and Prejudice, was not boring at all because there was only a little at a time and it was mixed in with the action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The romantic fiction is still grand, even if watered down by commonplace zombie warfare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a resurgence in zombie attacks across the English countryside, Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley) is dispatched to eradicate the threat. When his good friend Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth) encounters the five Bennet daughters and falls in love with Jane (Bella Heathcote), the prettiest one, Darcy is introduced to Elizabeth (Lily James), a girl he inadvertently offends with his callous demeanor, despite becoming immediately enraptured by her beauty, fiery attitude - and ancient Chinese zombie-fighting techniques. As the socialites battle for each others' hearts, the war for the very fate of Britain looms on the horizon, with the discovery of the existence of more advanced waves of the undead - capable of organizing and coordinating strikes.The very idea of infusing Jane Austen's classic, romantic tales of landed gentry with salivating zombie hordes is an innovative - and risky - way to attract audiences with varying interests in the same piece. Few will likely appreciate the middle-class melodrama and the head-stomping gore in equal measure; striking a balance between the incredibly disparate concepts is key, while attempting to thwart the waning of the novelty during a feature running time is no small task. Additionally, transitioning the Seth Grahame-Smith novel into a visual medium requires a separately challenging ordeal: namely, to deliver authenticity and farce in complementary proportions.When the premise gets underway, it's instantly apparent that zombie mayhem will be such a striking contrariety that it cannot be integrated smoothly; rather, it's thrust into the viewer's faces through jump scares and humorous violence (and talk of consuming human brains) that presumes to approach such nonsensical fantasy with a self-aware yet staunch seriousness. And it pays off. Many of the conversations are exchanged with straight faces and sincere deliveries, despite juxtaposing girls in corsets with the arming of daggers amidst ruffled lace, or poetic observations while the undead are hacked and slashed by sword-wielding maidens. The amusement is consistent and the silliness mitigated by a cast that refuses to give in to the riotousness of the script."Who would dare to leave a zombie head in the middle of the floor!" The polished aristocrats and mawkish melodrama of Austen's original story pokes through the repetitive zombie skirmishes just enough to heighten the potency of what could have been a sad combination of "Sucker Punch" and "The Walking Dead." The sharp repartee of Austen's characters (teamed with the outfits, sets, dialogue, and dancing) transcends the mediocrity of merely alternating zombie bloodshed with costume drama routines (and Matt Smith's effeminate quips, which provide a great deal of comic relief). The romantic fiction is still grand (with all of the "marrying without affection" conflicts, mind games of arrogance and conceit, and heaving bosoms), even if watered down by commonplace zombie warfare from time to time (especially with a rather restrictive PG-13 rating); there's enough "Pride and Prejudice" left in this modernized thriller to look and feel like an earnest work.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a fun little movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what was it really about this film that made it kind of entertaining to see. Maybe it was all the women could fight really well and jump from walls. I mean seriously the movie goes so far to say they have be trained by Japanese monks. What the heck? This movie was loads of fun for what the premise was.The dialogue was amazing as well. I was truly amazed by how good it was. There were scenes where they would could speak in there new england accents and dialect while a horde of zombies were out of them and it literally felt like someone of that time period would say if there were zombies after them. Did I mention Matt Smith is in this movie. Because he was and he was perfect!! Oh my god his scenes made me laugh so hard. He was defiantly the best part of this film. I also must say Sam Wiley was also really good in this film. I liked him a lot. He actually kind of interested me too. Some faults this movie has is defiantly some of its pacing. I won't lie not everything here was really that interesting. A lot of it was, but some of it felt dull and flat for me personally. Some of the parties and arguments really fell flat to me and weren't that interesting. This movie could use some more zombie fights as well something to pass the time in the arguing and partying in the movies. Overall I think people should at least give this movie a shot if they can get it for a low price. No it is not worth it to see at a movie theater, but as a redbox pick up then hey why not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets be clear on the fact that Seth Grahame-Smith is a great author/screenwriter and director. All of his books are magnificent genre-smashing works of fiction, and the film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter isn't great, but is far more watchable than this one. PPZ the book was a great connection between the original book and this story of zombies. The film unfortunately manged to lose that very quickly. It became Pride and Prejudice With the Occasional Zombie. The cast was dry with Lily James' Liz Bennett and a hilariously watchable Matt Smith being the standouts. Darcy was unattractive and creepy. His voice was just terrible. He sounded like he smoked 5 packs a day for two years. The opening credits were the best part, and the ending was very anti- climatic and frankly disappointing. This movie would have been better with a re-done cast, more zombies, and an R rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jane Austen and zombies -- it's a no-brainer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that can't be faulted under the Trades Description Act ? you want Jane Austen and the walking dead? It's a no-brainer! Well actually it's a lot-of-brains-er because it turns into a proper gore- fest at times, so fans of the genre won't go unrewarded.However unlike the lumbering, slow American zombies we've got used to in the likes of The Walking Dead and Z Nation, these early 19th century ones are quite benign until they've had their first taste of human brain and often go unsuspected in polite society. But once they've had those brains, they're fast and furious and there's no stopping them ? apart from the Benet sisters and Mr (here promoted to Colonel) Darcy (Sam Riley). The Bennets ? Elizabeth (Lily James), Jane (Bella Heathcote), Lydia (Ellie Bamber) Mary (Millie Brady) and Kitty (Suki Waterhouse) ? are Shaolin-trained warriors, experts at fighting the zombie menace with knives and pistols hidden under their petticoats. But, as the film puts it, "zombies or no zombies, all women must think of marriage," and so the story follows the familiar paces of Austen's 1813 novel, interrupted by zombie attacks and a lot of blood now and again.The good thing about the film is that everything is taken very seriously, although tongue in cheek, and there are parts of it that are very funny, in a gory kind of way. Lily James makes a fine action hero, as does Sam Riley, though his growling voice becomes a bit tiresome. And former Dr Who Matt Smith almost steals the show with a superb comic turn as the simpering stick-in-the-mud Parson Collins.Dedicated Jane Austen fans may not like it too much. But if you can stand the gore, everyone else definitely will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't know what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no issue with the retelling of Austen's lovely story, in fact the idea is quite novel in itself. The problem is that the film doesn't know if it is a period drama, horror, fantasy, farce or action movie. Actually, it's a bit of all of those, but does not combine them well. Based on the classic bits, if this had been a straightforward retelling of the period drama/romance, it would have been superb. The film was very well cast, and really this film was wasted on their considerable acting skills. I particularly liked Mr. Bingley, Eliza Bennett and Jane Bennett, with the former two experienced in period drama. However, special mention must go to Sam Riley, whose portrayed a sensitive but tough Mr. Darcy and carried it superbly. Anyone who has to follow in the shoes of Colin Firth (as per the 1990's BBC TV production) has a hard act to follow. However, Mr. Riley has tremendous screen presence as well as a brooding look which suits the part. On the basis of what I saw, I reckon (if played as a straight drama) this cast and production would have been superior to the Keira Kinghtley movie version some years back. There are comic moments, and some mild-ish horror moments, however there are some moments of farce which undermine the rest. The plot, of course, is totally nuts. Entertaining enough I suppose, overall. Darned silly though! Keep the cast and remake it as a proper film of the book I say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insanely entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two things I've never really cared for: the novels of Jane Austen, and zombie movies. Yet when put together, you get an insane parody full of laughs and drama that is Pride And Prejudice And Zombies. Hilarious at almost every moment, and featuring brilliant action and a heap of excellent performances, I absolutely loved this movie, no matter how silly that might seem.The premise alone is brilliant. Based on a 2009 novel, the story isn't just a zombie movie set in 19th Century England, but instead a retelling of Pride And Prejudice, where there just happen to be zombies all around. Therefore, you're thrown right into the deep end and don't have to wait for the generic impending zombie invasion for some action, because this film really starts with a bang.The first scene perfectly embodies everything that I loved about this movie. On the one hand, it feels immediately like a period piece. The costumes and production design is wonderful, and all the characters speak as if this were just Pride And Prejudice. But on the other hand, this is a brilliantly silly and excessively violent zombie parody, throwing in unexpected jump scares and spurting blood right from the start, setting up the brilliantly hilarious tone within seconds.And then, for the following 70 or so minutes, I couldn't stop loving this movie. Managing to maintain a consistent tone that balances the fun zombie parody with the Pride And Prejudice parody so well, telling both an action story and a romance story in the most entertaining way, with really well-written dialogue and fantastically well-directed action sequences too, and that left me with a huge grin that I just couldn't wipe off my face.What's more is that the performances are all fantastic too. Normally, good acting isn't the sort of thing you'd expect in a zombie movie, or a parody for that matter, but everyone is right at the top of their game here. Lily James is excellent in the main role, and shows how good she can be in both a serious romantic lead (because there are a lot of moments where the romance does take centre stage here), and as a great action hero, making her huge fun to watch right the way through.Also, Matt Smith, Sally Phillips, Douglas Booth and even Lena Headey were brilliant, but my favourite performance of the entire movie has to be Sam Riley as Mr. Darcy. Firstly, the way the character is written here is hilarious, turning the charming gentleman into a battle-hardened colonel, but the way Riley cements that personality with his piercing stare and gruff voice is brilliant too, and was one of the things that really kept me laughing again and again here.Of course, it couldn't last forever, and I do take issue with the final act of this movie. Although it's not bad, it unfortunately undoes a lot of the good work done earlier in setting up the brilliant tone. In the final twenty minutes, there's still some good action, but I just didn't have enough fun, as the film began to turn too much into both a zombie movie, and then a simple Pride And Prejudice retelling.It was a shame to see the final act disappoint, but even so, I had a huge amount of fun with Pride And Prejudice And Zombies, thanks to its generally fantastic tone, great action, brilliant humour and excellent performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES': Four Stars (Out of Five)A zombie rom-com horror flick; based on the 2009 novel, of the same name, by Seth Grahame-Smith. The movie, like the book, spoofs the classic 1813 novel 'Pride and Prejudice', by Jane Austin. This story deals with five sisters, in 19th century England, struggling to find wealthy husbands; as well as defend their home, from vicious zombies. It was written and directed by Burr Steers (who also helmed the 2002 indie cult classic 'IGBY GOES DOWN'), and it was co- produced by Natalie Portman (who was originally set to star in the film). The movie stars Lily James, Sam Riley, Bella Heathcote, Jack Huston, Sally Phillips, Charles Dance, Douglas Booth, Matt Smith and Lena Headey. I found it to be a most enjoyable filmgoing experience.The film is set in 19th century England; where an outbreak, of a deadly zombie virus, has consumed most of the land. Mr. Bennet (Dance) has raised his five daughters to defend themselves; from the bloodthirsty creatures. While Mrs. Bennet (Phillips) just wants her daughters to marry wealthy businessmen. To her delight, the rich Bingley family moves in next door. Elizabeth (James) and Jane Bennet (Heathcote), look like they've found ideal suitors; but zombies threaten to spoil everything.The movie is surprisingly hilarious, that's what I most enjoyed about it; it's full of witty humor and clever dialogue. The performances are all decent as well; especially Lily James, in the lead. The action, and zombie gore, leaves something to be desired though; and the horror elements, of the film, are actually where the film falls short, surprisingly (maybe partially because it was made for a PG-13 audience). It's still a lot of fun though, and sure to become a beloved cult classic!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/0d1sap746-M</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better and fresher than its (zombie) parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never read any Jane Austen novel, but I have watched a few traditional adaptations of her work including Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley that I really liked. Without the zombie aspect, this mash-up would be a mostly respectable and respectful adaptation of the novel in terms of tone, characters and plot if the Knightley adaptation was anything to go by. However, it does "dirty up" the original classic story with undead so it could be blasphemous to Austen purists. Those who consider her writing sacrosanct should definitely steer clear unless they have a strong sense of humour. The story hit the major points and had some beautiful lines, but it veered off in the last part. The whole bridge thing also confused me.The zombie aspect fit surprisingly well, was not too jarring (except at the start with Lady Featherstone), but it was not great, although I found original how some zombies still had enough brains to talk and even infiltrate society for a while. I also liked the facial makeup on some of the zombies. The zombie parts were also the catalyst for a lot of the humour. The contrast between the prim, well-spoken, 19th-century British society and the out-of-their-normal-environment zombies provided amusement. The action parts were somewhat disappointing. As an example, the first time you saw the 5 sisters jump into action, you would have expected something glorious and exhilarating, but it kind of fizzled because the moves weren't thrilling or convincing enough. Although the editing tried to hide it somewhat , you could guess that the actors were chosen more for their acting skills than their martial-arts skills (which is not necessarily a bad thing). Exceptions to the lacking action would be the human-only ones, especially the "confrontations" between Elizabeth and Darcy.I suppose the film is by definition a parody, but it was played very straight, and I don't think it would have worked so well otherwise. Sam Riley, the actor playing Darcy was excellent in his role. Lily James as Elizabeth didn't fare so well, lacking presence and charisma, especially at the start. She paled in comparison with Keira Knightley (in the same role), but she improved later on. The zany Matt Smith (former Doctor Who) stole almost every scene he was in, playing an unconventional Pastor Collins. By re-watching Pride and Prejudice (Knightley version) after this film, I noticed how much the characterization of the secondary characters was cut (especially the 3 younger sisters) and how much the ballroom dancing, dining and conversation was replaced with zombie shenanigans. I'm not convinced this was an improvement, but it was certainly different.I watched this at a sneak preview in a full theatre. The laughs mostly came in the first half. Personally, I smirked relatively often but never laughed out loud (I rarely do). I was entertained throughout though. What about the romantic aspect you ask? It is still there and Darcy's letter is still awesome, but it's often overridden by comedic or horrific elements. What about the gore? It can be surprising and a bit disgusting (the makeup mostly) but it's limited and over quickly. None of the parts of the film were particularly strong (except acting that was overall better than expected), but as a fun mash-up, I think it worked. For those curious, I consider the Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice superior in every regard and I don't recommend watching it too soon before this film because the latter would suffer too much in comparison.Rating: 7 out of 10 (Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies and fighters were cool but a boring story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've not read Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen or the updated version with zombies added by Seth Grahame-Smith but was able to catch the movie this weekend. Though the mix of romance and zombies were intriguing, I found the movie slow and restrained to the plot of the Jan Austen novel. The acting was passable with Lily James in the lead as Elizabeth Bennett. Sam Riley is the romantic interest as Mr. Darcy. HIs voice sounded odd but the chemistry wasn't totally absent. The zombie action was entertaining and any zombies will bring me to the theater and earn a few stars. The story didn't fit very well but the special effects were enough to make up for it. There were some really sick looking zombies throughout the film, and I was glad to see some of them running. My expectations were low enough that I didn't come out of the movie totally disappointed but the story was pretty boring. The plot had a predictable twist that could be seen about halfway through the film. The movie couldn't seem to decide between a comedy, romance, action, or horror and settled somewhere in the middle. I do like that zombies are getting more mainstream movies and the badass women were fun to watch!Check out more reviews on swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Either P&amp;P or zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain spoilers.The film inevitably since the very beginning divides itself and fall apart into two unequal parts, one is about zombies, another is about Pride and prejudice. The part about zombies is better, it is original and easy. The part about P&amp;P is pretty bad. The actors are not great in it. It is hard to say, what impacted on me to make such an impression. Maybe, just the topic (P&amp;P) is so popular so you have seen many very good actor works so in such a comparison the actors of the present version lose. Maybe this is just not their cup of tea and they have just lack of talent. Maybe, the matter is in the very idea, either P&amp;P or zombies and you must be an Oscar nominee to be able to keep such a self- dividing, self-breaking plot more or less integrate. The result is pretty unstable. The part about P&amp;P is bad and worse. I marked 4 for zombies. They are the only convincing actors in the whole film. I praise computer graphic for it and good work of make-up artists. One else actress is OK with the topic rather. It is Lena Headey. And she is here also with a giant bodyguard. So she changed her hair colour from white to black, but she came from Game of thrones and it is noticeable. But the plot is lame here as well, when Mrs.Bennet tries to compliment Lady Cathrine (Lena Headey) I doubt that the answers from such a person would be so vegetarian. Lena Headey is a gem and must have better lines than that, so it is wasting of her participation here. You expect something really witty from the plot, but alas. If Jane Austen would write this part about zombies she would do it much better.So the film is not worthy of seeing at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies doth not make a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jumping on the zombie bandwagon, Burr Steer bets heavily on the popularity of Seth Grahame-Smith's quirky novel "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies." Perhaps, as a desperate attempt to interest people in Jane Austen's classic story of 19th century love tirades, Grahame-Smith creates a world in which the British aristocracy are all trained in Martial Arts, Zombies talk and have some debate about the merits of eating live humans over pig brains, and that Lena Headey is still rather fetching with a plucked out eye. Sadly, zombies doth not save the viewer from an absolute mediocre and downright boring film.Without delving too much into the plot line, the main story consists of a group of young well to do's, forced into what boils down to a tale of class warfare. Sam Riley, Lily James, and Jack Huston form the center of this group and end up in a rather blaze love triangle (nobody has sex in this film, and if it was the scene was properly English and boring). Both men are rivals, from noble families, who have a sordid past of betrayal and anger towards each other, and end up fighting for the favour of the same woman, Elizabeth Bennet (James). Unfortunately the plot centers far too much on this inane romance, which never really feels real throughout the whole film.If you know the original, then you know who she chooses in the end, but this film made an absolute mistake buy trying for a cliff-hanger ending. I won't tell you what it is, but how on earth do they plan on continuing this disgraceful film is beyond me. The zombies themselves are quite talkative for the living dead. I didn't understand why, if they were of reasonable nature and capable of rational thought, that they would not work TOGETHER with society in order to treat or subdue their disease. It seems feasible enough to the viewer that if the zombies crave human flesh, but can sustain by eating pig brains, then there isn't really any reason to go to war against the human population. I understood the context of the elite rich humans vs. the poor and disenfranchised zombies, but honestly it was a pretty thin analogy for class warfare.Overall, this film is pointless and utterly missable . Zombies can't save this story unfortunately, and it certainly didn't save this film from being a box office bomb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And then Hollywood ruins two great novels at once...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin: Jane Austen's novel is one of the greatest novels of all time, beautifully written, delightful as it gets. Then along came a crazy man called Seth Grahame-Smith added zombies, ninjas and martial arts to the story. Right, as if such thing would work! That guy is on crack! THEN YOU BITE YOUR TONGUE CAUSE THE NOVEL WITH THE ZOMBIES IS AWESOME!If you haven't read it yet, do it, it is so much fun! And don't worry if you already watched the movie, they have the same name but their stories are totally different. I'm serious! Not "it's an adaptation of the book" different, but "I'll keep the title and the characters, the rest I'll throw away and re-write it!" different. THAT DIFFERENT!Damn you Burr Steers!For all it! First for a PG-13 zombie movie. I see more blood when my girlfriend bites my lip than in this movie. For ignoring ninjas. You tried to keep it safe with a zombie movie, man with that source material you should have gone totally bananas! For just saying f*ck it to all the strong female characters of both novels. For making me say that Wickham was right! He was the only reasonable among homicidal pedant aristocrats. AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ZOMBIES!Lydia and Wickham "love-story" was completely ignored. We had a two minutes dance between Jane and Bingley... They never saw each other until their marriage at the end of the movie. We barely had any Liz and Darcy time on screen. And the battle royale. It is teased a battle between Liz and Lady Catharine, but in the end just a ridiculous battle between Wickham and Darcy.What I saw was the corruption of literary work about women. Both sources are about strong woman who stand up and don't let themselves be subjugated by any male. The Bennet sisters, the deadly Bennet sisters are no more than damsels in distress, in this movie. They kick some ass and then nothing. THAT IS A SHAME!Casting-wise. I liked Sam Riley, Matt Smith and Jack Houston. Sam could play Darcy in a straight adaptation of the original novel and would be amazing. Matt as Collins was the comic relief, sometimes forced, sometimes perfect, he was quite well in the part. And Jack's Wickham was very good, he was quite charming as was supposed to, but because of the poor writing there was no deceitful Wickham.Among the women. I didn't really saw three of the Bennet sisters, they were barely in the movie. I liked Bella Heathcote as Jane, she was no Rosamund Pike, but balanced the delicate and lovely, but didn't had enough time on screen. Lena Headey was another one. Visually perfect as Lady Catherine, but the few lines she had were kind of lame. She would be awesome kickin' zombie ass and Lizzie's ass also.The so called protagonist, Liz Bennet, by Lily James. As the whole movie, the character was poorly written, so I don't know if she could do any better. Just for taste, I would change her for Lily Collins. I think Collins would fit better as Liz Bennet and is a better actress than James. Bottom line... I was really looking forward to this movie, probably the first one of the year, but it was a mess... It's hard to imagine how it could be worse... The writing was the thing that doomed this project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Premise Bad Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: Five sisters in the 19th century England must cope with the pressures to marry while protecting themselves from a growing population of zombies.This film looked promising from the trailers, but like a lot of films these days can lie to you in order to get you to the theater. Most of the actors except for Lily James are very one note, giving one dimensional characters that are very bland. This is called Pride Prejudice and Zombies and yet the zombies ARE BARELY IN THE MOVIE which is false advertising to many movie goers who are expecting to see zombies. This film didn't know if it wanted to be the actual pride and prejudice or pride prejudice and zombies, the filmmakers should have thought about that before going into production.This film had a good premise, but suffered due to poor direction, for the most part bad acting, pitiful cinematography, and lack of understanding of what it's supposed to be. I normally say to rent a film to give it a chance, but this film doesn't deserve that; avoid it at all cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>on the view of horror there isn't any</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like Crimson Peak (2015) I was looking forward to see this one, original concept. A romantic zombie story. But just like Crimson Peak who was sold as a Gothic horror throwback the romance was more important then the horror.Here we do have five sisters, looking gorgeous and are all alone but are excellent fighters who together tear down the rage of zombies until the D'arcy's arrive. And let that happen from the first minutes, so a romance do build, you know, the one getting working out fine and another one who can't tell they are in love, until the final of this flick. Did I spoil, sadly not, you could see it coming from the beginning.Nevertheless, the zombies do look fine but the problem on part of the horror is the fact that there isn't any. When zombies attack they are being stabbed or decapitated but it's all done off- camera. So no red stuff to spot anywhere even not on swords being used to kill zombies. Just watch one scene with a bomb being thrown towards zombies, they explode and the only thing you see is mud flying. Really? PG-13 I do call that.So this is pure a romantic story in Victorian London. Not one bit of suspense of horror to see. As a love story it's okay but as a horror it doesn't fit that label.Some do see humor in it, I didn't, maybe the vicar I can agree.And still a lot of people do watch this flick, yes, I know why, having people in it from the much acclaimed Games Of Thrones (Charles Dance and Lena Headey) it's reason why people are picking this up. Can't say that the acting wasn't okay, it was, but as a satisfying flick (in the horror genre) it wasn't. Open ending, ready for part 2 if this is a success...Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If they had made us read this in high school, life would have been so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Waaaay back in the day, I had to read the original Pride &amp; Prejudice for English class. Despite being a prolific reader, I hated it. I understood the language, I got the story, I got high marks on the relevant assignments, but damned if it wasn't one of the most boring things I have ever read at the time. Fast forward to 2009, when the book came out. When I saw Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies at my local Chapters, I laughed. It was a funny idea, and I couldn't help but think to myself: why didn't we have something like that in high school? Never picked it up, and that was pretty much the last I had thought of it until the first preview of the movie came out.I will say, I have been looking forward to this one, just because I really did not know what to expect from a zombie apocalypse hitting 18th century England. And what I got was pleasantly surprised. On the plus side, the dialogue was well done, and very reminiscent of the original Pride &amp; Prejudice. The story also followed along the same lines, but with the added benefit of zombies being shot and/or hacked apart at regular intervals. The subplot of the zombie plague also adds to the story between Darcy and Elizabeth. The take on the zombies is also a unique twist I liked as well, and one I don't think i've seen before. The setting itself was also well done. It looks like old England, and the places from the original novel, but at the same time, you can just tell something is very wrong. It really reminded me of the 1996 Romoe + Juliet movie that I did see in high school, and was far more interesting then the original play we had just finished reading in class.Not really much to say on the negative side for this one. The obvious one is that it takes a classic piece of literature and turns it on its head. However, unlike a certain other movie that involves a vampire-slaying president, this one makes no attempt to hide itself among the norm of the time, which helps it immensely in my opinion. But in the end, it is still somewhat classic literature, so I think this will be one that people will either love or hate based in part on their preferences.Overall, this is one definitely worth watching. It's serious, it's funny, it's fightey, and it's even mushy in a lovely-dovey way. And in a dead and decomposing one too. Very well done for what it is, and still retains enough of the original Jane Austen book that you could show this to your English students and they could learn something from it. Just make sure they read the original first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVED this movie....sort of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only failing of this movie really....is that it is simply too short. It should have been a mini-series at least. The architecture of the mash-up was genius. You can't take that away from the movie or the book (which I did not read).What threw this movie off was the pacing. The aristocrat vs bourgeois love story narrative simply doesn't have time to develop under the pressure of random zombie disruptions. And that's all the zombies really represent. Disruptions. They unsettle the "idyllic" life of the idle rich, who's main concern is marrying up for social and economic mobility and making more money by increasing family fortunes.Which is the irony of the story, for those who don't get that. The essence of this story is basically the utter detachment from reality that the elite and wannabe elite, suffer from. It's the 1% ignoring the Occupy Wall Street 99% at Zuccotti Park...literally looking down their noses at the filthy masses. That is why this story is funny.Pride and Prejudice is fascism wrapped up in a love story. But we love fascism. Women absolutely adore fascism if they get to wear pretty dresses and go to the ball. Most want a rich man to elevate them out of the rank and file drudgery of life. They all want to be a princess. It's a very common theme in women's love stories.The problem with Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is, that it just doesn't sell that idea very well due to the time constraint. It doesn't give the point of view of the zombies. I am assuming the book does. I don't know. If it did, we would have a more human face to the zombie struggle. It would be sad of the zombies were just some mindless antagonists. I'd have to think that the author by his very urge to create the mash-up would not have missed such an obvious rationale for creating the mash-up in the first place. This is the ONLY reason the contrast works!!!! This treatment was used by Simon Pegg way back in 2004's Shaun of the Dead parody. But in his version the zombies were used to examine the common man's detachment from reality. But both stories really examine man's detachment from man.Look, I love all the period dramas with the snobby leisure class lording it over the unwashed "human capital". But I also despise those people, which is hard to do when authors like Jane Austin romanticize them and gives them souls. What this story does, is that it shows how the rich have no souls, using zombies as a foil. In Shaun of the Dead there is some catharsis and realization about human connection. But I did not see that happen here as the "connection" angle which would have humanized the zombies turned out to be a zombie plot to fool the rich. So, that is unfortunate in terms of smart story telling and actually just rehashes old clichés of devious anarchists for the sake of action.In closing, from my perspective, the actors held up their end and did a great job with the tight clipped dialog which confined their ability to translate the emotional content of the scenes. So we lose some of that tension which revolves around money and status. But those that slam this movie aren't holding up their end by being actually educated about what this movie is really about. It is NOT about zombies. It's a blatant lampooning of the Upper Class!!!! At least I hope it is.The reason you don't see that, is because the main characters have been gifted with real talent and skills which implies that they have qualities OTHER than just inheriting money. If this universe were true to form, the elite would simply pay the poor to fight the zombies for them. In other words they would pay one half the poor to kill the other half of the poor. Which is how the rich have operated throughout the centuries, while hiding behind laws and religion that says God make people rich and here is the property law that protects that assertion.If you don't understand what I am saying....go ask a communist. They get it. Basically in all history a god, good fortune, and property law have operated as integrated human concepts that serve to keep rich people rich. It's a very cruel machine that creates progress.But when the feminine perspective clouds this truth about class warfare (literally expressed in this story) with love as the central theme, we are lulled into a pattern of lazy thinking. I refer to the litany of similar un-thinking critiques in this thread.Honestly, this movie and the book might actually be too smart for most people to understand. Which is really sad. Because it is so damn clever and really sticks it to the whole genre of money worship literature that women are addicted to. Jane Austin is "Money Porn". But most romance novels are basically money porn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do kids still have to read Jane Austin?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>pride and prejudice and zombies is funny because it is a send up of something you were forced to read in high school. That is if you are as old as I am you had to read it. I don't think they do that any more. The joke is lost if you never heard of Jane Austin, and I think thats why the reviews are down on it. If you do know about the book you likely have kids in school and you should see that it is the old hippie teachers have them reading now. I don't think you will like it. Got to pad this to make ten lines. I don't need that to make my point. You might find that no one even taught your kids to write cursive with a pen. They don't need to know that. Well Seth Greene said it best. He took a great classic of English literature and made it in to something you would actually read. Since most movie goers are high school kids who weren't forced to read it only old people will think its funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh new take on zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's what the title says it is. The zombies aren't really part of the plot. They're just sprinkled on top of the original story. I can't really put my finger on it but the book works, The film doesn't. I think it has to do with how books are read. In the book the zombies just act to add a level of absurdity to a great, and well known, classic story. When watching the film I expect a zombie movie. It isn't. This is Pride and Prejudice. A drama of manners. So it just becomes a boring zombie movie. It's fun how traditionally zombie movies are about how civilisation is fragile. Very little is needed to turn us into monsters. Well... in this film nothing and no degree of apocalypse ruffle the feathers of the British upper classes. Even in the midst of a zombie apocalypse people are mostly preoccupied with saving face and social status. But not that fun. It does have a twist on the zombie genre that I like. That the zombies look like zombies before they themselves realise they're succumbing to the infection. So they behave normally not realizing how others see them. Eventually they go rabid. But points for trying. This is creative and they are taking risks. My hat off to them for that. The problem with taking risks is that it sometimes it fails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is everything you would have liked for a day which combined something between Halloween and Valentine's day. Unfortunately with nothing like that existing, I'd presume that the best chance of this movie making it to a notable list is to become a B-classic. Meaning that bad that is actually good. Although certain scenes manage to convey Austen's fans frustration (i.e. the proposal at Collin's house) over certain passages which we would have enjoyed if they had some more energy, this movie doesn't manage to captivate neither a P&amp;P fan nor a gore/thriller one. The acting is mediocre, the direction somewhat going crazy and the plot that of a nice fanfiction. hard to believe that such a book made it to the shelves. In short what you think you get is what you will eventually get. A messed up classic which could have been somewhat enjoyable but loses focus pretty quickly. A shame really, but still perhaps enjoyable for a low key Halloween night. My advice for those who will attempt to watch it is to proceed with caution. Do not expect anything grand and you might actually enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can I just say as a bloke Jane Austen's works of fiction were not compulsory reading, but mention Zombies and that book living dead walked off the shelf into my collection...well now it's a movie. In fact if you love romance, action and horror then this could be your next date movie. However I'm more of a George Romero zombie kind of guy and while there was plenty of pride at stake, lashings of prejudice there just wasn't enough threat of zombies. There wasn't even inventive ways to kill them despite the gory tools of torture at their disposal back in the day. Did I mention this is a period (yawn) film set in London and surrounds after an undead uprising type plague strikes 19th Century England. Five sisters practiced in the art of war and combat are searching for husbands in a land of zombies...just your normal dating game. Sam Riley as Mr Darcy is no Colin Firth. Thank goodness for Matt Smith oddly as a Parson not a Doctor. Even Charles Dance as Mr Bennet is wasted, but Sally Phillips as his wife is amusing. Special mention to Game of Thrones Lena Headey as a pirate eyed Lady Caroline. The parody needs to be turned up a notch to make this fun and work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pride. And Prejudice. And Zombies. That is it, simple and ridiculous this film is confusing for me to conclude on. I liked it more than I should have.The film is Pride and Prejudice but with Zombies thrown in for random marketable reasons. It's a comedy Horror and as far as these tend to go its neither the best or worst of them, couple of chuckles, couple of jumps, all in all, an alright film.The acting in this film is fine. Not amazing, not terrible, just fine. Lily James if good playing the strong woman who will not change for any man, and Matt Smith steals the show, playing the comic relief character really well, doing the very best with what he was given. The guy who plays Mr Darcy.... WTF was the accent... That's not an accent that people have... It's like he's extremely dehydrated all the time or something.The letter which Mr Darcy writes to Elizabeth Bennett I found to be extremely lazy writing. It's probably in the Jane Austin book but in this film, everything that Mr Darcy did to make him seem like a dick was all explained and justified in one letter. In the film Mr Darcy has done nothing at all to convince the audience that he is not a complete ass and so to have a character completely change over the course of a letter being read out aloud seemed rather lazy of the writers of this film. The twist at the end of the film about Wickham being a Zombie was painfully obvious to me at least as why would he defend the Zombies, side with them and not get ripped to shreds when Lydia was rescued? It wasn't a matter of if but a matter of when really.The film includes characters such as the four horsemen of the apocalypse... Why? There was no point to them at all really as the film does literally zero with them not even having them lead the charge in the mid credit scene so really there was just no point to them to this film adaptation.Overall I went into the cinema hoping to have fun with this film and I did somehow. I can see lots wrong with the film as there clearly was but I still found myself enjoying this film as if it where a guilty pleasure film.</fullReview>

Most of the men in the movie were non fighters and they were a little bit scared of the zombies. Their was one man whose character was called Darcy. He was a zombie killer and fighter. Just like the original Pride and Prejudice. Darcy had pride in is heart and prejudiced towards Elizabeth Bennet and family. It parallels that same story line but just add zombies to the movie. It was a good plot and screenplay. Funny and witty and just full of life. Just like the original Pride and Prejudice. I give it 8 stars and I recommended it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved the romance in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to start off by saying that I am a big Jane Austen fan, and Pride and Prejudice is my favorite of her books. I love the romance in her books. So I went to this movie just wanting to see how the romance was managed, and didn't care so much about the zombies. In fact, I was glad to see it wasn't too gory (with a PG13 rating it probably couldn't be anyway). The worst were the heads getting blown off.I wasn't disappointed. I believe that Lily James and Sam Riley were very good and quite believable in the parts of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. Matt Smith as Parson Collins was extremely funny, and the other characters were done well, though Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Lena Headey) was nicer than as portrayed in the book.This is an alternate universe, so the characters have to be different, too. Lizzie Bennett was taught to be a warrior, so her womanly skills are awkward, and she knows it. Mr. Darcy was taught to be a gentleman, who just happens to also learn how to be a warrior. I think that Lily James shows both Lizzie's vulnerability and her strength. Sam Riley shows Darcy being very haughty, hiding his thoughts behind a calm facade, but who wields his blade mercilessly. I am definitely not someone who knows martial arts, but what I saw was good. Whether it was true to what martial arts should look like, I have no idea. I found it made sense for the movie, and that's all I cared about, not whether the moves were "real" or not. Movies are art, are they not? And art is in the eye of the beholder.The verbal skirmishes between Lizzie and Darcy are great. I think Lizzie's set downs are wonderful and she comes out on top each time, putting Darcy in his place. The first proposal scene between Darcy and Lizzie is quite fun. In Jane Austen's time, feelings had to be internalized, not shown, and if verbalized, in a nice way. But in this zombies time, Lizzie is allowed to be physical in her response to Darcy's proposal (which is all about HIM and what he had to overcome), and I loved the fight that erupts. For the second proposal later in the movie, you see how Darcy has changed because the words are spoken from the heart and it is all about HER. My romantic heart had a big sigh over what Darcy says. I also noticed that there are a few quick quotes from other Jane Austen books thrown in, one from Northanger Abbey (a paraphrase of if a girl can't find adventure at home she has to seek it out), and one from Persuasion (half agony/half hope). There might be others that I missed since I got caught up in the action. I must admit that I do not understand the very last scene, shown during the credits. Is it a lead-in to a possible sequel, or does it mean something else even more horrible?So I got the romance that I wanted and came away quite happy. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because, even though I liked it a lot, I felt there were some scenes missing. I really wanted to see Lizzie and Darcy dancing at Netherfield, and more verbal sparring. Maybe the DVD will have deleted scenes. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I walked out of the theater I felt satisfied with this movie. It wasn't great by any means, but it was entertaining. The problem is that they tried to put so much material into a movie that the pacing was way off. It starts off fast with action then its a slow kind of boring crawl and then out of nowhere comes the big finish. More zombie killing scenes would've helped out a lot in the middle of the movie. A project like this would've been way better as a TV series on a premium channel. I hope they do a sequel to this movie because it looks like there will be potential for more action scenes. Hopefully when this comes to DVD there will be an Unrated/Uncut version that contains more zombie action that was left out to keep it at the PG-13 rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Blend, but editing flaws and dull action take away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood recognizes no boundaries when it comes to making movies of literary "classics." This weekend they have dived back into the infinite pool of plots and bring their magic to the silver screen. Today's review is on Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies, a spoof on the revered novel by Jane Austen. As ridiculous as it sounds, this tale of zombies invading 19th century England is an enjoyable tale that is clever, fun, and quite thrilling with a little imagination. But can the movie match the majesty of the novel, or does it fall flat on it's undead face? Here are my thoughts on the film. The story is very similar to the book, maintaining the clever integration of zombies with society and giving it that ridiculous twist. Our team managed to hit the high-points of the film and portrayed all of the major events that enthralled us in the novel. However they took some major creative liberties to spice the film up, effectively weaving a new story altogether. Fortunately all of the elements are designed around poking fun at the Victorian regality, all maintaining the underlying theme of Pride and Prejudice. Yet though they hit the key points, the editing of this film was rather poor in my opinion. Many scenes felt rushed, quickly stung together in a series that was logical but seemed to skip some details as they sloppily transitioned into another sequence. To me it seemed the editors had forgotten scenes and quickly pasted them somewhere that was deemed appropriate. Not the greatest move guys. Fortunately there was great cast that portrayed our characters and looked the part of royalty. Lily James (my favorite) dropped the glass slippers for boots and weapons as she brought a feistiness to the film. Her character was a nice balance of honor, pride, and skill as she brought a whole new definition of girl power to life. Sam Riley plays Mr. Darcy, and certainly has the roguish nature down pat, including a dazzling display of stage combat that would fit well in fantasy movies. However, he displays very flat emotion and was a bit boring for a main character. Jack Huston on the other hand captured the part of the villain perfectly, capturing all the shadiness, deceit, and ire necessary for a good antagonist to have. Other characters, including the zombie extras played their parts well, but many of them were underutilized, which although matched the book, was disappointing to see. Many characters were underdeveloped and the poor editing didn't help matters, as characters became lost in the background or plot holes this story had. Despite the limitations to their cast though, the design, costume, and makeup teams were on point in this movie. The setting itself was beautiful, the movie filled with rich, elaborate manors littered with English history. Various shots of the countryside and fields of the estate only further brought me into the world, making me feel as if I had stepped back in time to this?alternate reality. Costumes further brought the mood to life with elaborate dresses that were fitting of the times, but laced with a cool edge that many heroes are associated with. And for those who appreciate the more physical qualities, many costumes showed off our characters' figures quite well and that's all I'm saying. And of course props to the makeup department for once more proving Hollywood have the art of making people undead to a science. Grotesque visages superimposed with natural skin never ceases to amaze me, and this film continues to show just how important makeup artists are to bringing the horror of zombies to life. All of this aside though, the thing that truly roped me into seeing this film was the potential for action. Unfortunately I was disappointed once more. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies has little of the adrenaline pumping moments I had expected. A few fights are impressive, but were short lived to mere seconds before abruptly ending. Despite the foreshadowing and story buildup, many of the action sequences are reduced to quick bouts of a character violently stabbing and stomping the victim into a squish, pulpy form (much of which is censored). And to be honest, I was quite bored in this movie, reduced to eating popcorn to stay awake at the many dull moments. So I warn those looking for a thrill to avoid this movie, unless your definition of thrill is rich Victorian dialogue geared at love. Although Lily James leads the cast in this comical twist to literary classics, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies fell short for me. The story was dull, and the editing robbed much of the suspense and quality I had expected from the trailers. Throw in the lackluster action and well there isn't much I can say to recommend it for the theater. Therefore skip this film and wait for Netflix unless you are just "dying" to see it. Cheesy puns aside my scores for this movie are:Action/Horror/Romance: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0</fullReview>

How could it be possible of a 1813 novel to be mixed with no other than Zombies? This must be the effect of good quality marijuana. We have read this novel as a old day English novel with simple themes like marriage, women, English countryside.... the women's own pretty small but interesting world. But this movie ( just the thought of it) is atrocious. Now I think anything is possible. waiting for the future release of... King Kong and Spartacus, The Terminator and The Bicycle Thieves Psycho and The Sound of Music....... I am short of ideas............boarders please help me to find more such juxtaposing GREAT and INNOVATIVE and WORLD CHANGING ideas...............

It has so much emotion and the fighting scene between Darcy and Elizabeth is funny, serious, yet romantic &lt;3 Sams Raspy voice was strange at first but watching it round 2, totally grew on me. Liy James not only can be a sweet sweet princess in Cinderella but also a badaxx, I loved her way of showing emotion hate and love all at the same time!!!

		<shortDescription>Crashed and burned!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So obviously it's the Pride and Prejudice story that we all know, even some of the same dialogue, but with a twist?there are zombies randomly attacking?.yes I know?.Jane Austin and Zombies?Based on the 2009 novel by Seth Grahame-Smith.I thought this is either going to work and be hilarious or this is going to be a total crash and burner?I am sorry to say this was a crash, there was fire, and there were casualties.OK, before I get into all the negative lets start with a few positives?.Cast! They all did a great job, I feel they did the absolute best with what they were given? Of course, every Pride and Prejudice spin-off (even one with zombies) must have a Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy love story. This was actually done very well with Lilly James (from Downton Abby and Cinderella) and Sam Riley (From Control and Maleficent).Lilly James totally holds this film together. She's very captivating and sexy in this, I almost didn't recognise her with dark hair, very striking. She's an impressive actress and plays a great Miss Bennett.Another actor who stood out was Matt Smith (from Doctor Who) he was hilarious, had me laughing in my seat, a very camp and over the top performance ? just great!Sally Phillips was very funny too, she makes a good Mrs Bennett Negatives:This just doesn't work! Isn't in any way scary or gory. It looked very naff. Didn't fit in. The story was pretty confusing. Very, very, predictable.Either have zombies and really go for it, black comedy style, make it funny or just don't have them and stick to the original story ? this was just all over the place and a bit of a mess. They were playing it straight which just didn't work and was a bit cringe worthy. The Direction was OK, nothing special. I would rather watch a really good version of Pride and Prejudice or watch a really well done zombie flick. I just don't get the point of this movie! There are so many great books waiting to be made into films and they choose this drivel!! Honestly - I was really bored and couldn't wait for it to be over. If you're a Lilly James or a Matt Smith fan it's worth seeing this for their performances.I just hope it doesn't kick off a new zombie-adaptation trend, if it does I hope they do a better job!!Watch my review (and more) here: https://youtu.be/kFv90I4SaoU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that when I read the book, it was the first Jane Austen I had ever read. I found it to be a fascinating mash-up. I was curious to see how it played on the big screen and was not totally disappointed in the effort.I must confess that I watched the Kiera Knightly version of Pride and Prejudice to get some feel for the story on film. That was a mistake as all the characters in this film suffered in comparison. Lily James (Lady Rose from Downton Abbey) gave a valiant effort, but Knightly was far superior in the lead role. I did not find the violence to be excessive, but the idea of brains as Communion was gross.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five 19th Century Hit Girls Take on Zombies in This Jane Austen Mash-Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The five Bennet sisters of Elizabeth aka Lizzie (Lily James), Jane (Bella Heathcote), Lydia (Ellie Bamber), Mary (Millie Brady), and Katherine aka Kitty (Suki Waterhouse) look like ordinary, well-bred 19th century young ladies living in England, but looks can be quite deceiving! The sisters have been trained in deportment, manners, and the deadly art of using muskets and swords. The skills of weaponry are necessary in the world the sisters live in unfortunately! Zombies of all shapes, sizes, and genders are rising from the dead and holding the countryside in a grip of terror with their insatiable appetite for brains. The sisters have been trained in China to be lean, mean killing machines against this threat.The girls team up with the dashing zombie killer, Fitzhugh Darcy (Sam Riley)who has a crush on Lizzie Bennet. Darcy owns a jar full of carrion flies that can find zombie characteristics in someone who doesn't look like a zombie. Before the revealed zombie can eat Darcy's brain, he dispatches them with his musket. The Bennet girls are especially quick in killing these zombies and are excellent students in handling weapons and martial arts. However, one woman does surpass the Bennet sisters in the deadly arts. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Lena Headey) is famous for her abilities and the fact she lost an eye during the zombie uprising and wears an eye patch. I heard of "PPZ" and read the book the movie is based on. At first, I thought the idea of incorporating zombies into this Jane Austen classic was a mistake, but after reading the book and watching the movie I felt Miss Austen would be pleased with the new-found interest in her stories! The actresses who are the Bennet sisters and the actor was is Darcy are great to watch in the dramatic scenes and when the zombie mayhem starts, all of them are exciting to watch in the fight scenes. The fight scenes are rather thrilling to watch and when a zombie gets his or her head cut off or blown off with a musket, there is very little blood if any. I recommend this movie for anyone who is into Jane Austen books or into the zombie scene. I do hope other Quirk classics are turned into movies as well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With a bit of effort, this could have been watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film fails to deliver anything to recommend it.The script, a mash-up of half-remembered lines from other adaptations of Pride &amp; Prejudice and forced, stilted dialogue which seemed to have been scribbled on-set before each take, was unconvincing and childish.The acting was static and emotionless - as if the first rehearsals were being filmed in single takes, using actors who either felt uncomfortable speaking the contrived lines or who had never acted before. The fault, here, must lie with the director. Why else would the talented Matt Smith be presented as if he were a simpering moron being given his first chance to perform in front of a camera?The audience is meant to think that the dimly lit sets were intended to create atmosphere but the real purpose of them was undoubtedly to disguise the poorly choreographed fight sequences and to save having to expend funds and effort on special effects.In seeking to create a possibly humorous and entertaining film by combining classic period drama with the current fetish for zombies, the producers of this woeful effort lost sight of both and made a film which stumbles along badly lit pathways, going nowhere, entertaining nobody and saying nothing.For any film to actually work, the audience needs to be engaged, to associate and sympathise with at least some of the characters. The script, the sets, the acting and the direction were so bad that engagement and a willing suspension of disbelief were impossible to achieve.Ultimately, it was boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies never finds a middle ground to this combination and is brought down by a tame PG-13 tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of combining classic stories with monsters isn't a bad idea. In a way, it's almost like a fan fiction that ended up becoming popular enough to get it's own book release. Some random ideas I'd like to throw out there include The Abominable Romeo + Juliet Yetis, The Grapes of Wrath and Cannibals, and even I Love Lucy and her Mummies. A lot of the success depends on either how seriously the situation is taken or how funny the scenario is. The one that I know that the most attention is the Seth Grahame-Smith novel Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (which was adapted into a movie back in 2012.What's interesting was that the movie of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter came out at the same time when vampires were all the rage (no thanks to that Twilight series). Now zombies are "the in- monster" with The Walking Dead show still clocking in high ranking ratings. The problem now is that I've seen a tone of copycat zombie stories that are all about the same theme of survival. While not a bad thing, it's popularity is going to eventually die out too unless something new is brought to the table. Here we get the newest horror/classic story mash, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.After a very fascinating opening that explains an alternative universe where a zombie outbreak is going in England, we find aristocratic Elizabeth Bennet (played by Lilly James) and her five sisters are warriors that are trained in Chinese hand-to-hand combat to fight the zombies (which has become common in this world, though the wealthiest train in Japanese arts while China is the lower tier). Her father wants them to be prepared for zombies all the time while their mother Mrs. Bennet would prefer to see her daughters married off in order to give them a chance at a normal life.The young women attend a local ball where Elizabeth is taken notice of expert Zombie hunter Mr. Darcy (played by Sam Riley), but is turned off by his comments on how she's unappealing to him. Elizabeth also meets a charming and polite solider, Mr. George Wickham (played by Jack Huston) who fancies her, but has some sort of history with Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth constantly considers who the better man is for her as the zombies start to overtake the city of London, threatening the extinction of humans.Pride and Prejudice and Zombies has great idea and an apparently successful book to make it a hit movie, but after seeing it, I don't get it. The story that I thought that I was going to get was going to be a lot funnier and a lot darker, full of? well, good zombie action. It seems that director Burr Steers is more interested in telling the story of Pride and Prejudice rather then the zombie element as I found the majority of the romance incredibly boring. I'm sure that the Jane Austin story is a good one, but the performances feel too stale to create an engaging world of wealth.Getting to the zombies, aside from constantly talking a lot about them, there not a lot of them until the climax battle in London. I kept thinking that Edger Wright or Sam Rami would have gone for a hard R rating with a lot of splatter gore, but the all too safe PG-13 insultingly eliminates what most zombie fans love; the violence. Even the zombies themselves are not the creative and rely too much on CGI to make them up. If anything, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies feels like a movie that's four years behind on what people really want.I'll give this three Pride and Prejudice and Zombies books out of ten. Aside from feeling so pandering to teenage zombie fans, it's a combination of ideas that never finds a middle ground. Unless if you read the book and want to compare, I'd say skip this and read the Jane Austin story on Saturday and to watch The Walking Dead on Sunday. This is barely worth a cup of tea let alone a movie ticket.</fullReview>

The story is somewhat disjointed, bouncing around and the zombies, while they are a bit original, aren't that frightening. Perhaps it's because they talk and run at times, something I hate in the zombie genre. The story is the main problem. Rather than a good linear tale, it bounces around a bit. And the entire bit of zombies finding god? Are they really zombies then? There is an interesting idea about brains that I won't give away, but over all this just couldn't hold my attention.

		<shortDescription>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The literary trend of fusing a classic material with the modern formulas of horror probably started in 2009 with the novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, written by Seth Grahame-Smith; but in cinema, ironically, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (based on a book by the same author) was released first, and the result was boring and insipid. But I'm glad to say that Pride and Prejudice and Zombies had better luck in its film adaptation thanks to the solid performances and adequate balance between Jane Austen's original book and the horror sequences. Nevertheless (I can't believe I'm going to say this), I ended up liking the romance aspect more than the horror one. The characters created by Austen in Pride and Prejudice preserve their endearing personalities, as well as the sparkling dialogs which reveal the customs and concerns of British Regency in 19th century. The social intrigue also keeps being present, as well as the female manipulations to "catch" the most desirable bachelors, checking their economic condition first, and then, authentic love. Naturally, things get complicated with the presence of zombies, who have filtered themselves into society thanks to the new rules added by Grahame-Smith to this mythology. The zombies of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies don't immediately become aggressive cannibals guided by a blind animal instinct. The transformation is gradual, and they only degenerate when they consume human brains. This allows them to hide into their mansions, keeping enough mental lucidity to conspire against "the living". This addition might bother the purist audience, but I found it a valid alternative which enriches the genre with some interesting ideas (such as the "zombie aristocracy"). Unfortunately, the ambition of the movie ends up getting very limited by the feared PG-13 rating, denying any opportunity of wallowing into the blood and violence many people would expect in a zombie film. Yes, director Burr Steers stretches the rating to the maximum, offering us some grotesque make-ups and a few head explosions... but without a single drop of blood. And when the Bennett sisters display their martial arts during fights of an excellent choreography, we never see the contact of swords, knives and axes with dead meat... only many gesticulations and sounds, but none of the "gore" which would have elevated this film to a more satisfactory level. On the positive side, we have the previously mentioned romance. The fans of Austen's will recognize the most basic features of the story: Jane Bennett trying to attract the wealthy Mr. Bingley in order to rescue the family from a bad economic situation; Eliza Bennett and Mr. Darcy in a constant verbal conflict due to very different ideologies; and the pedantic Parson Collins as a "comic relief" at the expense of the affectations and arrogance of English aristocracy. And, of course, all that is splashed by the proto- feminist ideas expressed by Austen as a challenge to that archaic society (even though the film doesn't take said ideas to their last consequences, betraying the ideals of the heroines in order to reach a more conventional ending). And as I previously mentioned, the whole cast makes a good work in their roles, highlighting Lily James and Sam Riley. In conclusion, the film Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ended up being better than I expected, and I can give it a moderate recommendation as a curious experiment whose occasional cons and frequent inconsistencies didn't avoid me from having a good time with this comedy of manners interrupted by zombie attacks. The film needed more blood and impact to enhance the horror, but I was left satisfied with the romance. And I wouldn't be bothered to eventually watch Sense and Sensibility and Werewolves, or maybe Emma in Space, or whatever Grahame-Smith is planning for the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a PERFECT watch for women's day! It so happened that the day I watched the film was women's day, and I could not have picked a more feminist film if I wanted to (and I had no such intention!).The girls are brilliantly charming, well trained fighters, and perfect examples of the different priorities sisters often have. The Darcy was a little annoying with his permanently brooding expression (even more so than E Cullen in the first of the Twilight installments, but at least he didn't glitter in the sun! :P And, of course, the character is meant to be portrayed as such. The action is fast paced and decently enough crafted. I mean, you won't get martial art perfection here, but it is smooth enough for a bunch of Victorian men and women. This is a movie that makes fun of the Victorian film genre and zombie films at the same time, without really being a spoof of either. It never takes itself too seriously, so it successfully avoids becoming ridiculous - even with the title it has. The zombies are also well done! And the twist (yes, there is one) is pretty darn good too. The plot lines are simple and clean - with no extra bits thrown in simply to satisfy a genre-audience. All in all, time well spent. Will rewatch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>10 might seem too much and it probably is, but still the movie was utterly enjoyable. It's a pity there were only a few cinemas showing it here on 1st weekend and we had to watch it among all in all 5 people (us included) in a theater for 200, but it finally seemed to be the perfect way.I was expecting it to be a classic cheap b-movie about zombies and I was amazed by the quality of work that had been done there. Good if not great costumes, nice victorian-age production design, good acting and even a solid plot with twists and u-turns.I really hope and trust it has the potential to become the new resident-evil kind of franchise, mixing jump-scares, action, gore, comedy and - yes - romance. Lily James was fantastic and you will love to hate Matt Smith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously Fantastic...Not Camp, Not Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. Unfortunately, I think the bad reviews are because many people were expecting a different movie (something akin to Zombieland or Evil Dead). That is unfortunate.In short: If you are looking for camp or if you are looking to laugh out loud, this movie is not what you want.The film is a serious take and very well done. The story is compelling, the characters are interesting. It is both suspenseful and thrilling.There are lots of strong female characters who are portrayed in an admirable, but believable way. The movie is intelligent and appropriately paced with numerous action sequences. I have not seen or read any versions of Pride and Prejudice nor have I read the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies novel. As such, I have no idea if having read Jane Austen's book will make the story more predictable or less. Either way, the film is masterfully done and enjoyable in its own right.Just keep in mind that while it is a spoof (and is fun), it is not meant to be funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a big fan Of Pride and Prejudice, although I have enjoyed the newer version, I am not a big fan of zombies. I am a fan of a decent action film. This is not one. What it mostly is an attempt to foist off yet another one of those wretched Mary Sue characters, that got cloned from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I loved Buffy, but the clones she spawned are meager, shallow, ugly things. I understand why they persist, The appeal is twofold. The adolescent boys like watching the big busted amazons fight in their cleavage baring outfits. The adolescent girls, and some like minded adult women, have the wish fulfillment of a female character that fights like she can beat up special forces soldiers, show off her playboy body to full advantage without being called slutty (because a woman that beats people up is a feminist, right?), and who has the boys panting after her even though she is unkind, uncooperative, and most often scowling. There is really never any reason given as to how she can best people who are bigger, stronger, have the weight and reach advantage, superior experience, and seem more intelligent. I guess if you need a reason its, like girl power? Right? This film has a whole family of the things?.and zombies. Oh, and the necessary males for these girls to sneer at, and who will then come running after them. All I can say is Girls; In the real world women are almost universally not as physically strong as males of the same age, and no one wants to be around a snide, selfish, snarky arsehole. Its sad that we feel that is the definition of a strong woman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, jumbled up mess of a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this might be fun and entertaining if not a good piece of filmmaking. I was wrong. Tedious, badly acted for the most part, but then the script is so mediocre I don't entirely blame the actors, some of them, or the director who clearly doesn't know how to direct actors. The real problem is the source material. Just putting zombies in a classic novel is not enough to turn into a movie, it's just not, and it upsets me that this is allowed to happen and that people spent good money making it. Some teenage boys will enjoy this and that's about it. I know that's the target audience of studios these days but I think it's a crying shame. Maybe if you'd had better writers, a director who could work with actors and actors who are less concerned with how they look and more about their character this could have been better. But that's a big maybe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're interested in a movie about zombies then you'll like this. If you in any way enjoyed either the book PPZ or the original PP story, this will leave you feeling very flat. Why they felt they needed to make up a story line with all the outstanding source material is beyond me. Notable issues: -Liz Bennet is known for her mirthful spirit. This LB scowled the entire way through the movie. Honestly, when she cried over Darcy at the beginning of the film instead of laughing off his snobbery I should have walked out then and there. -Lady Catherine represents the old guard of society. She would never accept any positives about Liz Bennet OR shelter her family (who are beneath her) -Since when could Lydia be considered anything other than a brat? Making her out into some kind of hero makes me want to vomit. -Intelligent zombies? Wickham with any real ambition? Which is more implausible? I regret spending money on this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Dreadful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (2016)1/2 (out of 4) Five sisters must try and find husbands while at the same time face a possible zombie apocalypse.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES is exactly what it sounds like. The Jane Austen novel has been updated to include zombies and I'm sure the author is spinning in her grave. I'm not going to lie or try to hold things back but I really, really hated this movie with a passion. My hatred for this film continued to grow with each passing second of this movie. I've never walked out of a movie and I've certainly seen much worse films than this one but I must say that I really thought about leaving.There are all sorts of problems with this movie but the biggest is the fact that you've got two completely different ideas that simply don't work together. The idea that you'd take a classic novel and throw zombies into it is rather stupid but if it was done in a creative way it could have worked. The problem here is that neither aspect works well on their own and they work even less when you put them together. The stuff from the Austen novel is just downright boring here as the cast members simply can't bring the material to life.Then you have the horror elements, which just don't belong mixed with Austen. Had the film known it was stupid or it was at least a B movie then perhaps they could have thrown in some camp, some humor or just something to make it fresh or original. Instead the film tries to take the material serious and it just comes across as stupid, boring and gets dragged out incredibly bad. The horror elements are extremely poor since the zombies are just as boring as the humans. I mean, these zombies have nothing going for them. They're not scary. They don't have any sort of identity. They have nothing.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES is a complete disaster on just about every level. Yes, I will admit that the costume design and the sets are of high quality but so what?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of Pride and Prejudice, and I love comedy-horror as a genre, so this film was a must-see for me. I can't say it met all my expectations, but it could've been worse.I thought the film should have been funnier. The premise is so absurd- yet the film refuses to admit the inherent joke. For me, this was constantly a source of frustration. I couldn't tell if the over-seriousness of the film was a conscious decision by the director, or due to his lack of finesse.Giving up on the direction itself being funny, Matt Smith is amazing, and for me made the film worth watching. He is hilarious. And naturally, Jane Austin's novel has tons of wit to begin with, so some of that humor survives here, as well.The acting is pretty good, and satisfied my desire to see the authentic Pride and Prejudice characters in a zombie apocalypse. Although Mrs. Bennet was too nice, it still worked.The action was fairly run-of-the-mill. None of the fight scenes are too memorable, but it's definitely awesome to see these Victorian ladies and lads kick-ass against zombies anyway.I'd say proceed with caution on this one; only for fans of Jane Austin who have a sick sense of humor. Might be a safe date movie come Halloween.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My film critic son went with me to see PPZ, the day Deadpool opened! And yes we will be seeing Deadpool soon enough. He totally enjoyed PPZ - why: because it's a mix of action, horror, humor and romance.Now the movie doesn't follow the book faithfully, but given that there like 6/7 different versions of P&amp;P it's OK and yes I read the book - the book rocks by the way.No the movie starts with Darcy arriving at a home investigating that someone is affected with the living dead virus. Mr. Darcy is admirably played by Sam Riley, his voice, continence is what you would expect from a male who has been fighting zombies for most of his life.Lily James as Elizabeth - in the book she is the perfect warrior, when Darcy insults her at the Meryaton Ball she draws her knife out to slit his throat - after all it is a matter of honor - not so in the movie, she goes outside and weeps, just a little, but her warrior skills are very good as are her sisters.Bella Heathcote as Jane - the way she looks in the movie, well she could be Heather Grahams little sister and as the character Jane, she is a wonderful sweet older sister for Elizabeth, who knows how to dispatch zombies quite effectively.Another reviewer commented how good the movie is and I quite agree, if you want to see an entertaining movie with a smashing performance by Matt Smith as Mr. Collins (Dr. Who) after you see what movie you want - see this one. The audience was laughing, cringing and I even jumped a couple of points, that's how well done the movie was done - yes there are zombies that are as gory as one can imagine.And I should mention Jack Huston as Mr. Wickham - what a villain - no spoiler of him - you will have to see for yourself.Stay for the movie credits - it is quite an ending!What makes a good movie? When your critic film son is talking bout the characters the two hours afterwards - you know that it was an enjoyable experience for you both!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is clever and manages to incorporate most of the elements of the classic story with humor and ingenuity. Whenever it blends the horror with the original story it's quite delightful. Liked the use of 19th Century dialog while fighting. The filming is beautifully done with sumptuous country houses and landscapes and costumes.Lily James is perfect as heroine Elizabeth Bennett and she is both sweet and feisty. Bella Heathcote is pretty as Jane Bennett. Lena Headey is amusing as the disapproving aunt. Douglas Booth is pretty as Bingley, Jack Huston is caddish as Wickham, Sam Riley is suitably standoffish as Darcy if not handsome. Matt Smith as the parson is suitably repulsive.Enjoyed this movie a lot. Not a dull moment. Worth watching on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie, based on a novel... based on a novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are good things about this film. There are also some things very, very wrong with it.As one who is a History nerd, and a fan of the original novel AND someone who also enjoys the concept of a empire waist gown that can be swept aside to access a bladed weapon strapped to a Regency lady's stocking thigh, I had certain expectations (Some of them not very high).I was rather surprised at how well they handled some things. The Dialogue (at least on Darcy's part) wasn't as terribly dumbed down as I had feared. I was particularly fond of Darcy's admiration of Elizabeth's form and figure while fighting (The comment about her arms being muscular, but no so much as to be unfeminine" particularly tickled me) and the translation of Elizabeth and Darcy's verbal sparring into actual physical sparring in Darcy's proposal scene truly impressed me. The lines were well placed and well executed. In all (apart from some casting objections) the first half of the movie was pretty darn solid.Lily James was just not a good choice for Elizabeth Bennett. She's not a very good actress to be honest. Again - I KNOW this is not a straight up adaptation of Pride And Prejudice, but as these characters ARE based on those of that novel they must, by necessity, follow the behaviors and action of those characters, or what is the point in naming the film "Pride and Prejudice" when Jane Austen fans everywhere object to its mere existence, and the average Zombie movie attendee probably wouldn't know who Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy are anyway. Elizabeth is spunky, and uncommonly tomboyish for her time to be sure, but she is also best known for her SENSE. She's got some very strong opinions about Darcy when she meets him yes, but P&amp;P&amp;Z Lizzie is so headstrong as to seem silly and mediocre. What makes her even stranger to the casual viewer is that she is SO vocal about her opinions on Darcy from the offset, that when Darcy insults her looks, she behaves like a teenage girl who's biggest crush called her fat at the prom, it seems a bit stupid. What is more, Jane clearly shows more Zombie Slaying mettle than Elizabeth. When faced with the undead remains of a mother and baby, she, while horrified, doesn't let sentimentality cloud her sense and dispatches them (I assume - the screen goes black and cuts away as the zombies charge - as she survives the encounter, her only wound being a scorch mark on her hand where her musket backfired)Sam Riley is passable as Darcy. He does carry off the character as an experienced Zombie hunter; His one great defect in the role is the fact that Darcy, while an expert at Undead Slaying, is also a Gentleman of distinction and pride. Sam Riley simply isn't genteel enough for the role. Mrs. Bennett wasn't sensational enough, and an over-the-top version of this character with many a loud, EXASPERATED exclamation of "OH, MR BENNETT!" was very much called for, and was not delivered. My only complaint on the count Charles Dance as the dry Mr. Bennett, is that there wasn't enough of him.And while I love the idea of Lady Catherine DeBurgh being an eye-patch bearing warrior woman played by Lena Headey, she would have been much more entertaining if they had included some of Lady Catherin's more ridiculous lines which would have given Lena some irresistible opportunities to be her Headey-est and chew the scenery in high dudgeon. What is worse, we don't even get to see Lady Catherin and Lzzie fully duke it out, which Lady Catherin DOES directly challenge Elizabeth to combat in the novel (The zombie novel, that is, not Miss Austen's original work. Matt Smith as the odious Mr. Collins! He might be one of the best, most delightfully cringe-worthy incarnations of the oily parson I've ever seen. As with all things, it's where the story strayed from the source material that it began to feel shaky. The latter half of this movie is not only a disgrace to Jane Austen's novel, but even of the direct source material, which, rather than taking the characters of Pride and Prejudice and dropping them in a Zombie Apocalypse (I mean that Literally - A (Suposedly)Biblical Apocalypse, except with zombies, simply sets the plot of the original novel in its entirety against the backdrop of a Zombie infested Regency England. The second half is when it really starts to fall apart. There are some aspects which were wholly unnecessary and go absolutely nowhere. One of the things that really annoys me about adaptations like this is that important characters from the second half of the story, such as Darcy's beloved sister Georgiana, are mentioned due to the use of canon dialogue early on, but are promptly forgotten. After Darcy's initial mention of her as being one of the few truly accomplished ladies of his acquaintance, other than a cameo in a flashback, she's never mentioned again, let alone seen. The name of Darcy's estate in Derbyshire, Pemberly, is never even mentioned.Personal issues with the film:In this Zombie Apocalypse re-imagining of Regency England, young people are sent by their families to study the martial arts of the Orient. Those of wealthy aristocratic families generally receive their training in Japan, while slightly lower class families receive training in China. There seems to be an implication that Mr. Bennett is wiser than other families in sending the girls to train in China as opposed to the flashier Japanese masters with their fancy katanas. I object to this view, as the bladed slicing weapons used in Japanese martial arts are probably more efficient for killing zombies than the straight bladed weapons, staffs and hand-to-hand combat practiced by the Shaolin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of Pride, Little Prejudice, and Zombies Galore!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicked, witty, and wonderful describes "Charlie St. Cloud" writer &amp; director Burr Steers' zombified version of Jane Austen's venerable 19th century novel "Pride and Prejudice," an oft-told cinematic comedy of manners about courtship in Regency-era England. "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" author Seth Grahame-Smith surprised everybody in 2009 when he appropriated Austin's public domain masterpiece, inserted zombies, and ascended to number three on the New York Times' bestseller list. Steers' horror spoof spectacle "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" succeeds in harmonizing the formal tableaux of a classy BBC period costumer with the brain-munching frenzy of a zombie melodrama. Mind you, this swashbuckling, PG-13 rated, parody of Austen's second novel not only maintains a straight-face throughout its outlandish 108 minutes, but it also doesn't ask audiences to endure gratuitous quarts of blood and gore. No, "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" doesn't generate gross-out levels equivalent to a gut-gnawing George Romero ghoul fest. Nobody is torn asunder by voracious zombies, and only a couple of heads vanish in earsplitting explosions of gunfire. Nevertheless, multitudes of zombies assemble for the occasion, and some appear as provocative as they are intelligent. Indeed, the undead in "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" can enunciate with surprising eloquence. They can also set traps. Steers doesn't let the George Romero elements overshadow the amorous Jane Austen affairs that remain an essential part in the proceedings. The Bennet sisters are still out to land husbands, but don't mistake them for delicate damsels-in-distress. Skilled martial artists who learned their craft in China, these daredevil dames can wield either swords or revolvers with devastating pugnacity. Occasionally, when things wax extremely violent, Steers averts his cameras so we don't witness the mayhem in all of its gruesome glory. Impressive production values, a serious-minded cast, and a subtle sense of humor make everything a lot of fun in what might otherwise have boiled down to a campy cauldron. As "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" unfolds, we learn that nobody knows precisely what precipitated the zombie pandemic. Presumably, British naval trade brought about this apocalypse. Indeed, some lay the blame at the feet of the French. Writer and director Burr Steers relies on clever, old-school, illustrated, pop-up storybook type narration to relay the mandatory exposition. Zombies have infested England, and most everybody has taken refuge in London behind tall walls and a massive moat. The agricultural land between London's walls and the Royal Moat is designated as the In-Between. When the zombies storm the bridges across the moat, a frantic King George closes all but one bridge. Eventually, people are allowed to inhabit the In-Between, and landowners reopen their estates. The first character we encounter is the officious Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley of "Maleficent") as he rides out on horseback to investigate a zombie sighting at the elegant estate of the affluent Mrs. Featherstone. Everything seems tranquil enough when Darcy arrives at the estate. He uncorks a vial that contains carrion flies. These buzzing insects are drawn to dead tissue, and they expose an apparently innocent fellow whose wrist has been nibbled by a zombie. Meantime, we learn that wealthy landowner, Mr. Bennet (Charles Dance of "Last Action Hero"), who has no sons, has sent his quintet of darling daughters--Elizabeth (Lily James of "Cinderella"), Jane (Bella Heathcote of "Dark Shadows"), Kitty (Suki Waterhouse of "Insurgent"), Lydia (Ellie Bamber of "The Falling"), and Mary (Millie Brady of "Legend")--to China to learn martial arts from Shaolin masters so they can provide a measure of protection. They can cavort as nimbly on the dance floor as they can engage in combat with flesh-eating zombies. When the Bingley family occupies a nearby estate, young Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth of "Noah") throws a party and invites the Bennets. Bingley sets his sights on Jane. At the party, Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy, and these two circle each other like adversaries. Initially, Elizabeth abhors Darcy, but they grow to appreciate each other. While they are warming up to each other, Elizabeth has to discourage the amorous advances of her cousin, Parson Collins (Matt Smith of "Terminator Genisys"), and gravitates to a dashing young army lieutenant, George Wickham (Jack Huston of "American Hustle"), who shares her hostility toward Darcy. One close-call with the zombie horde follows another, and the undead threaten London again with superior forces. Our three protagonists?Elizabeth, Darcy, and Wickham?find themselves on the wrong side of the single remaining bridge across the Royal Moat when the King decides to demolish it to foil a final zombie invasion.Generally, the best spoofs take themselves seriously despite their sidesplitting subject matter. "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" doesn't constitute a one-joke novelty item aside from its plague of zombies. Director Burr Steers never lets matters get too cockamamie. In an interview, Steers explained, "the big wink of the movie wasn't to wink, but to play it straight." Appropriately, Steers doesn't ridicule the Austen classic but respects it. As the lovers, lead actors Lily James and Sam Riley generate genuine chemistry. Although nobody deliberately plays the material to evoke laughter, former "Dr. Who" actor Matt Smith has a field day as the primary source of comic relief. Smith's Parson Collins is hilarious from start to finish, and he'll keep you in stitches. The make-up for the zombies looks imaginative with their withered and decayed faces. The producers have spared no expense to make "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" look like the $28-multi-million dollar film that it is with its verdant scenery and sprawling estates. Steers dispenses with the usual lessons in zombie killing. When the zombies attack, the Bennett sisters blast away with their rifles or slash away with their swords. Interestingly, Steers differentiates between good and evil zombies. Good zombies prefer pigs' brains, and they don't pose a threat to humanity. Comparatively, evil zombies crave human brains and cannot stuff enough down their gullets. Altogether, "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" qualifies as a tastefully horrific send-up, graced with superb performances, feverish heroics, and delightful romantic interludes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinarily bland.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing that has become incredibly apparent in our culture today it's that we love mythical creatures. But zombies have somehow eked their way into every facet of our lives. Video games, books, movies, and now cross overs with other popular works. This isn't a bad thing though. If we didn't all love it this wouldn't be happening right now. Unfortunately 'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies' may have proved that these pop culture icons may be coming to their final demise, at least for mainstream movies. Don't get me wrong this movie is really bad, but it isn't the worst thing to ever happen to me so lets talk about its strengths. One of the few saving graces here is Matt Smith. He may not have the greatest performance ever but he is the only person in this entire movie with a personality. Every other actor seems to be bored ninety percent of the time. So each time he is on screen he basically steals the show.Another positive is the opening half hour or so. We learn about what 18th century London may have been like if it was deep in the middle of a zombie infestation. Then we get to see our main actors show off their zombie hunting skills in some pretty alright fight sequences. But this blistering pace and excessive zombie violence doesn't last long.As I said, only for about thirty minutes. After that point we get the basic Pride and Prejudice love triangle coupled with stiff dialogue. The remaining hour plus is filled with uncomfortably bland characters spewing uncomfortably lifeless dialogue. And, sadly enough, this is the best part of the remaining two acts.The fact that zombies were included is the worst part. By doing this the film promises fans that this won't be the typical love triangle that they are used to. No, this time flesh eating creatures will be having at them. But the way that they are presented makes next to no sense. Some are super smart, sneaky zombies that can hide and jump out right as the film needs them to.Others are incredibly stupid and let characters literally walk past them. They never impose a threat because the film never allows them too. It only uses them as badly timed plot devices. It throws them in whenever things start to get overly stale, to try and lighten the mood. But, by doing this, things are only made worse.Poorly used zombies can sometimes be overlooked, but stupid characters can't be. Watching a "highly trained" character take off into a zombie infested forest at night is just one of these instances. In fact there are so many things just like this that listing each one would probably take an entire page to write down. And with each one the film grows more and more unbelievable and boring.'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies' may offer an interesting cross over type movie but it doesn't actually do anything with this offer. It promises so much that it can't deliver. The characters are incredibly flat, the zombies mechanics make next to no sense, characters act insanely dumb, and uneven pacing only heightens this bland experience.</fullReview>

When I originally watched the trailer for this movie, I thought to myself, "hey, that looks like a dumb, fun time at the movies. It's got girls in it to. I'll go see that." Now that I've seen it, did I get the movie I wanted? Sadly no. In fact it was less fun, and more dumb, and it couldn't pull me in because of that reason. In fact, I started to feel a bit dumb when I was watching it. The way this movie is written and acted will make you think to yourself, "... what did they say?" That was the most frustrating part of the movie. I literally had no idea what was happening every 20 seconds. It eventually got to the point where I just gave up trying to understand, and tried to make out what I actually liked about the movie. It was... just... kind of lame. The girls weren't as awesome as you'd think. Let alone, they weren't interesting characters at all. The main lead who played Cinderella pretty much play... Cinderella. That's sad give or take, because I was not a fan of the 2015 adaptation of Cinderella, and she's not that good of an actress. I literally keep thinking to myself, "is she a good actress, or is it he pretty face." They also showed a lot of her cleavage threw out the film, so that gave off a lot of distractions. I pretty much just gave up caring about what her characters actually name was, and started referring to her as Cinderella. Of course she wasn't the one actor in the movie, but I really wanted to clear up her character the most out of everyone else. What do I have to say about everyone else is I don't think anyone legitimately pulled off a good performance. I will say something about Matt Smith though. He was the only one who did a decent job of what he was given, and he was he only one who you could actually understand, but his character was so goofy. It wasn't really able to be taken seriously. I don't really know what else there is to say about the movie really. The blood and zombie makeup was aright, and the set design was pretty good for the most part. The rest of the movie felt really dry though. Kind of feel flat at points. Somethings just showed up for no reason. It really didn't take me very long to think about making a review for this movie. I quickly checked my IMDb profile, and it turns out this is the first movie I have seen in a theater that I've decided to review. Usually when I decide to write a review, it might take me a few hours or so. This is basically me just spit balling. Never the less, pride and prejudice and zombies wasn't really that entertaining. Sure it's got some, and I mean some entertaining scenes, but the rest of the movie just doesn't seem to work for me. Can't say I enjoyed past that point. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ and not for zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like somebody wanted to remake Pride and Prejudice but the focus groups said it didn't have enough support to get off the ground so they decided to add in a light smattering of zombies to get people in the door. Sure there's a few zombies here and there but the main focus in this movie is the love story which I have no idea how they expected us to take even remotely seriously with a backdrop of the undead. Also the love story itself was totally flat and unoriginal to boot so all I can really say is do yourself a favor and spend your time and money elsewhere. Well I have to write some more to fill 10 lines to submit my review so let me elaborate some more. You never develop an emotional attachment to any of the characters good or bad and (spoilers spoilers spoilers) also nothing bad ever happens to any of the main characters along with the plot being as predictable as an average game of tic tac toe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racist movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember seeing anything as racist in theater in my life. This is an awful movie. It's as if Donald Trump has directed it. The zombies who have come from the east are not zombies in the traditional sense; they are much more intelligent than the usual zombies and they have feelings, they can be among us without being known, they have their own community and even church, and as the "bad guy" suggests, humans can be at peace with them as long as they're controlled (fed pig brain) while there's always something innately wrong with them that only needs an ignition. They are the Others who are dangerous and we can't trust and, therefore, should destroy the last remaining bridge on the river so they can't enter the land(how about building a wall while you're at it?) The heroes are the ones who kill the sh** out of those dangerous Others and destroy the bridge while the guy proposing to live peacefully with the zombie community who are the seemingly peaceful ones turn out to be a secret zombie all along (Obama's secretly Muslim that's why he prefers diplomacy to bombing people?) And the last scene only reminds to mind that oh, you should have built that wall sooner! It was a horrible horrible experience to see this movie. I felt really bad after seeing it and I found other articles on the internet explaining the underlying racism of this movie. Anyway, if you don't feel the racism, then congratulations on your white American person!</fullReview>
