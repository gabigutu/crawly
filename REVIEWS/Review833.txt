		<shortDescription>The best thing you can ask for in a movie is to be left wanting more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few films I have seen where I was left wanting more. There were non stop laughs, funny sight gags and wonderful actors. It was wonderful to see Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny back together as well. Tom Bennett is truly a joy to watch and steals all of the scenes he is in. The costumes, sets, and acting are all top rate. The script, pacing and direction all make the movie flow at a fast pace. I was never bored and at the end of the film, I was left wanting more. This is one of the greatest compliments I can give to a film. Time does fly when you watch this film and feel free to laugh out loud when you watch it. Everyone else will be.Ten out of ten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austen rocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Jane Austen ROCKS! Sure, that might be a slightly exaggerated description of the writer who passed away almost two hundred years ago, and is known for such subtle and nuanced work as "Sense and Sensibility" and "Emma". But it's difficult to argue the fact that Ms. Austen's 2016 is off to an impressive start. First came Burr Steers' highly creative and entertaining "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies", and now Whit Stillman delivers a cracking version of her (apparently) unfinished novella "Lady Susan".Thanks to the standout performance from Kate Beckinsale, and the manner in which words from Austen and Stillman go zipping by (sometimes honestly, sometimes not), this is one fun and briskly-paced romp ? more descriptions not typically associated with the prim Ms. Austen. Ms. Beckinsale as Lady Susan Vernon flashes spunk and comedic timing that we have not previously seen from her. She fits marvelously in the dress of the late 1700's, while packing a diabolical and manipulative nature more often displayed in contemporary settings.The supporting cast seems to be having a marvelous time. Chloe Sevigny is Alicia, Lady Susan's confidant and gossip buddy ? and one whose husband (Stephen Fry) continually threatens to ship back to Connecticut (as if it were the coal mines or outback). Emma Greenwell is Catherine DeCourcy Vernon, adversary and sister-in-law to Lady Susan, and Mofryd Clark plays Frederica, Susan's somewhat mousy and inconvenient daughter.Though the women are standouts here, the men hold their own. Xavier Samuel is Reginald DeCourcy, the somewhat na?ve and susceptible-to-advances-from-Susan young man, and Tom Bennett manages to steal most every scene as the quite silly and funny (and wealthy) Sir James Martin. Adding their own special touches are James Fleet and Jemma Redgrave as Sir Reginald DeCourcy and Lady DeCourcy, respectively; and Jenn Murray as Lord Manwaring ? one of three suitors to Lady Susan.This spoof/parody will strike a chord for anyone accustomed to the uptight nature of most period pieces, as well as the importance of status, decorum and the corresponding insecurities (a weakness the cunning Lady Susan will most certainly seize upon). Mr. Stillman (Damsels in Distress, The Last Days of Disco) is an immensely talented writer, and certainly a welcome complement Ms. Austen's posthumously published work. It's a deliciously funny and intricate story that features such quips of gold as "Facts are horrible things." Welcome to the zany verbal barrages of Lady Susan, Whit Stillman and Jane Austen. Yep ? zany and Jane Austen in the same sentence. I told you she ROCKS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this an improvement on "Lady Susan"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps this is a movie that only Jane Austen fans can love. I like Jane Austen but I don't like this movie. The non-acting aspects of the movie were superb, and the acting overall was fine. My problems with the movie is the story itself and the director's lack of imagination with it.The movie reflects that, as an early work of Jane Austen, it was not very sophisticated. The writing and directing did not improve on it. In effect, the movie was built on a series of tedious soliloquies by Lady Susan. The only suspense was provided by not knowing which plot elements were real or Lady Susan's fabricated illusions. After a while I realized that I was giving too much benefit to Lady Susan for fabricating illusions. She was clever but not that clever. Her cunning strategies--and the plot--mostly had a short-term horizon that never extended past the next scene. I want to find the book and read it because I can't believe that it had some of the serious defects that the film showed. Most notably, what has been a friendly relation abruptly transformed to a discussion of marriage. I thought I had missed some bridging aspect of the dialogue but checked with my companions after the movie and they had been mystified too. I have a sense that a bridging scene was left on the editing room floor and no one noticed the abrupt change of pace. The conclusion of the movie came too suddenly. Just was it seemed there would be another act, the house lights came on and the movie was over. I got the sense that Jane Austen ran out of ideas for the story, perhaps got bored with it, and so quickly tied up the loose ends. To restate, the non-acting aspects of the movie were superb, and the acting itself was fine, per se. Perhaps there wasn't much material for a great movie in the original Jane Austen work, but the movie I saw could have been a lot better. I think the directing killed the potential for great acting and killed movie overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weakly done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's my beef with Love and Friendship. They told the story. Emphasis on told. Not sure if they didn't know how to build the character backgrounds and cultural implications into an hour and a half-ish flick or what. It's like they assumed you understood some things but, needed to explain the bulk of the story via Lady Susan. Instead of building the story via scenes and acting and playing out the idea and letting the audience think and work out the connections....leave a little to figure out if you got it right or not, Beckinsale's character basically narrarated everything that was going on. As we walked out, I said to my wife, Downton Abbey left a pretty high bar for period pieces. The Jane Austin story of relationships and status and morality was interesting enough. The presentation just plain left it all in the book. You read a book, and you know you're reading a book. Director Stillman just had the book read to us by actors. It wasn't as interesting as that may sound either. I don't know if it was budget over directing but, this was a disappointing movie-fication of a book. Even the period environment was stumbling and stiff. Oh yeah, a hand maiden should do this. Oh yeah, the footman or, doorman or butler would do this. It came across as a poorly staged amateur play, where there was no fluidity. Other reviews said you'd be laughing out loud. Maybe a few snickers and giggles. I was glad it was only 90-ish minutes. If you're coming to this because Downton Abbey made you a fan of that period of England, I'm sorry to tell you, you won't be satisfied by Love and Friendship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mild Mannered Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Love And Friendship" is not classified as a comedy but that's the only way it succeeds. Our website calls it a drama/romance but those labels don't capture the essence of Jane Austen's late 18th century novella, gorgeously filmed and impeccably acted by a predominantly British cast.In a nutshell; Lady Susan is recently widowed and now relies on the kindness of friends and relatives for shelter as she is very short of money. So she bounces from estate to estate endearing herself to the menfolk and is notorious among the ladies. Lady Susan is very beautiful and flirtatious; a husband is needed to achieve stability as well as position, not to mention a reliable source of income (We have to infer much of this information from the plot; Lady Susan is not a flamboyant character, like Auntie Mame). "Love And Friendship" sports first class production values as well as a sophisticated literary background. Kate Beckinsale is good as Lady Susan and the rest of the cast is even better. Midway through the film gets a needed boost from Tom Bennett, who plays the oafish Sir James Martin. He is an oasis in the midst of the arid screenplay, which cries for more of his bumbling presence.This is a movie for grownups in a landscape festooned with juvenile entertainment. It is difficult to find fault with any part of this handsomely mounted production which is graced by Jane Austen's relentlessly clever dialogue and the skilled direction of Whit Stillman ("Metropolitan", "The Last Days Of Disco"). Well done all around despite the bland storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whether you'll enjoy it depends entirely on your love and familiarity with the Jane Austin novels and films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read just about every Jane Austin novel and have seen many different versions of movies based on her books. As a guy, this makes me very unusual to say the least. But even women, who are usually the most die-hard fans of this great writer, only make up a small percentage of the population. Because of this, I feel safe in saying that a new film parody of Austin, Love &amp; Friendship, is likely only to be seen by folks who love and appreciate her stories. For them, this film is a must-see. For everyone else...not so much. Now this is not because there's anything wrong with this new movie...on the contrary, it's very well made and was produced, surprisingly enough, by Amazon Films (yes, from amazon.com)! Quite surprising...especially for a lush period piece. But the average person simply won't understand or appreciate the very droll and dry humor. And, even if you are a fan, you really have to be into the language and pay close attention for all the nuances. Again...not a complaint...more an observation which will let you decide whether the film will be right for you.This film, as in other Austin films, is set in the Regency period in Britain (the very early 19th century). However, the filmmakers actually chose to make the film in Ireland...and it's a nice substitute. When the film begins, Lady Susan Vernon (Kate Beckinsale) is abruptly leaving the Manwaring estate. You have no idea why but soon learn that Lady Susan is a rather poor woman and generally visits with friends and family in order to sponge off them. She also feels no particular obligation to pay her mounting debts...after all, she is Lady Susan! Her sister-in-law, Catherine Vernon (Emma Greenwell) isn't completely thrilled with the visit to her home, as Lady Susan has the reputation as a very beguiling yet vicious woman...all done with a smile. Catherine is also soon alarmed because her nice but slightly dim brother, Reginald DeCourcy (Xavier Samuel) is captivated by Lady Susan and would love to marry her. Oddly, despite Lady Susan being a horrible and conniving woman, when her daughter, Frederica (Morfydd Clark) joins them at their estate, she is nothing like her mother...and the audience hopes and prays that dopey Reginald recognizes Frederica and Susan for who they truly are. However, Susan is determined to have Reginald for herself and instead foist the incredibly boring and stupid Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett) onto Frederica. Can this master manipulator be stopped or will she soon manage to make three other people completely miserable?This film is quite funny but the humor is nothing like the long string of brain-dead and worthless parodies of films such as Disaster Movie and Date Movie. Instead of being broad and written for the average 10 year-old, Love &amp; Friendship is often very subtle and is filled with wit that should appeal to Austin fans. But it's also the sort of well-crafted film that just has a limited appeal to broader audiences. It's a shame, as it's very well directed, sports a clever script and has lots of wonderful supporting actors such as Steven Fry and James Fleet (who is my favorite in the supporting cast). For fans of the author it's a must-see...others might just want to wait until this comes to Netflix or DVD.For fans, I'd give this one a 10. For all others, perhaps a 5 or 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Jane Austen story falls pretty flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The funniest character in the film is James Martin. He steals every scene he's in and each time he was on the screen I couldn't stop laughing. Unfortunately, he isn't in a lot of the film, and the rest of the movie's humor comes in the form of pithy one liners at the end of every scene. Sometimes I'd chuckle at those, but that'd be about it. There aren't any weak links in the cast, they all do a great job with what they're given, but I wish they were given something better. The movie moves at an incredibly slow pace, and with not a lot ever going on, it often feels like I'm being read a Jane Austen novel rather than watching a movie adaptation. The movie isn't "bad" by any means but there's so little going for it that I would consider noteworthy I can't really find myself ever wanting to sit through Love &amp; Friendship again. Maybe if you absolutely LOVE period dramas from a design standpoint or are a huge Jane Austen fan, you'll get more out of this movie than I did, but otherwise there isn't much here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most enjoyable film I've seen this year so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whit Stillman is hardly the most prolific of film-makers. Since his debut, "Metropolitan", in 1990, he has only directed 5 feature films, all of which he has also written, but they represent as fine a body of work as any in contemporary American cinema. His movies may not be particularly 'cinematic'; they are talkative comedies but they are also fiercely intelligent and often very funny in a way that so many films aren't these days. When people talk of Stillman they may be thinking of Jane Austen, so perhaps it was only to be expected that Stillman would finally get around to tackling an Austen story."Love and Friendship", Stillman's thoroughly delightful new film, is based on Austen's little known novella "Lady Susan" and it may be the best screen version of Austen thus far. It's deeply acerbic in a way Austen seldom is and it's also laugh-out-loud funny. Kate Beckinsale is Lady Susan, recently widowed, mother of a daughter of marriageable age and financially dependent on the kindness of strangers.When the film opens she has arrived at the country seat of her sister-in-law, Catherine DeCourcy Vernon, in search of shelter and perhaps a new husband. Her reputation of being something of a man-eater has preceded her and yet she has no trouble in winning the heart of Catherine's younger brother, Reginald. What follows is a typically brilliant and very Austen-like tale of romantic intrigues and misunderstandings, broader perhaps than either "Pride and Prejudice" or "Sense and Sensibility" yet totally in keeping with Stillman's view of the world, past and present.It would be invidious of me to choose one member of a wonderful ensemble over another for special praise since every performance is close to sublime. Still, it was gratifying to see Chloe Sevigny, in the best part she's had in some time, as Lady Susan's American friend and confidante, always living in fear in being shipped back to Connecticut by her older husband, played by Stephen Fry.The closest Stillman comes to making his film cinematic is in his use of 'natural' lighting in several of the interior shots; otherwise this movie, like everything else Stillman has done, is totally dependent on his brilliant cast, the sharpness of his writing and the wit and compassion of his direction to make its mark. I doubt if I will see anything more entertaining this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sadly, a misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have complicated feelings regarding Whit Stillman. "Metropolitan" and "The Last Days of Disco" were great films. "Barcelona" was OK, not spectacular. "Damsels in Distress" was awful, and was justifiably panned. I had high hopes for "Love &amp; Friendship" after both the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald gave it good reviews. Sadly, it was not the return to form I was hoping for from Stillman. Yes, the dialogue was good and the acting was uniformly strong but the story was silly and not involving. I know that with a Stillman film you're not getting strict realism but the film was far too implausible for my liking. Also, Chloe Sevigny was totally wasted in a part that gave her nothing to do. Disappointed.</fullReview>

We are disappointed to say that this movie is not the typical Jane Austen. Yes the time line and costumes are, but sadly that's about all. There are a couple laughs here and there but overall The characters and story line are very hard to follow and it lacked the emotion and connection you expect from her movies :( We do want to say this, just because this adaptation wasn't great it won't be the last time we watch a Jane Austen book come to the Big Screen, because once your a fan your always a fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I have enjoyed most other film adaptations of Jane Austin's novels, Love and Friendship left me decisively unimpressed. Its plot is fairly silly and it contains too many poorly developed characters. Even the more important characters are merely caricatures about whose richly gilded but silly lives I came to care not at all. There were a few unexpectedly clever lines of dialogue but not enough to hold my interest for 90 minutes. We have seen the eras' manners and morals portrayed many times before and this adaptation has nothing new to offer. Had I wandered into the theater without a companion, I would have slinked out after half an hour. It is not a terrible movie but it does not live up to its literary pretensions. I suspected that Ms. Austin would have been embarrassed to learn that such a slight work has gained such attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stillman and Austen stirred together in a perfectly acidic cocktail.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whit Stillman's signature portrayal of the narcissistic upper class is a match made in heaven with Jane Austen's sharply written tale, Lady Susan. Aside from the divine direction and screenplay, Love and Friendship features a gorgeous set design and Whit Stillman's greatest array of cast members to date. Stephen Fry and Chloe Sevigny are often favourites of mine, although Kate Beckinsale effortlessly steals the show here, with her perfectly cunning and ruthless demeanour as the leading character, Lady Susan. As Kate Beckinsale's portrayal of Lady Susan has "an uncanny understanding of men's natures", I can only hope that her performance has the same effect on the Academy.Love Friendship is a 10/10 from me and has taken the lead as my favourite film of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I totally agree with dear Jane in not having let this rubbish be published, good girl, I did not know what to expect and yes, I cannot be disappointed on that score: the actors did their best, everyone, it's well done, like in most of Austen's movie/series' adaptation by British everything is there, costumes, music, language, time, however, this movie lacks the most important thing, a good story behind, Lady Susan is insufferable, unlike Emma she never let herself be awaken or changed by her circumstances, she keeps on as if nothing else matters and still gets away with murder. To be honest, I watched half movie, read the review online and then pressed fast forward until I reached the parts I cared, bought the soundtrack (well done there) and that's it but I would and will discourage everyone to watch this. It's boring, REALLY boring but neither the director nor the staff have any fault on this, the only fault here lies on Mss Austen who wisely chose to keep this away from the public view. Sadly, that did not last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I've never heard of this story/novella, I enjoy Jane Austen's most famous novels and loved some of the film versions so I figured this would be worthwhile. Unfortunately, despite beautiful costumes and set decoration, this film was incredibly dull. None of the characters was particularly engaging and the endless snarky dialog delivered in a civilized manner became tiresome after a while. Small crowd in my theater with a group of women who laughed hysterically at every put-down delivered by the leading ladies but I was bored silly and, despite a meager run time, found myself checking my watch on too many occasions. There was not one character that was likable or anyone that I rooted for. I was happy when the film ended but also surprised as everything just sort of shut down.

		<fullReview>"Facts are horrid things." Lady Susan Vernon (Beckinsale) has just lost her husband and has moved in with her in-laws in order to straighten out her life, and to help her daughter find a suitor. Soon Lady Vernon's intentions begin to show themselves and along with the help of Alicia Johnson (Sevigny) she begins to alter the lives of all involved, some for the better, but mostly not. Being a guy I was not all that excited for this at all. I'm not a fan of period movies, and never been a fan of Jane Austin movies. That said, this one wasn't terrible. I did like the comedy aspect and did laugh a few times but what I really enjoyed was the fact that Lady Vernon was basically a con artist, and that did give me something to latch on to and watch when the movie began to get away from me. That being said, again, this is not really my type of movie, and if you are a fan of Austin and period piece movies you will most likely love this. Overall, for a genre I don't typically enjoy I did find enough in this to keep me entertained but I would not watch this again. Fans of this genre will love this though. I give it a B-.</fullReview>

At first we kept hoping that the plot would build up into one of the social crises that Jane does so well. But an hour into the film we looked at each other in dismay when we mutually realized that "this was all there was."

		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; out of 5) THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A comedy of manners in need of more comedy.GRADE: C+SYNOPSIS: The Widow Vernon searches for love and security in British aristocratic society.JIM'S REVIEW: Finding a suitable suitor is the sporting game and all the rage in Whit Stillman's stuffy but diverting period film, Love &amp; Friendship. Renamed as such, from Jane Austen's 18th century novella, Lady Susan, this comedy of manners looks at relationships with a modern day sense and sensibility, but its screenplay lacks the necessary charm and wit to captivate its audience. The film is a rather stodgy affair in need of some enlightenment and, dare I say, fun.&#xfffc;Poor Lady Susan Vernon (Kate Beckinsale)! Living a recluse life amid vicious rumors of her improprieties circulating in British upper class circles, the Widow Vernon begins to take matters into her own hands. Her goal is simple, though her course of action is rather complicated: A husband is her ultimate conquest and providing a secure future for her daughter, Frederica (Morfydd Clark). She starts to narrow the field of possible suitors, from the rich to the pompous. Her possible targets include attractive and quite young Reginald DeCourcy (Xavier Samuel), wealthy and witless Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett), and already married (and rarely seen) Lord Manwaring (Lochlann O'Mearain). As we watch her scheme unfold and complications ensue, so too do her American friend, Alicia (Chloe Sevigny), and her questioning sister-in-law, Lady Catherine (Emma Greenwell).&#xfffc;The script by Mr. Stillman contains some droll humor and clever asides, but the farcical elements never achieve the rightful level of satire. Too much of the action is played off screen, with events suddenly changing the characters' actions. These incidents seem more like plot devices than actual period responses. There is also a slight anachronistic modern-day feel in the film's narrative structure with the overall effect becoming a playful seduction in the battle of the sexes. Nevertheless, Love &amp; Friendship still entertains its movie-going audience, even if its pace is of the slow and leisurely Masterpiece Theatre variety.&#xfffc;Mr. Stillman directs his able cast with an assure hand, although his film is too episodic and choppy. The mood swings erratically from melodrama to drawing room comedy as characters range from pretentious buffoons to conniving schemers. The actors play their roles well, especially Mr. Samuel as the smitten lover and Mr. Bennett as the foppish fool, the latter breathing some life and needed energy into these dreary proceedings. At the center of the tale is Ms. Beckinsale's Lady Susan, who looks the part and carries of the elegance and beauty of this self-centered vixen, but the actress never quite succeeds in showing her character's deviousness and hidden jealousies behind all of her manipulations.&#xfffc;The period details are impeccably mounted and add authenticity to the film. The costume design by Elmer Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh is flawless, Richard Van Oosterhout's atmospheric photography enhances already exacting production design by Anna Rackard, and a lyrical score by Benjamin Esdraffo lends the proper refined airs of haughty elegance.&#xfffc;Love &amp; Friendship may show these aristocrats as foolish and superficial foils blindly following society's demands. The film creates an acerbic view of a time when men may have had financial dominance over women, yet it was that fairer sex who had more power with their arsenal of beauty and poise...that upper hand ultimately being a simple feminine gesture than made the male of the species swoon in their cunning presence. As for this film experience, one may not be totally beguiled watching Love &amp; Friendship, but any moviegoer will be easily seduced by Mr. Stillman's love of language and style.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't as good as the unanimously approving critics would have it -- I think they are so fed up with movies where the characters wear spandex that they embrace anything made with adult intelligence -- but it is smart, fast, and funny. Kate Beckinsale is wonderful, and Tom Bennett makes an indelible contribution to the ranks of British upper class twits.I haven't read Austen's Lady Susan, so I don't know how much of the plot and the dialogue are Austen and how much is Whit Stillman, but they are perfect collaborators. The sense is pure Austen -- a woman alone navigating the always dangerous intersection of sex and money. Stillman's sensibility is a combination of P.G. Wodehouse and Absolutely Fabulous, complete to the conspiratorial confidante and the disapproving daughter. In his essay on Wodehouse, Orwell wrote that the English seem to believe that intelligence and unscrupulousness are the same thing. Wodehouse, of course, created a whole army of comic aristocratic boneheads. He also created in Frederick, Earl of Ickenham, alias Uncle Fred, a comic sociopath -- a man of great, underemployed intelligence and negligible conscience, whose delight was to make mischief by manipulating the idiots with whom he was surrounded. In intelligence, ready improvisation, utter lack of scruple and self- conscious delight in her own virtuosity, Lady Susan is right up there with Uncle Fred as a comic sociopath, although her impecunious widowhood gives her much greater motivation than Uncle Fred ever had. Stillman's great achievement, besides keeping up a cracking pace, is that he perfectly controls the tone. We are never in doubt that this brilliantly manipulative, completely unscrupulous, shamelessly devious and flagrantly (by the standards of her time) carnal woman is completely justified in her schemes to find rich husbands for herself and daughter, just as we are never in doubt that the foolish men and perceptive but helplessly indignant women who surround her will get no more than bumps and bruises, and that all will be well, after a fashion, in the end. The one character who is actually wronged suffers with such exaggerated theatricality that she seems ludicrous rather than pitiable. This is a real accomplishment -- in lesser hands, Lady Susan could have turned into either a monster or a sermon. One trick Stillman uses to keep the emotional distance essential to farce is to show the key courtship conversations either in silent long shot or, in one case, not at all, leaving the audience to imagine what is being said without becoming exposed to the feelings expressed by the characters. The other thing he has going for him is an audience ready to sympathize with Susan's situation as an economically helpless woman at the mercy of men who own everything. One can see why Austen put this story in the desk drawer and left it there. In Austen's time and for long afterwards, the only way for an author to get away with a character like Susan Vernon was the moral disapproval with which Thackeray portrayed Becky Sharpe and her surroundings. There is none of that here. On the contrary, Austen/Stillman stand astonished and admiring at the verve with which Susan imposes herself on others and the sheer grit with which she tackles her very real difficulties. In the end, her best laid plans are undone by her own appetites and her daughter's unexpected talents, but she makes a remarkable recovery. Along the way she gets to deliver one aphoristic gem after another, at a pace that Oscar Wilde might envy. Great fun, and I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's something very satisfying about a period piece that actually feels like a film that lives in another time and place. While Love &amp; Friendship certainly isn't the thinker or entertainer that most of the films released in May, it has its fair share of laughs and uses its gorgeous locales and famous source material to its benefit as much as it can.I don't consider myself the avid Jane Austen reader or fan of the media adaptations. In fact, I usually don't care for them much at all, but with rave reviews and a heavier reliance on comedy than romance, I decided to give Love &amp; Friendship a shot. For the most part, it's an enjoyable film. I don't know how closely the writers attempted to stay to Austen's work, but one of the main issues to the film is the overabundance of characters. We are introduced to almost every single character within the first few minutes via opening credits, and it became overwhelming as a viewer.I caught on to the characters after a while, but trying to remember everyone's names was quite the challenge, especially when they all talk, dress, and look relatively the same. With that said, it's far and away Kate Beckinsale's film as she plays the infamous Lady Susan Vernon. The story mainly focuses on Vernon's attempt to give her daughter and herself a new match, after being recently widowed. If not for anything else, Love &amp; Friendship is entertaining just to purely watch Lady Susan manipulate just about everyone she crosses. The beauty being that you don't truly know if she's being manipulative or sincere, which is why the abundance of characters actually works in the film's favor.Distracting the audience with new characters scene to scene keeps our attention away from what Susan is up to, hence surprising us with the next reveal. I can't say I was all that invested in the story itself, as it sometimes falls under the clichéd-romantic genre, but watching Beckinsale and the others have fun with the source material proved to be worth a viewing.I also appreciated the film's keen sense of humor at just the right moments. There are moments when the comedy could steer towards over-the-top, but veteran director Whit Stillman kept it from getting out of hand. In all, if you're into Jane Austen or period piece romantic dramas in general, Love &amp; Friendship is probably for you. If not, perhaps the humor and performances can reel you in.+Timely humor+Fun performances+Witty writing-A lot of characters can muddle the plot at times7.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with several friends of mine whom have a shared love for all that is Jane Austen or related...however we we are all too polite and didn't say anything even though we were dying to get up and leave early...this movie was AWFUL - not worth an hour and 32 minutes of my time nor my money. The movie moved so slowly with very little plot. It had the potential to be comedic and add to the collection of Jane Austen tributes that preceded it, however it failed on both accounts. The limited somewhat funny moments were all included in the official trailer and having seen that before watching the full movie there was nothing left to freshly entertain. And I cannot forget to mention that the acting was sub-par which was surprising with such a cast...Bottom line - Invest your time and money elsewhere.</fullReview>

This movie was not about love and friendship but about a despicable woman who sleeps around and lies and sets a poor example for her daughter. What a joke to say this was a high rated film. We almost walked out. The only part of the movie that was "lively" was the dancing. The humor in the movie was rather idiotic as was the person portraying the idiot, though splendidly. I don't want to suffer through any more movies like this in the future. There are too many choices out there for me and this was a bad one.

		<fullReview>Now that the rounds have been made on all of the fine Jane Austen novels (repeated versions, some including non-Austen vampires!), we turn to a rather forgettable short novella 'Lady Susan' as warped for the screen by director and screenwriter Walt Stillman.The fragile little tale ? 'Set in the 1790s, Love and Friendship centers on beautiful widow Lady Susan Vernon (Kate Beckinsale), who has come to the estate of her in-laws to wait out colorful rumors about her dalliances circulating through polite society. While there, she decides to secure a husband for herself and her rather reluctant debutante daughter, Frederica (Morfydd Clark). There is an American on the scene (Chloë Sevigny), a silly foppish wacko (Tom Bennett), lots of lords and ladies (Stephen Fry, Xavier Samuel, etc), endless beautiful costumes and scenery, but the chatter is rushed (perhaps a good thing because the script is fragile when not downright silly) and the story fails to hang together or to involve us.About the best thing in this tepid film is the musical score with some fine excerpts from Boyce, Purcell, Charpentier, Vivaldi, Beethoven, some Handel arias beautifully sung by Chloë Martin, and Mozart ? the famous trio 'Soave sia il vento' as sung by Sarah Brady, Chloë Martin and Paul McGough.Otherwise this is all fluff and no substance. Nice costumes and music, though?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't quite convince</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lovers of Jane Austen costume dramas presumably choose to see films in this genre for several key reasons, not least among these being the chance to enjoy acerbic wit, comedy of manners and romance in the company of leading British actors doing their stuff in sumptuous British settings.A first potential problem for "Love &amp; Friendship" is therefore that, while some of its actors are indeed Brits (notably of course Kate Beckinsale as Lady Susan Vernon), not all of them are (occasionally tangibly not, though Aussie male lead Xavier Samuel does well enough). The token presence of Stephen Fry (who utters very few lines indeed) is presumably intended to reinforce (or reassure the wavering as to) the Britishness of the cast, but obviously fails to achieve that effect.Far more seriously, the settings do not quite convince as British, which is not surprising since they aren't (being Irish, in this cooperative venture between Ireland, The Netherlands, the USA and France). Considering that's 4 partners of which none are Austen's native United Kingdom, you might (I think reasonably) get the impression that Brits and their considerable accomplishments in the historical drama field are being actively snubbed here.But it's a snub that backfires on the makers given that undefinable but readily sensed lack of authenticity...Beyond that, there is the issue of the story's presentation. The makers attempt (though actually fail) to help us out with the plot by explaining who is who using witty on-screen captions along with introduced names of the key characters. Alas, these details are not really present long enough to take in, so in the end we accustom ourselves to the characters and their interactions the hard, old-fashioned way, by actually watching the film. But in the meantime, we've been offered the signal that this piece is somehow sending up, even ridiculing, the genre it is trying to "sell" to us. Bearing in mind the even-sourer-than-usual nature of the original Austen story (called "Lady Susan", and only published decades after it was first written), it may well be that we need no extra convincing as to the somewhat cynical motives of several of the key characters. Presumably no extra (unsubtle) effort to do down or send up the characters is really needed here.I have not read "Lady Susan", but I now have the feeling I have heard some of the lines read to me, given the delivery achieved by some of the actors in this film. This is not necessarily a terrible thing, since Austen's complex sentences several lines long are things of beauty and wit, notwithstanding the wordiness. However, the way we feel we are getting chunks of the book rendered verbatim does not gel too well with what seem to be jumps from one point in the story to the next. Probably I am too ignorant to judge, but it strikes me that the film-goer feels first and foremost that somebody - Miss Austen herself, say - is up on a stage somewhere reading selected passages of her work, while skimming over other fragments "to get to the next good bit." Thus, for one reason or another, "Love and Friendship" does not quite reach the standards of the (UK-made) Austen-based films we have had in recent years, though this may to some extent reflect differences between "Lady Susan" and the great lady's other, better-known works. None of this leaves the film entirely unenjoyable, but one has the slight feeling that everybody here - audience included - is going through the motions just a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very funny tale of a conniving femme fatale who exploits her charm and beauty to outsmart every male she encounters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever a new Jane Austen film appears the purists insist the novel was better. But Love and Friendship (2016) is based on a little-known epistolary novella first published in 1871, so director Whit Stillman had a free hand in interpreting the story his own way. He could have made a traditional comedy of manners that emphasised the airs and graces of the British upper class, but instead, or as well, it is a very funny tale of a conniving femme fatale who exploits her charm and beauty to secure advantageous marriage. Her unrivalled ability to out-manoeuvre and outsmart every male she encounters makes her the epitome of the pre-feminist heroine.Like most Austen stories the plot is labyrinthine in a way that reflects the dense fabric of 19th Century British society. But plot is less relevant than intrigue in Austen adaptations. On-screen text introductions identify caricatures rather than characters and set up the plot lines using Austen's original delicious words and phrases. The centrepiece is recently widowed Lady Susan (Kate Beckinsale) whose sole preoccupation is to marry wealth. Her husband left her a title without means but she survives happily through extended stays at the stately residences of family and friends. She leaves a trail of hushed scandal and both competes with and then helps her daughter marry for social advantage. With Lady Susan the imperious protagonist, her foils are two hapless males: one the handsome and serious young suitor Reginald DeCourcy (Xavier Samuel); the other the hilariously silly but very wealthy Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett). As the novella is based on letters the narrative feels episodic, like a series of comedic sketches, and each is performed beautifully with wry insight into the lives of the British elite. Predictably, Lady Susan is adept at exploiting gender vanities and overcoming male power using little more than her fluttering eyebrows and gorgeous smile.While this is an impeccable period piece with the highest production values, it is Kate Beckinsdale's performance that powers the film. She wickedly charms her way into and out of various social situations with natural grace, and so totally commands attention that her acting overshadows other excellent performances. But this is hardly criticism. For Austen fans, Love and Friendship has everything we love about her timeless classics; for others, it is a highly entertaining introduction to a body of work that is loved around the world. The only thing missing are any signs of love or friendship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Helpless widow schemes to survive in patriarchal society.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We don't really have to wait for the novelization promised in the end credits for Lady Susan Vernon to be "thoroughly vindicated." It's in the film. Whit Stillman's reading of Jane Austen's novella anatomizes the constrictions the male- cantered social structure places on women and the manipulations and wiles women need to survive them. However dishonest, cunning, manipulative, cynical and both amoral and immoral she may be, Lady Susan does what she has to do to survive in an antipathetic social order. Her survival and her daughter's marriage validate her schemes.The narrative arc moves from the widow Lady Susan's banishment from the Manwaring estate, where she has been seducing the master, to her daughter's wedding. There Lady Susan is titularly married to a wealthy fool but is carrying Manwaring's child. The plot is Lady Susan's triumph despite a series of exposures and failed plans. There is a clear discrepancy between the genders' power and worth in this battle of the sexes. Only Susan and Manwaring have any religious spark; everyone else reads vapid. More importantly, Manwaring apart all the men are hapless tools and gulls. The intelligence, sensitivity, awareness and the capacity to plan and to act rest solely in the women. Yet the men have all the power, all the authority. The women can effect their desires only by manipulating the foolish men. As a penniless widow with a young daughter Lady Susan can be forgiven her manipulations of the silly men who don't deserve their authority and power.Susan's sister-in-law Catherine is a positive contrast. She has Susan's insight into male vanity and helplessness along with her ability to manipulate her husband. But she is direct and forthright about it. She deploys her cunning to protect her gullible brother and to preserve her family's honour. Unlike Susan, though, Catherine can afford to be thus open.The three other women reflect their gender's powerlessness. The American Alicia Johnson must sneak forbidden meetings with her close friend Susan under her husband's threat of exile back to the dread Connecticut. Manwaring's abandoned wife, despite her wealth and her protection by said Mr Johnson, is reduced to mad wailing by her humiliation. Susan reduces her supposed friend Mrs Cross to unpaid attendant until necessity finds her a job ? until which she is at her "friend's" mercy for sustenance. Susan's assertiveness gains validation from these examples of women's helplessness in a patriarchal society. The tension between a placid formal social surface and the tensions of gender warfare plays out in Manwaring's name. As spelled, the name suggests the external face of manliness, the man that is worn whether for shelter, warmth or protection in a society biased against women. But the name is pronounced Mannering, as if the manners and social conventions are part of the patriarchal ordering that ensures the men's advantage over women, however foolish and redundant the men ? and needy and worthy the women. The young and handsome Reginald, for all his character and virtue, proves Susan's most gullible prey. He is the film's most articulate man, in contrast to the verbally silliest, Owen, whom Susan initially plots to marry her daughter then weds herself to cover for her pregnancy by Manwaring. The other men speak in the short bursts of period foppery ? except for Manwaring, who speaks not a word. As the sexual and motive force in the film, his wordless power contrasts to his partner Susan's chatter and trickery and the other men's vacuity. Manwaring's expression is strictly in his stone face and steely eye. That he is Susan's object and objective reminds us of the imbalance of power between the sexes. It is for his cold protection and hot embrace that Lady Susan so chillingly conducts herself. Not entirely to her discredit, when we gauge her need and the helplessness of the recessive women.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen The Last Days of Disco on television about 13, or more years ago (when they actually showed interesting movies on television late at night) and having been introduced to the other works of writer/director Whit Stillman through some good friends of mine (they all mutually love his work), I then became a fan of his whole body of work including Metropolitan and Barcelona as well (I still need to see Damsels in Distress as it is the only piece of work by him that I still have yet to see). I have admired and enjoyed all of these films in equal measure and over the years I was surprised to see that Stillman has worked very sporadically on films over the years as there was a difference of over 10 years when he made The Last Days of Disco and then did Damsels in Distress all those years later with nothing in between. I believe I have read that Stillman had since moved to Europe and had even been a professor of sorts, teaching in various colleges, or universities, so that may explain his absence from films for that period of time. Almost very much the same case as Terrence Malick, who like Stillman for a time went without making a film for quite awhile and in both cases they seem to keep their private lives very private and focus more on the work they do in front of and behind the camera, more, or less letting the films speak for themselves. When, I first heard that Stillman was going to re team with his actresses from The Last Days of Disco (Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny) to do a period piece film based on a Jane Austen novella that wasn't published till after she had died, my interest was immediately peaked. Granted, I have never read a Jane Austen novel, or to my knowledge seen any of the film adaptations of said novels unless in passing I had seen something on Masterpiece Theatre on Sunday nights, but if I had it has been a long time and I remember nothing. Having now seen the finished product called Love &amp; Friendship, which is based on the novella Lady Susan, I can now entirely see why Whit Stillman chose this as his next project and why he was the most perfect director for the job and why he pulled it off so perfectly. I do not know what Austen's other novels, or the film adaptations consist of, but Love &amp; Friendship is certainly a very humorous film and if one was to try and classify it, I would certainly label it as a comedy. The humour though is very much in the exact same style, tone and with the acid wit that fans of Stillman have come to know and love through his films and especially through the scene stealing characters that Chris Eigeman would always play, who for the most part were overly confident characters bordering on narcissism and arrogance who you could not help but laugh and totally enjoy them for their lack of tact, or feelings for others with what they would say and do. If you are a fan of that type of humour and you like your laughs with wit, dry and a bit of acidity then you have come to the right film with Love &amp; Friendship. The screenplay here is so brilliantly done that it not only takes us into this period piece world, but involves us into the complicated goings on of the characters and the oh so complicated webs they weave. Characters who are busy bodies, gossips and some who are just unbeknownst to themselves just lovable fools are all on display here and we have a good time both laughing at them and with them as well. The acting from the entire cast is the best ensemble cast that I have seen this year so far and they bring these lively characters and sharp dialogue to life with such skill and precision that they make it look easy when I am pretty sure it is not. This is a film with a wonderful sense of humour, but also a certain amount of playfulness and just plain frolicking and fun as well. Never have I enjoyed myself so thoroughly with a film of this kind, or at least not in recent memory. This deserves to be nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for Stillman and I also hope his extremely talented cast doesn't get overlooked either. For fans of classic literature, or for any of the reasons above, this film is a must see and my absolute favourite film of the year so far. I am so glad that Stillman is back making movies and has a sure fire hit on his hands and I literally can not wait to see what his next project will be as this one ranks up there with his very best. A masterpiece that I am glad is doing so well in limited release and I hope continues to be discovered by mature movie goers.</fullReview>

Every aspect of the film is immaculate?the brisk editing, sparkling script, gorgeous costumes, twisted plot, evocative music and splendid performances. Kate Beckinsale is delicious as Lady Susan, with the cold self-command and upturned lip of the accomplished Regency villain. Never was wrongdoing so likable. Tom Bennett makes a splendidly idiotic Sir James Martin, whose perfectly-timed cloth-brained monologues are some of the movie's most delightful moments. But really Whit Stillman has found the best in all his actors, and every scene is a little masterpiece."Lady Susan" is the least well known of Austen's novels, and I've never understood why. It has all the acid of Austen's best satire, all the wit of her best dialogue and all the clarity of her best prose. It is the only novel of hers whose protagonist is a villain, and Lady Susan is one of the most wonderful villains in English literature, as attractive as she is dangerous, and as likable as she is cold. It is also Austen's only epistolary novel, and Stillman should be credited for turning a novel of letters into a film of such grace and poise.This is an extravagant movie, I had a good belly-laugh watching it, and its acidic representation of society's elites could not fit better with the cynical mood of the present times. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Unstoppable as a Hurricane: Lady Susan Blows Them Over!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this brilliantly funny movie, writer-director Whit Stillman takes on a lesser-known early Jane Austen novella, Lady Susan. It's a a gem of female manipulation cut and polished on male cluelessness, and Lady Susan Vernon is the lapidarist in chief. In this early epistolary novel (probably written when Austen was only 23), the author's disdain for the treatment of women is evident, and her character gets her revenge, deliciously. Though it's still the cake underneath her better-known novels, there it's masked by a thicker romantic frosting (see this recent post about the dark subtext of Austen's novels). Near-penniless, Lady Susan must find a husband for herself and her daughter, and Kate Beckinsale is a powerful Susan, "the most accomplished flirt in all England." The cast is strong, with Chloë Sevigny as the American Alicia Johnson, Susan's co-conspirator, eager to avoid being returned to Connecticut, Susan's perceptive sister-in-law Catherine (played by Emma Greenwell), and long-suffering daughter Frederica (Morfydd Clark). Jemma Redgrave, playing Catherine's mother, immediately reveals herself as an heir to the British acting family through her strong physical resemblance to auntie Vanessa. The men are cheerfully dim-witted, none more so than Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett). With ?10,000 a year, he's as rich as Darcy. But he's also "a bit of a rattle"?"Regency slang for blithering idiot," A.O. Scott reminds us in The New York Times. "How jolly! Tiny green balls. What are they called?" Sir James asks, pushing them around his dinner plate. "Peas." Catherine's brother Reginald (Xavier Samuel) is not dim, but even he is no match for Susan's calculated charm offensive and her "uncanny understanding of men's natures." Quite apropos of the current political season, friends Susan and Alicia blithely justify their most outrageous behavior, putting themselves always on the high ground. At one point, when confronted with her own irrefutable error, Susan snaps, "Facts are horrid things." Clearly, a woman for this season. Above and beyond the satisfying plot, delicious characters, and irresistible pull toward respectable matrimony, the charming countryside (filmed in Ireland) and gorgeous costumes are worth the price of admission. Over the story, widow Susan's costumes go from all-black deep mourning, to light mourning (grey and lavender), to none at all. When she dons that scarlet dress, look out! "It all ends up pretty much as expected," Scott says, "and yet also manages to take you by surprise."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not very familiar with Jane Austen novels, and I'm not a huge fans of these types of films, and perhaps that's why I found it so refreshing and really surprising. I figured it would be a really light-hearted, romantic, sweet little film. I had no idea that Kate Beckinsale would be playing such an unlikable character (within the film of course, I loved the character). It really is very much a stage play in the way it is executed, but I think that allows for the witty, fun dialogue to pop even more. I don't know if I would call it a great film, and the extremely high acclaim does surprise me, but definitely better than I would have thought when it was first announced. I also loved Beckinsale in the role, very fun, but I also don't think it's a very challenging role and I could easily see her being ignored for awards traction as the months go on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A witty work but too much going on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American Whit Stillman has written, produced and directed this very English film which adapts the title of one early Jane Austen work ("Love And Freindship" sic) and the story of a unfinished novella only published after her death ("Lady Susan") to tell an amusing tale of English high society in the 1790s with a sharply witty script plus gorgeously attractive costumes, furnishings and locations (all in fact in Ireland). At the heart of all the intrigue is Lady Susan Vernon herself, recently widowed, beautiful, clever, and endlessly scheming, played brilliantly by Kate Beckinsale, but the cast is embellished with a host of fine character actors. Lady Susan knows how to manipulate men and indeed just about all the male roles are simple or silly. The real problem though is that there are too many players (over a dozen) and too much scheming for the viewer always to know what is going on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of 19th Century period movies, but Love &amp; Friendship was surprisingly entertaining! The main thing I liked about it was its pace - at only 90 minutes the movie moves quickly and energetically, romping through the scenes and dialogue swiftly. Although this is mostly a positive point, I did miss a few lines of conversation (because it takes a second or two for me to process the olde English!).The acting was brilliant across the board, each performance was natural and believable, particularly Beckinsale's and Bennett's (the latter providing most of the comedy as the bumbling upper class twit). The tone of the movie is also admirably fairly light, without getting so serious and up itself, with as stylish editing as you'll see for the genre.The story, for me, is a little disappointing though - there are hundreds of period dramas whose primary focus is marriage. The theme has been done to death, and this movie (although lighter than usual) brings nothing new to it. Fortunately the dialogue is natural and witty enough to keep the attention fixed on each conversation, rather than the overall narrative.Well written, adapted, directed and performed, with terrific editing and costumes. An enjoyable 90 minutes - definitely worth a watch!4/5</fullReview>

Lady Susan (Kate Beckinsale) We have lived through countless adaptations of Jane Austen's late 18th and early 19th-century romances, not the least Pride and Prejudice, but I guarantee none of us has seen the likes of Whit Stillman's Love &amp; Friendship, which uses Austen's novella, Lady Susan, as its source. The lady's quote above should give you the flavor of her sweet venom that manipulates the most stolid and wary gentleman.Where the usual screen version is chock-full of sumptuous estates, carriages, and costumes, Stillman's take starts with rich language, at times delivered with screwball pace, and adds the other elements as mere backdrop to drop-dead acid discourse with the upper-class men ample fodder for Austen's satirical pen.Any man's match and then some, the Lady says this about Stephen Fry's Mr. Johnson, "Too old to be governable, and too young to die." When she learns that he could serve his wife a punishment by moving to Connecticut, Lady Susan says, "You could be scalped." Even the Americans are not spared her withering estimation.As a woman in a man's world, Lady Susan navigates the best way she can: Her tongue and her lovely visage are formidable weapons in her quest to provide comfortable living for herself and her underachieving daughter, Frederica (Morfydd Clark).Even the sub-plots are masterfully rendered, humorous in themselves but never overshadowing the main action of Lady Susan working everyone for her comfort and advancement. When Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett) is in a scene, watch a future comedy star in the making, but note how he doesn't dominate the scene but rather enriches it with his endearing blockheadness.Love &amp; Friendship is one of the finest Austen adaptations in film history and surely a brilliant testimony to the enduring charm of romance and its hyper-form, the screwball comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chick Flick - Men, prepare to drink</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this beautiful, charming period piece and it was one of those films that make men crawl up the wall. My wife loved it. I was bored out of my mind. Not to abandon some good things - the costumes are fine and Kate is gorgeous. Well mannered and straight. But too well mannered and straight for me. The dialogue is classic Austin, full of long, properly constructed and intricate sentences. DO PEOPLE TALK THIS WAY? And the verbage of a long sentence makes a simple one necessary. The plot is conveyed through these long long sentences. Properly spoken too. My wife called it a bedroom farce, but an old English theater bedroom farce is FAR FASTER and has more humor. That, too, is needed here as there are a few, very few but good jokes. Camera movement is about hill. Very proper.It is has inclination to satire something but not Austin. So in the middle of intricate sentences and proper acting, I had to have a beer. Necessary for me to enjoy the rest of the thing. Not a bad film for women, just horrid for men. My 2 cents. 5 out of 10 for a man, 8 out of 10 for a woman if I had to do it twice. (Nor am in the CAPTAIN America crowd as a better film as that was 2 and 1/2 hours of sensory beat-down. X-Men is far better). So if you like proper, staid, cinematically perfect films, this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bowdlerized lesser Austen with fits of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While failing to reach the heights of earlier adaptations of Jane Austen novels, Love &amp; Friendship, based on an early epistolary Austen novella, Lady Susan, does have a few laughs and charms to compensate for its incessant chattiness and some directorial missteps.Written when she was nineteen, and at only fifty-nine pages in the edition I have, Lady Susan, while recognizably the work of Austen, lacks the deep wisdom and lived-in quality of novels like Emma (written when she was about forty) and does not rise much above the level of satire.Love &amp; Friendship has a sketchy, episodic feel that belies its epistolary roots. I had slight difficulty following the abrupt changes of scene at times (only explained in dialogue after the fact), a choppiness I'd attribute to either questionable editing or lack of coverage (the movie was shot quickly in February in Ireland on a small budget). Furthermore, I felt the rapid pace of the editing ill-suited a story that takes place entirely through written communications hand-delivered by carriage over what were then large distances.Stillman stays reasonably faithful to Austen's characters, plot, and wording, but is not content with simple adaptation, and adds some of his own parody. I found this funny in parts (most of which were in the trailer), but more often was put off by the facile humor and characterization. Stillman's verbal footnoting of not very obscure references also took me out of the story; the same applies to self-deprecating jokes about Americans and Manhattan in-jokes. It seems that, in attempting to pander to what he perceived to be a skeptical audience, he lost at least this part of his captive audience (every Austen adaptation I've seen has left me wanting more, until now), while failing to win over the skeptics (the friend I saw it with struggled to stay awake).But I don't wish to exaggerate: while I found most of the movie artificial, rushed, and uninvolving, there are stretches, especially in the latter half, where the actors are allowed more than a minute or two to act as an ensemble, without abrupt scene changes, ironic subtitles, or Manhattan in-jokes, and I started to develop some real empathy with the characters. But it was largely too little, too late.The movie does have a good deal in its favor.The costume design is stunning, and the locations and/or set design make the movie look like it had a far higher budget than it apparently did. The cinematography shows off all of this to great advantage, with lighting simultaneously convincingly realistic, on point, and luscious.Beckinsale is well cast, especially given her performance twenty years ago as Emma Woodhouse, a character who bears a passing resemblance to Lady Susan - not to mention that Beckinsale was, like Lady Susan, the mother of a sixteen-year-old daughter at the time of filming. And her acting skill has improved noticeably in the last two decades.Tom Bennett and Xavier Samuel acquit themselves admirably. While I am not in principle against American actors in English period pieces (my favorite Austen adaptation is the Gwyneth Paltrow Emma), I found Chloe Sevigny's presence jarring here. I can only conjecture that either someone felt Americans needed a proxy character in order to relate to the story, or else that Stillman couldn't resist inventing an excuse to slip in America jokes.In summary, if you appreciate Whit Stillman's sense of humor, and are either a fan of Lady Susan or else appreciate Austen from a historical or post-feminist perspective, you will probably love this movie. If you're not into Austen or Stillman, this may put you to sleep. If, like me, you're a Stillman skeptic (I'm ambivalent on Metropolitan as well) and your love of Austen is conditional and based largely on her writing skill, it can be a mixed bag.Without referring to the original novella, I'm left with a feeling vaguely similar to what I felt after watching Coppola's Marie Antoinette - some amusing moments, some pretty pictures, and not enough story or storytelling to tie them together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jane Austen with a sharp edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- So, you think she's a genius? - Oh yes, of the diabolical sort!Seldom has such a small piece of dialogue summed up a movie so well. Lady Susan, the lead character, is not only a diabolical genius, but also a cunning seductress who has brought the art of manipulation to complete perfection. Moreover, she is blessed with a razor-sharp tongue, uttering one hilarious insult after another, making it sound like polite conversation. The film is based on a novella by Jane Austen. Her books have proved to be very suitable material for modern film makers. But Love &amp; Friendship differs from classics like Sense &amp; Sensibility and Pride &amp; Prejudice because of its sharp edge: the Lady Susan character is such a vicious creature that the film is less a period piece than an intelligent dark comedy. The ultra-sharp dialogue turns it almost into an 18th century version of a Woody Allen film. But a good Austen novella doesn't necessarily make a good movie. My impression was that Austen's wonderful and humorous dialogue is better appreciated by reading it than by seeing it acted. Sometimes the dialogue is so fast, there is almost no time to fully appreciate it. You have to keep extremely concentrated in order not to miss something. Not only does the dialogue require constant attention, the same goes for the plot, which moves ahead at breakneck speed. Love &amp; Friendship is a nice movie, but afterwards I asked myself if an evening spent reading Austen's novella wouldn't have been a more rewarding experience. But then again, by reading it I would have missed Kate Beckinsale's pitch perfect performance as the ultra-wicked Lady Susan, as well as some very good supporting parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the visually stunning, beautifully sounding and utterly charming period piece that you want, but it's not perfect. To list some of the things I really enjoyed about the movie: how the characters are introduced, the soundtrack, the subtle use of running gags, the performances from all of the actors, the costumes and the sets. It's all great.But, story-wise, I was not sold on this. The movie is great for its comedy, and the comedy works because of the story, but that's about as much positive I can say about it. The intrigue with Lady Susan and her manipulative plans was never that interesting, something that it seems that the director understood, as some quite pivotal scenes are cut (and instead only shown the consequences of). Maybe it would have been better to do a similar movie, but with an original story?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first cougar in modern English literature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this film is misleading. Jane Austen did indeed write a juvenile story entitled "Love and Freindship" (sic), but this is not a film of it. It is instead a filmed version of her epistolary novel "Lady Susan", which was not published until 1871. It is easy to see why Austen never submitted it for publication in her lifetime, as it certainly would not have been to the moralistic taste of Georgian polite society.The main character, Lady Susan Vernon, is the most unusual heroine (or perhaps I should say anti-heroine) Austen ever created. She is not a young virgin in her teens or early twenties but a beautiful thirty- something widow with a teenage daughter. Whereas most Austen heroines adhere to the moral conventions of their day- Fanny Price in "Mansfield Park" doing so with a Puritanical zeal which can make her unsympathetic to the modern reader- Susan is an unscrupulous schemer who flouts those conventions with impunity. And whereas the likes of Marianne Dashwood and Emma Woodhouse end up married to men considerably older than themselves, Susan likes to pursue, or at least let herself be pursued by, men significantly younger than herself, making her perhaps the first cougar in modern English literature.(The very first was probably Chaucer's Wife of Bath). The film is set in the 1790s. I won't set out the plot in detail, as it is fairly complex, but it revolves around the schemes of Lady Susan, left in straitened financial circumstances by the death of her first husband, to find suitably wealthy husbands for herself and her daughter Frederica. (Unlike her mother, Frederica is naive and unworldly). Two eligible young men, Reginald De Courcy and Sir James Martin, present themselves. Although Sir James is both a prize booby and a garrulous bore, he does have one advantage in that he is already in possession of his family's estates and fortune. De Courcy, on the other hand, will have to wait until his autocratic old father dies. Unusually for Austen, the story includes an American character, Lady Susan's friend Alicia, who has been exiled from her native land after staying loyal to the Crown during the War of Independence.Kate Beckinsale first came to public notice with her role in Kenneth Branagh's "Much Ado about Nothing", made when she was still an Oxford undergraduate. Since then I have sometimes thought that she has not always achieved as much as she might have done, given her beauty and undoubted talents, possibly because at one time she seemed to get side- tracked into too many horror movies. In "Love &amp; Friendship", however, she has found a role worthy of her talents. A part like Lady Susan is not an easy one to play. She may be an anti-heroine rather than a heroine, but that does not necessarily make her a villainess. She has to be someone whom the audience can, to some extent, admire, despite her flaws, and Beckinsale succeeds in making Susan a likable monster. Two other contributions which stood out came from Stephen Fry in a brief cameo as Alicia's husband and Tom Bennett as the bumbling Sir James, both of whom bring out the rich vein of comedy which runs through much of Austen's writing. The film was made in the best British "heritage cinema" style, although many scenes were actually shot in Ireland. Like most films in this style it is visually attractive, making good use of the costumes and architecture of the period, and it has a drily witty script. One of the best costume dramas of recent times. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flurry of exuberance that has a Shakespearean quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lady Susan Vernon (Kate Beckinsale, "Absolutely Anything"), the main protagonist of Whit Stillman's ("Damsels in Distress") period comedy Love &amp; Friendship is determined to get what she wants without any pretense of hiding her ambitions. With a bow to Machiavelli, she has perfected the skill of turning evidence directed at her back towards her accusers, declaring "Facts are horrid things." Based on Jane Austen's novella "Lady Susan" written in 1794 but not published until 1867, the story revolves around the recently widowed socialite, Lady Susan, whose reputation as "the most accomplished flirt in England" follows her from London to the home of her in-laws at Churchill Estate.In Austen's day, an unmarried woman had few prospects for financial stability and Susan's not-so-secret dalliance with the married Lord Manawaring, the owner of the Langford estate, does not work in her favor. Though we are aware of her tendency to scheme, we only get a hint of what she's up to when her daughter Frederica (Morfydd Clark, "Madame Bovary") arrives at Churchill after running away from school. Stillman introduces us to each character with a descriptive caption (though it is hardly possible to remember who's who). Lord Manawaring, (Lochlann O'Meárain, "Poison Pen") is called "a divinely attractive man," Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett), who plays Federica's suitor, is described as "a bit of a rattle" which in commonly understood terms means a simple-minded buffoon.Lady Susan nonetheless intends for her daughter to marry Sir James, noting that he is "vastly rich, rather simple, ideal." Intending to enhance her relationships with her late husband's family, Susan charms her brother-in-law, the young bachelor Reginald Decourcy (Xavier Samuel, "Frankenstein") who takes the bait, much to the chagrin of his sister (Emma Greenwell, "Dare to be Wild"). Susan has an ally, however, in her American friend Alicia Johnson (Chloe Sevigny, "#Horror"), her secret confidante. Married to a much older man (Stephen Fry, "The Man Who Knew Infinity"), Alicia is threatened by her husband to be sent to Connecticut if her friendship with Susan continues (sounds good to me). "Let Mr. Johnson's next gouty attack end more favorably," Lady Susan says to her friend. On another occasion, she laments that Mr. Johnson is "too old to be governable, too young to die." Kate Beckinsale's performance as the cunning Lady Susan can only be described as delightful. She is thoroughly believable as the powerless woman who gains strength through her ability to bend others to her will, though her accent and rapid delivery can render some of the best lines unintelligible. Another vibrant performance is that of Bennett who has great comic timing as the inane Sir James who discovers that there are only Ten Commandments, not twelve, and that those little round green things on his plate are called peas. As the plot thickens, the film turns up its snarky wit and the time whisks by in a flurry of exuberance that lends a Shakespearean quality to the unpredictable ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful costume comedy, with charming (if conniving) Kate Beckinsale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Love &amp; Friendship" (2016 release; 92 min.) brings the story of Lady Susan. As the movie opens,, we see her arriving unannounced at her sister and brother-in-law's estate at Churchill, for reasons not clear just yet. We do understand that Lady Susan was widowed recently, and that she has a teenage daughter who is in boarding school. We also are introduced to Lady Susan's friend Alicia, an American woman from Connecticut married to a (much older) British gentleman. Before we realize it, the flirting and scheming is in full swing. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Whit Stillman, best known for his "Last Days of Disco', but who most recently brought us "Damsels in Distress", in spirit a very similar movie to "Love &amp; Friendship". The latter is based loosely on Jane Austin's "Lady Susan", which I have not read (and hence I cannot comment who closely the film is or isn't to the book). The initial 10 minutes of the film are a bit overwhelming, as we get introduced to a bunch of characters in a screen shot and byline, and it takes us a while to understand (and enjoy) the flow of what's going on. Indeed, Stillman doesn't waste a minute or a second in unnecessary plot or side stories, as every shot has a meaning and a purpose. But most of all: the movie is a pure delight, as the one-liners come at us rapidly and repeatedly ("The Vernons will never go hungry!", as Lady Susan contemplates her next move). Speaking of Lady Susan, that role is played by Kate Beckinsale, best known for her recurring role in the "Underworld" franchise. Here, she delivers possibly the finest performance of her career as the charming (if conniving) Lady Susan, with just the right touch of humor and possible malice. Beckinsale is surrounded by a lot of talent, the best of the rest for me being British actor Tom Bennett in the role of the 'idiot' (or is he?) Sir James Martin. At the same time, it was difficult for me to accept Chloë Sevigny in this costume comedy, as for me she is so identified with contemporary drama (hence the complete opposite of what she does in this film). But in the end it's a minor quibble. At just over 90 min., the movie flashed by in no time, inducing smiles, if not outright laughter, much along the way."Love &amp; Friendship" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very well, I am happy to say. When my friend and I left the theater, a long line had already formed in the lobby for the next showing, Based on the strong reviews (it's currently "certified fresh" with 99% on Rotten Tomatoes) and strong word of mouth, this has all the elements necessary to become a big hit on the art-house theater circuit, and deservedly so. If you are in the mood for a light-hearted costume comedy featuring a stunning performance from Kate Beckinsale, you cannot go wrong with this. "Love &amp; Friendship" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest and Most Cynical of the Jane Austen Adaptations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love &amp; Friendship was adapted from Jane Austen's novella Lady Susan, which she wrote when she was 19 and which was not published until long after her death. Like other of Austen's works, the story revolves around women's striving/conniving to marry well in an early 19th century society that offered them limited options. The protagonist, Lady Susan, is uncharacteristic for an Austen heroine; she is selfish, mean, and fiendishly clever. She dominates and manipulates all of the men in her orbit, even if she can't fool the women. This is the least romantic and most cynical of the Austen films. The comedy, acting, costumes, and sets are all spot on, even if the material is lighter than usual for Austen. In particular, Kate Beckinsale's portrayal of Lady Susan and Whit Stillman's screenplay shine. Love &amp; Friendship is a fresh and fun entry in the oeuvre of Jane Austen film adaptations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Facts are horrid things" - Lady Susan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In other news, if you give Kate Beckinsale a wonderfully devious and charmingly adept character with sharp dialog and a strong director, she can be as good as any actress out there. To say that this is a high-point in her career is an understatement, and it would be for any actress, but she nails every syllable, even down to how she looks at characters and gets them, through the Lady Susan way that this (anti?)heroine has, to do what she wants or what they didn't think they wanted until she suggests it.I wish the ending had a little more bite (then again that's more a criticism of the original story than the film itself), but otherwise this is an effective comedy of manners in the Austen-movie world, and it's sense of lightness in its tone does not diminish it from being an exceptionally perceptive look at how class and romance become like pawns on a chess board.There is a plethora of excellent dialog here performed by a group of game professionals - even Chloe Sevigny does alright in her few minutes (though not too long) - and laughs to be had just by how a character may give a look to another in response to someone else saying something 'off' in front of them (my favorite is Tom Bennett as Sir James Marten who brings a Curb Your Enthusiasm level of awkward-cringe type of comedy I did not expect here).Bottom line here is this: Whit Stillman has only made five films, and though it may lack a slight visual grandeur something associated with costume pictures (the digital cinematography may have something to do with that), it feels like the work he's been building up to his entire career. If Ernst Lubitsch could see it I imagine it'd meet his approval, to give you an idea of how on point and delightful this satire is.</fullReview>

Her spoken word is enchanting, fast yet on point and to the point. You don't get lost in the Victorian and cannot help but be impressed by the script. Famous arts star Chlöe Sevigny plays Lady Susan's close friend and confidant, who's an American exile living with her husband, Stephen Fry, in London. Her words are not as many, even compared to the rest of cast such as Xavier Samuel, Emma Greenwell and Morfydd Clark whom are all amazing. It really shows Jane Austen's absolute genius and Whit Stillman's skill as a director. He directs superbly well and does an unconventional introduction for each character and shot this in only 26 days. The film brings her short novel to life. Its non-stop conversation after clever conversation, observing how the plot unravels, going from one social incident to another. There's isn't much else, but there's doesn't need anything else, costumes and locations are true to form however it's the script and the acting that overrules everything. It's a great film and a perfect example of Austen's brilliance, and a comedy at that. Why haven't we seen more of you Whit Stillman?

And "Love and Friendship" is respectable it makes it's point of trying thru life to find the right one as it's a seek and happiness tryout. The film is blended with themes of hierarchy and culture clashes of wonder, doubt, and sexism still it entertains and can hold some interest of the viewer. Susan Veron(the beautiful Kate Beckinsale)is living in 1790's society and a trip to her in-laws estate is for a reason it's to play matchmaker for her and her daughter. And along the way it's a joy yet a challenge to fit in and try and take a chance and shot at love and happiness. This may not be everyone's cup of tea still it's worth a watch for it's "Victorian" and style like feel of class, culture, norms, and manners that all blend with love and happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love &amp; Friendship isn't what this movie is about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love &amp; Friendship (2016) was written and directed by Whit Stillman. It's based on the novella "Lady Susan," by Jane Austen. The plot of this film pivots about Lady Susan Vernon. Lady Susan is a vain, calculating, scheming, liar. Her plan is to capture a a wealthy husband for her daughter. Love doesn't enter into her calculations. She has only one friend. (That's why reviewers-- including me--can't understand calling this movie Love &amp; Friendship.)Lady Susan gets ahead by her ability to lie readily and effectively, and by her great beauty. Director Stillman has made the brilliant casting choice of Kate Beckinsale as Lady Susan. Kate Beckinsale is 43, but she looks 35. That means that she certainly could have a daughter of marriageable age. She also certainly could attract men of any age. No suspension of belief is required.The plot is complicated. All of the characters are formally introduced to us at the beginning of the movie. If you're watching the film at home, I'd suggest you write down the names of the various characters. As is so often the case with Jane Austen, you have to remember the complex relationship between characters. These relationships are based on connections of blood, marriage, and adultery. It was sometimes hard for me to keep them straight.This movie has a sumptuous BBC-style grandeur to it. Horses, carriages, and great houses abound. We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well enough on DVD. It's definitely worth seeing out and viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific film! Not to be missed, Beckinsale shines as Austen's anti-heroine with brains &amp; beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 1800's, Lady Susan Vernon (Kate Beckinsale) is a beautiful widow with brains and nerve. She was residing at the Manwarings, as she has been left rather poor. Perhaps it WAS too awful of her to lure Lord Manwaring right under the nose of his wife. So, out she goes. Not having other choices, she hikes off to her brother-in-laws, Charles Vernon (Justin Edwards). Wife Catherine Vernon (Emma Greenwell) is less than thrilled, for she knows Susan's character, but hubby insists. Cat's own handsome, unmarried brother, Reginald DeCourcy (Xavier Samuel) also lives in the mansion and Lady Susan attracts him immediately. Wouldn't it be a coup if she could remarry a gentleman 15 years younger than she? Soon, the household gets bigger, as Lady S's daughter, Frederica (Morfydd Clark) leaves school and comes "home". Trailing her night and day is HER suitor, Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett), a very affable but stupid man. Frederica definitely does NOT want to marry him but her dear, devious mother may require it. When Lady Susan needs advice and comfort, she turns to her longtime, American friend Alicia Johnson (Chloe Sevigny) who married a rich, older Brit (Stephen Fry). Mr. Johnson has heard also of the Manwaring uproar so he forbids Alicia to see Lady S. Doesn't matter as the two ladies meet in secret. Will this culminate in two weddings, Lady Susan with Reginald DeCourcy and Frederica with Lord Martin? Ah, the best laid plans of Susan Vernon may be daring but could be thwarted! First, thank you Whit Stilman, for writing, from Jane Austen's novel Lady Susan, and directing a gorgeous, wonderfully acted, witty and intelligent movie. What an accomplishment for you indeed, although many film fans admire your previous four films. Then, Kate Beckinsale, take a deep bow, for you bring this smart but dangerous woman to life as few could. The other cast members are also tremendous, especially Bennett who offers a very funny turn as the dense but likable Martin. In addition, the sets, costumes, and art direction are of the highest caliber, making the work extremely pleasing to watch. Stilman adds hilarious captions from time to time, which likewise enhance the total enjoyment. Trust me, dear viewer, this is a movie to never, never let pass you by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If so,'Love and Friendship' is your cup of Regency tea. This comes from 'Lady Susan,' a very early novel Jane wrote and then, having lost her way, wrote off. (She didn't leave it unfinished, just kissed it off in a hasty burst of unconvincing solutions.) Here writer-director Whit Stillman takes over and makes this delightful soufflé: kudos to him for recognizing the potential in it. It's Austen, so of course it's all money and marriage, pining and scheming, wit and wisdom, and it's beautifully dressed and acted, too. Kate Beckinsale is splendid as the scheming bitch and Chloë Sevigny is her equal (or better) as her cold-hearted co-conspirator. (Sevigny, like Sally Field in 'Hello, My Name Is Doris,' even acts with her breathing: she gives an excellent demonstration of early 18th Century heaving?bosom femininity.) Stillman's genius was to rescue Sir James Martin, who is the crux of the story. But Austen's novel is epistolary?a series of letters amongst the womenfolk ?so Sir James is merely referred to. Stillman puts him up front, making him into an actual character--hilarious example of inbred stupidity worthy of Monty Python's Upper Class Twit of the Year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the huge advantages of having a subscription to the cinema, is that every now and then you go watch a movie you wouldn't do otherwise, and get pleasantly surprised. As I was tonight.I was the only men in the room, but boy, I think a lot of men could benefit from watching this movie. Based on the novella "Lady Susan" by Jane Austen, this is a nice look into women in the England at the turn of the 18th century. And very maybe into women nowadays as well. ;) I would describe this to be a costume comedy. Seriously, I have seen some marvellous costumes and dresses tonight. And I laughed often as well. The look is one of a typical GB Costume Drama, but looks can be deceiving.Kate Beckinsale, the lead, does a splendid job here, but in my humble opinion the best acting is done by Tom Bennet. Seeing is believing, but he really amazed me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the easiest to follow if you are not already into Austen, but, once you get the hang of it, it's quite enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whit Stillman adapts Jane Austen, staying very much in his dialogue-heavy wheelhouse. It also shares themes with some of his earlier films, like class, pretension, manipulativeness. And it also re-unites the stars of perhaps his best film, The Last Days of Disco: Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny. Sevigny's role is supporting. This is Beckinsale's movie all the way. She stars as master manipulatrix Lady Susan Vernon, a young-ish widow who strives to survive on her own terms, "visiting" friends and relations until her welcome is worn, hoping maybe to land herself a husband. She also hopes to find a husband for her teenage daughter (Morfydd Clark), and to accomplish both tasks she must juggle a couple of different men. Her main target is the younger brother-in-law (Xavier Samuel) of her own sister-in-law (Emma Greenwell), with whom she is staying. Another man (Tom Bennett), a rich idiot, waits in the wings as second prize. I'm no reader of Jane Austen, and I found the plot and dialogue at times difficult to follow (of course, Lady Susan Vernon is both manipulative and changes her intentions frequently, so it's somewhat easy to get lost in her machinations), but I eventually got it, and by the very end it was all easy enough to understand. It's an amusing movie, if not laugh-out-loud funny (Tom Bennett, though, is hysterical). It might play better on a second viewing when I have the plot all pinned down. It might be my least favorite Stillman film on first viewing, but it's very nice to see him back in the game so relatively soon after Damsels in Distress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my kind of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy of manners with some very mannerly characters from the 18th century. Set in England, filmed in Ireland, with production help by the Netherlands and France! If you like costume, historical romances, as I do, you will like this. The actors are all appealing. The costumes and sets are magnificent. The introduction with the characters pictured and their relationships explained was just right since the plot is about relationships and they are a bit complicated. This contributes to the somewhat stagey feel of the film which is fine with me, since they are pretending after all. I will say -- unusual for me -- I thought the film was too short. I had that definite feeling when it ended, because I liked it. On reflection, another reason too. The wooing and marriage of the main character are not shown on film but related in a letter read by her daughter which cheats the viewer a little and spoils some of the symmetry of the plot (I don't think this is a spoiler but just in case I ticked the box.) Go see it and enjoy !</fullReview>
