		<shortDescription>Great Chemistry between Johnson and Hart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget about the formulaic spies plot and its flaws, the film does not look silly for the wise decision of making it into a comedy and it sparks thanks to the strong rapport between Johnson and Hart. The thriller may seems to be dumb and lack of inventiveness in all the right ways but it is also a bit smarter than what audiences could have expected. The hilarious but not nonsense actions, sweet high- school buddies friendships, comedy about bullies and inspiration to transform a better oneself however are all blended well into this lack-of-originality thriller; though insufficient to generate big humors, it is still able to keep your smile till the end. The film centralises on the delightful chemistry between the two actors, both Hart and Johnson deliver a cheerful bromantic, especially the latter who takes his character and silliness seriously other than just knowing to flex muscles. It might lack in depth to explain about the quest of the mission but it is overall entertaining due to the commitment of the cast to bring us laughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this while it's still playing.(Spoiler-free)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here comes another buddy cop film,this time with Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart in the lead roles.I thought this movie would fail miserably.I thought it was ripping off Ride Along(which is not a good film to rip off) but it surprisingly stands on its own and makes for a fun time at the movies.Bob Stone asks his old classmate,Calvin Joyner to help him with his computer skills.I don't really like Kevin Hart all that much,because he plays the same character in every film and even though he does have acting skills,he goes OTT in every performance.But his character is a bit more serious in this one and Dwayne Johnson is awesome as ever in his role.The main strength of this movie is the chemistry between the 2 leads.They are so much fun to watch.One is a fearless agent and the other a normal guy who can't even hold a gun.There are some nice jokes and gags as well.On the downside,the film falters sometimes in the plot section.Yet another OTT performance by Kevin Hart(as mentioned above) I wish the action scenes had a bit more lustre in them.But do not be bothered by that because this is the action junkie in me speaking,and you may like this movie more than I did.This movie isn't completely flawless,nor is it totally groundbreaking in the buddy cop genre.But it is still worth watching in the theatre,thanks to the chemistry between the 2 leads and a lot of laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little off for me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Started well, but sadly went down hill. I really expected great things from this movie after all the two main characters can be extremely funny, sadly this was not the case. I felt the plot also let it down, leaving me with a lot of fun unanswered questions, don't get me wrong it's a comedy so I don't expect in depth thought provoking scrip, but come on guys! I felt both lead actors were let down by the script, what I would describe as " a fluffy film " . I personally couldn't get to grips with Dwyne Johnsons character at all, seemed a little slow witted, yet works as a CIA operative? Not that I care either way but also they seemed to have made him gay I think, but to be honest I'm not sure, as I say lots of holes in both the script and sorry to say the acting.OK so would I recommend you going to watch the at the cinema? In short no, wait till its on TV I'm not saying it's not worth watching, but I wouldn't waste your money going to the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed opportunities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this last night on the big screen, not expecting much but hoping to be entertained. Sadly that didn't happen. Why? I has to have been the movie's writing and the way it was directed. It just never got started, and while the actors' delivery in the various scenes had to have been what the director wanted, it just never rang true. I'll leave off any explanation of the plot and story line, others have done a great job at that. I'll just stick to what I feel are the failings of the directing and writing.The movie starts out well enough, we get the transformation of the formerly bullied fatty 'Rob Wierdich' into the now huge and muscular Rob Stone and how this man now re-enters the life of co-protagonist Calvin Joyner, a man whose great high school promise has in his own estimation fizzled. Stone is over-the-top enthusiastic and presumptive while Joyner plays the baffled and grudgingly accommodating nebbish. But it is carried on too long, straining for the laugh. Hart as Joyner goes from normal speaking voice to Chris Rock style falsetto screeching with apparently little provocation and Dwaine Johnson's Rob Stone plays his overplayed huge smile and light hearted repartee gag so often that it becomes tiresome and distracting.The mishandled opportunities in the movie get worse as it goes on. Late in the movie comes the anticipated high school reunion. The movie's makers seem to have had no idea how to tastefully or effectively tie it all up and make a satisfying conclusion to the story. The principal bully who has harassed and humiliated Stone throughout the movie could have been dealt his come-uppance in some turnabout humiliation of his own, and I was expecting and even looking forward to this. Instead the writers blew this chance and had Stone simply haul off and knock the far smaller man unconscious with a single blow to the head, in front of the whole crowd. Nice. Way to transform your hero.More disturbing by far is the next scene in which Stone takes the stage and while accepting an honor, begins to take off clothing. No... he's not going to... but yes. Not only do the writers have Stone strip off his shirt to show off his muscles in a display of vanity, they have him strip completely naked, to the ooo's and ah's of the assembled crowd, and then walk around like a regular dance attendee. What was the purpose of the full nudity? Are we supposed to believe that Stone has altered his genitalia to the better as well as his muscles? (while it isn't shown of course, the implication that Stone is totally nude is clear when Stone tries to hug Joyner and the latter says, "Not now with your junk hanging out!"I'm not offended at the scene, but I really have to wonder what motivated the writers to think they were advancing the story arc with this uncomfortable and implausible gag. What were they thinking? It's just weird.Lots of action scenes, cool stunts, but the story was dealt a poor telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a movie with Kevin Hart that I enjoyed with all of my heart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was invited to an early screening of this movie in Norway, brought friends and did not have high hopes for this movie (since I've already sat through many Hartflicks, without laughing once). But this one is a bit different! Without spoiling to much, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson brings a lot to this, and is already known as Dwayne "The Franchise Viagra" Johnson, so this is going to be big! The bromance between the characters is much more believable than Harts movies with Ice Cube, Josh Gad or Will Ferrell. And Dwayne Johnson freshens up our memories of his performance in the 2005 comedy "Be Cool".All in all, I had a blast! So go see it with your girlfriend or best-friends, and enjoy yourselves!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mega Fun with Great Chemistry Between its Two Leads,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Central Intelligence is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific comedic cast. It's a fun, mindless comedy action that you can switch off from reality while watching and have a good time, there are many side splitting moments and even parts that had me at the edge of my seat. The writers did a great job of making us care for these characters before they set off on their journey, which helped out in the long run. However, the pacing was certainly slow, it was not as action packed and intense as the trailers made it out to be, there's a lot of slower moments, even times where I was begging for some plot development instead of mindless comedy. The cast are terrific, Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson shine in the lead roles and their chemistry is the film's highlight, they are joined by a stellar supporting cast that includes Amy Ryan and Aaron Paul, as well as a few brilliant cameos. It also deserves credit for switching roles and getting the lead actors to do something unexpected of them, putting the well known comedian, Hart, in a straight role and putting an action star, Johnson, as the flamboyant, over the top character, this differentiated the movie, making it more interesting. Though it may not be as exciting as the trailers made it seem, Central Intelligence is simple fun, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy. An accountant gets himself in trouble with the law after reuniting with an old high school acquaintance looking to prove his innocence. Best Performance: Aaron Paul</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ride Along 3: A little Hart and a big Johnson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the guy behind Dodgeball: a true underdog story and We're the Millers comes another Buddy Cop/Spy comedy starring Kevin Hart. Central Intelligence marks the second time this year that we have seen Kevin Hart in a movie where he forms an unlikely friendship with his nicknamed co-star (Ice Cube or The Rock) while he also shoots, fights and back flips his way to save the day.As opposed to Ride Along, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson plays Bob Stone in a subverted role than one might expect of the peoples champ. The Rock does a pretty good job as the Optomistically enthusiastic, unicorn loving CIA agent, bringing the action star to the screen as well as a more softer and comical side of the Brahma Bull. The film also features entertaining performances/ cameos from several actors; such as Aaron Paul (Who can't stop himself from calling someone a Bitch), Jason Bateman (Who plays a more comical version of his character from The Gift), Amy Ryan and even Melissa McCarthy. As for Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart... Enough said.The film itself is formulaic, two polar opposites bond over a case they work together... The formula of every buddy cop movie out there. At the close the Rock gives a speech bout being who you are and standing up t bullies, if the film could have maybe delivered that message better or at all then we could be looking at a better film here. The film just felt a bit bland story line wise.My biggest issue with this film is that it feels censored. I can't help but feel that with 2 major studios backing the film that there must be some major studio interference taking place. There are many scenes that I felt didn't work because of cuts and edits to create a 12A film in the hope to widen the films audience. This is a film that definitely needed a certificate boost to be more entertaining, the humour needed to be ruder for Kevin Hart to work and the action needed more blood and detail to grip an audience. The film just felt tame and too safe and so not particularly entertaining, plus the ending was cheesy as hell God Damn.Overall Central Intelligence is a film that I feel was ruined by studio interference. The high point is definitely the Rock (but when is he not?) as he plays a different character to what you would expect pretty well. The story is unoriginal and the humour works on occasion but ultimately the film falls flat. What this film needs is a 15 rated Directors cut which I pray Rawson Marshall Thurber releases. The film isn't good but on the bright side it doesn't look like it has completely hit Rock Bottom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action, Great Comedy, Great Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Central Intelligence", starring Dwayne Johnson-the Fast &amp; Furious movies, Doom; Kevin Hart-the Ride Along movies, Krod Mandoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire_tv; Danielle Nicolet-Third Rock From the Sun_tv, Loaded Weapon 1 and Amy Ryan-Bridge of Spies, The Wire_tv.This is an action comedy, containing the very first collaboration of Dwayne-the Rock-Johnson and Kevin Hart. And I hope it is not the last, because they make a great team. The movie starts 20 years in the past, when Dwayne and Kevin are in high school. Dwayne is an over weight dorky kid and Kevin is Mr. Popular. An embarrassing prank is pulled on Dwayne- by bullies-and Kevin comes to his aide. 20 years later, Kevin is an ordinary accountant, married to his high school sweetheart, Danielle. His 20 year high school reunion is coming up and he gets a Facebook invite from Dwayne to have a drink and catch up on old times. Dwayne tells Kevin that he has never forgotten his generosity back in high school and that he is the only friend he has ever had. Dwayne then tells Kevin that he needs his accounting skills to help him in his job, as an agent for the C.I.A. Not long after this, Amy shows up, saying that Dwayne used to work for the C.I.A. but went rouge, after killing his own partner and is now trying to sell classified government secrets to terrorists. That is one of the perks in this movie, Dwayne acts kind of goofy at times and it is hard to tell if Dwayne is really a good guy or a bad guy, that is, until the very end. There are several cameo roles scattered throughout the movie and it is better if you see them, as they pop up. Of course, if you really want to know some of them, just let me know and I will spill the beans. Good action, good comedy, good story. What more do you need in a non-sequel movie? Oh yeah, as the end credits start, there are some funny bloopers and out takes shown. It's rated "PG-13" for crude and suggestive humor, nudity, action violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 47 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action/Comedy Buddy Cop Movie (Minor Spoiler only)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw a sneak preview of Central Intelligence, and I really haven't had such laughs for a long time. Kevin Hart plays Calvin "Golden Jet" Joyner who peaked in high school, and now is an accountant who can't seem to win. Enter the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) as Bob Stone aka Robbie Weirdicht who acts like a man-child with hero worship for Calvin. They were never really friends, but Calvin was the only one who didn't laugh when Robbie Weirdicht was humiliated in front of the whole senior class, and actually helped him out.Kevin Hart does a great job through the first half of the movie playing the straight man while the Rock hams things up. While the Rock's role is over-the-top, he plays it with such sincerity, it's absolutely a riot to watch. I usually don't like when a character's embarrassing behavior is the point of the comedy, but in this case it really works well.The plot twist arrives relatively early on (minor spoiler), when the CIA shows up and tells Calvin that "Bob Stone" is a rogue operative. For the rest of the movie Calvin is freaking out because he is caught between the CIA and his old high school acquaintance. Calvin has to figure out who to believe, as both sides tell the same story, with slight critical differences.Amy Ryan does a great job as the cold CIA operative, Agent Pamela Harris, trying to hunt done Bob Stone. She has the sharp dead-pan act down, which lets Kevin Hart play his usual loud squirming act.There are a number of action scenes, but frankly they are over way too quickly. Sure it makes "Bob Stone" look super impressive in how quickly he can dispatch adversaries, but I prefer actually being able to see the action, and appreciate the skills involved.Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, and judging from the laughter and smiles on the preview audience leaving the theater, I wasn't the only one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The polarizing duo might not have the best chemistry, but each has their own quirky way to entertain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite possible that they cast Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson just to make "Little Hart, Big Johnson" pun. As far as buddy cop goes, this contrasting nature can provide some chuckles, however the espionage them might not hit all the marks. Still, there are significant amount of scenes where laughter is secured by sheer timely body language and jokes alone.Dwayne Johnson plays as Bob, a CIA agent who tries to reach out to his old friend. This escalates into a chase for secret files and national security. The way Bob is presented relies heavily on juvenile gag and demeanor despite his imposing physique, this is fun at first but it hampers the credibility as an agent. The movie wants to add some bullying subplot which is commendable, although it doesn't have the depth to accommodate it.Kevin Hart is excellent in creating reactions and gestures. He's surprisingly identifiable with high school nostalgia and occasional self-doubt. Many of the good moments come from his outbursts and babbling. The script has a few nifty pop references and sometimes even witty gags, so the comedy is not just slapstick throughout and undermines the "intelligence" in the title.There are serious undertones of adult life or self-acceptance even though they are not fully fleshed out. Action is pretty light, it's passable without being too demanding. The most important thing is it's enjoyable. Sure, there are a few awkward moments, yet they make the best out of it to present a light humorous spectacle, a better buddy cop gimmick than expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delightful Surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Central Intelligence stars Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart and is about them teaming up to save the world. I'd like to say that I had zero expectations going into this but was still looking forward to it. This movie is HILARIOUS! The Rock and Kevin Hart are fantastic together and have some of the funniest jokes I've heard all year. Watching them both on screen is the best part of this movie and it was extremely funny. The story follows both of them having reunited 20 years after high school in order to save the world. The main plot is the weakest part of this movie since there's not much emphasis put on it. I will say that there are some pretty sweet cameos in here that are awesome. The action is mostly good even though it got a bit shaky in some places.Overall, Central Intelligence is a pleasant surprise this summer. This movie is honestly battling Deadpool for funniest movie of the year; I can't believe I just said that. This is definitely one of the better buddy-cop action comedies we've gotten in the past few years.Central Intelligence gets a B+.Check out my Youtube channel where I review movies as well!: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOGWUFunDhIwKVcL7eNMWiQ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You won't find a more dynamic pair than Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart this summer, and thanks to their chemistry, this odd-couple buddy action comedy genuinely pops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As convenient as it may be to pigeonhole 'Central Intelligence' into the label of a buddy cop movie, the always-amusing, often-hilarious and surprisingly-affecting action comedy really is much more. For starters, Kevin Hart's Calvin Joyner isn't a cop at all; in fact, he's a put- upon mild-mannered accountant who is disillusioned with his job and where he is at in life, despite being married to his high-school sweetheart (Danielle Nicolet). For another, Calvin and Dwayne Johnson's Bob Stone can't quite be called buddies, especially since they have been out of touch with each other for the past twenty years and are only reconnecting upon Bob's initiation on the eve of their high school homecoming reunion party.Oh yes, the catch here is that while Calvin used to be the high- school superstar who excelled at everything from athletics to academics to drama and was thus dubbed 'The Golden Jet', Bob ? who used to go by the name Robbie Weirdicht ? was the overweight kid who had to contend with being dragged out of the locker-room shower by a bunch of sneering bullies and thrown naked in the middle of a school assembly. And yet, in his moment of humiliation, Calvin's act of kindness in offering his 'Golden Jet' jacket to cover Bob's privates has made him Bob's hero, so much so that Bob worships Calvin as no less than his idol. But it isn't just for old times' sake that Bob is now reaching out to Calvin ? indeed, after watching 'Fat Robbie'- turned-He-Man take out four bullies in front of his eyes, Calvin agrees to Bob's seemingly innocuous favour of accounting help with his overseas payroll.And so begins a series of CIA hijinks, as Bob reveals himself to be a CIA agent after someone known as the 'Black Badger' who has stolen the US satellite encryption keys and intends to sell them to the highest bidder. Though Calvin wants no part in the high-stakes operation, he finds that he is already unwittingly involved when Bob's superior Pamela (Amy Ryan) turns up at his doorstep and informs him that Bob is a rogue agent who happens to be the very Badger himself. Oh, there's also the question of whether Bob's former partner (Aaron Paul in an extended cameo) was killed by the Badger as Bob claims or was in fact killed by Bob himself as Pamela claims. As earnest as Bob may appear, Calvin's struggle as he grazes past one life-threatening setpiece after another is whether to trust Bob in the first place.From an extended shootout at Calvin's office that ends with Bob and Calvin crashing through the eleventh-storey window onto a giant gorilla inflatable below, to a CIA safe house where Calvin springs Bob from custody, to an underground parking garage where Bob comes face to face with his nemesis, director Rawson Marshall Thurber stages the action with surprising élan, emphasizing Johnson's swift and lethal moves as well as Hart's barely controlled hysteria at every turn. Yet because Johnson and Hart have performed similar shtick in previous roles, the real fun is in watching the two actors play against each other in quieter and more intimate scenes, such as a couples' therapy session between Calvin and his wife which Bob crashes by pretending to be their therapist.It is in scenes such as this that the sheer chemistry between Johnson and Hart shines through. Thurber, who co-wrote the script with Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen, plays against his audience's expectation by letting the usually motor-mouthed Hart play the straight man and Johnson be the unhinged man-child responsible for the verbal and physical shenanigans. Thanks to Johnson and Hart's elevated performances, the 'role reversal' works beautifully and makes for reason alone to watch this instead of say the next 'Ride Along' sequel. The stronger than usual character work is yet further proof that this film is a notch above many others of its ilk, demonstrated in the insecurities that Bob and Calvin each have to deal with individually along the way.Even though the opening scene of Bob's teenage appearance in the form of Johnson's face fattened by CG trickery suggests that it may end up pandering to the lowest-denominator, 'Central Intelligence' ultimately proves unexpectedly sensitive to the plight of those bullied in high school in its concluding scene, where Bob finally overcomes his personal demons to take the stage in front of his schoolmates twenty years after being painfully humiliated. Besides a cameo by Melissa McCarthy as Bob's high-school crush, it is as sweet a parting shot as any, underscoring yet again what an earnestly endearing and humorous joyride this odd-couple buddy movie has been. Most of all, Johnson and Hart are like 'yin' and 'yang', and together they prove that a little Hart and a big Johnson goes a long, long way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining - but that's it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, here's the deal ? we have the film beginning on the last day of high school where Calvin Joyner is voted to the student most likely to succeed, while Bob Stone (not his real name) is in the shower dancing. Stone is then grabbed by some bullies, naked, and thrown into the middle of the gym, where all the school is watching. Everybody, but Joyner, is laughing at Stone, however Joyner gives Stone his jacket, and that is basically the last anybody hears of him.Twenty years later Joyner married his highschool sweetheart and is working in a dead end job at an accounting firm with an inflatable gorilla out the front. The idea of him succeeding seems to have fallen flat on its face, particularly when he found himself in the real world. However he receives an anonymous friend request on Facebook and discovers that it is his old friend from school, however he has changed ? a lot. Instead of the fat kid he remembered he is now and incredibly muscly, yet still very nice, Dwayne Johnson. Stone is actually needing some assistance, which Joyner gives him, and it soon becomes apparent that Stone is a rouge CIA agent, and Joyner is now caught up in a mission to save the United States, which includes a huge machine gun fight in his office.So, that is basically the movie ? it's funny in parts, but the comedy pretty quickly wears off to become not so much your typical spy action movie, but rather a somewhat unbelievable spy action movie. When I left the cinema I thought to myself ? yes, this was a good film, however as I thought about it (though not too much, because there is nothing all that much to think about) I realised that there really wasn't anything all that special about it. While Johnson's character wasn't bad, or irritating, he just seemed to be a little too nice, to the point that I didn't feel that there was all that much depth to the character. Sure, there were some amusing scenes, but it wasn't a side splitting funny type of movie.I guess it is basically one of those 'life didn't quite turn out as we expected' type of movies ? the ones where at the end of highschool it seems as if the world is your oyster, but twenty years down the track all the potential that was there when we were young seems to not only have gone, but has been wasted. In fact Joyner doesn't even want to attend his reunion (I know what it is like ? I didn't, despite the fact that Facebook as allowed me to connect with my old school friends) because he feels that the expectation that was there were he was left has been wasted. Mind you, it is also one of those 'wouldn't it be good' type of movies ? the ones that suggest that it would be good if something were to just suddenly happen to take the monotony out of life.Even though it was enjoyable, and I would hardly call it boring, it seems to suffer from the malaise that many of the Hollywood movies seem to be suffering from these days ? lack of depth. Oh, and it is also predictable as well ? I worked out that there was a purpose for the giant inflatable gorilla almost as soon as I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hit-to-miss ratio is surprisingly higher than you expect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a film has a tagline as witty and sharp as Central Intelligence's ? "Saving the world takes a little Hart and a big Johnson" ? something tells me that the producers came up with that pun first and decided to commission a script around it after. True enough, this film is an excuse to have Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Kevin Hart play delightfully silly characters amidst a fairly disposable plot. It really doesn't matter because you won't see this film for a complex plot, you'll see this film for some good laughs. The hit-to-miss ratio is surprisingly higher than you expect.In Central Intelligence, Johnson plays a formerly morbidly obese high school student named Robbie Wierdicht (yes, it's pronounced as Weird Dick, hah!) who was subjected to a horribly cruel prank twenty years ago. He now resurfaces as Bob Stone, a herculean CIA agent who decides to reunite with his only friend in high school, Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner (Hart) ? back then Central High's "most likely to succeed" student. Ironically, he is now living an unexceptional adult life as a mid-level accountant stuck in a rocky marriage. Little does Calvin know, what started as a mysterious Facebook friend request to a casual catch-up is Stone's silent attempt to enlist Calvin as his unwilling sidekick in a deadly mission to track down stolen U.S. satellite codes and stop a wanted kingpin called the "Black Badger" from obtaining them.In his previous comedies (Ride Along and Get Hard), Hart is often portrayed as a fast- talking shtick at the center of attention. In this film, We're The Miller's director Rawson Marshall Thurber, who co- wrote the script with Bob Fisher and Steve Faber, breaks this stereotype by subduing Hart to a serious straight-up role and giving the goofy prankster role to Johnson (responsible for pulling off most of the verbal and physical gags). The role reversal works with the slapstick comedy thanks to both actors' exhilarating chemistry and sharp performance. Their size juxtaposition alone is a joke in itself. "Pint-sized" squeaky-voiced Hart, with all his outbursts and babbling, mixes panic and rage probably better than any actor. As for Johnson, he keeps up with expectations here whether by simply donning fanny packs, unicorn t-shirts, and uber-tight pajamas; or flaunting his cartoonish manliness against a character who is surprisingly sensitive and still embarrassed with his past. Central Intelligence is given more depth when it deals with our main characters' high school baggage ? Calvin's frustration on his life turning not the way he expected, and Bob's self-esteem issues due to the serious and lasting effects of bullying.Don't get me wrong, the exhausting espionage plot struggles to have any shred of intelligence to it. It is quite perfunctory to the point that it might as well fade into a background noise. It even falls apart to utter nonsense by the end when the plot twist is revealed and judging by their focus on comedy, the filmmakers seems to be fine leaving the plot holes unpatched. Neither are the villains written with deep thought as they are all cardboard bad guys who are homophobes, bullies, mercenaries or a combination thereof. Apart from the comedy itself, the film apologizes in its shortcomings by boasting a roster of cameos that I'll leave unmentioned for the sake of surprise.You can groan at its dumb plot, get antsy over action scenes where no one (not even trained CIA gunmen) can shoot straight or frown at Calvin and Stone whispering strategies whilst pointed with guns, but Central Intelligence is hard to dislike because Johnson and Hart shine perfectly in their roles and hence, elevate this film from subpar to moderately enjoyable. Without them, this film will be as useful as a bag of rocks. That being said, Central Intelligence can be a good distraction during a hot summer day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Central Intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going in to Central Intelligence I didn't know what to think. With many comedic movies, I didn't want to build it up too much in my mind, cause that is a sure fire way to not enjoy the movie. I was pleasantly surprised by the picture though. Hart and Johnson almost switched roles in a sense, with Johnson taking on a quirkier role and Hart playing the part of the level headed thinker. They both were able to take a new role and add it to the same gut busting comedy we love from them, and made a movie that was truly delightful to watch. Several times I laughed till my stomach hurt. The other thing that made this film more enjoyable was the plot line. In most movies, as the story progresses you start to make assumptions on what is going to happen, or who the bad guy is. With Central Intelligence, I was wrong in my assumptions, and when I found out I was wrong, it made the movie much more enjoyable in a sense. It made me go back and rethink what had happened, and I could see where I was wrong in my thinking. All in all it was a great film that I will watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spy Movie That's Really Funny, Along The Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way, this movie is nearly a 10, because it is hard to imagine it being any funnier. When watching it the stuff between Johnson and Hart is so good that I have to hope they are going to do another movie with a script like this one. This movie is more fun than any film I have seen in a long time.Too often when WWF Wrestler's get into acting, their egos are so large, they can't transfer it into acting or comedy. Dwayne Johnson (aka. The Rock) does that transfer here. He shows he can act and do comedy with great skill at both and does not let anything get in his way. Kevin Hart does not hurt as the two of them with a full foot difference in height really seem to have this down. Their timing and pace are so good that I could not help laughing more than I have at a movie in a long time.It is almost hard at times to take the CIA spy plot seriously, but then every so often you get to wondering who are really the good guys and who are really the bad guys. The script is good enough to keep you wondering for most of the film. Centering around a 20 year high school reunion the plot works well. This one is worth checking out because it really lightens the mood and the supporting cast really backs it up too. Both Amy Ryan and Danielle Nicolet stand tall here despite being shorter than Kevin Hart. The Golden Jet and Bob Stone make this film funny, and the support and Thurber's Direction pace here are just about perfect. The running time of less than 2 hours is perfect and the inclusion of great pieces of the gag reel at the beginning of the credits made me leave the theater with a big smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A minimally watchable product</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not really funny, basically there is no one good laugh in the whole movie. But, there are many somewhat funny situations/lines, like when Rock and his little partner jump out the window onto a big balloon-monkey.It is not really fun, but, it is engaging enough to not be boring or just plain bad. The Rock kicks some but, but in a mostly-believable way and not too much.The story is not really good, but, it doesn't have serious flaws, for a comedy, that is. It is mostly consistent, has a good progress and doesn't just implode near the end, like a lot of modern movies (comedies included).Acting is not really good, it's mostly over-acting, but, both the Rock and his little partner don't "over do over-acting", so to speak. Again, it's a comedy, over-acting is somewhat expected.So there are a lot of better movies, but, this one satisfies the minimum quality bar. It's a good way to take a rest if you're not sleepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dwayne Johnson is back! Oh wait he was never gone. We get to see so much of The Rock every year these days and we seldom complain. Because, TheRock knows what works, what people love and how to engage with them so that they love it before they know it. Central Intelligence is no different. The publicity campaign buy both Rock and Hart throughout the making of this movie is a movie in itself. Central Intelligence is a perfect example of how to make a cliché Hollywood buddy comedy work. After directing the R rated epicly funny We're The Millers, Rawson Marshall Thurber looks to target a larger diversity of the audience with this PG13 flick.We all know there is no point in discussing the storyline of the movie. It was all pretty obvious from the trailer. This is the type of movie that delivers what it promises. If you take your logical and serious brain with you, you are to be disappointed. I went to watch an out and out entertainer and I got one. There are all kinds of funny moments in this movie, the outrageous action comedy, subtle funny one liners, stupid stunts and what not. Of course it is not a perfect movie, editing could have been better, the spy angle of the storyline could have been more complex and you can go on. But hey, as long as it is entertaining, who is complaining.Kevin Hart can make a monk laugh if he wants to. He is just too good. He practically lifts the whole movie. I am finding it hard if anyone other than Kevin Hart could have made this movie the way it is. It is good to see Dwayne Johnson is finding different dimensions to his acting. He has tried his best to be funny is all I can say, but what he does better is kicking ass and making Kevin Hart's character do what he does. Amy Ryan is the only other actor who has a significant screenspace apart from Rock and Hart and she is okay as the stern faced CIA agent. Aaron Paul makes a guest appearance and even a third grade kid can guess what happens with his role.Central Intelligence may be yet another Hollywood bromance comedy, but it is all worth the price of your ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best Kevin Hart vehicle yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE': Four Stars (Out of Five)An action-comedy buddy flick, starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. It was directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (who also previously helmed other hit comedy flicks, like 'WE'RE THE MILLERS' and 'DODGEBALL'). It was written by Thurber, David Stassen and Ike Barinholtz. The film costars Amy Ryan, Danielle Nicolet and Aaron Paul. It's a pretty funny movie, because of the pairing of Johnson and Hart, and it's also surprisingly touching (at times).Johnson plays Bob Stone; a once bullied (and severely overweight) nerd, that's now a lethal CIA agent. Calvin Joyner (Hart) went to high school with Stone; he was really popular, and helped Bob out during a traumatizing incident. So Bob has idolized Calvin ever since. The two meet for drinks, the weekend of their high school reunion, and Calvin gets pulled into a life threatening CIA adventure.Johnson and Hart have beautiful chemistry together; it really is a classic odd couple pairing! That's the highlight of the movie, but it also has a lot of heart; and a strong message about bullying. It's definitely 'forced' and 'clichéd', but it's also (surprisingly) emotional. I really enjoyed the movie, for that reason as well. The plot, and action scenes, are routine (and forgettable), but the character development is awesome! It's probably the best Kevin Hart vehicle yet!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Action comedy. 1 Thumb Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>18 June 2016: I saw Dwayne Rock Johnson &amp; Kevin Hart in their new action comedy and it was really good. I knew that Kevin Hart would be funny and that is what the audience is expecting from him, but the surprise stand out is action actor tough guy Dwayne Rock Johnson, who proved in this movie and in a movie he did several years ago titled "The Game Plan" with cute little actress, Madison Pettis in year 2007 that he can really transform from tough guy to letting himself go and be really good in a comedy film.The really cute actress who plays Kevin's wife, Danielle Nicolet African American looks like a younger version of Italian American actress television host, Juliana Rancic.All of Dwayne scenes were funny and on point. He looked very natural. I would give this film a 10, but the only reason, I will not give it a ten is because of some of the unnecessary profanity. This movie would have been just as funny without the cursing. Nice cameo by Melissa McCarthy.</fullReview>

So, instead, he tries and fills in the blanks, however it sounds poor and empty.It reminds me of some 90's movies with Eddie Murphy.Maybe the writers could have helped at some point.Dwayne Johnson is quite OK, some jokes somehow work, but it's not enough to carry the movie.I would have loved to have loved it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It takes two to make a good comedy - little Hart and big Johnson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that Central Intelligence is going to star Dwyane Johnson and Kevin Hart ? I was absolutely sure about watching it in theaters. First trailer confirmed my assumptions ? it looked pretty legit to me.The plot has nothing special in it from the beginning: classic "before" scene from 1996, which introduces us to Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) and Bob Stone (Dwyane Johnson). Calvin was a typical guy everyone would love to be friends with and Bob was just someone you wanted to bully all the time. Quick jump to 2016 shows us that Kevin wasted his "potential". However, we see tremendous transformation of Dwyane Johnson's character. He is the Rock now. Wait, is it actually possible to bully the Rock, even in 1996? Anyways, since that we can enjoy great chemistry between Kevin and Bob.Many people might think: "Oh, another spy movie. I am so tired of it". I am going to tell you one thing ? this movie is nothing about spying at all. Well, it is in some way ? FBI agents, terrorists and all that. But it is not the main "selling" point of the movie. Thriller and spy part seems pretty straightforward and "easy to predict". But the way it goes to this obvious end is the key. Sweet high-school buddies friendship, bullies jokes and hilarious action scenes ? all this is Central Intelligence. What actually amazed me is the fact that even though this film is all about laughing, it kept me smiled during all 105 minutes. Isn't it amazing when a big muscle machine Dwyane Johnson delivers one of the best jokes you would ever hear? Or little Hart doing cool ass moves you have never expected from him. Beyond all that, I was really surprised when I saw Aaron Paul in this movie. While he was more like a cameo, his character still got a few "breaking bad" quotes, if you know what I mean.Overall, film is centralized on delightful chemistry of two main actors. Usually, it is not enough to keep people entertained. In this case, it is. Another perfect evidence is domestic gross which is more than 120 million dollars. Not bad for a comedy movie, huh? However, this film is not gonna "suit" every viewer. A lot of people aren't going to get jokes, characters motivations and references. But all in all, if you are a guy who does not judge movies too strictly ? Central Intelligence is a perfect choice for you. Strong 7/10 for me. Hopefully, I will see Dwyane Johnson in comedies again ? he is really great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently a lot of Kevin Hart's movies have been pretty lack luster. The Ride Along movies and Get Hard were shredded by critics. When I saw the trailer for Central Intelligence, I thought this would be just another one of those flicks. Thankfully, I was very wrong! The page here lists the film as an "action, comedy, crime" movie but really it is more of a "action, comedy, drama" flick. Dwayne Johnson plays the gentle giant Bob Stone/Robby Weirdicht (haha pun) who works for the CIA while Kevin Hart plays the everyday joe Calvin Joyner (a nice change of pace in my opinion). These two are the reason this film works as pure entertainment. They have great chemistry together and they play rather interesting characters. Robby is on the same level as Jason Bourne when it comes to hand to hand combat and other spy stuff like that but he has the sensitivity and the tastes of a fourteen year old girl. I don't care who you are, you have to admit that's hilarious. Calvin was the favorite student of his high school but now he is just a washed up accountant upset with where his life has gone. Hart and Johnson bring some real comedy to their roles as well as true convention. You can believe that these two are dealing with some real emotional problems. I never thought of either of them as good actors but they do a splendid job here. The stunts they pull also look so very realistic. They are very thrilling and pretty creative too. Now the movie isn't without problems-what movie is? The spy portion of the plot is pretty straight forward and pretty shallow. It's obviously just an excuse to get these two together but is that really such a bad thing when what they are offering is so good? Central Intelligence is kind of like that movie Twins with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito. Two popular actors play as comic foils to one another as well as provide great drama with some cool stunts thrown in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a pleasant surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into the theater, I didn't expect much from this Rocky-Hart venture that seemed oddly named as Central Intelligence. Whilst from the surface it appeared the same as any comedy movie Kevin Hart had in the past pounced upon, finding it good simply made my day.DIRECTION OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE This is what I expect from a good comedy flick ? a good slow paced direction to keep you thoroughly engaged whilst throwing in some laughable bits every now and then. At the same time not compromising the crucial plot at play. Rawson Marshall Thurber ensures the audience has plenty. There were well thought of comic bits strewn all across the movie, as he tries to work upon a rare build up to get to his punch lines. He will make you used to it, and you will be waiting with jaws wide open expecting a funny liner bomb to be dropped anytime.THE ROCK AND HART CONNECTION Central Intelligence is a buddy flick. Even though the protagonists are oddly paired, minutes into the movie and you will notice neither of them is a douche. They are totally nice guys and they gradually create a stunning chemistry that most Nice Guys movies profusely miss. Kevin Hart's Calvin Joyner is like a confused blend of perseverance and slapstick comedy. At dire moments when his emotional rivers go inundated, he reacts just as anybody of us would react, and that makes it both funny and relatable. That's what Thurber pays attention to, letting Hart go savage at situational savagery.SPOILER RIOT AHEAD: CAMEOS There are endearing cameos that make you go, "Hey! Jason Bateman's in the movie." Or "Melissa McCarthy's in it too." Whilst Jason gets a shot once again at the Bully storyline, (seriously I can't see how he fits the bill there!), Melissa's role is ephemeral. Aaron Paul has a good role for a cameo as Phil and he will make your heart melt when he goes "Bitch!" bringing in memories from Breaking Bad. Kumail Nanjiani beams you up with his perfect comic timing in a funny Airport distraction scene. Ryan Hansen as Steve was hilarious too.There is plenty of dope action inscribed in Central Intelligence for a comedy movie which looks absolutely spectacular when it gets delivered by Dwayne Johnson. Hart makes it all better with his rib-tickling descriptions.DOWNSIDES On the big downside of the movie is Dwayne Johnson's pathetic good guy acting. When I see him it feels like he is acting. Give me something that betrays it Rocky! That and the fact that the plot would make you go meh! We have seen too much of that sorts. Another one is that it goes too slow at times and doesn't retain something that will throw you into fits of laughter to be candid.THE FINAL VERDICT Overall Central Intelligence was very entertaining, had funny situations that squeezed out comedy. The movie becomes successful in giving an uncanny makeover to comedy movies.Go watch! Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Little Hart and Big Johnson Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I will state from the start that Kevin Hart as a comedian has never appealed to me and so therefore that also translates into his films having never been intrigued enough to go see one of his (some of the critical receptions bare this out) but this is obviously where that trend ends for me.In this 'mismatched' buddy action comedy both Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson seem to have stumbled upon some fabulous comedic chemistry that I most certainly didn't see coming.Having stated my indifference earlier to Kevin Hart I am at the opposite end of the spectrum when it comes to Dwayne Johnson, a man, an actor who probably shouldn't be as successful as he is...yet I can't resist his charms, there is just something inherently likable about the man as an on screen presence and as an actor in general and that is no different here.Quick plot synopsis now, flashback to high school, Hart is Mr. Popular, Johnson is the school joke, flash-forward twenty years to the present day where after a social media inspired meetup if would appear maybe that now the two have switched places in life (quite a common story arc) and what may also be certainly more concerning for Hart is the fact that Johnson may appear to be a spy on the run, so ensues a parade of nifty chase sequences some rather inspired and choreographed escape fighting scenes interspersed of course with Hart chipping in with comedic observations of their currently absurd predicament. There is in particular a scene where Johnson has replaced the role of a therapist who is about to give marriage counsel to Hart and his wife and it is extremely funny.This should not of entertained me as much as it did and trust me I am as surprised as anyone that it got many laughs out of me, it certainly does remind me in parts to 21 Jump Street, what I mean by that is it being a nice comedic surprise of a film that has the laughs but actually does in part also have a heart in place, or as the brilliant marketing department said on the films tagline and posters 'It takes a little Hart and a big Johnson' just superb.I was a little concerned after the films opening which I mentioned earlier is a flashback to high school where we see the rather unsubtle face of Johnson transposed onto the head and body of a rather overweight kid but the film got out of that just pure weird territory quicker than expected, yes not every joke hits the mark but the success to failure rate is amply way on the positive side of things and the pace and action is brisk enough that it never overstays its welcome which is very surprising given the near two hour feature length running time.But I suppose the main question that does have to be asked though is 'who is the Black Badger' maybe I'm the Black Badger, as Thomas Kretschmann brilliantly puts it.So it's not particularly going to change the comedic landscape out there but it more than succeeds in keeping you very entertained throughout mainly thanks to the great comedic chemistry that Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson bring to the party.</fullReview>

With two high quality leads and excellent scripts this "brain off" funny movie left me and my family in stitches. I want slapstick and with this vehicle for visual and verbal jokery and was rewarded in spades, this was not an intellectual chuckle, I hurt from laughing. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Harts swapping of funny/straight lines was done crisply and the best comedic talent was bought out of both actors who balanced hamming it up with some excellent down the line acting. The support cast of wives, friends, CIA etc. come straight out of every American movie you've ever watched and were done to perfection.Well worth it humour for teens and up..</fullReview>

Trust me. Go see this movie and you will love it.

		<fullReview>14 July 2016 Bastille Day Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Central Intelligence. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Kevin Hart star in this absolutely farcical movie about a bullied fat kid turned muscle man who also happens to be in the CIA. The script gave us scenarios reminiscent of Eddie Murphy in the Beverly Hills Cop movies where he uses about a million words when one short sentence can suffice. The story was outlandish, and everyone was overacting so much it all combined to give us one of those amusing films that actually make us laugh out loud from time to time. Even though once again we got shown most of the funniest bits in the trailers they still made me laugh when they were put into context in the film. I just knew the mismatched partnership would work, The Rock is about 15 feet tall and Kevin Hart is about quarter of that yet they awkwardly rub along throughout the whole film. Total trash........loved it!!!</fullReview>

Though the National Teen Suicide Hotline made Warner tack on some gratuitous Happy Ending Plot Points, the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE offered here is that the Fat Lady has finished singing by the time she pops you out. On the brighter side, Kevin Hart leads a trio of sure 2017 Oscar Winners among the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE key urban cast members. Only the lack of a lead minority actress will prevent the Citizens of Color in this flick from duplicating IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT by sweeping ALL of the acting statuettes.

The plot is focused around Calvin, an accountant who was very successful now a failure and Bob (formally Robert) who was a failure in high school now ex-member of the CIA. Bob eventually gets Calvin to help him find encryption codes that have been stolen. The plot to this movie, well, was not memorable. Why did I give it 10 stars then? I was not expecting a good plot. I was expecting comedy and fun and action, although not too much as that would ruin the comedic atmosphere and this movie performed. Kevin Hart's performance was outstanding in this film and I would definitely be interested in watching more of the work he is in. Dwayne Johnson in this film is awesome and I personally think that he should be in more of these types of films; funny action movies. Would recommend it for anyone wanting a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favourite things is when a film is a hybrid of genres ? horror comedies, romantic comedies, dramedies and romantic dramas. Unfortunately, Central Intelligence is an action comedy which skimps on both the action and the comedy.This was disappointing for so many reasons, but mainly because expectations were high with the tagline for the film being such a stroke of genius: "Saving the world takes a little Hart and a big Johnson" (I do love a good pun). I can handle when a film is predicable in plot if it makes up for it in other ways, and I was hoping this one would have fresh jokes to counteract the cliché story however this is where it fell short. Kevin Hart's character Calvin Joyner is a straight-laced accountant who was once the high school golden child. He receives a Facebook request from a nerdy and overweight ex-classmate Bob Stone (played by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) and when they meet to catch up over drinks, Calvin is slowly drawn into a crime underworld where Bob is an ex-CIA agent gone bad? or is he? (Cue dramatic music? yawn).Kevin Hart plays the same character he always plays ? whiney and a little nerdy, whilst Dwayne Johnson's character has a little more meat to it (and I don't just mean his biceps). Even though Bob had bulked up over the years, he maintains the soft and fluffy persona that his high school self once was. This was probably the only redeeming feature of the film which made it even remotely unique and interesting. With Ike Barinholtz as one of the screenwriters, you would think the film would have many more laughs than it did. I think the comedy was just too PG for my liking and with no amazing action sequences to boot, it became a dull journey where the only excitement I felt was when the closing credits began to roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - missed opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A little Hart, and a big Johnson" could be the best tagline all year! And with that in mind, Hart and Johnson could have been the next really great action-comedy duo, following in the footsteps of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, or Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum...Unfortunately the key phrase is "could have". I guess the filmmakers didn't want to just play into the buddy action movie formula, which is respectable but may be a missed opportunity. The plot is more complex than it needed to be for this kind of movie, but not complex enough to rival any decent mystery film, but I guess it deserves credit for trying to be more interesting?! The first act does a great job of building character (particularly Hart's), just a shame it twisted and turned a little sloppily later.But enough of what it wasn't, let's do justice to what it was. In terms of action, you can't really get much better than Dwayne Johnson - the guy's a monster! The fight scenes are well directed, with quick camera cuts and hard-hitting punches (although the CIA seemingly has no gun accuracy training...), and the film moves at a hell of a pace. Even Hart does his action bits well - just a shame there were only a few of them!As for the comedy, I was *slightly* disappointed. Kevin Hart is in his element when his voice goes all high-pitched and he gets flustered and awkward, which is really missing from the first half of the movie, which it has to be said is mostly funny because of Johnson! That said, when he gets caught up in the CIA stuff, I couldn't think of a better actor to play that part. As for the other comedic character (Ryan Hansen), I could happily watch him being tased for two hours!So basically, the action and the comedy are well worked, and the two lead characters have fairly good chemistry, but I really wanted more from Central Intelligence. This does seem like it could be the start of a franchise, which with great character set-up like this, I'd look forward to! Maybe just up the fighting and humour a tad...3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Calvin (Kevin Hart) was the star of Central High long ago. He was a great athlete, student and friend, nicknamed the "Golden Jet". On the other hand, classmate Bob (The Rock) was overweight and the butt of most jokes. On the day of a closing ceremony in the school gym, bullies pushed Bob onto the floor straight from the locker room showers. Only Calvin helps out by offering his letter jacket to cover Bob as he exits the place. Flash forwarding 20 years, Cal has married the most lovely girl in the class, Maggie (Danielle Nicolet) and is a staid accountant. In part, he feels ashamed for he aspired to higher ambitions. As the twenty year school reunion is approaching, Calvin is startled to get a Facebook invitation from Bob. Agreeing to meet in a bar, Calvin is astonished to see Bob is a lean, mean, fighting machine, tall and full of muscles. Not only that, Bob is a CIA agent who needs CALVIN'S help to find accounting trails of a big criminal he has been trying to take down. Flattered, it turns out to be more than paperwork, as Calvin is soon involved in gun battles way over his head. Not only that, but a tough lady agent wants Cal's help to bring Bob down, as she says BOBBY is the bad guy here. Who can Cal believe? Will he live to see it matter? This fun, somewhat-mindless flick is a good yukfest for those who truly need to "get lost in laughter". Hart and The Rock make a great duo, not only in size difference but in styles of humor. Nicolet is very beautiful while the rest of the cast is nice, too. (Watch for a cameo from someone special). It also sports nice costumes, venues, and sets. No, its not going to bring home a dozen golden statuettes. But, who cares? Therefore, slip out some evening soon to send the blues miles away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most appealing things about Kevin Hart has to be his marketing team. That's not to say he isn't a great comedian; his stand up is currently second to none. Yet, for his new movie, Central Intelligence, he has taken to Facebook and Twitter with his co-star Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and presented some outright hilarious and completely irrelevant videos, such as; Hart and Johnson conducting a one-on-one interview while doing an impression of each other. It's ludicrous but their belly laughing is very contagious. It only seems a disappointment how they don't quite manage to portray the same on screen chemistry for the movie.Hart plays Calvin Joyner, an accountant and one time high school golden boy who regrets that he never lived up to his potential. He also happened to be the only kid in school who showed any compassion toward heavily overweight, nerd Robbie Weirdicht, played by an impressively CG rendered Johnson. Twenty years on and Robbie returns to reconnect with Calvin through Facebook with a new name and a mountainous physique. What Calvin didn't account for was that behind Bob's overzealous persona lies the cunning mind of a super spy as he is dragged into a dangerous game of espionage with the CIA.One thing is for sure, Johnson does not have any natural comedic ability and this movie is certainly evident of that. Give the guy a gun and a cheesy one-liner and he's immediately likable but here, his attempts appear forced and down right awkward to watch. However, his performance reflects the considerably under-cooked script in which a lot of the material relies on the improv talents of their key actors and, to overcompensate, Hart gives it everything he's got while ultimately reducing his part to a series of shrill attacks on his bumbling costar. Think Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan in Rush Hour. Although, in that respect, Johnson isn't even given the decency of any respectable choreography to show off his more applicable talents. For a movie primarily focused on the relationship between this oddball, buddy-up, action comedy, any actual plot becomes insignificant; something about account numbers and selling secrets, basic CIA stuff. Although, it's a shame as the two actors are individually very capable of being entertaining in the right roles. This little and large team-up had a lot of potential but the whole thing just comes across as hopelessly underdeveloped. In saying that, the tag-line is nothing short of genius, 'Saving the world takes a little HART and a big JOHNSON'. Shame I can't say the same for the movie.For more news, reviews and trailers visit whatsiesays-online.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are introduced to Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart's character) in 1996 at his senior high school graduating assembly; the principal introduces him as 'Most likely to succeed'. The scene changes to Bob Whierdicht (please note how last name sounds when said aloud) at school taking a shower. Four students drag him from the shower and into the assembly. Equally unconscionable, the principal states to Calvin, "That's a - hard one- to top." The only redeeming quality of the scene is Calvin lending Bob his letter jacket.When students worry about bullying, these writers and producers of Control Intelligence apparently feel a thirteen year-old can see the above because Calvin later mentions to his wife that Bob never returned after that day. Present day, Bob contacts Calvin via computer. After Calvin responds sexual material is displayed on his computer. Three more minutes Dwayne Johnson finally makes his appearance as Bob. Following two or three more sentences I left; ten minutes after the movie started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pathetic excuse for a star comedy. Not even trying to be convincing on any level it plods through some 'twists' and the stars pick up their paychecks. There is no reason to care about anyone or anything in this badly written, badly shot bore. Why did it take more than one major studio to bring this waste of money to the screen? Another annoying film where a main character (Kevin Hart's) arrested then acts and starts babbling in ways that no living person ever would while the arresting CIA agents hang around in the scene inertly (and no, his act is not in the slightest way funny.) Likewise its hard to get any handle on Dwayne Johnson's character - he's made good from being the bullied fat kid at the opening but a confusing trajectory which led him to be a CIA agent, but is he good or rogue? Who cares? His giving a comeuppance to a nasty character is just thrown away too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I didn't trick you, you offered to help me." Calvin Joyner (Hart) was the most popular and successful student in high school. Years after graduation he is struggling to live up to expectations and is considering not attending his class reunion. When Bob Stone (Johnson), the most unpopular kid in school shows up Calvin thinks he is being nice by talking to him. When Bob's true intentions, and secrets, come out Calvin is put in a rough spot..and the fate of the world rests on him. I was not really looking forward to seeing this at all. I'm not a huge fan of The Rock and I do think Kevin Hart is funny, but can get a little annoying sometimes. I say that to tell you that this movie is hilarious and both of those actors where amazing in this. The Rock really lets his comedic side show and Hart does a great job playing, essentially, the straight man in this movie. Not once did I find him annoying and that added to the enjoyment of this for me. There are some very funny lines and scenes in this and I laughed pretty hard and loud a lot throughout this. Overall, one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while, great chemistry by the actors but the best part was that no one seemed to try to hard?which made it seem real. I highly recommend this. I give this an A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Central Intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part "buddy comedy", part "odd couple", part espionage thriller and part anti-bullying manifest. The result: I don't remember. Central Intelligence is one of those films which are so generic and lacking of personality that, even a few hours after having watched it, I struggle to remember something I liked... or even something I didn't like. The story is built by pre-fabricated scenes we have seen in uncountable films (examples: the louts bothering the hero in a bar and getting what they deserve; the government agents who end up being villains, etc.). With two likable actors in the leading roles (the opinion of the reader might vary) and a screenplay co-written by the subversive comedian Ike Barinholtz, I expected Central Intelligence to at least offer enough humor to compensate the incoherent "mystery" of the stolen secret codes; the anemic "action" scenes, incapable of generating the slightest suspense or exciting; and the "endearing" (and instantaneous) friendship forged between two different, and at the same time similar, persons. Dwayne Johnson repeats his "sensitive tough guy" routine; Kevin Hart is given the ungrateful role of being a generic buffoon; and Amy Ryan brings some gravity as the agent in charge of the investigation (Does she belong to the good or evil ones? Who cares?). I wish I had a more vehement (either positive or negative) opinion about Central Intelligence; unfortunately, it's one of those grey and indifferent films which aren't worthy of being remembered. I feel it would have been more productive to talk about the restaurant in which I ate after watching Central Intelligence; but the food was equally insipid. Good metaphor of the movie; bad culinary experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life After High School</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a high school senior "Calvin Joyner" (Kevin Hart) has it all?he is popular, smart, athletic, adored by his pretty girlfriend "Maggie" (Danielle Nicolet) and has just been voted "Most Likely to Succeed" by his peers. "Robbie Wierdicht" (Dwayne Johnson) by comparison, is the high school loser who is terribly obese and is shunned and tormented by the other students. So badly tormented that on the last day of school he is dragged onto the basketball court totally naked in front of the student body so that his humiliation can be complete. Sadly, Calvin is the only person who feels any sympathy for Bob and even lends him his high school jacket to cover him. But life has a way of evening things out and 20 years later it is Calvin who is ashamed to go to his high school reunion because he feels he will be seen as a failure for not living up to everybody's expectations. Robbie, on the other hand, has been motivated by his treatment in high school and has not only buffed up but has also joined the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) where he leads a life of mystery and high adventure under the new name of "Bob Stone". Yet even then he is still ashamed and so on the night before the high school reunion he reaches out to the only person who was ever nice to him?Calvin Joyner. Naturally, being the nice guy that he is Calvin accepts Bob's invitation to have a drink and renew their acquaintance. But what Calvin doesn't realize is that Bob is currently involved in a severe case of espionage and that his life will never be the same afterwards. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this particular comedy had some genuinely funny scenes and both Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson played their parts exceptionally well. Unfortunately, the film was marred by unnecessary vulgarity along with a bad ending and this really affected the movie as a whole. Even so, the humor essentially carried the day and because of that I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fairly entertaining production that is action packed with a few laughs. Though I was quite let down as both of the main actors can be quite humorous in their own way, and this was not necessarily the case. Don't get me wrong there were a few laughs but not as many as you would expect. The movie started pretty well but towards the end it got a bit hard to keep up with, confusing and just disappointing. I thought the lines were fairly well written. This movie is more for people of younger ages, as the movie is more 'goofy' than funny. The character that the Johnson plays is not like his usual characters as he plays Robbie who is seemingly childish, but Dwayne seems to pull it off with a few sloppy scenes here and there. Overall this movie was fairly good but a bit of a disappointment with comedy and did not lack in action packed scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Comedy Does Not Fulfill What Promises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart join forces in a predictable comedy and not as extraordinary as its grosses at the box office."Central Intelligence" is a classic buddy cop film (CIA agents and everything else) starring two of the personalities most influential and striking of North America, Johnson and Hart - MTV Awards 2016 was presented by them and will be together in the remake of "Jumanji" next year - must save the world of a corrupt cartel that threatens the global economy. It doesn't seem a very original plot, nevertheless, it is the impact of its protagonists that makes spectators buy one ticket to see it. I did it and discovered the truth.Directed and partly written by Rawson Marshall Thurber, the story saturates a cliché argument with predictable and ridiculous plot twists, but which undeniably is fun. Chemistry of the pair is not brilliant nor funny like Poehler and Fey, nevertheless, they successfully establish their connection and dazzle talent and joy. Well made jokes and a few unexpected cameos molded the surprises of the film, but it is not enough to hide the doubtful development. Accept it, Hart and "The Rock" do not have enough material to keep a comedy that abuses its duration (1 hour and 47 minutes), that only manages McCarthy, maybe, it would have been better a lenght lighter and shorter.20 years ago, Calvin Joyner (Hart) -nicknamed "The Golden Jet" - was the star student and champion of guys, therefore, he is commemorated by the sycophant director in front of school, such attention is diverted by an atrocious action, an psychological aggression on the personality of Bob (Johnson), overweight boy is victim of school bullying and he is thrown naked in front of hundreds of teenagers; that's where Calvin gives him his jacket so that covers up himself, the guy comes out as grateful as sadden by the event, the first encounter of a disorting friendship. Currently, the boy with the future more promising, works as an accountant, has a humble house and lives with his wife Maggie (Danielle Nicolet). The guys at school have organized a meeting for all students of that period, which do not like Calvin on account of his drastic change of life and his abrupt change of thought. Social networks are a viable link to meet people, Calvin knows it and decides to accept an invitation from Facebook, having a night of drinks with his renewed friend from high school. Starting from there, it unfolds the meet of their lives, what do you do, where do you live, with whom; Stone manages to stay in the house of his friend, he realizing that it CIA would come to the following day claiming that his friend of the last night is a dangerous criminal.Thurber carried out an acceptable work, a comedy that we've already seen before full of unnecessary twists and a few funny jokes starring by the real stars, "The Rock" a brawny with much, much talent and Hart a little guy with much, much inventiveness. It was not a disappointment, but the pieces did not fit together in the filmic puzzle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Hart is short Part 6 only it is actually pretty funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Central Intelligence is another entry into the Kevin Hart partners with a stronger and taller person. However, the exception that actually helps this movie is the addition of Dwayne Johnson as that partner. This movie tries to change the formula around by having Kevin Hart be the straight man for once and The Rock goes for the crazy role which makes this for an entertaining time.Good: Hart and Johnson make a good team together with chemistry and a great back and forth. I like that Hart takes a backseat as plays the straight man while The Rock goes for the comedy by playing a very naive goofy guy. The dynamic works and overcomes the staleness of the plot. The jokes work because of the chemistry between the two actors. There are also a couple of cameos that brought some surprise laughs.Bad: The plot is still your basic buddy cop comedy and it doesn't stray from the formula. The villains are cookie cutter and the action is alright. There is an attempt for a twist that doesn't really work as the predictability weighs heavily on it.Overall, as another Kevin Hart buddy cop comedy, this is easily the best one he has made thanks to the inclusion of Dwayne Johnson. Worth a shot if you are in the mood for a light comedy.</fullReview>

Shenanigans ensue, when Hart is unsure if Johnson is who he claims to be, or if he's a killer and hacker.Hart occasionally overdoes his usual screeching act, but he does well as the straight man, and he and Johnson do have a great chemistry together, which alone makes this worth watching. Jason Bateman puts is a really weird, but really funny cameo, as the former high school bully, in a weird twist, vaguely reminiscent of 2015's, The Gift. Funny but unmemorable buddy/ action movie could have benefited from a bit of editing, it's about fifteen minutes too long, and has at least three endings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had quite a bit going for it, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, they're known for decent films, but this movie had too many cons, but let's start with the good side:1. The action scenes were a good balance between funny, action packed &amp; borderline ridiculous, Hart's lines during the action sequences made up for some of the ridiculousness. 2. Johnson's &amp; Hart's chemistry is good, it's not amazing, it's just good. They bounced off each other, they're lines, some of which were improv, didn't totally fall flat, but some did.The Cons: 1. The writers were trying too hard to make the viewers expect something, but throw us completely off guard it makes either, no sense, or makes the characters seem too dumb. 2. A lot of the references to pop culture fell flat &amp; were too outdated. Everything from old online videos that weren't incredible back then &amp; now are just obscure to reference now. 3. Johnson's character is just too weird, if you've seen the trailer, that's basically who the character is, he's too dumb &amp; weird, it could almost be insulting to some people. 4. The Trailer Showed The Whole Film! They tried to make it so it's not the obvious answer, but it's the trailer &amp; I quickly got bored of it.But my biggest problem with Central Intelligence is: The Bloopers Are The Best Part! During the credits, they show bloopers from the film &amp; they were genuinely funnier than the rest.You'll enjoy it if you're a 15 year old boy, but it's more of a last resort to waste time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the success of "We're the Millers", a comedy that got mixed reactions from critics, yet that I personally really enjoyed, Rawson Marshall Thurber is back with another comedy. In "Central Intelligence" Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) meets through Facebook an old high school companion Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson). After what appears to be an innocent night of drinks between buddies, Calvin is lured into an espionage plot by Stone who doesn't accept 'no' as an answer for Calvin's involvement.Despite not being particularly excited for this comedy, I was curious enough to check out what The Rock and Hart could have in store for a good buddy action comedy and the results are kind of underwhelming, even though nobody comes out of this looking bad.The film opened with a very offbeat flashback scene that could not find its voice and ended up being mean spirited. It turns you off immediately because other than being uncomfortable it also is not funny. Fortunately, as soon as Kevin Hart appears on screen as his present-day self a lot of that goes away because had it kept going in that direction it could have become one of the most annoying and ridiculous films of recent years.I cannot say I laughed a lot in this film, the laugh out loud count was most probably under six, yet in its defense I can confidently say that throughout the whole duration I did have a smile on face. That is indicative of the measure of the film. It is not by any means a great comedy, there isn't a smart use of cinematic technique to deliver laughs, it is shot way too generically to give it any kind of interesting or upbeat stamp to it. Not to mention how utterly overbearing is this predictable plot which isn't half as smart as the writers think it is and doesn't become a parody on itself or the genre, it does not give the film a funny self consciousness, it falls just flat unfortunately and fails to matter in the bigger picture.What the movie does have is two great, charismatic, funny leads, with good chemistry that play off each other perfectly when there isn't generic writing or directing getting in their way. Many times you don't get to enjoy Hart of Johnson because of standard witty banter or observational comedy that we have seen too many times in American comedies and is a trend that has to end because it clearly isn't funny. Yet, when the two leads manage to play a scene fully or riff off each other it is a joy to see and Hart does a good job of playing the straight man and letting Johnson unfold on screen, which gives us some great moments and some very good running gags that were some of the most funny parts of the film. Moreover an element that is nailed in the film is giving each secondary and even tertiary characters a specific vibe which results in some great laughs and henchmen not being anonymous people appearing on screen and instead contributing to the picture.Whilst the ending of the film was a disaster that made my score and overall enjoyment of the film decline, I still had a decent time with Central Intelligence, it isn't a fresh comedy by any means but it had some inspired moments</fullReview>

Even if the chemistry between Johnson and Heart is just right and they act greatly together, I'm missing some new innovative ideas in the movie. It's clearly fun to watch but it's never really surprising. At some point the story line misses something and gets confusing for a while. Later in the movie this problem doesn't matter anymore because the main part of the story is over too fast.The friendship of Johnson's and Heart's characters changes through the whole movie several times, which just gets boring in the end. And don't get me wrong: I like the movie and the ending but it's definitely not new to me.All in all the movie offers good entertainment with two well playing actors and an average screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was highly disappointed by an absolutely awful script for this concept. For the genre of comedy, action there was the addition of dramatic elements of the Hero's character. This was actually a sub-genre of comedy: The buddy picture. Both characters had back stories to their high school days. There's the irony of the overachiever "little guy" and the buffoonery and cruelty toward the "fat guy." Then we have the "most likely to succeed" wallowing in his career as opposed to the "fat guy" who worked out 6 hours/day for 20 years and now is a superman in strength and who now is a CIA operative with superhuman combat skills. But how the above was related to the audience is where this script really fell down. The opening 10 minutes was pure talk. No action, just talk, talk, talk in one location. And then we have the incident we've been waiting for: the meeting of the two buddies. Then for the next 10 minutes, we have more talk, talk, talk at a bar...one location. So for 20 minutes, it's slow moving and going nowhere. In the action genre the audience comes prepared to see action. There is none. In the last 10 minutes of Act 1, we finally get a reveal as to the covert work that Dwayne has been doing these past 20 years, but it's more talk, talk, talk. Then we have the C.I.A. breaking in and we have the spoof of the Bourne series. Okay. I love the acting of the two buddies, but the script was so predictable, and yet so abysmally boring with talk, talk, talk, the audience was shifting in their seats from sheer frustration. No spoilers here, but this was an idiotic plot with predictable turns. Even the decent chemistry between the stars could not save it for me.</fullReview>

Kevin Hart was his funny old self as usual, couldn't fault him, but the poor plot couldn't even help him stand out. The poster and trailer looked like it would be one of the funniest, and best, movies of the year, but it really wasn't.To explain the 4 stars - it wasn't the worst movie in the world, but for its big names and huge hype, it didn't deliver. It had somewhat funny bits but in all honesty, a movie that added nothing to my life, and one that I could have done without watching.You're better off waiting for this movie to come out on a movie channel rather than going to see it on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just discovered another "big" actor, Dwayne Johnson. He's very big, 6' 4" (1.93 m). I can not say that he doesn't have some charm, I expected something much worse from this "Central Intelligence". I don't know about Kevin Hart, is he really a gifted comic actor or just a tedious presence? The other actors, Amy Ryan, Jason Bateman, Aaron Paul, Thomas Kretschmann? They do their best to win their existence, it's not easy at all to be an actor, specially when the script it's not so good. Anyway, it has some action and some good music. For the level of "intelligence" in the world today, the film is above. Be careful with the CIA, not to burst over you in the house (or cinema), while you watch it! Everything is possible nowadays...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bullied as a teen for being overweight, Bob Stone shows up to his high school saviour, Calvin Joyner, looking fit and muscular. Calvin is a a fast-talking accountant who misses his glory days as a popular athlete. Stone is now a lethal CIA agent who needs Calvin's number skills to help him save the compromised U.S. spy satellite system. Together, the former classmates encounter shootouts, espionage and double-crosses while trying to prevent worldwide chaos......Kevin Hart is a wonder of cinema. When he has the right co-star, with the right material, his films are passable fluff (The Ride Along films). With the wrong material, and him taking over the film, they can be quite unbearable (everything else).So Kudos to him for letting Johnson hog everything and play against type as a Unicorn loving, fanny pack wearing CIA agent who is still a little bit touchy about an incident that we see in the beginning as a flashback.And if the flashback was the foreshadowing of the film, it wouldn't be as enjoyable as it is, because when we get back to the present, predictably the tables have turned for the two characters. Bob is now the one with the huge personality, whilst Calvin feels a little deflated in how his life has turned out since finishing high school.It's all been there done that narrative, but the two leads have chemistry, and the writers either had the sense to do proper comedy rather than rely on derogatory racial, sexual, and cultural humour, or they just just forgot.And in turn, it makes it just that little bit more refreshing than it should be.Yes, it features predictable comedy that you'd expect, like Hart trying to copy his friends CIA type skills, someone being shot and then whining about it, and of course, the bully from the opening being g played by a special guest star in the present, whom gets his comeuppance.For a film that has such lenient certification, it's pretty violent in a couple of instances, especially during a torture scene, and a fight that references a certain Patrick Swayze film.But for a comedy, in this day and age, not to be derogatory to some minority is an absolute bonus, as they don't need gimmicks to pull the audience in.If it's successful, I'm sure they'll be a less enjoyable sequel, but for now, I'll be chuckling to myself at when Hart walks away nervously from a car that's about to explode.Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is not good or bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here comes another buddy cop film, this time with Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart in the lead roles. The film does not look silly for the wise decision of making it into a comedy and it sparks thanks to the strong rapport between Johnson and Hart. It is not really funny, basically there is no one good laugh in the whole movie. But, there are many somewhat funny situations/lines, like when Rock and his little partner jump out the window onto a big balloon-monkey. It is not really fun, but, it is engaging enough to not be boring or just plain bad. The Rock kicks some but, but in a mostly-believable way and not too much. Acting is not really good, it's mostly over-acting, but, both the Rock and his little partner don't "overdo over-acting", so to speak. Again, it's a comedy, over-acting is somewhat expected. So there are a lot of better movies, but, this one satisfies the minimum quality bar. This movie is not good or bad. This movie starting is from the past 20 years ago. In 1996, extremely popular student and star athlete Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) is being honored at his high school's senior pep rally. His obese classmate Robbie Wheirdicht (Dwayne Johnson) is being bullied by a student named Trevor (Jason Bateman) while showering in the boys' locker room. Robbie is thrown into the gym naked by Trevor and his friends just as Calvin is receiving his award, and everyone erupts in laughter except for Calvin and his girlfriend Maggie (Danielle Nicolet). Calvin takes off his varsity jacket and gives it to Robbie, who covers himself up, thanks Calvin, and runs away in embarrassment. 20 years later, Calvin is married to Maggie and works as an accountant. He is dissatisfied with his career. He want to be back at high school. One day, Calvin receives a friend request on Facebook from a man named Bob Stone, who reveals that he is Robbie and requests that they meet at a bar. Calvin is shocked to see that Robbie has transformed into a tall, muscular, confident man. Robbie easily defeats a group of four men that try to bully them. As Bob drops Calvin off at his house, he asks Calvin to review a few accounting records, saying he has payroll issues. Calvin deciphers the records as multi-million dollar transactions from an auction, with the final payment set to be made the following day. Bob avoids Calvin's questions and ends up spending the night on his couch. The next morning, a group of CIA agents led by Pamela "Pam" Harris (Amy Ryan) arrive at Calvin's house in search of Bob, who escapes after erasing all evidence of his presence. Pam warns Calvin that Bob is a dangerous rogue agent who has the intention of selling satellite codes to the highest bidder. As the CIA agents follow Calvin to his office, Bob successfully abducts Calvin and explains that he is trying to stop a criminal known as the Black Badger from selling the satellite codes, but needs Calvin's skills as a forensic accountant to find the coordinates of the deal's location. However, Calvin did not believe in Bob. Calvin flees and calls Maggie, telling her to meet him at the marriage counselor's office. Pam intercepts him and informs him that Bob murdered his own partner Phil (Aaron Paul) and is the Black Badger himself. She warns him to refrain from telling Maggie and gives him a device to alert them to Bob's location. Bob met Calvin in building again. Bob convinces Calvin to help him. As they leave the building, Pam calls Calvin and threatens to arrest Maggie if he fails to help them detain Bob. Calvin is forced to betray Bob and the CIA arrests him. Calvin feels guilty and decides to help Bob. The two manage to escape successfully. They steal an airplane and fly to Boston where they can deal with Black Badger. At a park in Boston, Calvin guesses that the deal must be happening in an underground parking garage. Bob tells Calvin to stay outside and enters the garage alone. However, when he sees Pam entering the garage a short while later, Calvin mistakenly assumes that she is the Black Badger and runs after her. He finds Bob meeting with the buyer and claiming to be the Black Badger. Phil arrives, revealing that he is alive, and claims that he is the real Black Badger. The buyer attempts to retrieve codes from both Bob and Phil, but the CIA arrives and a shootout begins, while Calvin grabs both codes and runs outside. He encounters Bob and Phil, who engage in combat. Unable to decide who is the criminal, Calvin aims blindly and shoots Bob, allowing Phil to knock him out. Phil then confesses to being the Black Badger and reveals that Bob is innocent. Before Phil can kill Calvin, he causes a distraction and allows Bob to rip Phil's throat out, killing him. The two deliver the codes to Pam, who then drops them off to their high school reunion. Trevor attempts to bully Bob again, but Bob knocks him out with one punch. As Bob delivers his speech, he relives his most embarrassing high-school moment and takes off all his clothes confidently. He walks off stage to unite with his high school crush Darla and they share a kiss. During the ending credits, Maggie is revealed to be pregnant and Calvin has joined the CIA. As a gift for his first day, Bob returns to Calvin his varsity jacket from high school.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had some funny parts but fell apart in my opinion because of Dwayne's character. Fair enough he was a nerd in school but as he started buffing up and getting all the ladies he would've gained confidence and not still been all nerdy as he matured. I don't think Kevin knew how to work with that ridiculous character and so it didn't really work as a whole. Someone else nailed it here when they said it lacks depth. The characters are trying too hard to be funny and super buddy and just don't gel. I would almost rather see Kev and the rock put in a real life situation, reality TV style, where their own jokes would be much funnier! Just my point of view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE: Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and the rest of the cast are having a great time in this buddy, espionage, action, comedy and so will you. A high school classmate (Johnson) shows up 20 years later seeking 'accounting' help from the most popular kid in school (Hart) and the latter becomes involved, with great reluctance in a plot to secure secret US satellite codes. Johnson may or may not be the Black Badger who may or may not be a rouge CIA operative who is after the codes. The direction keeps the story moving at a crisp pace, the comic timing is spot on, the sight gags are sharp, the action sequences are entertaining and it's laugh out loud funny. There is a cameo performance at the end that will delight. Score: 8.5. Go. Stay for the out takes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the central mystery of who was the Black Badger in this movie. The action sequences were great, but the comedy was lacking throughout the movie. The funniest moment was hands down when Calvin receives the friend request from "Bob Stone" and some guy pops up on the screen with a metal rod attached to him. That was hilarious. There were some awesome nods to shows like the Office and Breaking Bad, like how Amy Ryan was named Pam (receptionist from the Office), and when Aaron Paul said "BITCH," just like he does in Breaking Bad. I didn't find Kevin Hart and The Rock to be as funny as everyone else did, but the movie was still good. The first 20 minutes or so were hilarious, but the rest was average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen a comedy movie that had made me laugh out loud in a while. Most movies nowadays throw in drugs, sex and parties which pretty much sums up most of the comedic movies that have hit the big screen in 2016. I wasn't expecting much out of this movie, but I knew that I had a decent chance to get a laugh.Both Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson delivered with a chemistry which could only be described as bromance; a bromance which rivals Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in rush hour 1, and 2. Now don't get me wrong here, I am not saying it was a better bromance than we witnessed in those movies, but it definitely gives those two a run for their money.Grab the popcorn, hang on tight, and enjoy the movie like you were about to watch Jackie Chan in rush hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best part is Dwayne Johnson, weakest part is Kevin Hart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is better than others are giving it credit for, and I am largely unsure why. The plot is solid and keeps you guessing, the acting is for the most part perfect. The jokes are on point, the pacing is good, and you are able to laugh then rest and then get excited over a well down action scene rest and then repeat the process. It is hard to find a movie that lets you get a moment to catch your breath and reset your emotions a little. The Rock is amazing in his role of someone so friendly and caring, yet also so out of touch with reality. He has good chemistry on screen with Kevin, and the scenes of him just basically ignoring everything Kevin has to say or think in order for him to get him to come along are done very well. Where the movie has trouble is the scenes with Kevin Hart trying to be Kevin Hart. When he is in a scene without Dwayne, and is trying to be funny it falls flat. His over the top style doesn't work when someone is being better at it, which Dwayne does in almost every scene. Kevin actually does some good acting when he is serious and not trying to force laughter on the audience. Also the movie is paced at such perfection that you don't even notice that 2 hours have flown by, and that is important. A 2 hour film is a long sit, and when you are thinking about the time and not the movie that tells you that a movie hasn't got you invested in it, but Central Intelligence does a good job of keeping you invested. I can't wait to own this one on DVD.</fullReview>

Majority of the scenes weren't funny, and they just seemed to happen for no explainable reason (The plot is really weak). The acting was above average, but not particularly great. I would put this down to the fact that there was no real story line, this movie felt like it was all over the place.I found myself rather bored throughout a lot of the movie, and ended up scrolling through Facebook to pass the time.

It could have been a good funny movie if someone knew how to wright the script. Instead it was a nasty bunch of crap. Nasty sexual references and fowl language. So unnecessary. I was surprised that Dewayn Johnson would have his name on anything this bad. And I don't see how it received a PG13 rating when it should have been rated R. Let me put it this way. This was the first movie I ever walked out on before it ended. For anyone with kids I would suggest picking another movie. I made the mistake of taking my 12 and 13 year old. There is junk in this movie that made me sick and ashamed to watch it much less my kids. My 13 year old said this was even worse than she hears in the hallways of her middle school.

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson, and all the other big names that made appearances in this movie. However, they kept setting up situations that could have been really funny - but nothing happens. The joke just withers away. It was like they had a lot of funny jokes or situations in the script, but at the last minute the censors made them take out the punchlines. I did like the story, and there was even a bit of "who dunnit" suspense. The fact that they had a decent structure and great talent leaves me thinking that the writers were more interested in drama and action than comedy - but the movie was promoted as a comedy, and has several events and props that scream "COMEDY MOVIE." But when it came to being funny, for the most part it left me hanging. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart were still doing a top notch job delivering the material they had, but this movie could wait for home viewing.</fullReview>

Save yourself some money and time by just having a cheap laugh at the trailer as this contains the few decent parts of the movie. The predictable story line of the popular high school jock (Kevin Hart) in the future becoming a bit of a loser stuck in a dead end job. While a school nerd becoming some cool FBI agent (Dwayne Johnson) is such a lazy plot and there is no real development on the story line other than this. Not to mention the fact that Dawyne Johnsons attempt to play a different sort of character than the typical hard man just comes across strange and unbelievable and is one of the worst examples of acting i have ever seen in my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie Central Intelligence is a hilarious action comedy. This movie mixes humor with action at the same time, and Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson are a great pair together as their acting is outstanding. I read the reviews and noticed that the critics judged the movie by saying it was a typical buddy cop comedy movie such as "21,22 Jump Street, but they are wrong because the plot is very easy to understand and it stands out of 21 Jump Street or any other buddy cop movie. This film has a message to it which is about bullying. Bob Stone back in the day was known as Robbie Werdicht and was bullied and thrown out naked onto the gym. While Calvin "The Golden Jett" Joyner was the all star of the whole school and was very popular. Calvin helps Robbie by giving him is Letterman jacket, so Robbie could walk out of the gym covering his private part, while the whole gym just laughed at Robbie. 20 years later Bob shows up to his high school reunion looking tough and it shows that people can change as Bob did. Bob stands on the stage all proud and shows that even if I was bullied I am a changed man now. I think that many people should watch this movie because it has a great message to it. The one thing that could've been better about the film is the plot, but overall great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We haven't really gotten a Kevin Hart film that is on par with his stand-up comedy. Heck, it's possible that we never will. Humorous reactions aside, he's a storyteller. And a very good one. Maybe writing a film will prove to be his fit, but for now, we get sporadic characters, mostly just thrown into comedic scenarios and told to swim. Fortunately, it hasn't hurt Hart's star quality and people still flock to the theaters to go see him. But still, we had yet to see him take on as compelling of a character as his role in Central Intelligence.Back in high school, Hart's character, Calvin, was the most popular guy in school. And 20 years later, he fears that his best days are behind him. His classmate, Bob (Dwayne Johnson), was an overweight kid who was horrendously bullied all his life. In school, Calvin was the only one who was nice to him, and Bob developed somewhat of an obsession with Calvin. Which would be creepy if Bob wasn't a tough CIA agent.Throughout, you're never quite sure whether or not you trust Bob--which could probably be avoided if the filmmakers didn't want it to happen so badly. But it's fine, since it makes the experience more enjoyable for us as well.The film wants Johnson's character to be the central figure, but Hart's is far more interesting. The struggles he deals with are touched upon briefly early on, but mostly forgotten about as the film progresses.The chemistry between Hart and Johnson is a brilliant discovery and one that hopefully sees the light of day again. The fact that Johnson isn't a comedian works in the film's favor. The writers can do what they do best and fully invent a whole new person without having to rely on the stylings of an already-established comedian. That job is reserved for Hart.The character the writers create for Johnson is hilarious. And he commits fully to it. His Facebook page states that he loves unicorns and guns. In person, it's apparent he also loves fanny packs.Director Rawson Marshall Thurber has fun with these little idiosyncrasies. He knows what the audience will react well to. Even the subtle stuff.The plot isn't too complicated. It tries to be, and it's appreciated, but it mostly consists of a format that has proved to work time and time again. We won't complain. Nor can we. And luckily, there's just enough to it to show that this is more than just a vessel for two stars.For perhaps the best Kevin Hart film to date, the laughs aren't over-the-top the whole time, but usually you'll at least have something to smile about. It's entertaining from beginning to end.Twizard Rating: 89</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank goodness Kevin Hart always co-stars with superior people to carry him through any project. Will Ferrell, Ice Cube, The Rock?all actors who can rightfully steal any scene from Hart. But, it really doesn't take much.I do think Hart is funny?though he's just so middle of the road, always borderline homophobic and plays the same character. Luckily, this go- around, he had the incredibly more interesting and fun-to-watch, THE ROCK.The Rock is someone who is so unbelievably charismatic and really built as one, it's hard to dislike him in ANYTHING. Here, I liked him a ton. I really liked his character throughout. So, when Hart normally gets upstaged, I barely even noticed him this time.As for the movie?It's enjoyable and funny at times, but like Hart, it's so middle of the road. There is absolutely nothing new here. The plot is 30 years old, the action, though good (best scene is in the bar, early on) and the twists easy to figure out. Thank goodness, again, for The Rock who saved us ? and the movie ? once again.After an amazingly awful, unfunny and terrible prank at the end of a high school year, victim Bob betters himself, joins the CIA and gets framed. He needs the help of the only person that showed him mercy during the prank to solve the case. Two things, ah-hem, stick out here. Number one, I am not sure if we, the audience, were supposed to laugh with all the assholes in the high school during the prank. The movie sets it up that way; the kids laugh, the administration does nothing, no one's held accountable and even the Principal carries on as if nothing happened. Yes, this is a comedy, but come on. That's so incredibly criminal, it's nowhere near funny or plausible.And second, the ending was so incredible awkward and just as unreal as the opening. No spoilers, but I'd like to say I understand why he did what he did, but no, there is no reason. It was dumb and went on for far too long.That all said, again, with The Rock's help, his own humor and likability and some of Hart's jokes that worked, it's a slight recommendation. ***Final thoughts: Notice how I didn't mention the prank's details? Because I don't want to spread that hate and bully tactics. The movie "tried" to show retribution in the closing, but it was weak by that point. Mercifully, there's the bar scene early on that really worked. Quick, obvious and predictable, but satisfying.</fullReview>

At the beginning, Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) and Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) has a good separation and the viewer is led to the fact that this film can be one of the positive odd balls of the mentioned section in movies. A successful student in high school becomes an accountant and lives a "normal silent life". In comes a vivid and colourful character and the "normal social life" played out from Kevin Hart is taken too lightly and the situation becomes a parody spelling Dwayne Johnson. As the both story and the film develops, the characters is, sadly, thrown right into the fire of cliché and parody. Kevin Hart is fighting to give his ridiculous character life, and Dwayne Johnson should have been treated more professional from the director. Mr. Johnson "The Rock" can act, the director just has to push him further and harder. Anyhow, as in "all of these kind of silly dumb sitcoms movies", "Central Intelligence" should have been in the central of intelligence (pun intended). With that, the audience could have gotten a great movie. Instead, it is like; "Here we go; another sitcom movie. Laugh hard and laugh....now! Laugh now!" Too bad. An example; the therapy scene about 54 minutes into the movie. And... to top it off like frosty on a cake tasting real bad and cheesy; Melissa McCarthy!Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Melissa McCarthy should be given a chance to prove themselves in serious movies. And Jason Bateman. One good and fine actor, sadly placed within sitcoms and "funny" movies. He should really be given some block buster chances, 'cause he can deliver. I am confident of that fact.A tip. Take a look after "The End" and the fire deparpment arriving. If you want a taste of "acted bloopers"; look further after "The End". The concept of "Why?" and "Weird" comes into my mind.Enough of bad critique. There is some entertainment and more than 5 really great laughs in "Central Intelligence". Is about 5 honestly and excellent laughs enough? You tell me. One good one liner delivered by Trevor (Jason Bateman): "Get your a...ole of my door!" Movie references throughout and all over the place. From "Roadhouse" to "Snake Gyllenhaal".Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Almost good. A few major errors and goofs that drags "Central Intelligence" down a lot, both in quality and for the rate. Could have been good. - The actors : Give them an honest opportunity. - Entertainment : 20 minutes into the movie, entertaining. Then just... oh, well... - Age : 11.5,3 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of chemistry hurts it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The smallest man in Hollywood teamed up with the largest man in Hollywood. Sounds like a recipe for success, right? After all 'Twins' in 1988 starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito was considered a hit. The problem 'Central Intelligence' faces is that its stars have almost zero chemistry together. They are purely working as individuals. A film can still survive with its stars doing that, but it does take a lot of quality away. Kevin Hart is his usual self, trying to be the life of the party and doing his best Chris Tucker impersonation at the same time. Every movie he's in seems to be almost the same performance these days. Does he have more levels to his acting ability? I'm starting to doubt it. Dwayne Johnson on the other hand gives a fairly solid performance. He had layers, with his character changing motives many times throughout the film, and he pulls them all off. He was still lacking the comedic timing that a professional funny-man would have nailed, but his enormous physique also lets him pull off jokes that others could not get away with. Sadly though, both are acting purely on their own and never manage to feed off each other. Luckily for them the script is actually quite strong and well-written which covers a lot of this up. There are some quite good action scenes and the story actually has some genuine mystery and suspense to it at times. There's a tremendous amount of nods to the audience to look out for (one from Aaron Paul of 'Breaking Bad' is particularly noticeable) and some unexpected cameos that work in quite well. All in all it's a watchable, yet forgettable, action- comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Central Intelligence stars Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson and its the story of how Kevin's Harts character teams up with The Rock for a CIA mission of some-kind. The best part of this film is the chemistry of the main leads. Kevin Hart and the Rock play each other really well and they seem to be having the most fun in this movie. But what this film fell apart for me is the "intriguing" story the film tries to tell. Its really dull and too complicated for its own. Besides that, the film is really funny and i think Kevin Hart steals the whole show. The Rock is fine but since his character is being bullied throughout the film and also in the past, the film does a lousy representing what i think is a good message, but its handled in the worst way possible and its really cliché. Also i don't know why but throughout the film, Kevin Hart does not want any part to do with the rock's plan, and it kinda seems that The Rock is a bad guy, and that was kind of weird at first. Then it kicked off where it started at the end based on the chemistry of the leads. Overall, the action well handled, its really funny at parts, and the actors play well with one another, but the story that the film tries to give us, its really bad. Also the overall message is important but not played well in this film. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Central Intelligence' is driven by the charisma of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Kevin Hart. Both of the terrific actors boast enviable energy &amp; rise above the film's clichéd narrative. Its good fun! 'Central Intelligence' Synopsis: After he reconnects with an awkward pal from high school through Facebook, a mild-mannered accountant is lured into the world of international espionage.'Central Intelligence' rests on a predictable plot, that doesn't hold much innovation. But, as mentioned before, its Johnson &amp; Hart who make it thoroughly watchable &amp; also enjoyable. They are willingly ready take up the silly jokes &amp; also turn up the action-sequences, with complete conviction. And Director Rawson Marshall Thurber plays to their strengths right!On the whole, 'Central Intelligence' has its heroes doing it right. Watch It for them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is outdated racial stereotypical trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can American be so crude and out dated as to keep making race movies? A formulaic racial stereotypical movie here! The fast- talking, dark-skinned black man with the light skin toned wife, who is intelligent. Had the wife been a dark skinned black woman, she would have been, head shaking, loud, lascivious and uncouth. Don't take my word, go back and watch any movie or television show in which the black woman is dark-skinned, she will be a fool! Of course, some of you can pick an exception, and granted, there may be a few. But the overall formula is light skinned smart, dark skinned dumb, and with no class, sex hungry, etc. And the dark-skinned scared for no reason a black man that Hart portrays here is from the old days of Charlie Chan, Three Stooges Shorts(This house is sho gone crazy!) The difference here is, they can use a little profanity. How many times did Hart make the comment "I'm black" in this movie? It is just sad that Hollywood and our Global Esoteric Elite still prefer to keep the racial stereotypes alive. Italians are all gangsters, the Irish are drunks, Mexicans are thieves, Polish are dumb, and Jews are money hungry! And, it is not playing the race card for me to mention a racial component to a movie or show. This type of entertainment widens the gap between all of us.If you like the movie fine, but keep on living and you'll soon come to understand why this type of brainwashing is bad for our collective humanity. Movies like The Help, The Butler, Django, 12 Years a Slave, and Tarzan, are all a part of the program to bring out ill feelings between blacks and white in this country and the world over. These movies, along with the recent white cop killing black men, and black man ambushing and killing white cops, are all a part of a greater scheme. Don't fall for this folks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a very good Matinée...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not mean that as an insult! This was an enjoyable movie to watch. The movie, overall, is fun. If you don't see the chemistry between Johnson and Hart during the movie, you definitely will in the bloopers that show up during the end credits - which I would stick around for. Story wise, there are not going to be any big surprises. Much like other reviews, I can't help but feel this could have been much funnier. There's plenty to laugh at, certainly, but there wasn't anything that really had me out-of-breath laughing, either from a single joke or a part where there could have been a string of them. However, this movie does have a very good underlying theme, that was set up in the beginning scene, used for creepy/joke material a bit throughout, with redemption at the end. Like I said, a very good matinée.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 3 minutes of bloopers were funnier than the entire film! But not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with a close up of the obese rear end of the usually Herculean Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. As it does a significant pan out shot, it shows him in the shower singing to En Vogue's My Lovin (You're Never Gonna Get It) and jiggling to every beat of the music. Cut to bullies making fun, and throwing him out in front of the entire student body at an assembly to celebrate the many achievements of Kevin Harts character Calvin Joyner aka The Golden Jet.The scene is definitely lacklustre. In part, because of the slightly off graphic of the CGI face/bodies of the actors and their younger counterparts. But also because the scene was the films main teaser trailer and therefore been shown on television for weeks in the lead up and viewed countless times. And perhaps also because simply relying on humour because there's a fat person on screen being bullied isn't exactly everyone's taste.We follow the life of Calvin Joyner, the guy who peaks in high school and his life falls downhill from then. Even though he is married to his high school sweet heart Maggie (Danielle Nicolet), he can't shake the feeling of failure. Not being help that his assistant is promoted before him in the accountancy firm he works at, and he hates his co-workers. In order to shake things up, he lets his old classmate lead him down a dangerous path which involves shoot outs, CIA rats and saving the world, all thanks to his mean skills as an accountant.The film follows a lacklustre theme throughout, a lot of the jokes seem to fall flat. Especially when there repeated throughout expecting the same reaction, and the twist ending was guessed in the first half of the film (you don't hire an actor that popular and only use him for a 2 minute scene). Jokes are pretty simple, Robbie Weirdicht wears a fanny pack and that's apparently hilarious. He acts like a lost puppy for a lot of the film, desperate to befriend with the coolest kid in school.Essentially the big joke is how dorky Robbie is, whilst being in peak physical condition, and how cool Calvin is, despite being the little man. But I think it's the failings in the characters which completely let down this film. Dorky Robbie is completely unbelievable as a CIA agent and what he gets away with in the film is a joke, not the funny kind. You'll be questioning why Calvin doesn't just press the button in the therapist's office for the rest of the film! And as for Kevin Hart's performance of Calvin Joyner? Pretty much the exact same character and performance in other one of his films. Short 'every- man' and kind-hearted to a fault. Loud, quick speaking gibberish when stressed, all with a beautiful wife and some kind of special skill to make him needed for the story. It just doesn't feel like the film was thought out and put together in a concise enough way. The entire film relies on the fact that Robbie is a bit pathetic still because he was bullied and Calvin is a good enough guy to keep helping him.If Robbie made it through the CIA then surely he's built a pretty thick skin along with those muscles. As for Calvin, when a guy you weren't ever friends with asks you to join his illegal and potentially fatal mission. You say no! The premise of the film really requires a suspension of belief from the audience to accept what their seeing, otherwise there's a lot to question.In conclusion the film is a pleasant one, I didn't find myself wanting to get up and leave the Cineworld cinema. It did make me smile on occasion and it might have made me laugh a few times but definitely not the best comedy I've ever seen. Even by Kevin Hart's standards. But if your looking for a silly comedy where you don't have to think too much and you like a bit of slapstick then this is probably your calling!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny enough for summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I'm a sucker for Kevin Hart. I enjoy his act. I like the energy he puts into his performances. I agree that it doesn't really change from film to film, but, for me, that is okay, since I enjoy it. I enjoyed it in RIDE ALONG, I enjoyed it in GET HARD and I enjoyed it here.Such will be the case with you. If you enjoy the schtick that Kevin Hart brings, then you'll enjoy CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE, if he gets on your nerves, then he'll get on your nerves in CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE.If you are somewhere in the middle, or have not seen Kevin Hart before, then this is a good movie for you to check it out.CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE tells the story of Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner (Hart), an "all-everything" High School star who, 20 years later, is stuck in a dead-end job wondering when the spark was taken out of his life. Enter Bob Stone (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) a former classmate that Joyner was kind to. Stone has been transformed from a schlubby loser in High School to...well...THE ROCK! He pulls a reluctant Joyner into an adventure - and hilarity ensues...or, at least, some pretty good laughs.I enjoyed this film. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber (WE'RE THE MILLERS, DODGEBALL) moves the action/comedy along at a fast, but not furious, pace so you can enjoy each scene, but not really worry about the lack of character development or plot holes. Just enjoy it.Is it a topnotch film? No. The plot holes are big and besides Hart's and Johnson's characters, there are no other interesting characters and certainly no other characters are fleshed out. They serve the plot and the comedy and that's it. As for the two main characters, as stated above, Hart plays Hart. Either you like it or you don't. I think this movie swings with what they do with Dwayne Johnson's character. He holds a traumatic bullying experience with him throughout this film and they try to play off of that, I don't think they totally succeed with this, but I applaud the effort.Is this movie going to winner Oscars? No. Is it a fun and entertaining summer film, one that will make you laugh and enjoy yourself for 2 hours? Definitely.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie really tried to be funny. But with all those Kevin Hart movies, it's just a bit much with this movie. It's like people anticipated more after all those movies, which don't really got to be so funny. This movie's earlier premise seems interesting enough that it spots the focus on Dwayne Johnson being a new kind of character than his usual buffed up macho man. But the movie clearly failed to deliver the justified conclusion to its premise. The character development also didn't feel good. The acting is just flat, just all other Kevin Hart comedies. Yet while they depend on the story and jokes, this one failed to deliver in following suit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an action comedy which does not aim very high and therefore does not fall very flat. It's a kind of bromance in which the two male characters are not just different from each other (one a short office worker and the other a huge CIA agent) but different from how the were when they were at the same high school 20 years ago (the coolest kid in school failing to achieve his expected future while the fat, bullied kid becomes a turbo-charged fighting machine).No prizes for guessing which of the two lead actors - Kevin Hart and Dawyne Johnson - takes which role (one fast with his mouth, the other fast with everything else), but they are both sufficiently engaging to make a mediocre movie quite entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humorous, action packed and heart warming story with Dwayne '"The Rock" Johnson and Kevin Hart. I was invited to an advance screening of central intelligence on the 4 June in London hosted by Kevin Hart and the film is certainly a crowd pleaser with a lot of good action in between the silly but funny antics. It's certainly a role reversal with The Rock bringing most of the witty comedy and Hart being the more serious of the two characters. Nonetheless there's a good screen chemistry between these two that doesn't appear in similar Kevin Hart films. This isn't just a roll your eye and laugh at the stupidity type of film. There is an entreating storyline throughout that keeps you guessing to the end and there's a lot of things to keep you entertained along the way much like the Rush Hour movies (Albeit nowhere as good) A Must watch.

		<fullReview>Central Intelligence Directed by Rawson Thurber who you might remember directed DodgeBall and We're the Millers. Unlike DodgeBall, I probably laughed as many times as I did in We're the Millers. This of course isn't the directors fault but Ike Barinholtz's. The guy from MADtv, it was his first time really doing a major film and the jokes were too far and few in between. Dwayne Johnson plays a CIA agent who needs the help of his high school buddy to exonerate him. Johnson committed himself to being in character throughout the film and it really shows how far he's come as an actor. Kevin Hart plays Calvin Joyner, the popular kid in high school that peeked and is having trouble in his personal life now. He just wants to go back to the familiar lifestyle despite being brought in time and time again by Johnson. His performance was much better than in Ride Along 1 or 2. There are three surprise actors in the film that the trailer didn't show and they are each worth it. The dialogue was great, not funny, but much of it takes some references from TV and movie culture to understand. Something perhaps a teenager or elder might not get. I also want to mention that Danielle Nicolet was in the film as Calvin Joyner's wife. She does a wonderful job and is an under-appreciated actress in Hollywood. I recognized her from 3rd Rock from the Sun and as the wife from Key and Peele. Verdict: Watch the movie. Don't watch the trailer as it has many of the funny parts in it and would spoil it for you. The ending is good, but also predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable thanks in large part to Hart &amp; "The Rock"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Central Intelligence succeeds because the chemistry between Kevin Hart &amp; Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is so engaging that the film really becomes the ultimate bromance movie. The chemistry between them is so strong that it almost carries the entire film but ultimately falls short due to a weak third act.Dwayne Johnson portrays a lovable, goofy, yet straight arrow CIA agent. He is impressive as a comedian, he provides plenty of charm and is surprising vulnerable. Kevin Hart is pleasantly restrained but still comes off very likable. He is a great straight man which is a real treat compared to what I usually see him in. Bravo to both men for playing against type.The films biggest flaw is in its third act. The story of these two men who haven't seen each other since high school and becoming reacquainted to attend a high school reunion really should have been the heart of the story with the Johnson's involvement with the CIA kept only as a subplot. As it is, the films third act devolves into a standard, paint by numbers action flick and almost grinds the film to a halt.As it is Central Intelligence is a fun afternoon popcorn flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was hard to accept that Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson were going to be in a movie together. The thought of them having good chemistry....it just never worked for us! However...we were proved wrong again! Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson have excellent chemistry as not only high school buddies, but as a team to work together to bring down the main villain! The first segment of the movie shows us what happened to Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) in school and he he was humiliated and bullied in front of the whole school. Calvin (Kevin Hart) was the only one that really looked out for him or helped him. Now years later Bob Stone sends a facebook message to Calvin asking him if he wants to hang out again like old times. Calvin accepts and they both have a fantastic night. Little does Calvin know what is installed for him: Bob Stone is CIA Agent and needs Calvin help to locate the main Villain behind all of this.Dwayne Johnson is actually really good at comedy. His comedy shines during the first half of the movie, but during the second half Kevin Hart steals the show with his comedy by being over the top and having that high pitched voice we all know and love! The comedy..well..there's hit and misses when it comes to the comedy in this movie, but luckily it is saved by the emotional and heartwarming message of this film, which is that bullying is wrong and you should be accepted no matter who you are and no matter what you do. Normally this does not work in many comedies, but luckily it works here. There were missed opportunities throughout this movie, and it could have been longer and dug deeper within the two main characters, but it is what it is and it gets the job done.All in all, it's a very watchable movie. Heart breaking, emotional and very funny in certain scenes (especially a scene involving a counseling session). Go and grab your girl or guy and sit back ,relax and enjoy Central Intelligence! 3.5/5 stars. 7.5/10 -Autistic Reviewers</fullReview>

The relationship between Kevin Hart and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson are great as well as the other characters, the jokes were freaking hysterical (Including the end credits where they show outtakes of the film) and the story was full of twists that I honestly did not expect. But it does have a bit of a problem: Some, not all but some, of the movie was kind of boring to me. That, and the dialogue was kind of flat at some parts. But overall, Central Intelligence is a mostly great summer comedy and I am glad to give it a 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the producers of Blue Streak (1999), Wedding Crashers (2005) and Role Models (2008) comes Central Intelligence the newest buddy comedy in a long, long, long, long line of paint-by-numbers buddy comedies. In it Calvin "The Jet" Joyner (Hart); formerly the most popular kid in high school, reconnects twenty years later with kinda-sorta friend Bobby Wierdick on the eve of a high school reunion. Growing up, Bobby was morbidly obese, painfully awkward and either bullied or ignored by his classmates. Now Bobby has transformed to Bob Stone; a Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson shaped behemoth who up until the eve of the reunion was a field agent for the CIA. After a night catching up, Calvin is harangued into an espionage plot involving a mysterious terrorist known as the Black Badger.If you were reading the description for the film and automatically thought "ooo fun" then you probably won't be disappointed by Central Intelligence. It's a movie you kind of have to meet halfway as far as shutting down your brain and activating your funny-bone. But once you get there you won't be disappointed. The jokes are broad and occasionally go on too long but they are still reliably funny. In fact, between Keanu (2016), Ride Along 2 (2016) and Zoolander 2 (2016), Central Intelligence is hands down the funniest film coming out of the buddy comedy sub-genre this year. I realized when compared to the aforementioned that's not the strongest endorsement. Allow me to explain further.What makes this film a cut-above the banal helpings of gauche odd couple movies and Martin Lawrence vehicles is the themes of its screenplay. Scribes Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen build a opposites annoy scenario out of a very universal desire to become extraordinary."I really thought I was going to change the world," Calvin says grimly to Bob while walking the halls of his alma mater. When we first see Calvin after graduation, he works as an accountant, pushing papers and passive-aggressively hating on his shiftless co-workers. His only solace is his high school sweetheart Maggie (Nicolet) but even then cracks in the veneer incite her to seek counseling. His life is stagnating. All seems lost; then Bob sends him a Facebook friend request.Much like the film's themes, the success of Central Intelligence also relies on our two charming leads. Kevin Hart plays against-type as the straight man to Johnson's farcical antics. You're not really sure if Johnson's pony obsessing, geeking out to 80's movies and all around light stalker-ish behavior is all an elaborate ruse but his gleeful acceptance of the role he's given is downright endearing. He slips seamlessly from gawky fruitcake, to bada** beefcake all the while teaching Calvin a few lessons about appreciating what you have and who you are along the way.If there is a stumble it lies with the CIA plot point which, while providing some decent action set-pieces, never seems exactly necessary. It's given no weight or consequence putting all the cards squarely on whether Calvin should trust Bob. If anything, this tension halves the audiences' attention between the tenuous partnership and the rekindling friendship. We not sure until the end whether Bob has truly gone rogue thus we don't know if Calvin is just an unwilling patsy forced to do financial work for a suspected terrorist. One couldn't help but wonder if the script was tinkered just a bit to give the audience more information vital to the story, the movie could have been just a skosh better.On it's own however, Central Intelligence is a tolerable little time-waster. It provides more chuckles, stronger direction, stronger story than the competition. It gets two entertaining performances out of its charming leads and even features a few casting surprises along the way. Pound for pound, this film is the funniest currently in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Central Intelligence stars Dwayne(The Rock)Johnson and Kevin Hart and tells the tale of a former popular high schooler named Calvin(played by Hart)who had it all in school. Meanwhile an obese guy called Robbie (played by Johnson)was bullied in school and was made fun of. Fast forward 20 years later and now Calvin is a down on his luck accountant who gets a mysterious invite on FaceBook from a guy called Bob Stone who wants to catch up with Calvin. Little does Calvin know is that Bob Stone was the obese kid at his high school 20 years ago and he is now working for the CIA and is tracking down the black badger. So Calvin and Bob go off on a crazy action packed adventure to find out who is black badger and clear Bob's name. But could Bob's former partner in crime have anything to do with this?Overall I seen this today in the cinemas and quite frankly I really don't know what the critics are saying about it. It was funny and I thought both Dwanye and Kevin had great chemistry as the oddball accountant and the former nerdy loser who was made fun of his weight Robbie.Now I am gonna tell you the good and the bad.Good: The humor was funny and the two main leads was great. Kevin Hart reminds me of Chris Tucker right down to the mannerisms.Bad: The story seems to rip off The Heat which starred Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCartney(who makes a brief cameo in Central Intelligence)and it gets kinda predictable too.Also Dwanye Johnson is a fairly descent actor but his smile is so forced.But still I had a great time watching this with my brother who also laughed at Kevin Hart's references from Sixteen Candles to Taylor Swift even Twilight and Face Book gets mocked in this film.Zootopia's Jason Bateman also makes a cameo as the boy who bullied Dwayne Johnson's character as a kid. 7/104/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Central Intelligence (2016): Dir: Rawson Marshall Thurber / Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Amy Ryan, Aaron Paul, Danielle Nicolet: Action comedy with a title that references heart. Dwayne Johnson plays Robbie Weirdicht, an overweight kid caught showering naked. During a pep rally to finish off the 1996 school year he is tossed by bullies out into the gym where his nakedness is met by laughter by all except one person. Kevin Hart plays Calvin Joyner, an accountant who is passed up for a promotion and feels that his life is going nowhere. He was high regarded in high school but became a hero to Robbie when he issued his jersey to cover himself up during the prank incident. He is married to his high school sweetheart but unsatisfied with his life. Robbie re-enters his life as Bob Stone who is seemingly innocent until C.I.A agents turn up looking for him. Calvin becomes mixed up in this when Bob thought his accounting skills to uncover codes. While the ending is corny the screenplay does a great payoff with regards to who is innocent and who is guilty placing viewers squarely in Calvin's position. Johnson displays some vulnerability as Bob whose tough in shape agent conceals emotional pain from yesteryear. Hart as Calvin demonstrates friendship but ultimately confusion when decisions rack up. Supporting characters are props including Amy Ryan as agent Harris, Aaron Paul as Bob's ex-partner in a predictable development, and Danielle Nicolet as Calvin's wife. Well made action farce with a message regarding bullying and its lasting affect as well as good deeds not forgotten. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A little Hart and a Big Johnson"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, two of my favourite celebrities I follow on Instagram come together for director Rawson Marshall Thurber's Central Intelligence. (Dodgeball, We're The Millers) I mention Instagram because this was how I first heard of the film in the making. Actually seeing the crazy, fun antics the two were pulling off on the set, photobombing each other, some of it making the blooper reel at the end credits. I think they may have had too much fun on set because it shows on screen which unfortunately makes me think they didn't take the film seriously, or, was having too much of laugh, and how is that a bad thing? Hart plays the popular, successful high school kid Calvin Joyner AKA the Golden Jet, who shows an act of kindness to bubbly, bullied, overweight Robbie Whierdicht, yes, pronounced 'weird dick' at High School. Fast forward twenty years to present day and Joyner is not the success everyone thought he would be and Robbie, well, he becomes Bob Stone AKA The Rock who happens to be an agent at LARGE for the CIA. The two of them create a superb and very funny relationship which is reminiscent of Crystal and De Niro in Analyse This and That. The therapy session is hilarious and there's plenty of laugh- out-loud moments. Johnson's character being larger than life, donning that famous fanny-pack he so got ripped for in real life and having an underestimated sneakiness that would put Batman and Turturro's Emilio Lopez to shame. Hart, doing what he does best, venting funny frustrations whilst continually trying to figure out what the hell is going on. The film is loaded movie references that sound like sly digs at fellow actors and there's plenty of in movie jokes and actually seems strange seeing Johnson as more stupid than serious. He's like a big kid, and I mean BIG. It has a poor plot but it serves the purpose of the film, script too and I reckon a lot is ad-libbed, mostly by Hart. Action is fast paced, sometimes too fast but it's entertainingly good but just not enough of it. The film spends a lot of time jumping from potential plot twist to another; it's not entirely predictable and has a good couple of surprise cameo appearances. (Don't read the tags at the bottom if you don't want to know who) and it didn't drag for the 107 minute running time. I think some of the casting could have been better, especially with Warner Bros and Universal joining forces for the first time in twenty years. Amy Ryan's (Gone Baby Gone, Birdman) Pamela Harris seemed too much of a copy of Bourne's Pamela Landy played by Joan Allen. There were loads of opportunities for more cameos that could have made this film even more fun.There's obviously a good 90s retro soundtrack that doesn't feel that old, but damn, 20 years ago; and there's a hint of a good score which is a collaboration between Ludwig Göransson (Creed, We're The Millers) and Theodore Shapiro (Walter Mitty, Spy) tracks from the soundtrack including House of Pain's Jump Around and En Vogue's My Lovin'. It's certainly not a film to take too seriously, though not considered a spoof. It would sit next to Spy on my shelve and though not as funny as Spy it's certainly better than a lot of comedies out there and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 5 Performance: 6 Direction: 7 Story: 6 Script: 6 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the therapy session and being good sports, it shows in the bloopers.71% 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The combination of wrestler Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and comedian Kevin Hart proves a winning formula in this laugh out loud summer release. Hart plays accountant Calvin Joyner who was once popular back in high school lending his varsity jacket to a bullied CGI overweight Johnson as Robby Weirdicht aka Bob Stone. This event has repercussions twenty years later as Hart's Joyner has become disaffected in his professional life and having trouble in his marriage. Bob Stone shows up right before the twenty-year high school reunion and he has packed on the muscles from working out six hours everyday for twenty years.Stone also has become a CIA agent and involves who he believes is his best friend, the accountant Joyner. Hart is great as the reluctant accomplice caught up in a case of international espionage that doesn't have much of a background focusing more on jokes. There are a few spots where the action pauses to let Hart deliver long comedic monologues that don't always hit as great as his standup does and slows down the plot but the comedy is greatly enhanced by The Rock's giddy performance. As a once peculiar kid, Johnson embodies the bullied kid Weirdicht who has now become a tough international spy.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb, stupid, predictable - and very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd never normally choose to go and see a film like this, but free ticket. Happy I went. I don't normally laugh out loud in a cinema, and this had me chortling throughout. Many other reviews explain the story and the 'chemistry' between the two main actors. But what really struck me is what a fine actor Dwayne Johnson is. I guess all those years in WWF have paid off. In the movie he plays two very different people, and very believably. He switches effortlessly from one role to another, and can really bring menace to his part. His comedic side was excellent, playing the over-enthusiastic buddy, and delivering banalities with such sincerity you almost forgot it was scripted. Well written, though sometimes Hart's black shtick was a bit overdone, nicely paced after a slow start, and really good fun that doesn't take itself too seriously. Great date film, she'll love you for it :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is your basic buddy movie, fighting the bad guys, bigotry, racism, etc. it's not my usual fare, but the movie got pretty good reviews so I gave it a try. there is nothing wrong with the movie, exactly: it just lacks imagination and spark. the director paints by the numbers and gets us from a to z. there are no surprises as far as the film goes and everything works out as you expect. when I say no surprises, I can't say that about the two stars. their chemistry is great and I was especially impressed by dwayne Johnson. he is really quite good here. he is a natural and his line readings are right on the money. I suppose there was some amount of acting in his former profession. anyway, it's a nice little movie. just don't expect a lot. every movie can't be a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does comedy need to essentially have an engaging plot or just the level energy to keep the audience engaged? I have done this long enough to say that keeping the interest irrespective of the genre is a focal factor to the championing of a motion picture. With a juvenile burlesque plot, the prattling Kevin Hart and infamous Dwayne "The Rock" Johnsons', CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE is now here. Months of snapchat teasers, previews and interviews the greedily awaited summer hit CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE does not disappoint. Kevin Harts ? Calvin is the homecoming king, valedictorian and all round good guy who is seemingly the ultimate student to walk through the halls of Central High School and he is expected to go to finer places ?possibly governor or maybe even president. Dwayne Johnsons ? Bob Stone (He hates bullies! Wonder how that happened!) on the other side of the coin is a largely built student that is bullied all through high school life. While Calvin is praised at his final assembly by the school principal Bob fins himself facedown butt naked (literally) and is never seen in school again. Twenty years later things seem to have panned out differently as Calvin has been sucked into the rat race of life with a desk job as an accountant. A random Facebook friend request changes everything.The essence of the comedy ? Kevin Hart is the todays King of Comedy. He is always at his best when he teams up with screenplays with just one other leading role. RIDE ALONG 1, RIDE ALONG 2, GET HARD &amp; THE WEDDING RINGER are his most noteworthy work so far that has left us with aching sides from laughter. The liveliness that he brings and his motor mouth is right up where it should be. Dwayne Johnson who has featured in more roles in the past years than Hart plays off this energy and is ridiculously entertaining. The ability of the A-Listers to play off against each others energy is what distracts the audience from the weak screenplay. This to me is greatest part of the movie. They are in sync and no one overpowers the other with their performances ? This is perfect chemistry.The director of WE ARE THE MILLERS Rawson Marshall Thurber has done it again. He does justice to the advertising hype created by its campaign leading up to the release of CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE. Hats off to good comedy!This summer funny is both big and small.

		<shortDescription>Saved By Johnson &amp; Hart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dewayne Johnson continues to impress as he pretty much carries the film here. It must be said that he wouldn't be nearly as effective without a good co-lead. Kevin Hart hits a sweet spot here against Johnson. It's a good pairing which works hard to make a ridiculous story work.The ugly duckling turn mysterious black swan (i.e.possibly an evil swan) begins a wild ride in which Hart's over-acting seems, well, naturally correct. Hart's Calvin Joyner "The Golden Jet" character,is the former high school golden boy who has hit a rut. His life is suddenly turned upside down by the one person who was the most bullied and downtrodden classmate, now known as Johnson's evolved new man, Bob Stone. The strange re-union of the two is exemplified by the fact there's a 20-year class reunion looming among all the chaos. These two might have hit it even better had the story not been as thin and lightweight, but considering all things this is a case where the two leads gel so well as to make the picture much more enjoyable than it has a right to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not being a Kevin Hart fan, I did not expect to laugh as hard as I did watching Central Intelligence, because I had my expectations so low to begin with. Almost everything in this buddy action comedy hits the right notes- the execution of the plot, the chemistry between the cast, the performances of the cast themselves(The Rock was the bomb!), the execution of the humor, the charming anti-bullying message(wasn't cringe-worthy like other movies), the film's goofy self-awareness, the creative action sequences and most of all, the way the two main characters interact. What makes this movie genuinely funny is the entertainment Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart provide with their energy while improvising(Hart's at his best with his stand-up, here) their jokes- the whole audience was laughing heartily and loudly throughout the movie mainly because of this reason. It sounds like I'm going too fair on this movie because people aren't raving on and on about it- but for how hard I laughed during this movie, I'll shift my rating to a 9, as such an accomplishment deserves such a rating, especially for this non-Hart fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Central stupidity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Central Intelligence (spoiler free) ** (2/5)Cast: Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson, Amy Ryan, Danielle Nicolet.Plot: After he reunites with an old school pal through Facebook, a mild-mannered accountant is lured into the world of international espionage.Everyone knows who Dwayne Johnson is at this point we can all bet that once he punches someone in his movies that person is then going to get thrown into a wall and it's going to be funny, however this is neither action nor comedy because the action isn't fun and the comedy is just dry. With poor writing that sounds like it didn't even reach the second draft so it sounds stupid basically. Kevin Hart used to be the funniest man in America when he did his stand up acts however ever since he started doing movies, like Ride Along 1-2, Get Hard the movies have been lacking one thing comedy. This also makes references to much better movies like Roadhouse and 16 Candles so as you can see not an enjoyable comedy. Calvin (Hart) is an accountant for a major company however his life feels empty so what should happen? Well he gets a friend request from Bob (Johnson) with an interesting voice change however that voice change still isn't funny. So he then takes Calvin on an adventure where his life is constantly at risk. Conveniently Kevin Hart is more annoying and more irritating than he is in Ride Along (2014) which wasn't too bad, it's not great but it's not bad either. Just like those two other "comedies" there is no story and no character development and that is something that a movie like this needs. However even though the chemistry is amazing between Johnson and Hart the film is lax on actually making that better. However the script by Ike Barinholtz barely even holds out for its length bad thing. There is also a cameo from Melissa McCarthy and so you can see this movie is trying its hardest to be funny when it just isn't it is a dry comedy and quite frankly stupid. The other main thing that should be mentioned there is no control in vocal tones but I guess this movie was just rushed, interestingly even the bloopers during the end credits weren't even funny either, the most interesting thin that can be recalled is that the soundtrack is actually OK, its not the best but its okay so the soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson and Theodore Shapiro isn't that bad although it sounds similar to a Christopher Lennertz soundtrack.Here are some points as to why this is a comedy that should be avoided:No Story: The lack of story makes this movie duller than it already was however the "story" whatever there is, is stupid and quite frankly just wrong it makes it sound like this is a movie that shouldn't have been done. The story is quick to get to Johnson and Hart making friends however even that is dull, this is just and uncharacteristic and an idiotic mess and it just falls apart after the first ten minutes in fact not even that and it is just wrong the story is wrong and stupid, so next time they want to do a comedy like this make sure it has a better script or just doesn't have Kevin Hart.No Character development: Another that is lacking is the intelligence for one thing it's the character development all you learn is what their names are and also what they do but that is it there is no development whatsoever. It sounds like if this movie just Dwayne Johnson in it, it would have more interesting. No character development even though these characters connect instantaneously and that makes this movie better but not much.However there is an interesting back story/flashback when Bob remembers his time at High School conveniently he was very fat and when the bullies saw him again they were expecting him to turn out the way he did. That is the interesting thing in this movie apart from appearances by Jason Bateman and Aaron Paul they stick the story together but however Bateman is more dry than he usually is. In-case you are wondering he plays Trevor who is one of the people who bullied Bob in school. All in all this movie is stupid and quite frankly should never have been done.Verdict: Stupid, and lacking the main thing comedy, another "comedy" with Kevin but lacks his Hart. Even the Rock's enthusiasm and charisma cannot save this dud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a 6.5 kinda movie. I'm just rounding down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know Kevin Hart is a funny guy. We all know The Rock is awesome. This movie just isn't as good or funny as it should be. Maybe it is the writing, maybe it is the directing; I don't know. All I know is if The Rock or Kevin Hart were not in the movie, it would panned by all the critics and fans. I almost feel bad for The Rock because you see him giving 100% but not even his 100% can help a flat script. The idea behind the movie is great. The idea behind the characters is great. But the execution of the movie just fails. Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny but not as funny as it should be. Kevin Hart and The Rock have to do all the heavy lifting and it is a sad because this could have been one of those classic comedies you would go back and watch over and over again. Oh, and let us talk about that ending. That ending pretty much confirms that the writing/script kills the movie. I just now took the time to use IMDb to see who wrote this and yeah, go check for yourself. It was the writers who turned this into a C- kind of movie. What a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanny Packs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sold into the Kevin Hart/The Rock dynamic long before the movie was released and I'm down for plenty more collaborations. Unfortunately, the against-type characters they play get lost in a spy story that takes itself a tad too seriously.Central Intelligence takes a slightly more serious approach to a 21 Jump Street type of story with some fanny packs, unicorns, and surprising cameos added in. Although I haven't always been a big Kevin Hart fan, I really enjoyed him playing the straight man to The Rock's unpredictable-CIA agent. Again, with it balancing the fine line of being a stupid comedy to a serious one, Hart doesn't get to ramble off into stand-up comedian mode often, but when he does, the jokes definitely hit for me.On the other-hand, The Rock is probably the best thing this film has going for it. Much like Hart, I enjoyed watching him play a more guarded bada** than he does in the big action blockbusters. There's plenty of built up emotion underneath his characters' anger due to him getting beaten up as a high-schooler. The spy-comedy is structured around the 20-year high school reunion both of them are set to attend, and I think that's one of the areas where the film slips a bit for me. It's not that I didn't enjoy the fun cameos of former classmates, but it's where the film veered into something more silly. I would have been fine if the film went all in Jump Street and poked fun at itself, but there are plenty of times the film does take itself more serious than it has a right to.The film also has a tendency to be overly predictable. Right from the get-go there are certain scenes that you know will come back to have an impact on the story in exactly the way you would think, and they do. Again, predictability doesn't always mean a fault, but when the movie isn't all that great to begin with, it can be bothersome. So overall, I enjoyed watching Central Intelligence for its choice to take two good actors and flip their personalities, but I can't deny some of the action-comedy tropes it falls into.+The Rock and Hart against type+Some cameos are fun-Others just take the film into a completely different direction-Doesn't balance tone well enough6.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Central Intelligence Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently managed to catch Central intelligence in cinemas and it has truly not failed to live up to my expectations, even surpassing it at some point. I had been looking forward to this movie for quite some time, having been closely monitoring it's progress through The Rock's Instagram account which I followed. He promised a fun packed movie for the summer and he delivered.What I didn't like so much about this movie was the fact that Dwayne Johnson's past as a fat teenage boy was made fun of so much, though I did get a good laugh about it, it could have been handled better. The movie does attempt to remedy this by including a scene in the end where Johnson punches his old tormentor in the face saying that he doesn't like bullies. This hardly seems sufficient but at least an attempt was made.Nonetheless, this is not an Action Movie for those who are planning to watch it, this is a Comedy Movie. Understandably this is due to the director, Rawson Marshall Thurber, whose portfolio includes Dodgeball and the comedic hit We're The Millers and this is a choice well made. After all, what makes this movie good isn't the plot, which at times comes across as hollow and facile, but the chemistry between the two male leads. The two have signed up to do more movies together such as the recently announced Jumaji reboot and it is completely understandable why.The chemistry between the two male leads, Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart is undeniable with each given ample time to shine in their character roles, Johnson as the cunning and capable CIA operative and Hart as the timid and tepid accountant. As the story line progresses, one sees this chemistry truly shines, this is something that saves Central Intelligence from being just another mainstream action movie and turns it into the summer hit that I predict it will be.In Conclusion, If you're looking for a great movie that'll leave your jaws hurting from laughing too much and aren't really particular about the quality of the script, you'll love this movie. It'll give you a good laugh and wanting for more. Now that I've seen what Kevin Hart and The Rock can do together, I can't wait to see more of their future collaborations.It gets 4 stars for the comedy, though that gets knocked down to 3.5 due to the weak plot that tries to tie the story together.If you liked this review, visit my blog at www.leoreview.wordpress.com!

		<shortDescription>I thought I'd be bored out of my skull. But, I was wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK! To start off with, I will make an announcement that will probably have some of you muttering "WTF."This is the first time I've ever heard of Kevin Hart.It's true! When I first saw the lobby card for this movie, I thought it was going to be starring _two_ Rocks! Dwayne Johnson...and screechy- voiced Chris (who, as far as I'm permanently concerned, has gone downhill since the "Rush Hour" trilogy). Fortunately, for me, however, I soon realized that the actor playing Calvin "C.J." Joyner had a comparatively lower voice, and a much better acting range, than Chris. Including the ability to do his jokes (intentional and otherwise) in a much subtler--and ,thus, way funnier--manner than Chris!Something you'll see for yourselves during the end-credit blooper reel. You should also keep your eyes peeled for an uncredited cameo by Melissa McCarthy (who, as I understand it, recently did a spy spoof of her own opposite Jason Statham).Add to that the under-rated comedic talent of Mr. Johnson, himself (talent that his roles in RUN DOWN and JOURNEY 2 THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND proved, to me at least, that he had), and you have a nice little action-packed time killer for a boring Saturday afternoon.The only reason I deduct one star from my score? I really think Warner Brothers and Universal should have delayed the release until much later this summer. Just in case some movie-goers might think the otherwise mandatory gunfight scenes were a little bit in poor taste, given the recent tragedies in Orlando.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dream team of a little Hart and one big Johnson makes for some good giggles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As if there's not a high school geek in the world he does not want to grow up to become the most electrifying man in showbiz, Dwayne Johnson plays a CIA agent still effected by the kids who bullied him twenty years ago. It was hard to believe that someone like The Rock is a die hard fan of unicorns and the 80s movie Sixteen Candles, but Johnson only proves his talents.It was more surprising how Johnson carried this film on his very big shoulders being the screwball side of this comedic duo. Most importantly, we do get to see the Rock kick ass and take names (while wearing a fanny pack, but...) He's action, He's comedy, And I can definitely smell what he's cooking. And if the Rock is not enough for you, Kevin Hart is in it too. One of the funnest men in movies today. Though I must admit, Kevin Hart is not at his funniest being Johnson's straight man, and I could have used a few more direct laughs from his side of the table, but the two men are a real dynamic duo on the big screen. Central Intelligence is a good time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Video Review for Central Intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Video Review link is at the bottom. I am not the best typer so I would recommend going to the video instead. Central Intelligence is a buddy cop film starring Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson. They both have exceedingly good chemistry in the film with Kevin being this guy who you can relate to after high school and Dwayne playing a socially awkward CIA agent. Both these two come together to take down a huge deal involving multiple countries. Although their chemistry is strong at first it begins to get awkward at times even for the audience and they can make you stray away from enjoying the movie. Some of their scenes feel forced and sometimes the movie can obsess too much into the spy stuff going on. In other words, most of the movie is good, and most of their relationship is great. Just be wary of the flaws the movie has. Video Review link is right here.

		<shortDescription>A little Hart and a big Johnson really does go a long way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other than having one of the best taglines in recent memory, Central Intelligence also has two of the biggest names in the world of entertainment at its disposal; Dwayne Johnson is literally the most profitable movie star on the planet and Kevin Hart is the biggest name in comedy right now.I haven't been a massive fan of Kevin Hart's films to date but I've been a fan of Dwayne Johnson's ever since his days as The Rock in WWE, so I was looking forward to seeing how they would play off one another in Central Intelligence. I think we could be seeing a lot more of these two together in future films because they work together so well.Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) was the most popular kid at his high school, voted the most likely to succeed, who went by the nickname 'Golden Jet'. Twenty years later and Calvin is an accountant and married to his high school sweetheart, Maggie (Danielle Nicolet).Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) was the overweight geek that was endlessly targeted by bullies during his high school days. Twenty years later and Bob is a lean, mean killing machine for the CIA. Reuniting through Facebook, Bob drags Calvin into a world of international espionage in order to save the world.For a film like Central Intelligence, it's of great importance that they get two leads who are both likable and share a chemistry that makes the film work. This is very much the case in Central Intelligence, Hart playing the straight man with Johnson taking on the role of the goofball.We've already seen a great new double act this year with Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling in The Nice Guys and, while Hart and Johnson never reach those heights, it's very similar in the way that, like Gosling in The Nice Guys, Johnson steals the limelight from his co-star. Johnson has always had a knack for comedy and seeing him like this is just so damn entertaining.Dawson Marshall Thurber, who directed Dodgeball and We're the Millers, continues to show that he knows his way around the genre of comedy, throwing in some action for good measure. After all, it wouldn't be a Dwayne Johnson film if there wasn't any action to be seen. There's also a little reference to something in Aaron Paul's past that you may recognise which got one of the biggest cheers in the film so, while it's almost impossible to miss, listen out for it.I have to applaud the film for trying to send out a message about bullying and the effects it can have on victims later in life. While some of it gets lost in the ridiculousness that plays out on screen, it's a message that's done a lot more subtly than the feminism agenda Bad Neighbours 2 pushed onto us.Central Intelligence is a comedy that doesn't try too hard to make you laugh or like the characters, a problem a lot of comedies face nowadays. However, thanks to the natural chemistry Hart and Johnson share plus the writing and direction of Thurber, Central Intelligence is a comedy that will leave you entertained, doing so with a large likability factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly - and impressively - the film has almost no racial jokes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Maryland's Central High School senior class graduates, Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner (Kevin Hart) prepares for a promising future. Two-time class president, captain of numerous sports teams, and voted "Most Likely to Succeed," Joyner appears poised to conquer the world. On the opposite end of the spectrum, overweight loner Robbie Weirdicht (Dwayne Johnson) is continually, heavily bullied, and ridiculed to a severe degree during the school's pep rally. Twenty years later, Calvin finds himself stuck in a dead-end accounting job and in a rocky marriage to his high school sweetheart Maggie (Danielle Nicolet). But his whole life is turned upside down when one fateful afternoon he accepts an online friend request from "Bob Stone," the alias for a completely transformed Robbie. Now a herculean muscleman and secret agent for the CIA, Bob tricks the unwitting Calvin into aiding him on a deadly mission to track down stolen government satellite codes and a shadowy crime kingpin codenamed the "Black Badger."It's a typical yet amusing formula, with the extremely popular kid in high school failing to live up to his potential. Top-of-the-class designation and an incomparably cool, loved-by-everyone status becomes a recipe for adulthood mediocrity and discontent. Meanwhile, the impossibly awkward, obese, nerdy counterpart, who is always the butt of the most vicious jokes, blossoms into a trim, formidable, respectable, macho man. And then comedy ensues. Indeed, the ironic contrasts of formative years not accurately predicting future outcomes is a pleasing, universally understandable setup for humor, even if its ultimate influence in the actual plot (when it finally arrives) is pointless."Well, there's no coming back from that," insists the principal after witnessing - and refusing to intercede in - a particularly disgusting prank. But even after the film moves on from the curious references to "Sixteen Candles" and the obvious nods to "Romy and Michele's High School Reunion," there doesn't seem to be much for the two leading men to do. And that's quite a shame, considering both exhibit excellent comic timing and hilarious idiosyncrasies, especially as Johnson assumes the role of the funny man to Hart's not-so-serious straight man. In an unexpected but welcome twist, Johnson is the flamboyant, ungainly, inarticulate goofball to Hart's fish-out-of-water everyman, even if the latter actor dons his usual routine of nonstop jabbering and distressed neurosis. Both excel in their parts, succeeding in slapstick, chemistry, and frantic repartee. And even some of the action scenes are engaging, despite the film opting for that overworked, rapidly-cut editing style that obscures any truly talented fight choreography.But notwithstanding all the laughs and the easy emotions or themes of confidence/self-esteem, living up to expectations, contentment versus superior social standings, and especially the idea of conquering fear or bullies, the story is just pitiful. Even as an excuse to provide opportunities for Johnson and Hart to play off of their disparities (while also surprisingly straying away from racial jokes), the formulaic superspy gimmick is exhausting. It's so overwhelmingly generic - and riddled with the kind of plot holes that are intentionally disregarded by the filmmakers because they view this venture as a mere comedy - that it can't sustain its two-hour running time or slip into the background of physical gags or loopy conversations. The story arc is so interruptive and meaningless that it disrupts any chance of the humor prevailing over the supreme insincerity (motivations, allegiances, and the murder/mystery concepts are absolutely incompatible with the characters). As a result, the finale falls apart, tremendously. Fortunately, the jokes are consistently diverting, save for the outtakes - which are significantly funnier than everything before them.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny buddy film and more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy crime film has a dual burden: being funny and suspenseful at the same time. Central Intelligence tries to be both and succeeds some of the time, mostly on the comedic side. Surprisingly, its thematic elements about bullying and humans reaching potential elevate the film above quips and slapstick.Bob (Dwayne Johnson) and Calvin (Kevin Hart), former high school chums, get involved 20 years later in a haphazard investigation of a secret government activity that involves foreign spies and questionable US agents. The challenge of determining who is good and who is bad is middlin' but entertaining.Their friendship goes back to when Calvin, the "Golden Jet," was the most likely to succeed senior and Bob the obese object of bullying; their hookup now before the reunion provides a chance for the director, Rawson Marshall Thurber, and his writers to run a theme about "what have you done with your life?" Calvin feels as an accountant he has not reached the heights his early accomplishments promised, despite the fact that he married the best female in the class, who became a successful attorney.Bob, on the other hand, has grown from a fat boy into, well, the "The Rock," with marvelous muscles, a world-class smile, exuberance, and a job with the CIA. That he still idolizes Calvin is a questionable obsession until we figure out a couple of the reasons. Overall Bob seems to have a more balanced life.The comedic parts are sometimes of a higher order, for instance, when Calvin explains he doesn't do therapy because he's Black, goes to the barbershop, and watches Barbershop movies. The largely African-American audience at my screening enjoyed the stereotyping.Central Intelligence has numerous stock jokes and situations for the buddy comedy, especially the mixed races and the little man paired with a veritable giant (think Wilder and Pryor, Gibson and Glover, and Murphy and Nolte for the races)... One thing is for sure, Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson are an intelligent comedy team, which should be central to our summer enjoyment for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Edgy For PG-13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but way too many swear words and sexual innuendo for a PG-13 movie. The opening scene which exposes a rear-end is funny and I really didn't have a problem with it. But all the references to intercourse, oral sex, etc. were really too much and took away from what would be a great movie. If my 13 year old and I have to look at each other 5-6 times during a movie with angst, then it's too much. I would let a 15-16 year old see this but not a 13YO. The movie was really funny and would have been an 8* if it wasn't for the overkill, silly/sex dialogues. I thought the plot was good and kept you guessing until the end and there were plenty of funny moments--just too gratuitous with the "bad stuff."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, it wasn't utterly terrible but it's by far the Rock's worst outing which disappointed me quite a bit since I"m a fan and tuned in specifically to see him in action. Contrasting that, Kevin Hart, someone who never moved my needle any, truly showed quite a bit of good stuff. I think it's fair to say he saved the show. He showed a good deal of range without the 'feets do your stuff' eye rolling I was half expecting. Rock's character just isn't believable or likable. He varies from wheedling to bullying to whatever. The plot is supposed to have a bit of tension about who the bad guy is and toward the end throws Jesse Pinkman in as Jesse Pinkman for those Breaking Bad fans everywhere. The ending left, to say the least, a very bad taste. It pure embarrassment amped up ten times. There were any number of dignified ways to wrap this one up but the director choose the least appealing. Appealing? It was appalling. A minor diversion made at least somewhat worthwhile due to Hart's character. Else, nothing much and surely NOT a place for a Rock fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of chemistry in addition to thin plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Johnson &amp; Hart fan but this movie lacks chemistry as oppose to Hart &amp; Ice Cube. Johnson's character was poorly written and it was evident in the movie that the Rock was struggling to produce a natural comedic performance. Spoilers: the movie wanted to do a twist in Johnson's character by having him portray to be good and bad which really makes it weird how near the end, Johnson gave a smirk after turning away from Hart as he enters the underground parking. Bateman's character, Trevor, felt weird and out of place as an adult. I just feel that the script was poorly written and the movie kind of reminds me of Adam Sandler's Do Over but with better writing and performances. I want to give it 3.5 but round up to 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Central Intelligence" has a strong central premise, but just isn't very... intelligent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the theater. That intro is a paraphrase of the famous tag line from a 1978 summer movie sequel ("Jaws 2"), which helps explain how I feel about the action comedy "Central Intelligence" (PG-13, 1:54). While this movie is not part of a summer film franchise (yet), I think the comparison is apt. Similar to the way the absence of sharks in the waters of Amity Island tragically lulled its people into a false sense of security, you might think that Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart would have learned the dangers of complacency in their acting. Feminizing a legendary tough guy (like casting Hulk Hogan in 1993's "Mr. Nanny", or Johnson himself in 2010's "The Tooth Fairy") does not automatically equal funny. The same applies to allowing/forcing Kevin Hart to take on another hyperactive motor-mouthed role like in the "Ride Along" movies. Hart is better when his comedy is more restrained (for example, in "The Wedding Ringer" or even "Get Hard"). For his part, Johnson is funny when he plays off of his tough-guy image (as he did in 2010's "The Other Guys"), rather than almost completely against it, as he does in this film. While "Central Intelligence" is not a bad movie, it's not as strong as you might think when you see Hart's mug on the movie poster ? and Johnson's muscles.The movie's title has a dual meaning. Before we even learn that one of the main characters works for the Central Intelligence Agency, we see them when they were students ? at Central High School ? where they are getting an education and gaining? intelligence. These two characters, Robbie Whierdicht (Johnson) and Calvin Joyner (Hart), had little in common as classmates. Calvin is everyone's favorite person (as the principal points out in a school assembly). He's dating Maggie (Danielle Nicolet), the most beautiful girl in school and he is known by the nickname "The Golden Jet". He's a star athlete, a drama club stand-out and has been voted "Most Likely to Succeed" by his fellow seniors. Robbie, on the other hand, is a nerdy fat kid who sings and dances in the shower to R&amp;B/Pop songs and is picked on by bullies who mercilessly and publicly humiliate him. The only one who shows Robbie any compassion is Calvin.20 years later, the fortunes of both Robbie and Calvin have changed dramatically. In fact, they've completely reversed (similar to the two main characters in 2012's "21 Jump Street"). Calvin got the girl, but his marriage to Maggie has gotten a little rocky. Calvin works as an accountant. He's good at his job, but he hates it and has to endure the indignity of seeing his former assistant get promoted over him. Calvin feels that he peaked in high school and tells Maggie that he's not going to their 20-year high school reunion because he's dreading the "what are you doing now" question. It's quite a different story when we (and he) see Robbie again. Robbie has turned his excess weight into muscle mass and he's an agent in the CIA, even though he's still in touch with his sensitive side ? wearing a sky blue unicorn T-shirt and extolling the virtues of the 1984 classic "Sixteen Candles". These two very different men are about to become reacquainted and become true friends for the first time ? if they don't get killed first.Robbie isn't Robbie anymore ? not just physically, but legally. His name is now Bob Stone and he gives Calvin a call after Calvin accepts his Facebook friend request, even though Calvin didn't understand at first who Bob Stone really was. That phone call turns into hanging out in a bar (and a bar fight because, as Bob says, "I don't like bullies") and Bob ends up crashing at Calvin's house that night. Bob tricks Calvin into getting him some information for a case that he's working and, by the time Bob reveals his job and his motives, Calvin is hip deep in international intrigue. Even though Bob has a particular set of skills of his own, he needs Calvin's particular skill set (and his decency and trustworthiness) to stop a grave threat to U.S. national security. Complicating matters is a group of CIA operatives, led by Agent Pamela Harris (Amy Ryan) who is trying to arrest Bob, saying that he's a central player in the plot that Bob says he is trying to stop. It's Abbott and Costello in a global whodunit."Central Intelligence" has entertaining moments, but they're diminished by implausible and clichéd plot points and ridiculous characters. Some of the specifics of Hart's character don't make a lot of sense, a criticism which is even more pronounced in the case of Johnson's character. And it doesn't help that both actors are playing to their weaknesses and first-time feature director Rawson Marshall Thurber seems unwilling or unable to focus the acting in a more realistic and entertaining direction. The script, by Thurber, actor-comedian Ike Barinholtz and David Sassen, relies too much on action-comedy-mystery tropes and makes their characters do things that feel random, unmotivated and silly. The light-hearted tone and some cool cameos help a little, but most of the movie is just a little on this side of dumb. The film's central idea is a strong one, but it would've been better if it were more? intelligent. "C+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there were some funny parts, Dwayne's character was just too ridiculous that it became obnoxious instead of comical at times. Kevin Hart always provides a good laugh but even that wasn't enough to "save" this film. The plot is far-fetched, ridiculous and...stupid. Really, really disappointed. We didn't even stay for the entire movie, we left about 20 minutes early because we just couldn't stand it anymore. Really would recommend you save your money or see something else... This is not hate on Dwayne Johnson or Kevin Hart - I have seen both of them in previous films and really enjoyed their work which is the main reason we thought this would be a good choice to see Saturday night. Like I said, it isn't their acting that is the problem here... it's the story line, the characters, the plot, the bad jokes... two thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Buddy Action FIlm of the Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say enough about this movie. From the action to the comedy to the direction, everything involved was top notch. So refreshing to see Kevin Hart in a more serious role, instead of forcing comedy as many of his movies such as Get Hard become. The real star here though is The Rock who really gets to show off his comedic chops with his goofy and lovable character. The other great thing is that the trailer did not give away the other cast members of the film. The story is also rewarding as there is solid character development, all of which is can be familiar to many. Something that in a summer action blockbuster is usually non-existent. Keep an eye out for Rawson Marshall Thurber (Were The Millers and Dodgeball) as he is going to continue to be a rising star.</fullReview>
