		<shortDescription>This is the one --well, one of the ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity," this is the one that established what film noir was all about.Robert Siodmak's classic thriller, along with "Criss Cross" are two of his best pieces of work, proof positive that crime dramas could rise above the mundane and the clichéd.Based on one of Hemingway's Nick Adams short stories, it tells the intriguing tale of two hit men who show up in a small town (the film moves it from the Midwest to New Jersey), where they take over a diner and tell its terrified occupants they intend to murder a nobody of a gas station attendant when he comes in for dinner. When he doesn't show, they hunt him down at the rooming house where he lives and do the job there. That's where the short story ends, but the script by Anthony Veiller picks it up from there, pursuing the fascinating story of what makes a man give up on life to the point where he passively waits for a pair of gunmen to show up and blow him to smithereens.The protagonist,called the Swede, is a guy who isn't a criminal by nature, just a guy who fell upon hard times, but sees a way out by committing one more crime. And of course, as in any good film noir, his greed is fueled more by lust than anything else. There's a girl involved and in order to get her, he has to get the loot.Burt Lancaster, in his first staring role, comes off very well here, as does Ava Gardner, also top billed for the first time. Strong supporting performances by the great Albert Dekker as the top hood and Sam Levine as a cop with a heart of gold. And we cannot forget Charles McGraw and William Conrad as two of the most frightening cold blooded killers in film history.Siodmak does a great job in the director's chair in this Mark Hellinger (The Roaring Twenties) produced drama, but it is cinematographer Woody Bredell who steals the show. His use of lighting goes beyond spectacular. All of the clichés we think of in film noir lighting spring from this one film, where they were done right. And watch for one of the longest tracking shots in film history, as Nick Adams flees the diner and races to the Swede's rooming house to warn him. It's an amazing, unbroken shot that runs more than a minute.Watch, too, for the brilliant shoot 'em up scene in a restaurant at the end of the movie when the two gunmen reappear. It is just a textbook blend of all the movies are supposed to be about, great acting, camera movement that means something, and brilliantly layered music by Miklos Rozsa. Film-making doesn't get any better than this.A four star film and one of the godfathers of the genre. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has aged unbelievably well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I've just seen too many old movies, but for me, other than the period fedoras and suits, nothing about this movie would really give away that it's almost 60 years old. The plot is solid and keeps you guessing until the end, with many twists and turns along the way, and is told asynchronously (perhaps necessary for today's audiences, which may be why it holds up so well). The acting is great, quite realistic, and for the most part avoids the maudlin sentiment and overacting that characterizes some older films. The Killers is an incredibly enjoyable crime film, perhaps the perfect crime film. I haven't seen the remake, so I can't comment on that, but I hold this film in high regard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir At Its Very Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Universal International's THE KILLERS (1946) is arguably the finest Noir ever to come out of Hollywood. It certainly has the most effective opening scene of anything that was ever seen in a film of this type before or after. Bright street lighting throws long dark shadows on the street that emanate from the two wanton and pernicious hit men of the title as they stealthily walk to a diner in the small town of Brentwood seeking their prey. With stunning monochrome cinematography by Elwood Bredell and underscored by the ominous pulsating music of Miklos Rozsa it is one of the most perfectly conceived sequences ever seen on the screen. From a short story by Ernest Hemingway THE KILLERS was beautifully adapted and written for the screen by Anthony Vieller and bracingly directed by master craftsman Robert Siodmak. This was the second of three high tension crime thrillers produced for the studio by Mark Hellinger - the other two being "Brute Force" (1947) and "Naked City" (1948)A brooding Burt Lancaster, in his first starring role, plays ex prizefighter Ole Anderson known as the "Swede" who has buried himself in the unknown town of Brentwood where he works at a filling station. But the "Swede" is a man with a past! Years before he was involved in a robbery and after double crossing the gang he absconded with the loot. Now it's payback time and two hit men (Charles McGraw and William Conrad) have been sent to Brentwood to "take him out".("Why do you want to kill the "Swede" asks the barman in the diner "We're killing him for a friend" replies Conrad coldly). But the "Swede" doesn't run and is strangely reticent about his impending fate. Even his friend Nick Adams (Phil Brown) warns him about the two strangers in the diner intending to kill him. "Why do they want to kill you" Nick asks........."I did something wrong ......once" responds a resigned "Swede". Later after the killers fulfil their grisly contract (a brilliantly intense heart stopping scene) an insurance investigator (Edmond O'Brien) is assigned to find out the whole story about the Swede. And in flashback we see how he fell in love with the beautiful Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner) wife of gang boss (Albert Dekker) and the series of events and double crosses that occurred before and after the heist that ultimately led to his killing.Performances are excellent from all concerned. Lancaster is terrific as the ill-fated "Swede" and Ava Gardner never looked more ravishing than she does here. But superb are those in smaller parts such as gang members Albert Dekker, Jack Lambert, Jeff Corey, Sam Lavene as a cop and not forgetting the perfect casting of William Conrad and the chilling Charles McGraw as the title characters. Carrying the whole thing along is the extraordinary nominated atmospheric score by the great Miklos Rozsa. His raw biting music with terse rhythms and musical hammer blows adds immeasurably to the picture. ( Curiously his motif for the two killers was "stolen" and used without permission as the theme for the long running TV series "Dragnet" in the early fifties.) Rozsa'a music for films came in three distinct phases. The first phase was his writing for fantasy films which included "Thief Of Bagdad" (1940) and "Jungle Book" (1942). THE KILLERS came from the second phase which covered his output for psychological and crime thrillers like "Spellbound" (1946), "Lost Weekend" (1945) and "Brute Force" (1947). Then finally his third phase - for which he is best known - covered his work on historical and epic subjects like "Quo Vadis" (1951), "Ivanhoe" (1952),"Ben Hur" (1959) and "El Cid" (1962).These films all had unequalled rich highly textured vibrant scores.Rozsa's powerful music is but one aspect alongside editing, cinematography, directing, writing and great performances that makes THE KILLERS an exceptional work of cinematic art. Here is a movie that maintains a palpable dramatic thrust throughout its running time. Few films achieve this. THE KILLERS does ....in spades!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasia On a Theme By Ernest Hemingway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautifully made improvisation on a Hemingway story that screenwriters Tony Veiller, John Huston and Richard Brooks, along with director Robert Siodmak, have somehow turned into baroque film noir. The movie starts out with a couple of hired gunmen looking for a character named Swede in a small New Jersey town. They tie up some people they encounter in a diner where they expect the Swede to be, then go and look for him, as he has not turned up at his usual time. A young man they tied up breaks loose and goes and warns the Swede, who thanks him but does nothing, remaining in bed, smoking a cigarette, waiting for the killers to show, which in time they do. The rest of the movie is an exploration, conducted by an insurance investigator, into the murky issue of why the Swede allowed himself to be murdered, and who ordered the killing in the first place.I can't say the movie's exploration of the Swede's character runs deep, or even that it's satisfactory in its psychology. It works so well because it's excellently written, photographed (by Woody Bredell), and acted (by Burt Lancaster, Ava Gardner, Edmond O'Brien and Albert Dekker, among many others), and consists of flashbacks, and in some cases flashbacks within flashbacks, as its labyrinthine plot, full of double crosses and unexpected turns, drives the film with a relentless urgency that in the end has less to do with psychology than the workings of fate. There is an overwhelming feeling in this film that people behave the way they do because they are driven by forces they cannot understand. In this sense the story in itself is, as presented, shallow and depressing, and yet the movie is so well-crafted, with the action at times seeming to be choreographed, that the end result is akin to an existential roller-coaster ride, if not much to think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First rate film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film! It's in my favorite genre, film noir, and it ranks among my favorites in that genre along with Out of the Past and Double Indemnity to name a few. Although there are a series of coincidences in the plot that stretch credibility, I believe they were necessary to maintain the pathos. In his first star turn, Burt Lancaster was excellent as the naive hood and Edmond O'Brien is likewise in his portrayal of the insurance investigator. He is almost always in a supporting role but that in no way diminishes his talent. But this movie is really Ava Gardner's. She never again had a role that fully realized her talents as much as Kitty Collins. Her portrayal of the manipulative and seductive but not altogether unsympathetic mistress is one the greatest of its kind. The last scene with her and Colfax shows this type of character in its most ignominous glory. Highest recommendation, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expanding A Hemingway Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killers is an expansion of a short story by Ernest Hemingway. The first ten minutes of this film is pure Hemingway with two contract gunman occupying and terrorizing a greasy spoon diner. Two of the most malevolent character actors around, Charles McGraw and William Conrad are the hit men.They're there to kill Burt Lancaster, known to the town as just a simple garage mechanic. Because he left a small insurance policy, his death was investigated by insurance cop Edmond O'Brien. Naturally Lancaster was no simple garage mechanic by any means. O'Brien comes up with Burt's real identity and the reason why a few people wanted him dead.The Killers was a big break film for Burt Lancaster. He had only done one previous film and that was Desert Fury for Paramount studios which had signed him. Because Universal was looking for an unknown to play the victim, Lancaster's agent was able to land him the part. And because Desert Fury was held up, The Killers became his debut film and he was a star from his first film.This was also a milestone film for Ava Gardner as well. After The Killers, Louis B. Mayer was most reluctant to lend her out any longer due to the notice that she got.The plot of The Killers is very similar to that of Out of the Past with Lancaster in the luckless Robert Mitchum role. As for Ava Gardner in her portrayal, she's taking a couple of pages from the Mary Astor school of double crossing, two timing dames. At least Mary had Sam Spade's promise he'd wait for her. The Killers is a must for Burt Lancaster fans who want to see the film that launched his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dignity in the face of death - textbook noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using Ernest Hemingway's short story as the foundation for the film, Siodmak and cinematographer Elwood Bredell create a dark, brooding and brilliant looking character study of Ole "The Swede" Andersen (Burt Lancaster), a quiet unassuming man who is hunted and shot by two killers who enter the small town he inhabits. Indeed, the opening shots are textbook examples of how to use shadows and light effectively in film. The central idea behind the short story and Siodmak's film, is the very masculine concept of dignity in the face of death. The fact that "the Swede" apparently knew of his fate but did not try to flee puzzles the insurance investigator (Edmond O'Brien) assigned to the case. He becomes obsessed with resolving this mystery, and through the testimony of people that had various associations with the dead man, facts start illuminating the gray areas but ultimately end up darkening the reality. Lancaster plays the proud, tough, handsome but intellectually limited Olle "the Swede" Anderson convincingly, and Ava Gardner as the sultry femme fatal never looked better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Siodmak, Lancaster's first pairing is one of noir's central masterpieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killers marked Burt Lancaster's screen debut, establishing the stoic persona that would sustain his long and luminous career. Along with Criss Cross (also starring Lancaster), The Killers also records the high-water mark of Robert Siodmak's work in film noir.Starting with a Hemingway short story (the retelling of which constitutes only the prologue to the film), The Killers endeavors to fill in the "back story" which Hemingway left to his readers' imaginations. That back story explains why the "Swede" (Lancaster) passively, almost eagerly, awaits the nasty pair of torpedoes (William Conrad, Charles McGraw) who have come to hunt him down. The germ of this recreation is Lancaster's small, solitary bequest -- to a chambermaid in an Atlantic City hotel where he had once stayed. Insurance investigator Edmond O'Brien catches the scent of something unusual and can't let it go. His investigations, helped by an old buddy of Lancaster's who is now a police lieutenant (Sam Levene), uncover a botched stint as a prizefighter; a smouldering yet duplicitous temptress (Ava Gardner), and a payroll heist that ended in an elaborate double cross. Siodmak, having disposed of the end right at the outset, takes a circuitous route through his telling by using a fragmented series of flashbacks. Paradoxically -- much as the false starts and averted climaxes in a Bruckner symphony pay off handsomely in the end -- the story thus gains depth and momentum. Woody Bredell's dark and meticulous cinematography fulfills Siodmak's vision, resulting in one of the central masterpieces of the noir cycle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's a really a good yarn." That's what President Ronald Regan said about Tom Clancy's book "The Hunt for Red October". The same thing can be said about this movie. It's like a big yarn. And in the end you're still not quite sure who screwed who. Two men walks in to a diner. It becomes clear that what they're after isn't eggs and bacon but a man. A man named Swede. Swede has done something. A long time ago and now it's catching up to him.Ernest Hemingway's "The Killers" is a good film noir. It's based on a short story and the only connection between it and this movie is the opening scene. The rest is written by various other writers. The film was entertaining. Drawn out at times but entertaining none the same. Humor combined with drama like the dialogue in the opening scene makes you think about it later on and it doesn't just leave your mind three minutes later.The gritty film noir style and filming is quite clear in this movie. Especially in the opening scene which remains as my favorite part in the film. The use of shadow and light is wonderful. As for the rest of the movie, it was good and even a bit thrilling at times. This is definitely recommended to people who like good film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film noir picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised when I looked at IMDb's list of highest rated film noir pictures, since this movie was well down the list. This review and my subsequent review for DOA are being made to try to correct this oversight. Also note that there was a re-make of this film in 1964 starring Lee Marvin and Ronald Reagan. This review is for the original film only.This is one of the most stylistic noir pictures made. Like the FANTASTIC opening of Sunset Boulevard, this movie STARTS with the murder of a poor sap and then backtracks to let the viewer slowly understand why this occurred. Surprisingly, the part given to the murder victim in this movie is played by Burt Lancaster in his first picture--what a great first film! Other reasons I liked the film were the cast (I like ugly old Edmund O'Brien--a stand-out noir actor because he is unattractive, beefy and delivers lines like it was from an episode of Dragnet), writing (it keeps you guessing), direction and impressive cinematography.Do yourself a favor and see it soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film Noir Embellishment of Hemingway Short Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the definitive version of Ernest Hemingway's short story put to film, some say. A film noir classic, in every sense of the word, some say.Up front, I will say I wanted to watch the 1964 version first before re-watching this, (I had not seen this in over 10 years) because I was afraid I would not like the 1964 version, if I had seen this first. So, this review is based upon those circumstances.This is in fact a good film noir. The biggest asset and the main star and attraction of the whole film is its style. It reeks of atmosphere and shadows and everything a great film noir should look like and feel like. But its main weakness is the lack of development in the characters we should be feeling something for. But we are not made to empathize with really anyone. Burt Lancaster is a great actor, but his "Swede" is essentially "walking dead." And, Ava Gardner, while beautiful, gives very little to humanize her character.(One aside: Every time I have ever seen Burt in a movie, I always think of the word immaculate. His figure is lean and his appearance neat and perfect. No actor is as immaculate as Burt Lancaster.) Getting back to the film, the only interesting ongoing character is Albert Dekker as the brains behind the heist, as he is actively keeping the momentum going. Another big weakness is the fact that no one in the movie knows what the other one's doing. Burt never knew Dekker had double-crossed him. The others in the heist never knew Dekker double-crossed them. (There was no fun in the climax or denouement. No ah ha moment!) And, too much was relied on the use of flashbacks, I think. The 1964 version saw these problems and solved them by stressing the action and another point I have not mentioned: the actual killers, played wonderfully by William Conrad and Charles McGraw. There's more entertainment value in their 10 minutes, than the rest of the picture, with their perfect delivery of simple lines. Conrad and McGraw, you are not forgotten.The viewer is captivated by them and wants to see them again. We do, when they get killed themselves. The makers of the 1964 version saw they were the highlight and developed them and in that way made the whole story more interesting.I know it sounds like I'm blasting it. It should be seen once. But multiple viewings may tend to show its flaws too much. Unless you want to see just the first ten minutes, which is what the short story covered anyway: the diner scene. Just try ordering the dinner! Just try!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor noir, but worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 15 minutes of this film are based on Ernest Hemingway's short story, in which 2 killers turn up at a remote town to murder a gas station attendant called The Swede. This section of the film is fabulous. It's direct and snappy (like Hemingways prose) and similar in tone to the introductory scenes in David Cronenberg's "A History of Violence".The rest of the film is loosely inspired by "Double Indemnity", released a couple years prior. Using flashbacks it provides the back story that leads to the Swede's death and introduces us to an insurance investigator, named Riordan, (Edmund O'Brien) who serves as our narrator.Like most old noirs, the pace lulls in the middle section. All the noir elements are here - the double crosses, the femme fatale, the gangsters, the smoke filled bars - but it all feels a bit too mechanical, director Robert Siodmak unable to rise above the material.Still, "The Killers" shut the book on the classic noir cycle's use of flashbacks. Each flashback segment is prompted by Riordan's finding of some clue, as someone begins to tell him about their part in the mess. It's illogical and unlikely that someone would piece together a case in such a way, but cinematically it works. 7.9/10 - Despite a strong opening and brilliant last half hour, this is a minor noir. The dialogue lacks wit and the middle hour lacks bite. Still, it's worth watching if you're a fan of classic noirs.One more thing. Keep an eye peeled for references to cats:1. Kitty (Ava Gardner) 2. The Green Cat. (bar) 3. Meow scene 4. Glasses of milk 5. Cat statuesIt all makes little sense, until we see Ava Gardner sobbing at the end, her nine lives expired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't want to give too much away, but this is a brilliant noir...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE KILLERS is an excellent film noir, , perhaps only bettered by OUT OF THE PAST (1947). To give too much of the plot away would be to spoil the experience for new viewers- I was able to watch it without virtually any prior knowledge of the plot and the film really knocked me for six.One thing that enormously impressed me about THE KILLERS is how seamlessly and seemingly effortlessly director Robert Siodmak manages to pull off the intricately layered plot, which consists of many (13 in total, I think) flashbacks. The film, like CITIZEN KANE, is told from multiple points of view but Siodmak turns the noir atmosphere up to fever pitch by jumbling the order of the flashbacks. Just as we are lead to believe one thing, another possibility comes out at us. So very noir.Burt Lancaster made his starring debut in this film and its a very strong performance of a weak character. In the famous opening 12 minutes, two hit men (including a mean Charles McGraw) enter Brentwood, California and gun down Lancaster's character, the "Swede". He doesn't even resist, telling his co-worker "I did something wrong...once". This serves to be the mystery of the film, as we gradually piece together the Swede's life and how he came to such a miserable end. Of course, like most noirs, it has something to do with a beautiful yet deadly femme fatale, played by a scorching Ava Gardner. Kitty Collins has to be one of the sexiest, yet dangerous, women on film. I'll let you uncover why- her final scene is unforgettable.Lancaster and Gardner, though featuring on most of the publicity posters, do not have as many scenes as the real leading man, dogged insurance man Rearden, Edmomd O'Brien. Rearden gets to live the film noir life when he begins investigating the Swede's death, and you can sense as he is getting sucked further and further into a web of deceit he is enjoying it more and more. Albert Dekker, Sam Levene and Vince Barnett also provide great support. This is a film where every role feels perfectly cast, and there is a never a false moment in it.Siodmak is a director I have not seen much of, yet I will look out for his work in the future. THE KILLERS still feels very fresh and contemporary, and Siodmak directs in a taut, economical style, making sure every flashback serves its purpose whilst still entertaining the audience. The plot was derived from a short story by Ernest Hemingway, but writer Anthony Veiller really deserves the most praise here, as the film is actually an extrapolation on Hemingway's hit men premise. The screenplay contains many great noir lines and the cinematography is appropriately dark and ominously lit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Killers' was released on 1946. Back then, the film-noir genre was really popular. And in my opinion, this one is one of the best of this great cinematic genre, because it's told in a different way than most of its time. This movie is told through really smart flashbacks.'The Killers' begins with two hit men arriving in a small town with only one objective: kill 'Swede' Anderson (Burt Lancaster). After this, a detective starts to investigate his death, by interviewing the people of the town. This is how he uncovers a murderous plot evolving multiple characters. This is one of those movies that really keeps you interesting and anxious on what's going to happen, ans when the plot reveals itself, it's really awesome how everything is around Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner). The story is well-told and aged really well.The acting here is not superb, but it's not bad also. The movie is important because it's the first major role of Burt Lancaster, and the movie made him a star. It also features the always beautiful and mysterious Ava Gardner and the competent Edward O'Brien, in a interesting role.I have never watched a Robert Siodmak picture before, and was surprised to see how well he directed this picture. The camera was always at an interesting and different angle, and there's one nice tracking shot in the middle of the movie. Along with the well-made soundtrack by Miklós Rózsa, and the also well-made cinematography by Elwood Bredell the mood in here couldn't be better.Overral, this is a great film-noir movie, one of the best of its genre. It aged really well, most because of Ernest Hemingway's powerful story. It keeps you interested, with nice acting and directing.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The swede story unravels in noir classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can scan thru many publications and they will tell you that Robert Siodmark's adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's story The Killers is quintessential noir, and whilst I haven't seen enough of the perceived classics to make a sound judgement, I do understand why this one ranks so high.Perfectly directed by Siodmark because it is washed with a moody ambiance that befits the script, the main players in the piece are bang on form to realise the mood and sombre tempo that makes the film a winner. The story basically revolves around Burt Lancaster's Swede Anderson who upon learning that hired killers are out to fulfil a contract on him, promptly stays horizontal on his bed and awaits his fate. We then follow Edmond O'Brien's insurance investigator Jim Reardon as (thru a series of flashbacks) he reconstructs Swede's life and what caused his demise.The story encompasses one of film noir's most well known femme fatales in Ava Gardner's foxy Kitty Collins, and it's certainly the film's driving force as we observe her part in Swede's life, for better or worse as it were, but ultimately it's the classy framing of the film that marks it out as essential viewing. It's oppressive, it's almost stifling, and it's certainly story telling of the highest order, but mainly it just looks so fecking gorgeous you feel privileged to have been part of it. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uneven expansion of a Hemingway story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film seems to get a lot of love, and to extent, it deserves the acclaim. The first 20 minutes of the film is an adaptation of a famous short story of Hemingway. The film starts with two killers taking over a diner, waiting for a local known as "Swede" (played by Burt Lancaster in a breakthrough role) that they've come to kill. When Swede doesn't show, they leave, and Hemingway's ubiquitous protagonist, Nick Adams, races to the Swede's apartment to warn him. For the first 20 minutes, the writing is excellent, the dialogue terse, and the viewer is left with a grim view of the coldness of life, which provides moments of sudden danger and incomprehensible actions.And then Hollywood makes its contribution. Around the gem of a short story, the film makers added a backstory explaining the Swede's actions (or lack thereof) including crime, a femme fatale (played by the gorgeous Ava Gardner), a robbery, and a conflict about stolen money. The larger film is far less interesting. Unfortunately, the film spends most of its time following the actions of an insurance investigator played by Edmond O'Brien, who just cannot command the screen as well as Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner can. Perhaps if Lancaster and Garnder had been given more prominent rules and O'Brien had been marginalized, the relative triteness of the larger screenplay could have been overlooked. I give this film a 6. The first 20 minutes are epic, but the rest isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ernest Hemingway once described the only proper way to do business with Hollywood. You drive up to the California border and stop before you cross it. The producers show up on the other side. You throw them the contract. They throw you the money and you catch it and run away.Nice typical fifteen-minute noir opening informed by Hemingway's brand of ambiguity. There's a small town in New Jersey. Two malicious-looking mean-talking guys enter the diner and insinuate themselves into a position of command in a few minutes, making an occasional wisecrack. They announce that they've come to town to kill a Swede. After they leave, one of the customers runs to warn the Swede, but the Swede lies there in bed and says, thanks for coming, but there's nothing I can do. End of story.The rest of the movie owes nothing to Hemingway and has to stand on its own. And it's not bad. Edmond O'Brien enters the story as an insurance investigator determined to find out why the Swede (Lancaster) left his $2500 life insurance to a elderly chambermaid in Atlantic City, whom he'd met six years ago and known for only two days. One tip leads to an implausible other tip and before you know it -- well, within a week anyway -- O'Brien has the case solved and the bad guys all dead and the femme fatale (Ava Gardner) sent to the slams.If it's above average -- and it is -- it's because it is supertypical, almost an "ideal type" out of Max Weber. Lots of low-key lighting, mostly night shooting, Miklos Roza's ominous score (including a leitmotiv for the two killers that sounds exactly like the theme from "Dragnet"). Everybody double crosses everybody else. Of two childhood pals, one grows up to be a cop and the other a gangster. A beautiful and dangerous woman lies to a gullible but fundamentally decent guy but chooses to follow the money, casting her perils before swains. Sam Levene has a haircut that looks like the prototype for Don King's. A nightclub called the Green Kitty Cat or something, whose piano player launches into a nerve-rattling boogie tune when the two killers come down the stairs looking for O'Brien.Towards the end it gets a little confusing. Let's see. A quarter of a million dollars is stolen from the Prentiss Hat Factory in Hackensack. At the end, O'Brien seems to have recovered the money -- but I don't know how.There are some niggling flaws. Lancaster and his cell mate are in stir examining the stars through the bars. The cell mate (Vincent Barnett) has been studying stars for years. So how come he mispronounces "Orion"? And how come he says Orion is also known as The Big Bear? And how come he says Betelgeuse is the brightest star in the heavens? Now that I think about it, this is not a niggling flaw at all. It's deeply disturbing. And I'd feel even worse if I were Orion or Sirius.The writer did his homework in other ways though. Yes, Chestnut is a prominent street in Philadelphia. And Newark at the time was filled with insurance companies, a poor man's Hartford. And MArket was a real telephone exchange in Newark. The Ledger was the most prominent local paper, and still is, though it's now the Star-Ledger. I'll have to check on those hats in Hackensack.Final note: It's interesting how Hemingway, through his prose and dialog, almost created his own universe which, once immersed, the viewer comes to take for granted as natural. But Big Ernie's dialog doesn't translate too well to the screen, nor does his writing style. (Name a very good movie made from a Hemingway story.) What looks pungent on the page comes out arch on the screen. Of course there's not a heck of a lot of Hemingway in this movie anyway -- only the opening scene, up to the point at which the Swede dies with grace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Road To Brentwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Siodmak's best known movie is an excellent thriller which marked the debut of screen legend Burt Lancaster and also launched the career of Ava Gardner. It was a great box office success, drew positive reviews from the critics and was also nominated for four Academy Awards.Lancaster plays the role of Ole "The Swede" Andersen, a professional boxer who had to retire because of a serious hand injury. Having been used to high financial rewards in his boxing career, he couldn't contemplate the more modest levels of income offered by conventional jobs and so went into the numbers racket before spending a period of time in prison and then going on to take part in a payroll robbery.At the beginning of the movie, two contract killers arrive at Brentwood N.J. and after visiting a diner, go to The Swede's boarding house room and shoot him. Later, Jim Reardon (Edmond O'Brien) an insurance investigator becomes involved when it emerges that The Swede had a policy with the Atlantic Insurance Company. As there are no apparent reasons why The Swede had been killed or why his beneficiary is a chambermaid in Atlantic City, Reardon's interest becomes aroused and he goes on to interview a whole series of characters who are each able to contribute various pieces of information which, when put together, enable him to establish the background to the incident at Brentwood.During his investigation, Reardon discovers that The Swede had fallen under the spell of Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner) and had, in fact, served a prison sentence for a crime she committed. Despite this personal sacrifice, Kitty never either visited or wrote to him during all the time that he was incarcerated. On being released from prison, The Swede went on to become a member of a gang led by Jim Colfax (Albert Dekker). Kitty was in a relationship with Colfax, but The Swede's obsession with her remained undiminished. The gang went on to carry out a payroll heist and complications later arose in making arrangements to share the proceeds. His role in this, led to him being duped and betrayed in a way which left him a fugitive from the other gang members and without any personal profit from the robbery."The Killers" is a movie that stands up well to repeat viewings and the device of unveiling the plot through such a large number of flashbacks seems very authentic and is used so expertly that the end result never loses pace or becomes disjointed. The movie looks really good and some of the sequences, such as the one between the arrival of the hit men in Brentwood and the murder of The Swede, are like a masterclass in how to establish atmosphere and mood through the medium of light and shadow. Miklos Rozsa's score, (now more widely known as the "Dragnet" music) sounds sombre and threatening and fits the mood of the piece perfectly.Lancaster gives a strong performance as a man who is the victim of his own obsessive attraction to someone who exploits him mercilessly and it's interesting to see his demeanour change as he goes from being the courageous boxer fighting with a painful injury, to the swaggering operator in the numbers racket, a helpless fall guy and eventually a haunted, humble attendant in the filling station in Brentwood. Don Siegel's 1964 remake is more perfunctory in both style and content and compares unfavourably to the Siodmak version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burt Lancaster is a handsome man and a good actor and those traits shine through here, but I found this supposed noir classic to be much ado about nothing. Burt as the Swede takes the rap for his sexy but vapid girlfriend Kitty (Ava Gardner), who unsurprisingly hooks up with someone else, Big Jim Colfax (Albert Dekker,) when he's in the slammer. So once the Swede is sprung what does he do but take part in a heist that is organized by the repellent Jim? I couldn't understand the twists and turns in the convoluted plot and the whole thing was so tiring I stopped caring. Edmund O'Brien looks good as a wannabe cop who investigates insurance cases but all the running around and wisecracking with his boss didn't make me care about his character. (One unexplained flaw in the film is his being kicked senseless at one point by the criminal Dumb-Dumb -- only to be seen none the worse for wear in the following scene!) I was surprised to see this was based on a story written by Hemingway. I found the saga no more compelling than your typical pulp throwaway.</fullReview>

The Swede was a washed up boxer who got mixed up with some bad people and Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner).Killing off Burt Lancaster right at the start takes away some of the tension. The movie stalls a little bit after a really compelling start. It would have been much better to have him live and he could hunt down for those responsible. Watching the flashbacks in this movie, the fact that he's already dead is always at the back of my mind. I love the start but the structure isn't as compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashback after flashback, but interwoven with precision and dark beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killers (1946)This first version of "The Killers" is even more legendary than the Hemingway story it is based on, and director Robert Siodmak keeps the complex plot graphic and engrossing step by step. It's a gritty hunt for the bad guys through a lot of terrific sets, from city inside and out to some country scenes, all really authentic.It's flashback heaven, which is fascinating but also fragmenting. It's a choppy ride, so if you love aspects of the movie, you'll never get drawn into the flow of it in the usual way because it keeps bouncing between the present and the next flashback, and the flashbacks are told from a whole slew of perspectives, including a man who dies while telling it.This might be recommended in some ways. The methodical steps end up mimicking an actual investigator's progress, hearing the stories of different witnesses or people who knew the victim. And so the story gets pieced together by necessity. It's tightly woven, and of course photographed in that fabulous late 1940s black and white exaggeration that defines the look of film noir. Flashbacks are of course a staple of the genre, and even the idea of having a main character dead in the first few minutes is something noirs have played with all along (from "D.O.A." to "Sunset Blvd." to name just two). John Huston, of proto-noir "Maltese Falcon" fame, helped write the screenplay, though the best writing seems to come from the first half hour, which is the only real Hemingway part.We rarely see Burt Lancaster, the headliner, but are glad when we do. We catch more of the plodding insurance investigator, a kind of Bogart wannabe, Edmond O'Brien, who is exactly the needle we need to thread all these pieces together. And if Ava Gardner makes a famous appearance now and then as a mysterious woman mixed up in a crime ring, she is as fleeting as Lancaster. This is a group effort, and you can picture it being filmed in discrete sections with particular actors only needed for small parts of the whole.Eventually the pieces become clear to the investigator, and to us, and if there is some surprise (and satisfaction) by then, there was much more satisfaction getting there, step by step. A great but in some ways middle of the road noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Siodmak's American Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killers is a masterpiece of the film noir genre. I watched this movie several years ago and never forgot it. Sure, some details have slipped away from memory, but I always kept an impression that it was a very good movie, one of those rare instances in which everything comes together to make the best work possible.It starts with Anthony Veiller's screenplay, based on an Ernest Hemingway short-story. Based is perhaps too great a word for Veiller's work. The short-story only makes up the first ten minutes of the movie, right up to the moment the Swede is warned that two men are after him to kill him, and Swede just lies in bed waiting. Veiller in fact invented an entire back story to explain the murder, and credit must go to his inventive mind.The story moves thanks to the efforts of Jim Reardon, an insurance investigator following the case (an insurance investigator instead of a cop or a private eye; Veiller sure wasn't following the formula here), and through a series of flashbacks we get to piece together the events that led to Swede's murder.A teacher once told me that The Killers was like the Citizen Kane of film noir because of its complex structure and use of flashbacks. I'll agree that it's a step forward in the genre, if we only think of John Huston's simple narrative in The Maltese Falcon. It's not just that the movie uses flashbacks, but each one is, like Citizen Kane, started by a different character telling his memories. If all art is theft, Siodmak and Veiller knew to steal from the best.I don't remember the visuals very much, but I remember that the use of darkness and shadows, the play with, impressed me very much. A good deal of film noir is knowing how to set a mood, an atmosphere, and this movie achieved that very well.What I definitely remember and love is Miklos Rozsa's score (I listen to it all the time), whose main theme is so popular I understand it became the main theme of a show called Dragnet. The theme playing whenever the killers show up (at the start and at the end) is unforgettable, heavy with menace and violence. I've heard several scores by him and I consider this one of his best, up there with his Oscar-winning scores for Spellbound and Ben Hur.The Killers is an exciting, fast-paced movie that explored the seedier aspects of human existence: the greed and the will to power; and like the best noirs, it portrays a fatalistic view of mankind, of the past as something that we can't run away from; a feeling pervades that everyone gets what they deserve and truly there are no winners in this movie. Not even Reardon, for all his efforts, gets anything in return. This, with Jacques Torneur's Out of the Past, is the most depressing noir ever made, and perhaps for that reason also it's one of the best.Robert Siodmak isn't very famous today. Perhaps it's because he choose to return to Germany after the war, where he created masterpieces. Perhaps if he had remained in Hollywood he'd be as famous as Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang and others. But in spite of the fame he has today, he was a film artist and this is certainly his American masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If there's one thing in this world I hate, it's a double-crossing dame"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some intrepid critics have categorised 'Citizen Kane (1941)' as an early example of film noir, owing largely to its influential cinematography and flashback narrative structure. As though consciously in support of this assertion, Robert Siodmak's 'The Killers (1946)' ? expanded from a 1927 short story by Ernest Hermingway ? plays out precisely like a noirish retelling of Welles' film. After enigmatic ex-boxer Swede Andersen (Burt Lancaster) is gunned down by hired assassins in a small American town, insurance investigator Jim Reardon (Edmond O'Brien) decides to piece together the man's past using fragmented testimony from those who once knew him. In doing so, he hopes to uncover the meaning behind the dead man's final words, "I did something wrong once." The life that Reardon discovers is one tinged with tragedy, regret and betrayal, revealing details of an audacious factory heist, a treacherous dame, and a double-cross to end all double-crosses. An archetypal noir, 'The Killers' caps an excellent year for Siodmak, who also released the Freudian psycho-thriller 'The Dark Mirror (1946).''The Killers' opens with a thrilling prologue that sees two hired thugs (William Conrad and B-noir stalwart Charles McGraw) harass the patrons at a small-town diner on their way to assassinate Swede Andersen. The characters' quickfire exchange of dialogue resembles something that Tarantino or the Coen brothers would have written decades later, only better, because screenwriter Anthony Veiller (with Richard Brooks and John Huston) reproduces the conversation from Hemingway's short story almost verbatim. After Andersen is unresistingly gunned down in his bed, the screenplay then expands upon the foundations laid down by the source material, using flashbacks to fill in the empty spaces at which Hemingway had only hinted. Veiller, whose work before WWII was dominated by romantic dramas, comedies and light mysteries like 'The Ex-Mrs. Bradford (1936),' appears to have been hardened by his work on Frank Capra's "Why We Fight" propaganda series, and the dark, cynical post-War tone he brings to Swede's tragic story is an ideal representation of the noir spirit.Burt Lancaster shows promise in his screen debut, though the film's narrative structure does keep the audience distant from his character, an issue that Welles somehow avoided in 'Citizen Kane.' As the resident femme fatale, Ava Gardner never quite inspires the collective hatred garnered by Barbara Stanwyck in 'Double Indemnity (1944)' or Jane Greer in 'Out of the Past (1947),' but perhaps that speaks to her charms ? that, despite her betrayal, we're still unwilling to treat her with due contempt. Good-guy Edmond O'Brien cheerfully and voyeuristically experiences the wretched life of a gangster through the intermediary flashback device ? he ends the film with a cocky grin, like an audience-member emerging from a screening of the latest gangster thriller. Throughout this review, I've been making allusions to 'Citizen Kane,' but there's a very important difference between the two main characters: Charles Foster Kane had all the money in the world and got nothing out of it. Swede Andersen wasn't even that lucky; he didn't even get the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double crosser Kitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernest Hemingway, a man whose novels made it to the movies, was not too fortunate, like his contemporary, F. Scott Fitzgerald, in that the treatment the movie industry gave them did not do justice to the written page. He was lucky, though, in what was achieved with this short story. "The Killers", was one of the best things Hollywood did to Hemingway's work. Part of the success was the man who was selected to direct, Robert Siodmak, who had distinguished himself in movies that show his imprimatur. The film also succeeds because of the excellent cinematography by Woody Bredell and the fine musical score of Miklos Rosza.Burt Lancaster, fresh out of Broadway, made an impressive debut as the Swede Andersen. Swede knew what his fate was going to be and quietly accepts it. He could have run, but no, he understood he could not get away from his past. The other great debut was that of Ava Gardner. She was a beautiful woman who was at the height of her youth. A fresh new face that went far, like her co-star. Their chemistry was easily transmitted to the audience."The Killers" also boast a sensational cast doing their best work for the director. Robert Conrad and Charles McGraw were perfect as the hired assassins in search of the Swede. The film owes this pair the mystery that was created when they appeared at the diner. The same can be said of Edmund O'Brien, the insurance agent who figures out the whole plot behind the missing money. Sam Levene gave his part the right tone. Albert Dekker, Donald MacBride and Queenie Smith were also seen in minor roles.The version shown on cable recently showed a pristine copy of this memorable film of 1946 that still looks fresh as the day it opened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At ATime When Noir Reigns As King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Killers" tells the exciting story of hired hit men who for an unspecified motive unceremoniously murder a has-been boxer called Swede (Burt Lancaster). This leads to insurance investigator Jim Reardon (Edmund O'Brien) to dig the dirt on Swede's shady past and his connections with the attractive but very vile Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner). Burt Lancaster was in full swing in his performance as a boxer who's near the end of his career and goes by "The Swede". From the opening scene where his character gets murdered for an unknown reason this leads to further digging out information about The Swede and search for clues behind his cagey past. Edmund O'Brien is the leading investigator who comes to the conclusion that there is a more darker motive behind his unwarranted assassin. The story goes back and forth in time as Mr. Reardon goes further into the case as to why the Swede sacrificed his life instead getting out of Dodge or at least put up a bit of a battle.The missing piece to this enigmatic mystery is to look for Kitty Collins who mysteriously left town all too sudden. Miss Collins was at one time in a relationship with the Swede. Reardon claims that the Swede naively negotiated in paying up to these thugs in a robbery just so that he could win Kitty's affection. However, Kitty was already dating the the goon's head honcho Big Jim Colfax (Albert Dekker). The easily vulnerable Swede could never imagine how such an attractive vixen like Kitty could be so diabolical. The heist comes out successfully.. Sadly Swede didn't realize his role in the heist would bite him back until it is too late."The Killers" is a suspense noir that packs a lot of bite that will keep you glued to the edge of your seats. and it is so much fun to watch you don't want to miss a second of it. The black and white cinematography is in sync with the genre and it's complimented nicely by the brilliant camera angles. The script is well edited and the performances don't get any better than this. The atmosphere is in full force to create a real, dark cold moody landscape that should keep you enthralled during it's hour and forty-five minute duration. Lancaster and Gardner provide enticing chemistry between each other and their roles launched the careers of these two.This movie and definitely deserves our attention and needs more credibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tend to provide comments on movies I've never seen or lesser-known movies or movies with fewer reviews, not on the classics like "The Killers" (1946) whose virtues are extremely well-known and that I've seen many times. Last night was another one of those times.What can I say? The opening sequence is phenomenal in all ways: its looks and the two hit-men, McGraw and Conrad, the repartee, the exterior and interior of the diner. It's no wonder that the movie feels a bit downhill after that. The number of flashbacks amazed me upon this viewing. The complexity of the story is notable. The cinematography is of course off the chart. Burt's physique and height looked impressive. Ava Gardner's sexuality and looks are great. Humphrey Bogart said "Whatever it is, whether you're born with it, or catch it from a public drinking cup, she has got it." I've always liked Albert Dekker's performances and he is excellent. One or two of the sound stage sets don't hold up, but they're easy to forgive. Lots of familiar character actors pop up.I sat all the way through this classic film noir as if I were seeing it for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If there's one thing in the world I hate, it's a double crossing dame."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My summary line spoken by Big Jim Colfax (Albert Dekker) about his woman Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner) spells out the requirements for any film noir worth it's salt. Trouble is, she didn't really double cross HIM, but instead poor schlep Swede Anderson (Burt Lancaster) who met his death at the hands of two hit men to begin the picture. The Criterion Collection serves up both the original 1946 film directed by Peter Siodmak, and the 1964 remake from Don Siegel. If you're forced to make a choice, go with the black and white original. Paraphrasing Bogey's description of the Maltese Falcon, it's the stuff great film noir is made of.With no less than eleven, count 'em, eleven flashback scenes, Ernest Hemingway's "The Killers" is a satisfyingly complex mystery, but truth be told, I had to watch the film twice in a row, back to back because I kept getting lost between past and present in the story the first time around. It didn't help either that Lancaster's character was called by a series of different names starting out as well, going by Pete Welling, Pete Lundz and The Swede before he ever even appeared on screen. The Swede's equanimity in the face of his own murder turned out to be a maguffin if you think about it; we never do find out why he just accepted his fate the way he did.But for the rest of it, the story fairly crackles with suspense and mystery. Ava Gardner plays her role sublimely, we never get a clear sense of who's dame she really is until the very end, and by then she's pleading for her life with the dying Big Jim. Lest I forget to mention it, most of the story is related as the investigation into why The Swede named a poor chambermaid as the beneficiary of a twenty five hundred dollar life insurance policy. Hot on that trail is Jim Reardon (Edmond O'Brien), working his tips and hunches right down to that last minute when Big Jim gives it up in the end. But not all of it - Colfax never comes around to taking the dive for Kitty Collins (Gardner). Police Lieutenant Sam Lubinsky (Sam Levene) summed it up the best - "Don't ask a dyin' man to send his soul to hell".Hot on the heels of this picture I managed to watch the 1964 remake, and noticed something kind of cool. In the original, Reardon tracks down a former cell mate of The Swede when he took the blame for Kitty's shoplifting a piece of jewelry. Charleston, who opted out of the mail truck heist for the quarter million payroll robbery, was portrayed by character actor Vince Barnett. Whether it was intended or not, there's an inadvertent tribute to him seen on a building marquee when the camera pans a scene of the city. Reading from top to bottom of the marquee, it spells out the name 'Barnett's'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessential film noir, and one of the best film adaptations of Hemingway's work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regarding the latter, that is saying quite a lot seeing as Ernest Hemingway's work is very difficult to adapt and has met very mixed success on film. What is remarkable about The Killers is how it takes a very good and remarkably powerful short story and expands further on it, one of the few Hemingway adaptations to be just as good as its source material and at times be even better than it.This said it is a fabulous film too on its own terms, and is quintessential film noir, audacious, taut, exciting and suspenseful when it could have been overblown, overwrought or dull if done wrongly. And as much as I did like the 1964 remake, mostly because of Lee Marvin, the 1946 original is the far superior film, with an obvious difference for the better being the production values. The remake was hurt by its rather rushed and cheap made-for-TV look, whereas the production values is one of the strongest things about this version, with its crisp photography, brilliantly atmosphere production design influenced by Edward Hopper and shadowy lighting, that bring such an effective noir-ish atmosphere, the opening scene is particularly striking in this regard.Miklos Rozsa's music here is one of his most ominous and stirringly orchestrated, used sparingly but with palpable effect, really allowing the atmosphere to speak and enhancing it even further when it features. So good in fact, that it was used again for the TV series Dragnet. Robert Siodmak's expertly direction, which maintains a powerfully bleak tone throughout, and a cracking screenplay are further great things, as is a story that is tightly paced and excitingly taut with tons of suspense and intrigue and intricately done and never confusing flashbacks, not getting dull for a minute. This viewer for one was riveted throughout and never found herself confused.Strong acting also helps, with Burt Lancaster thoroughly convincing in his first starring role, his best moments in fact are stunning, and Ava Gardner in the femme fatale role is wonderfully beautiful, classy and mysterious. Albert Dekker and Edmund O' Brien are the standouts in support, Dekker is splendidly larcenous and O'Brien drives the investigation with such taut aplomb. Charles McGraw and William Conrad are chilling too, and you wish the film developed their characters just a little more. While the characters are not the most well-developed, they are still interesting and carry the narrative without any annoyances or irrelevance.All in all, superior version and quintessential film noir in its own right. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killer Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This iconic film noir marks itself as something out of the ordinary with its opening sequence set in a dining car in Nowhereville America. William Conrad and Charles McGraw play a couple of unlikely hoods whose lazily insolent manner of talking to their captive audience seems true to the style of Hemingway. Although Hemingway's story on which the film claims to be based apparently ends at the point when Swede (Burt Lancaster) is informed of their arrival, co-writers Anthony Veiller, Richard Brooks and John Huston maintain the sparse, bleak style of this opening sequence to fashion an intriguing Noir classic that is fully deserving of its status.The cast alone is reason enough to watch the film; in addition to Lancaster, Conrad and McGraw we have Edmond O'Brien (in the days before he started getting hefty) as a dogged insurance investigator determined to find out why Swede was murdered, and why he accepted his fate so passively, Albert Dekker as the sleazy crime boss who masterminds a fateful robbery that ultimately changes the lives of all involved for the worse, Ava Gardener as one of film history's most insidious femme fatales, and Sam Levene as a police detective friend of Swede's who helps O'Brien's investigator crack the case.A finely honed Lancaster commands the screen, although he enjoys less screen time than the not-so-toned O'Brien. With his effortless screen presence it's not difficult to see why this role propelled him to stardom. The story has a kind of Citizen Kane framing device, with the key protagonist dying early so that a subsequent investigation into his death can be undertaken by interviewing those who knew him when he was alive. The difference is that in this film, O'Brien's dogged investigator manages to unravel the mystery before the final credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Compelling Jigsaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot. Lancaster and Gardner may get star billing, but O'Brien gets the screen time. In fact, Lancaster's role is spotty, while Gardner's only big chance comes at the end. Otherwise, she sits around, looking beautiful and sexy, which she's supposed to. Clearly, O'Brien's insurance dick is no Phillip Marlowe. Instead he has to answer to a by-the-numbers boss (MacBride in a surprisingly straight role). Still, Reardon (O'Brien) has the one feature required of all noir private eyes?he's a seeker after truth, come what may. And in this case, it's what's with the suicidal Swede (Lancaster).Also, get a load of that opening scene?a midnight diner, shadowy figures, an empty street. Noir seldom comes any purer. All that's missing is a lonely train whistle. In fact, I'll take that extended scene as the movie's best. McGraw and Conrad drop enough tough talk on the poor counterman to drown the average fall guy. It's from that tense 15-minutes that the movie gets what grit it has. The story's remainder is more like a metaphysical puzzle, as Reardon tries to piece together a solution to Swede's mysterious death. Trouble is he's got to rely on second-hand sources since Swede's in no condition to talk. Plus the sources from his past are disconnected in the telling, so it's like trying to figure out a jigsaw. Then too, will the pieces all fit since somebody could be lying?maybe the squinty Dumb-Dumb or the cringing Charleston, or even the curiously laid-back Colfax (Dekker).This is a narrative you have to think about once it's over. Because, like a highway under construction, there're a lot of twists and turns. Curiously, the main part is largely devoid of action or even much violence. Instead, the writers and director Siodmak settle for atmospheric exposition, and I'm not sure if that helps or hinders. But either way, the unraveling is compelling. Then too, that final scene on the staircase is oddly reminiscent? in this case, Mary Astor's elevator going down at the end of The Maltese Falcon (1941) despite her emotional pleas.Anyway, 40's noir hardly comes any purer, from spider woman to fall guy to $50 lighting bill. So if you don't mind a complex plot-line, this is one to catch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" I've always wondered why life imitates the stars, some burn brighter than others "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the superb writings of Earnest Hemmingway have become the blueprints for extraordinary movies. 'The Old Man and the Sea, the Snows of Kilimnjaro' and Of Mice and Men are three of the more exceptional ones. In this film, "The Killers" which was duplicated in 1964, contains something which the second film lacked; naked drama. This original version stars Burt Lancaster as Ole 'Swede' Andersen. The black and white movie is solidly crafted with black shadowy brush strokes, eerie music and dark images. Further, the menacing killers, max and Al (Charles McGraw and William Conrad) later become established actors in their own right. This movie launches Lancaster's career and establishes him as a bona-fide thespian, despite playing a washed-out boxer and petty thief. Joining up with a small gang, he and a group of others, steal $250.000 and then decide to betray one another. With the help of a double crossing vixen named Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner) her boyfriend Big Jim Colfax (Albert Dekker) plan to eliminate the rest and keep all the money. Edmond O'Brien is Jim Reardon an insurance investigator who with the help of Police Lt.Sam Lubinsky (Sam Levene) do their best to unravel the successful robbery and ensuing murders. Hailed as a remarkable achievement, this crime drama stands the test of time and becomes a true Classic and a milestone for Burt Lancaster. Easilly recommended. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the early and great film noirs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is actually in two distinct parts. The first involves the first fifteen minutes or so and includes a dynamite opening with some great cinematography. As the film opens and credits roll all you see are the silhouettes of two figures in wide-brimmed hats driving through the night. These are "the killers", contract killers in search of a gas station attendant known as "Big Swede" (Burt Lancaster) in the small town of Brentwood, New Jersey. This is the part taken from Hemmingway. The killers enter the town diner and spout some of the most enjoyable and memorably acted dialogue spoken in any noir film ever. Unfortunately, being the realist that I am, I have to wonder...what were these guys thinking? They choose to walk into a well-lit diner, involve three innocent long-time residents of the town, and make their murderous intentions clear, when they could have just waited for the Swede in some dark alley, minimizing any local outrage at or even interest in the crime? How these two got to the top of their profession as paid killers without detection and arrest is a tribute to the Peter Principle. But I digress.The Swede knows the killers are coming, doesn't choose to flee, almost seems grateful at the prospect of being killed, and the killers do miraculously make a clean get-away. Nobody seems interested in solving the mystery behind the murder of this anonymous and seemingly unexceptional drifter except a lone insurance investigator (Edmund O'Brien). Many people have said that the investigative part of the film doesn't live up to the promise of the opening, but I disagree. There is intensity, fine acting, and a very involved plot that kept me interested right up to the end.If you like noir, you'll love this seldom seen or mentioned little film. Do notice how this noir, with a story that is largely told in flashbacks going back nine years, seems to completely ignore the fact that WWII ever happened during four of those nine years. The war was over, and with the nightmare of both the Depression and Hitler behind them, Americans wanted their bad guys isolated in a world that only effected other bad guys and their accomplices. Thus film noir, as dark as it was, became the escapist entertainment of choice for post-war America for some years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first-rate crime noir from 1946</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you make an interesting movie when the character the movie ostensibly is all about is just a dumb lug, as interesting as a boiled potato? The Swede stumbles into one situation after another, willing to believe in true love or lies. For me, director Robert Siodmak and screenwriters Anthony Veiller, Richard Brooks and John Huston (the last two uncredited) solve this problem three ways. First, there is the great look and style of the movie. I think it's impossible to say one movie looks better than all others, especially when it comes to noirs, but The Killers nails as well as any the dark, foreboding feel of cheap hotel rooms, shadowy streets and close-ups of white, worried faces. Second, all the flashbacks in this movie create the sense of a complex jigsaw puzzle slowly being solved. The story not only becomes complicated and interesting, it's great fun to see what the next piece in the puzzle is going to show us. And what helps make all those puzzle pieces interesting is the cast of characters who take turns in the flashback spotlights. There's not a dud actor in the lot. And third, for me, is the sourness of the ending. No, not the last scene of a smiling Edmond O'Brien jauntily leaving his boss's office. It's the revelation of what a nasty piece of work Kitty Collins really was and how far out of her league was the Swede. He was just a big, thick-eared guy who, in other circumstances, might have gone straight, but he didn't have a chance when he saw Kitty that first time at the party sitting next to the piano player. I don't think this was what Rodgers and Hammerstein had in mind when they wrote about seeing a stranger across a crowded room. Besides, "I did something wrong once" is a great line to power a crime movie with. What also struck me is the simplicity of the logic behind Jim Colfax' decision to unleash the two hit men onto the Swede. At first, it seemed so much smarter just to let things coast by. But Colfax's reasoning holds up if you think about it, and that logic powers the action of the movie. What doesn't hold up is the motivation of the two hit men's behavior in the diner. How much easier it would have been to walk in, sit down and order a couple of cups of coffee. Then mention they were in town to pay back some money to the Swede but they don't have his address. Anybody know where he lives? Someone would have said, "Why, sure. He lives at Ma's boarding house just a couple of blocks from here." I know, this more practical approach would have gutted the foreboding and nervousness of the movie. I'm not advocating this, just suggesting that it's a little bothersome when a great plot device has a flaw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest of its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film noir from 1943 was loosely based on an Ernest Hemingway play of the same name, introducing the world to giant powerhouse Burt Lancaster. The famous 20-minute opening that has two contract killers, Max (William Conrad) and Al (Charles McGraw), arrive at a small-town diner looking for a man named the 'Swede' (Lancaster), is now one of the most widely celebrated scenes in noir, going against type by having it's (anti)hero killed before the film has really begun. As Ole 'Swede' Anderson lies dead, life insurance investigator Jim Riordan (Edmond O'Brien) takes a special interest in the case, interviewing friends and ex-colleagues that leads back to sultry femme fatale Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner) and a $250,000 heist.While it ticks all the traditional film noir boxes, the main aspect that makes The Killers stick out amongst many other noirs of the period is the cinematography, which is straight out of the school of German Expressionism (German-born director Robert Siodmak would have grown up with the likes of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) and Metropolis (1927)). Filmed by Elwood Bredell, long, dark alleyways swirled with steam, silhouetting suited strangers, pepper the film, adding a real sense of style to the proceedings, and adding to the mystery and blindness of Riordan's mission, of which he has little to go on. The aforementioned opening scene, which was later homaged by David Cronenberg in A History of Violence (2005), is a masterwork of tension- building, as two suited thugs press their violent sensibilities onto the simple townsfolk. Producer Mark Hellinger helped create some of the finest noirs of this era, including They Drive By Night (1940), Brute Force (1947) and The Naked City (1948).Lighting the torch that would be carried on by fellow noir masterpieces Double Indemnity (1944) and Sunset Blvd. (1950), The Killers is tough, unpredictable and dark, representing everything the genre is so lauded for. Anchored by an impressive physical performance by Lancaster, it is really O'Brien who takes the centre stage, playing the shrewd investigator who would become the fabric for many a noir dick, full of confrontational dedication and unconventional methods. But it is Ava Gardner, who plays one of the most devious femme fatales in history, that lingers in the memory, perhaps never looking more beautiful. When the climax comes into force, it becomes clear that the plot is actually very basic, but the film wraps it up in double-crosses, bruising monochrome boxing matches, and some fine dialogue, written by Anthony Veiller and an uncredited John Huston. One of the finest of its genre.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well done film noir piece tells the story of an ex fighter called the Swede, who is gunned down in his room, even though he knows the killers are coming and does nothing to stop it, saying, he once did something wrong. An insurance investigator, following up on the death is curious to know what forced his death and what involvement in a payroll heist has to do with the Swede. Very well directed by Siodmak telling the story in various out of order flashbacks where the viewer has to assemble the puzzle, but still very easy to follow. Lancaster is good in his first movie role, Gardner is stunning to look at (a nod to cinematographer Bredell). Conrad &amp; McGraw lend excellent support as the killers, as does Barnett, as the Swede's weary ex cellmate. Some coincidences seem too fantastic, but are excusable to make necessary the story.

		<shortDescription>A little disappointing considering its reputation, and the Hemingway opening is, ironically, the most grippingly cinematic. (Possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely baffled. I know noirs are meant to be confusing and convoluted, but what the hell is going on in this film? I don't think I should have had that fourth glass of wine. I'm tempted to say that THE KILLERS is not the sum of its awesome parts, but I didn't really grasp it, so that would be a lie. Time to cling to some coordinates.In many ways THE KILLERS is CITIZEN KANE as noir thriller. There is a heavy metaphysical bent to the film (most noticeably Charleston's paean to the stars right in the middle), what with the many Irish (and hence Catholic) characters (Reardon, Kitty, Swede's beneficiary); a visual schema which suggests the engulfment of the individual, and a hero who awaits calmly on his death-bed the approach of the Grim Reaper(s), in the shape of the title's killers. Is the action dreamed by Swede as he waits to die, like Kane? There are beds everywhere. For a film heavily based on repression (of truth, justice, desire etc.), it seems appropriate that the film should be a paranoiac's dream, rather than an objective thriller. It's almost as if Swede has died, and Reardon is an angel who has to uncover the meaning of his life, to see if he's worthy of redemption.The film seems unusual in the noir cycle, in its use of the detective. Normally, the detective is an independent outsider, hostile to the law, attempting to live by a code of honour, often falling for the sinister charms of a femme fatale. He begins the film detached, and ends the film ensnared and unable to escape. This is usually taken as a metaphor for masculine impotence after World War II, the male's inability to make sense of, or control the world around him.Reardon, on the other hand, is almost inhuman. He is not a 'private' eye, but the representative of an insurance company, that ultimate emblem of capitalism (it is his job to judge death, to see if it fits in with his guidelines). He must, as a detective, uncover truth and assert order, and this he seems to do. He remains detached, doesn't fall for any femme fatale (doesn't seem to have any sexual or emotional life at all; there's the possibility that he lusts after Kitty, but he never allows her to weave her web). He doesn't go mad - he restores order with relative ease. He is more of an impersonal instrument for a repressive force, rather than a person. His victory is a chilling one.But it is a victory. There are so many double-crosses in this film noir, so many interchangeable names and faces, so many distorted flashbacks, that meaning and closure loses all its reassuring power. Reardon himself is frequently just a shadow, and as Mark Cousins points out, he spends the film continually mirroring the man whose history he seeks. The way to truth is to uncover Swede's truth, but Swede is dead, he has no voice, we have to rely on testimonies seriously partial and unreliable - it is therefore ironic that Swede is killed so that he can't speak.Swede is an outsider, a romantic, someone who'll take the rap for his lover (astonishingly, in his film debut, Burt Lancaster was already playing Lou from ATLANTIC CITY - past it, yet hopeful, dreaming, adoring of the big boys; betrayed, used, disillusioned, a man out of time running out of time. It's a remarkably un-Lancasterian performance: quiet, passive, vulnerable, marginalised). Reardon imposes his truth on Swede, co-opting the outsider into his world view. Reardon's optimism depends on crushing dissent - after all, the Swede is his opposite, his enemy.This noir world is typically disorientating, without fixed boundaries or perspectives, at one moment so cramped you fear the screen will burst, the next a revelation of the abyss. There is little light in the film, nothing to encourage truth. Siodmak's direction is extraordinary, continually concealing when it most seems to enlighten. His biographical status as a German Jewish refugee adds anguish to the tale of a man who has two shadowy executioners invade his home one night. This link with Nazism and the US is sly and disturbing.This is a film I'd really have to rewatch. If meaning is elusive, the pleasures are immense. The lack of humour is a huge drawback, and the two stars are sidelined by O' Brien's less interesting character. There is none of the romantic anguish of, say, OUT OF THE PAST. But the hallucinatory, dehumanising quality of the film, with Swede's decency on the margins being crushed; the near abstraction of plot and character; the brilliant undermining, rather than simple obfuscation, of flashbacks, make this a film to be seen again and again.</fullReview>

Anyhow: no one ever looked more made for a sleeveless white t-shirt than he did. It seems to fit him. Ava Gardener is an absolute knock out here. She could probably change a person's sexual orientation just by smoking a cigarette. Again, with the cigarettes. No wonder everyone from the 40's died of cancer. Another scene where a dying man puffs on a cig right before going under forever. Reminiscent of Double Indemnity. All in all: great to look at, and lots to ponder, as you try to figure out what it all meant and who really screwed over who?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredibly an exciting beginning of a movie. The murderers who kill without explanation and victim calmly awaits death. THE KILLERS is out of sync movie, which does not affect much on a very good story and a solid noir atmosphere. Flashbacks are chronologically nonlinear, are manifold, but are quite clear. Most attract attention, because the reconstruction of the victim's life. Looking at the other side, they are only an attempt to illuminate the case in which the robbed factory. The heart of the story is certainly not an insurance investigator. He is only an intermediary.The story is quite complicated and tense. Therefore, conclusions can be multiple. Why man quietly waiting for its own liquidation? For love or fraud. The victim of femme fatale or just a criminal who fell in love with the wrong woman.One of the protagonists patiently solve the mystery. He waits until all the attributes are not in his hands. Burt Lancaster as Pete Lund/Ole "Swede" Andreson is handsome and muscular actor who in all solid pace. For the first important role quite decent. Although I think it director spared some embarrassment. Several times he was close. Ava Gardner as Kitty Collins was prickly as a femme fatale. The lady who cut the flow of the story. Although I was fascinated by her beauty, I have not regretted the fate of her character at the end of the film. Edmond O'Brien as Jim Reardon is cunning, cold and relentless investigator in the style of a real detective. On one side is a bad copy of the Bogart, on the other hand the result of the popularity of such characters in film noir.The film has a slow tempo with a lot of uncertainty and tension. The sharp dialogues, gloomy atmosphere and fatalistic tone determined work on which the movie is based.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A game changer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Killers" follows tow hit men who takes out a complacent victim (Burt Lancaster), after which a detective and insurance agent go down the rabbit hole into a web of mystery which entangles the magnetic Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner).Marked by what may be the best opening scene in film noir history, "The Killers" is in the ranks with Wilder's "Double Indemnity," though it doesn't so often get the same amount of talk. The fact that the film partially riffs on the Ernest Hemingway story gives "The Killers" a bit more of an edge in my opinion. It is rife with suspense that holds up even as the narrative breaks up into kaleidoscopic fragments, twisting and turning through time and space.As the hallmark of most all film noir, moody cinematography, shadows, and darkness play a major aesthetic role here. The film is photographed exceptionally, yet retains a grittier feel than its glossier Hollywood peers; in that respect, "The Killers" is a bit more hard-edged and reminiscent of the B-movie noir, yet thematically and otherwise, it is not a B film in the slightest. The film marks Burt Lancaster's first starring role, with Ava Gardner as the mysterious femme fatale who appears in the thick of things.Overall, "The Killers" is a historical game changer for noir, and a real convention-setter. It's a bit nervier than some film noir, and a bit grittier in tone, but I think that that fact alone sets the film apart to some extent. Gardner's appearance as the jet black-haired Kitty Collins is also one of the most memorable femme fatale performances in history. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering The Killers dates from early in the noir cycle it's a little surprising that it's as definitive a crystallization of the noir ethos that we're likely ever to see. Wow! Director Siodmak and cinematographer Woody Bredell are at the top of their form: they pile shadow upon shadow, scene after scene. So much going for this one: noir composer of choice Miklos Rozsa here comes through with maybe his best score ever, regardless of genre. Jangling and Stravinsky-esque, it never lets up. Burt Lancaster is fine as the doomed Swede, and of course Ava Gardner is a wonder. The visage of her in that slinky black evening dress is the very definition of the noir femme fatale. Only Rita Hayworth in Gilda gives her a run for her money. A bonus is that Ava sings her song using her own voice. And how about Charles McGraw and William Conrad, for my money the two coldest hired assassins in film history. And it is refreshing to see a young, relatively slim and more or less handsome Edmond O'Brien taking on the gumshoe role. The rest of the supporting cast is primo, especially Albert Dekker as Mr Big and, in a turn that seems to anticipate his appearance in Kiss Me Deadly a decade later, Jack Lambert nearly steals the movie as the problematic thug. Also fascinating is the inclusion on the Criterion DVD of a 1956 short produced in the Soviet Union(!) which sticks pretty faithfully to the story and does a pretty good job of capturing an American atmosphere, quite amazing considering the times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After out of town killers come into a small community to kill a garage mechanic/former boxer nicknamed "the Swede", an insurance investigator pieces together the crime--and the victim's reluctance to run when warned of his impending death. Gripping film noir, expanded from Ernest Hemingway's short story, is often misrepresented as the first of its kind when the genre (and these stylized characters) had been kicking around cinema for at least 10 years. Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner turn in star-making performances, though the seasoned character actors in the lesser roles are often just as good or better. Screenplay credited to Anthony Veiller, however both John Huston and Richard Brooks worked extensively on it. The melodramatic music by Miklós Rózsa and the striking cinematography by Woody Bredell both compliment the film tremendously. Remade in 1964 with Lee Marvin and Angie Dickinson, in what was meant as a TV feature but instead was released to theaters. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two hit men bump off unresisting victim Ole "Swede" Anderson (Burt Lancaster, terrific in his film debut) without a hitch. Shrewd and persistent insurance investigator Jim Reardon (an excellent performance by Edmond O'Brien) decides to pursue the case and untangles a complex web of crime and trickery that leads to the lovely, yet lethal Kitty Collins (ably played to the irresistibly sultry hilt by a ravishing Ava Gardner).Director Robert Siodmark, working from a crafty and compelling script by Anthony Veiller, not only relates the gripping and intricate story at a steady pace and stages several action set pieces with breathtaking skill and precision, but also does a masterful job of crafting an extremely dark, tense, and brooding fatalistic atmosphere where almost everyone is crooked and practically nothing is initially what it seems to be. The super acting by the top-rate cast keeps this movie humming, with especially stand-out contributions from Albert Dekker as fearsome ringleader Big Jim Colfax, Sam Levene as helpful and streetwise cop Lt. Sam Lubinsky, Vince Barnett as petty thief Charleston, Virginia Christine as the sweet Lily Harmon, Jack Lambert as vicious hoodlum 'Dum-Dum' Clarke, Jeff Corey as doomed junkie Blinky Franklin, and, best of all, Charles McGraw and William Conrad as the splendidly mean and menacing killers Al and Max. Elwood Bredell's sumptuous black and white cinematography provides a beautifully moody look and boasts a few striking unbroken crane shots. The robust score by Miklos Rozsa hits the stirring spot.

From now its up to life insurance investigator to trace the story back in flashbacks, talking to everybody who might have known Lancaster and slowly trough all these stories and memories we get more or less clear picture why was Lancaster killed and why he never even resisted his murder. Its impossible not to feel sorry for Lancaster who was basically a good guy with lots of bad luck, he never had a chance involving himself with this crowd. There is a lot of strong supporting characters, notably Vince Barnett (ex prison cell mate) and stunning Ava Gardner as gangster moll who double crosses everybody and watches Lancaster like a black spider.</fullReview>

When it becomes apparent that he isn't coming they head off to where he is living. One of the diner customers runs ahead to warn him but he has no intention of running or fighting back and is gunned down in his bed minutes later! The local police aren't too interested but insurance man Jim Reardon is curious and starts asking questions that lead us to discover why The Swede was murdered and who sent the two killers.We learn that he was a boxer who had to quit when he broke his right hand. His life goes wrong when he meets femme fatale Kitty Collins; he immediately falls for her and even does time in prison to protect her. Once out he gets involved with a robbery and it looks as if he double crossed his associates and took the $250,000 stolen? a certain motive for murder; Reardon isn't so sure though and continues digging.This film gripped me from the start; the two killers' behaviour in the diner is genuinely threatening; there is a real sense of menace and when they kill The Swede it is a real shock? after all he is played by Burt Lancaster who gets top billing! Of course that isn't the last we see of him as much of the story is told in flashback. Lancaster does a solid enough job as The Swede but the real star of the show is Edmond O'Brien who plays Reardon; the character who's investigation drives the story. Ava Gardner is good as Kitty Collins although her role isn't as large as one might expect. The way the story unfolds keeps things interesting even if some of the links are a bit far-fetched? at one point Reardon listens to a delirious dying man who just happens to be talking about the robbery several years previously. Still that is a small quibble about what is otherwise a great film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Man as Much Sinned Against as Sinning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burt Lancaster was an actor who succeeded in reinventing himself more than once in the course of his long and distinguished career. In the fifties he was mostly seen as the hero of action-adventure films, many of them making use of his athletic and acrobatic talents. From about 1960 onwards he became the social conscience of Hollywood, appearing in many films with a social message, often one in line with his own left- wing political convictions. In the early part of his career in the late forties, however, he appeared in a number of films noirs, including "Sorry, Wrong Number" and "The Killers", his screen debut. The film is, officially, based upon a story by Ernest Hemingway, but Hemingway's story is a very short one, with little plot in the normal sense of that term, and the film adds a great deal of material not found in the original. Two hit men arrive in a small New Jersey town looking for a gas station attendant named Pete Lund. Although Lund is warned of their arrival and of their intentions, he makes no attempt to flee and is shot dead. The hero of the film is not a police detective but an insurance investigator named Jim Reardon. (The idea of having an insurance man as a main character was doubtless one borrowed from that other great noir, "Double Indemnity"). Reardon is assigned the job of finding the beneficiary of Lund's life policy. This seems a simple task, but Reardon becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth about the dead man's life, a story which is revealed through a lengthy series of flashbacks He discovers that his real name was not Pete Lund but Ole Andreson and that he was a Swedish immigrant. (Hence his nickname of "the Swede"). He was at one time a professional boxer, but his career was cut short by injury, following which he fell into bad company, including a local crime boss, "Big Jim" Colfax. After serving one jail sentence, the Swede is recruited by Colfax for a big payroll robbery. The plot then becomes very complex, revolving around attempts by the gang members to double- cross one another. A complicated plot was a common feature of films noirs, and "The Killers" exhibits some other characteristics frequently associated with the genre, such as the stark black-and-white cinematography of director Robert Siodmak, or the glamorous femme fatale, here played by&nbsp;Ava Gardner. Gardner's character, Kitty Collins, is at one time or another, the girlfriend of both the Swede and&nbsp;Colfax, and betrays, or appears to betray, them both. This was not Gardner's film debut, but it was her first starring role, and the one which did most to establish her in the public mind as a sultry, seductive glamour girl. Like Gardner, Lancaster here shows the talent which would make him a leading name in the cinema. Andreson- the leading character but not the hero- is in many ways a difficult part to play. Although he is a criminal, he is not entirely unsympathetic. He is a once-honest man who drifts into crime, but who never gains anything from his criminal lifestyle and who is betrayed by both his associate Colfax and&nbsp;by Kitty, the woman he loves. The Production Code meant that the script could never expressly indicate sympathy for a criminal,&nbsp;but Lancaster had&nbsp;to imply that the Swede is a man as much sinned against as sinning and someone who deserves the audience's pity as much as their condemnation. Despite the strictures of the Production Code, film-makers were often able to work this type of moral ambiguity into films noirs, many of which featured either flawed heroes (like Bogart's brooding private eyes or Glenn Ford's vengeance-obsessed cop in "The Big Heat") or villains who possessed some redeeming features (as here). This helped to lend such films a greater psychological depth and made them more- sometimes much more- than mere adventure thrillers. "The Killers", in fact, is not really a thriller- the death of its central character in the opening scenes means that there is little suspense as to how it will end. Seen as a psychological crime drama, however, it is a fine one. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why so many think this is a great film. Yes its well made and presented but for me its not quite convincing. Its not really clear why the hero gets into crime, and his obsession with the glamour girl isn't quite convincing either since she doesn't give him a lot of encouragement and certainly not enough to make anybody go to jail for her. The plot structure using rather too many flashbacks to reveal the story is a bit overdone and "bitty". But most of all the dialogue just isn't up to classic noir standards. Basically, nobody says anything much which is stylish or memorable. The Maltese Falcon for example is full of great talk and one liners.Its an enjoyable 40s crime caper but not as special as people say when compared to a film like the Big Sleep or any number of Bogart films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive as well as classic film noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The killers (1946) is a film that has great individual scenes; the early scenes in particular are powerful enough to disturb today. The scene in the diner, when the two killers hired to kill the Burt Lancaster character, are slowly becoming more menacing in their conversation, with themselves and others is breathtaking. When Burt Lancaster's fatalistic character Lund is in his room, awaiting certain death as the killers wait outside his door, you don't want to believe it will happen and when it does, it is a jolt. The main character is not 'supposed' to die so early on, but this is why this film noir is a cut above most others. It allows for a story that reveals itself in flashback, but not clumsy flashback editing, but naturally as individual characters reveal what they know off Lund. The story uses a insurance claims investigator to link all the characters together and the story is eventually revealed as those involved in a payroll robbery end up trying to double cross each other. The rest of the film doesn't quite match the great early scenes, but the film still has the drive of a good solid thriller. Ava Gardner who plays the femme-fatale, does look incredible in this film, and is used to add a layer of moody dangerous glamour that almost seems to belong to a more permissive age. Her part is not just based on appearance and the final scene of her trying to persuade a dying man to clear her, is memorable if a little too obviously contrived to be believable. I probably will watch this film again, in order to follow more closely the plot twists, as well as appreciate the films structure. For a fairly early film-noir this is very good effort, and comfortably up there with the best film noir. If you do like the genre, then I think you will gain additional satisfaction of seeing all the boxes ticked, but done in a smooth, and very interesting way. This is a good film for those may just want to watch a good complex thriller, or for those who want to watch a 'must' see film noir they can tick off their done that seen that list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killers is a high watermark in film noir and Hollywood cinema in general. The opening scene is full of shadows and misty light; metaphors for the film and the plot which only becomes clear when we edge further into the film and by that time we're as trapped as the characters within. We follow an insurance investigator, Jim Reardon (Edmond O'Brien), working on behalf of the Tristate oil company after an employee with life insurance has been killed. Reardon is ambitious, wants to make a name for himself and sees an interesting case begin to unfold that may or may not have a lot of money at the bottom of it. We see the dead man, Pete 'The Swede' Lund played by Burt Lancaster killed in his bed in a small town, Brentwood, New Jersey. He almost wants to die and has resigned himself to this most brutal of ends. Two hit men load him with lead but not before an electrifying scene at a diner where they calmly enquire about Lund and tell the men at the diner they were 'lucky' to avoid being caught in the potential crossfire. This is a key scene in the movie and sets the film up with beautiful deep-focus cinematography and killer dialogue.As Reardon discovers more about Lund's life, for essentially this is a biopic of The Swede, we learn what he does through flashback scenes. Lund was a boxer who never quite made the big time and when he could no longer fight, fell in with a gangster called Jim Colfax. He became Colfax's heavy and when he fell for Kitty Collins (played with suitable vamp by Ava Gardner), he was jailed for three years for covering for her in a stolen jewellery rap. In jail, we see Lund hold on to a handkerchief Collins gave him. It represents her, it represents freedom.At this point in the film, the audience has already seen the plot from three or four different time-frames, and we piece the picture together as if we were the investigator in the movie. Although the film is about the Swede, it is also about a heist and it is this job and its consequences that brings the film together. I always think the greatest heist movie is The Killers, Stanley Kubrick's foray into noir headed by Sterling Hayden but the scene of the payroll robbery in The Killers is just as good - a single shot with voice-over reports the scene and it was a great choice by the director to execute it in this fashion.The final third of the movie cannot be revealed here but it finishes with flawless pacing and acting with a chilling end-scene for one of the characters. Siodmak was to be blacklisted in the McCarthy HUAC trials but not before he made this influential and electric contribution to cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The killers are Charles McGraw (Al) and William Conrad (Max). They arrive in a small town looking for Burt Lancaster (The Swede). They find him and kill him. The rest of the film follows insurance investigator Edmond O'Brien (Jim Reardon) as he unravels the life that 'The Swede' led in an attempt to find out why he was killed. However, he is also putting himself in danger....The killers appear in the first 15 minutes and the final 15 minutes and they are worth every moment of their screen time. They are clearly an influence on the later 1980's and 1990's gangster films, eg "Good Fellas" where the gangsters in that film improvise scenes with dialogue such as "do you think I'm funny?", "Why are you laughing?", etc...... Well....."The Killers" does it first.The bulk of the story is told in flashback as we are introduced to different characters and watch different segments that help to provide a complete picture. There are numerous different flashback episodes. It's a device that could be very annoying and confusing but the film manages to get away with it. There are a couple of dumb things about the film - Burt Lancaster being called 'The Swede' is one. Another is Burt's appallingly creepy staring at Ava Gardner (Kitty) when they first meet. What a letch. Not at all cool. Maybe that's how things worked in the gay community back in those days but Burt needed to come away from that scene and he doesn't pull it off in those first scenes with Ava.Overall, the film is very good with an excellent cast and many memorable scenes thanks to the cast, lighting and direction, eg, the whole opening section that lasts for a quarter of an hour. The story keeps you guessing and there is a twist at the end that you won't guess. Clever use is also made of a dying man's ability to testify. Poor Burt's character got a real bum deal in this film. Definitely worth seeing again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Film Noir Style Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a is very good film noir type detective story. Only the Detective is actually an Insurance Investigator. Burt Lancaster plays the Swede who is murdered in the first reel of the film. Then Reardon, the insurance investigator,)Edmund O'Brien shows up to investigate the murder. When I saw this film, it had a feel of another film I had recently viewed. Ava Gardener plays the femme fa tale in this movie, the woman Swede loved &amp; the woman that would double cross him. Part of the main lynch pin in this movie is a robbery involving $250 thousand dollars &amp; what happened to the money. Watching O'Brien put together what happened with the gang &amp; the pieces of why Swede was cut down is very entertaining.While this is based upon a Hemmingway short story, only the early part of the film is the story. The rest is cobbled together by some other screen writers including one writer who did the script for another Ava Gardener film a few years later, his last script, The Night of The Iguana where she starred with Richard Burton. That one is based on a Tennesee Williams play.I got a feel of the same writer while watching how this film runs. While there are major differences, the feel of the two films being written by the same writer is here. This one plays a little better than the other film &amp; it is a different story. It is said this was Hemingways favorite film of his short stories. I found it easy to see why.If you like film noir, this movie is a must see. Lancaster dominates the film even though he is dead. O'Brien is dandy, and in the cast in a minor role is William Conrad (TV's Cannon later in his career). The film is structured in a series of flash backs, but it is still easy to follow. That might have to do with John Huston working on the written script as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard about this movie for years and finally got a chance to watch it this afternoon. Excellent in every sense of the word. Many movies made this many years ago have an out of date feel to them. This movie is fast paced and tension filled from the get go. It has an excellent structure using the flashback technique to maximum effect. It keeps you guessing as each flashback, told from the point of view of a different character, gives you another piece to the jigsaw puzzle. I heard that this was the first adaptation of a Hemingway story for the movies that he was pleased with. The first 20 minutes are very faithful to the Hemingway story and the rest was written specifically for the screen. But the screenwriters did an excellent job keep the tone and mystery of the original short story. Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner are at top form. The director uses them wisely. Building up their entrances, having them smolder in front of the camera for a scene or two, and then keeping them out of the action for long stretches so that your always waiting for them to appear again, stepping into their key light and delivering a few pungent lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Swede</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Son of Dracula" director Robert Siodmak, who emigrated from Germany after Joseph Goebbels drove him out of the Fatherland, made a specialty of what French film theorist Nino Frank called 'film noir.' These gritty, black &amp; white melodramas usually occurred in an urban setting and involved unsavory criminal figures as well as law enforcement personnel in one capacity or another. Women?designated as femme fatales--often lured men to their doom like the sirens did to sailors in ancient Greek myths. Although some scenes took place during daylight hours, most film noir thrillers transpired after dark. Metaphorically, film noir involved flawed protagonists suffering from some psychological ailment. Siodmak's "The Killers" epitomizes vintage film noir. "Black Friday" lenser Woody Bredell captures the dark look of film noir and Siodmark incorporates several mirror image scenes as they depict the solution to a mysterious robbery and the demise of all the conspirators."The Stranger" scenarist Anthony Veiller, along with John Huston and Richard Brooks (neither received credit for their contributions), adapted Ernest Hemingway's famous short story that Scribner's Magazine had published in its March 1927 issue. Siodmak and his scribes kept most of the short story intact. The short story dealt with two gunmen who occupied a Midwestern dinner in a small town and waited to kill a prizefighter named 'Swede' Anderson. Undoubtedly influenced by the narrative flashbacks in "Citizen Kane," the filmmakers forge the remainder of this concise 103 minute film with flashbacks galore as various individuals discuss their relationship with a curious lone wolf insurance investigator who cannot get over the fact that the Swede let the killers' ice him with trying to stop them. The investigator runs down every lead and winds up solving a 6 year old robbery and recovers a portion of the loot."The Killers" opens after dark as two gunsels in fedoras and trench coats, Max (William Conrad) and Al (Charles McGraw), cruise into the cozy hamlet of Brentwood, New Jersey, check out the Tri-States G as Station and then step over to Henry's lunch counter a little before 6 PM when supper is served and set up to ambush to kill 'Swede' Anderson. The diner owner warns them that the 'Swede' doesn't always dine out and if he doesn't show at 6 PM then he isn't going to show. The gunmen leave Henry's dinner and he unties his black cook and a customer, Nick Adams. Adams (Phil Brown) works with the Swede at the gas station. Henry sends Nick off to warn the Swede (Burt Lancaster making his film debut) before the gunmen can find him. Nick warns the Swede, but the Swede refuses to flee. "I once did something bad," he explains to Nick. Later, Max and Al break into his room and shoot the Swede eight times. All we see is the flash of their firearms barking off-camera as they gun him down.Riordan (Edmond O'Brien of "DOA") investigates claims for an insurance company. He learns that the Swede left $2,500 to a beneficiary. Riordan questions Nick about the Swede. The flashbacks begin with Nick's story about the Swede meeting an out-of-town motorist who makes him so queasy that he takes a day off of work and lies in the darkness of his boarding house. Initially, Riordan's boss, R.S. Kenyon (Donald MacBride of "Room Service"), considers it a nickel and dime case and wants Riordan on another case. Riordan convinces Kenyon to give him more time. Riordan calls on Philadelphia detective Lt. Sam Lubinsky (Sam Levene of "Golden Boy") who not only grew up with the Swede but later arrested him for theft and sent him to prison for three years. Riordan attends the Swede's funeral that Lubinsky and his wife, Lilly Harmon Lubinsky (Virginia Christine of the Folgers Coffee commercials), and asks about another funeral guest. Charleston (Vince Barrett of "Scarface") shared a prison cell with the Swede for two years. He tells Riordan his side of the story. In the flashback, Charleston contacts the Swede as soon as he got out of prison about a job. The Swede joins the ring of criminals led by 'Big' Jim Colfax (Albert Dekker of "The Wild Bunch"), a trigger-happy goon, Dumb Dumb Clarke (Jack Lambert of "Vera Cruz"), and Blinky Franklin (Jeff Corey of "True Grit").Riordan learns that Colfax, Clarke, Franklin and the Swede robbed the Prentiss Hat factory from a single lead, a green silk bandana with an Irish harp on it. An incredulous Kenyon reads about the robbery. While Kenyon reads about the robbery on the soundtrack, Siodmak presents the robbery in a single take with a crane shot. Clearly, Siodmak knew his craft to pull off this complicated camera movement. This scene exemplifies Siodmak's finesse with the mise-en-scene. Touches like this one elevate "The Killers" and make it look better than it convoluted story. Indeed, Veiller, Huston, and Brooks expand the scope of the action, going back seven years to depict the Swede's victories and successes. Usually, the Swede lost. He goes soft on a dame, Kitty (Ava Gardner of "Whistle Stop") and takes a fall for her so that she won't land in prison. The remainder of "The Killers" deals with caper that Big Jim cooks up. When the Swede joins them, he is surprised to see Kitty as Big Jim's squeeze. Later, Big Jim and the Swede scrap over a card game. Big Jim hates the Swede and tries to cut him out of the robbery. The Swede trumps him because Kitty tells him about the new rendezvous and he swipes the $250-thousand from Colfax, Clarke, and Blinky."The Killers" qualifies as a top-notch film noir caper. Burt Lancaster became a star as did his co-star Ava Gardner. The irony is the Swede never had a chance with Kitty. He took a dive for her and she still tricked him. The theme of fate pervades "The Killers." The Swede knows he'll never escape either fate or the gunsels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should belong to any '40s Hollywood cinema top ten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The foremost quality of THE KILLERS is its immense poetry, obvious from the first scene, the arrival of the two murderers and their talk with the folks in the small diner; that charm born out of poetry, the very assured taste and the exciting gusto and also the noble smoothness of its syncopated and fractured, perforated storytelling. The poetry pervades and nurtures everything in Siodmak's bleak thriller. It's in the atmosphere, the cinematography, the smoothness and fluidness, the storytelling, the pace, the very content ?. It melted my heart.Siodmak's THE KILLERS has or is exquisite cinematography, pretty good performances too and a rousing score, but firstly atmosphere and the architectures of light, exquisite compositions, awesome sets, the right cast, a top movie from perhaps the top decade of Hollywood's cinema; the cast, the score I mentioned only in passing?but they deserve more. THE KILLERS has an inner elegance and quality, a smoothness and naturalness seldom seen; one of the very best American movies. Siodmak does not exploit the noir genre?he merely handles it exquisitely, attentive to the content as well as to the form, hence his movie is not a mere noir exercise, heartless and exhibiting cold virtuosity?but a lyrical piece worth any movie buff's time ?; it ought to be one of those inspirational, career deciding movies. Very good?I only wish they adapted Faulkner that well too ?.In THE KILLERS O'Brien looks a bit like a Bogart impersonator?the expression, the haircut, the smile, the outlook ?. In this movie they're pretty all actors deserving being seen.'The Citizen Kane of crime movies', wrote, inspired, Eddie Muller; he's right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killers(1946) is a tragic tale that flashes back into the things that led to the main character's murder at the beginning of the movie. The movie is an extension of the short story by Ernest Hemingway which was about ten to tweleve pages. Ava Gardner is just alluring and cool as the double crossing femme fatal, Kitty Collins. The Killers(1946) would be remade twice in 1958 as a short film by Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky and in 1964 by Don Siegal. The story's flashback is structured in the same manner as Citizen Kane(1941). The Killers(1946) is a feature that is an example of the excellent b movie genre that was at its hayday during the 1940s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an almost perfect film noir, starting out near the end and flashbacks its broody way through a labyrinth of stories from the various participants of the drama. Along with Double indemnity, The Big Sleep, Build My Gallows High and a few others it's textbook stuff, high entertainment and almost high Art.Two burly thugs with strange senses of humour show up in a small town intent on killing someone they didn't know as part of their job. Burt Lancaster is the guy with the murky past who puzzlingly and philosophically resigns himself to his impending doom, but ends up being shot to bits and pretty cut up about it along with his insurance company who send investigator Edmund O'Brien to unravel the mystery. And it takes some unravelling during the series of short flashbacks as he gets to the truth, from a fine collection of character actors expertly directed by Robert Siodmak to a typically stirring and inventive score by Miklos Rozsa. The production values were also skyhigh, the photography brilliant and atmospherically monochrome. I thought Jeff Corey was perfect as usual in his supporting role, but everyone was very good ? Ava Gardner could maybe have done with a little longer screen time during the picture so as to underline the denouement for the femme fatale - but nothing matters much as everything works so well anyway.Favourite bits from so many: the tense opening scenes that hook you in so easily; the ballet-like scene in the restaurant where Lancaster takes the rap for stealing Gardner's jewel; Vince Barnett and Lancaster discussing the heavens; the big payroll heist ? made to feel like a voice-over newsreel showing how easy it is (sometimes!) to rob a candy store; the killers violent but brief re-appearance in the bar ? don't blink! It's a film which although obviously made a couple of generations ago still feels if not looks modern to me, and if you can jettison any prejudices and preconceptions it's still a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking Death In The Face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often praised as quintessential film noir, "The Killers" holds up well as an absorbing, existential murder-mystery in its own right. It asks the question what value a man's life has, after that man is gone, and suggests it is well over a $2,500 life insurance claim.Ole "the Swede" Andreson (Burt Lancaster) is already lying on his back when we first meet him, waiting for the hearse. Warned he is being sought by a pair of hardened criminals, he seems barely interested. A few moments later, Lancaster's film debut comes to a sudden end, at least in real time. Flashbacks carry us the rest of the way."I don't want to know what they look like," he tells the guy with the warning. "I'm through with all that running around."The rest of the film is devoted to the investigation of insurance detective Jim Riordan (Edmond O'Brien), who learns who the Swede was mixed up with and how it sped him to his doom. Riordan discovers a green handkerchief emblazoned with harps, ("angels play 'em") and figures how the Swede was played himself by femme fatale Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner).The existential nature of the film is made clear early and often, in the Swede's acceptance of his doom, in the ink-stain-like lighting design, and in the gallows humor of the two men who fix to blast the Swede into eternity."He never had a chance to do anything to us," one of them tells a luncheonette owner. "He never even seen us.""He's only going' to see us once," the other killer says.The doomy mood is so pervasive it seems no one has a chance in this film. People face death so much its like Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal," except no one has time for chess. But there's also an odd Christian message buried in the subtext. A cleaning woman stops Swede from killing himself by pleading with him so as to "sleep in consecrated ground," and later, we hear one of the culprits get told, while trying to get someone else to take the fall, "don't ask a dying man to lie his soul into hell."It's a strange movie for that, and other intriguing things as well. Based on an Ernest Hemingway short story, it quickly wanders off into its own territory by building out a story of multiple perspectives that fits together only for Riordan and the viewer's sake. I don't think "The Killers" is hard to follow at all, just a bit complicated in places where it works rather well.Riordan's actual mission is not exactly understandable. He's congratulated at film's end for having reduced the basic rate of the Atlantic Insurance Co. by one-tenth of a cent. But we care about what happens, and for that, the bringing of "The Killers" to justice feels a bit sunnier by its conclusion.There's another film version of the Hemingway short, made in 1964, which is nearly as good, albeit not as film noir but rather pulp fiction. What this version of "The Killers" has is magnificent scenics, a gripping story, and a firm command of the material by director Robert Siodmak which never lets you go from the first frame to the last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly mugs and a pretty face. And a classic genre movie worth its weight in bullets.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killers is classic film noir. A gripping thriller from start to finish. The elements are so clearly defined it also makes an ideal study sample.Burt Lancaster has his debut role but fails to survive his first scene. Unfortunate, apparently, as he spent months before shooting training with a champion boxer. But happily he is reprised in (eleven) flashbacks. So we can work out why he ends up at the wrong end of ten bullets.But the story isn't about that. True to noir, it turns with seductive femme fatale Ava Gardner as its axis. This torrid temptress is Kitty Collins. At a piano. And for added value, Ava sings the song herself. (A beautiful number called, The More I Know of Love.) Kitty know more about that and everything else. A sad reflection on the male punch bags involved. We too know she's bad news. But hell. Her charisma fills the screen to suck us in like cigarette smoke.Lancaster is a garage attendant. Ex garage attendant. Called Olé. Or the 'Swede'. Or Pete Lunn. He used to be a boxer. Olé/Swede/Pete leave life insurance money to an Irish chambermaid who barely remembers him. Private Dick work is legged by Jim Reardon (Edmund O'Brien), an overly-motivated insurance investigator. And if Reardon had met Kitty earlier in the movie he might even have fallen for her himself. The policeman's a nice guy married to Olé/Swede/Pete's ex-girlfriend. But that isn't why Swede gets suicidal. And somewhere there's a heist . . .Our eponymous killers are classic Ugly Mugs. They set the tone of the film early on and re-enter near the end. Tension is knife-edge and non-stop. The 'clue' is a green handkerchief with gold harps, wafted temptingly to the audience long before we have a chance of making sense of it.It has been very fashionable to describe femme fatales as 'liberating' or 'empowering' to women. Indeed, they empowered a number of good actresses in need of roles. And The Killers is set in the late forties, post World War II, womens' lib and film noir hay-day. But the 'liberated' femme fatale is really a sad reflection on mens' inability to face facts (including their own constitution). For women, it is a pathetic and cornered Last Stand. Kitty, like most trapped pussy-cats, pretends to be agreeable before her malicious pounce. She is neither genuinely romantic nor truly sexual, but sordid and bestial. A cardboard pretender. Her 'weapon' is the eroticised fantasy of the sexually frustrated male. She looks the part of a liberated woman but it is only an act.Swede's girlfriend is pleasant and puritanical. Her 'chaste woman' persona, ill-judged. It increases the frustration of the male - who is then more vulnerable to attack. When Kitty 'pounces' she has the trappings of what a self-made woman might want ? looks, career, good taste, social skills, a mind of her own. But they are trappings (except for the looks) and illusory. The femme fatale suborns in order to better herself. Like a pickpocket stealing jewels to save mom from poverty.If we compare Swede and Kitty to the protagonists of Casablanca, for instance . . . The Casablanca femme fatale, like Kitty, seeks to entangle a man by using a phantasm of their lost romance. Bogarde, arguably, sees through it. He overcomes his own weakness and hence her power over him. (At worst, he sacrifices himself rather than being sacrificed.) Kitty's self-estimation is summed-up in a junkie-like admission. "I'm poison . . . to myself and everybody around me! I'd be afraid to go with anyone I love for the harm I do to them! I don't care harming him!" But there is no strong Bogarde to save her from herself. She goes the way of most of her kind, restoring male hegemony as retribution nears.Two-faced to the end, she proclaims, "I know when I'm beaten. I'm fighting for my life, not Kitty Collins' life, but mine." Sad. And then worse, "Even the old Kitty Collins never sang," she says. (I think she holds a tune quite well actually. Just as long as there's a man at the piano.)The Killers was a B-movie given prestige treatment by Universal. This at a time when the studio was roughing it financially. Somehow it hits on redeeming qualities in abundance. The script isn't that memorable, and precise mise-en-scene leaves small room for actors to make mistakes or shine. But the paraphernalia boast the hallmarks of a classic. High contrast, low-key lighting, genre-perfect characters and plot, a claustrophobic sense of gloom from which we want to break out. (Ironically, one of the most uplifting scenes - and the most unrealistic - is set in a prison.) As with any good thriller, sexual shenanigans in The Killers are not shoved down our throat. They are used like red wine in a rich meat sauce.Tight editing is impressive. He would miss the Oscar, but Editor Arthur Hilton still gets an extra credit towards the end of the film - on a poster near a nightclub. It modestly proclaims, "Sir Arthur Hilton presents..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triple Dekker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who had read Hemingway's short story before it was even optioned as the basis of a movie will be acutely aware that this is actually TWO movies; the first lasts barely a reel and ends, as did the story, with the two hit men acing The Swede but no one, including the reader, is any the wiser about who put a contract out on the Swede and why whilst the second 'invents' a plausible back-story. Not surprisingly this took some doing so although Tony Veiller had a decent enough CV he was probably glad of the uncredited help of Richard Brooks and John Huston (he obviously hit it off with Huston because he worked with him on Moulin Rouge and Night Of The Iguana) both, of course, writer-directors. It was almost inevitable that the 'invention' turned out to be a caper involving both double and triple crosses that subsequently led back to Albert Dekker rather than Ava Gardner as we had been conned into believing. Siodmak finally came into his own - in terms of his career in the US - with this film which was shot more or less back-to-back with another masterpiece The Spiral Staircase and both films featured exceptional acting talent; George Brent, Dorothy McGuire and Ethel Barrymore comprised a formidable parlay in Staircase whilst The Killers featured not only strong leads in Burt Lancaster, Ava Gardner and Eddy O'Brien but also top-of-the-line support from the likes of Albert Dekker, Sam Levene, Jeff Corey, Donald McBride, Charles McGraw and William Conrad. Siodmak tells his story fluidly with minimal 'expressionistic' touches (arguably reserving those for Staircase) and allows the pace of the story to dictate the style. O'Brien, a fine Oscar-winning actor, plays what amounts to the male lead in a subdued fashion possibly realizing after a couple of days that his normal 'virile' style would be eclipsed by Lancaster's natural animal vitality. Whichever way you slice it this is a helluva movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I did something wrong, once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Showing up at Henry's Diner in little Brentwood NJ. these two strangers Max &amp; Al, William Conrad &amp; Charles McGaw, make no bones to who they are professional hit-men and whom their looking for this big guy called Pete "The Swede" Lunn, Burt Lancaster, a gas station attendant in town. Working over the diner manager George, Harry Hayden, and his cook Sam, Bill Walker, and a customer Nick Adams, Phil Brown, they get all the information that they were looking for and head to this rooming house where Lunn is staying at. Nick who works with Pete the "Swede" Lunn at the gas station runs over to warn him that these two guys are out looking to gun him down only to get this cryptic response from a both tired and defeated Lunn: "I did something wrong once". Within minutes after Nick leaves he's blown away by the two gunmen.The brutal and, what at first seemed like, unknown reason in the murder of Pete Lunn would have ended right there and then. But something unexpectedly come up that in the end would not only lead to Lunn's killers but the reason he was murdered and even more important who was behind his murder, a big time hood named Big Jim Colfax ,Albert Daaker. What was to tie all the loose strings together in Pete Lunn's murder was a $2,500.00 insurance policy that he took out six years ago with Mary Ellen Daugherty, Queenie Smith, as the sole beneficiary.With insurance investigator Jim Riondon, Edmond O'Brien, checking out all the leads in Lunn's life and murder he finds that Lunn was actually an ex-prizefighter named Ole Andersen. Lunn/ Andersen got mixed up with the wrong crowd, the Big Jim Colfax Mob, who were responsible for the daring July 20, 1940 robbery of the Prentiss Hat co. that netted them over $250,000.00. Andersen was madly in love with Big Jim's girl, or unknown to him at the time wife, the beautiful Kitty Collins, Ave Gardner, whom he previously spent three years in prison by him foolishly taking a shoplifting rap for; Doesn't love make people do wild and crazy things.It turns out that the Prentess job turned out to be a triple double-cross by***SPOILER ALERT*** Colfax and his moll Kitty Collins setting up the big poor and lovesick lug, Andersen, into double-crossing his and Colfax's fellow crooks Dum Dum &amp; Blikny, Jack Lambert &amp; Jeff Corey. This whole set-up was for Andersen to unknowingly take the blame with Kittly playing his accomplice. Later after the double-cross When Andersen thought he was about to be on his way out of the country, and married, with Kitty he himself was screwed. As Kitty took off with the stolen cash and went back with it to her husband Colfax. The now double-crossed Andersen becomes a marked man by his former fellow crooks, Blikny &amp; Dum Dum, for himself double-crossing them. This turned out to be the double-cross to end all double-crosses with the double-crossed Andersen being the targeted fall guy!It was no secret, after we found out about his past, that Ole Andersen was almost happy to get it from the two hit-men since he was already a beaten and broken down man with nothing to look forward in life. The rest of the movie "The Killers" has to do with investigator Riordon and the dead Andersen's friend Phillie policeman Let. Sam Lubinsky, Sam Levene, tracking down who ordered his murder and the killers, Max &amp; Al, who executed it.A bit complicated but still very effective film-noir crime drama with Burt Lancaster in his first movie, that had him in the staring role, appearance that made Lancaster a star overnight. There's also the film the sultry and utterly beautiful Ava Gradner as the femme fatal who like her co-star became an overnight sensation becoming one of the most sought after actresses in both Hollywood and Europe for the next twenty or so years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now We Understand Sinatra's Obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ava Gardner oozes sex in this thriller, as Angie Dickerson did in the 1964 update. When you first see her, vamping over a piano, you understand why Burt Lancaster just completely ignores his sweet date. And he's a really nice, if estupido, guy!! I very much wish that some internal conflict might have been shown, when he immediately without hesitation falls into her invitation to join the gang..no moral conflict whatsoever. The fight scenes in the beginning make you understand that Burt's brain is somewhat softened by the traumas he's endured. The hard-heartedness of his trainer and 'owner' are underscored beautifully when his broken knuckles are discovered. You'll know why I thought of Mohammed Ali when you see this. The only other place you have to suspend disbelief is when the head of the gang drives into Brentwood, where Burt has escaped to ...supposedly with the loot from the heist. There Burt is, washing the crook's windshield and making no attempt to escape discovery. It would be more rational if he, on the off chance he HASN'T been recognized, would have developed his stomach ache right then and there, and exited. But, as Hemingway makes perfectly clear, he was already dead and just looking for a place to lie down. He had already done 3 years in stir (how easy it is to fall into the criminal patois, after seeing this movie) on a bum rap, taking the fall for her. Now, he believes that she wants to run away with him and steals all the money for 'them' from the other gang members after the heist. You'll have to see the movie to get the rest, as I don't want to spoil it.All the killers are completely believable, and the insurance investigator (Pat O'brien) doing a 'Sam Spade' was credible. The acting was great, yet it was one of the first movies for both Burt Lancaster AND Ava Gardner. See both of "The Killers" together. Lee Marvin will help you understand Burt Lancaster's apathy toward his own murder. The fall-from-the-window ploy is in both, but used for two entirely different purposes. A great double feature!!! Amazingly, the movies, using the same plot, are very different.  It's hard to believe that anyone could be so gullible in the cynical 90's, but the combination of Ava Gardner plus the IQ of the typical boxer, as portrayed by Burt Lancaster, is sufficient to make a believer of you.Now to read again "The Killers" and find out how close to the actual story both films were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Killer Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrific film noir from a period when it seemed every other movie being made was a film noir. But "The Killers" deserves its reputation as one of the best examples of the genre.The film is based on one of the only pieces of writing Ernest Hemingway wrote that I actually liked, a short story in which a man in a diner overhears two hit men talking about a murder. For the film, the screenwriters fill out the story, adding narrative threads and characters to create one of your typically twisted and intricate hard-boiled thrillers. But what stands out about this film is not its story, but rather its style and its cast.Robert Siodmak directs with a fluid camera that doesn't waste a single shadow thrown by the moody lighting. And he's got a great cast to work with: Burt Lancaster, Ava Gardner and Edmond O'Brien. The more I see of Lancaster, the more I think he was a very gifted and even versatile actor. He's not asked to do a whole lot here, and it's a role any number of tough guy types from the same period could have handled just as well, but he gets the job done. Ava Gardner, like so many beauties from those days, couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, but these movies only demand that their leading ladies have looks and allure, and she's got both of these. Edmond O'Brien is really the stand out. He was a character actor who looked a lot like Humphrey Bogart, but never found his way to the leading man parts. He's in fine form here and carries the film.A lot of fun--one of those movies you want to watch again to pick up all the great lines you missed the first time around. And film music buffs will instantly recognize the main theme.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Super But Notable For A Few Things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always thought the best part of this film was the opening scene in the diner with two of the toughest guys in the film noir genre: Charles McGraw and William Conrad. After that, it went downhill but is still quite passable as a film noir.It's also nice to see Ava Gardner in her prime. Take a look: there is a woman with some true sex appeal! Also fun to admire was the cinematography, which usually is good in film noirs.This was Burt Lancaster's first major role and he looks and sounds different from the Lancaster most of us know through his great films of the 50s on up. Most of the story is told in flashback as an insurance salesman (Edmund O'Brien), who is the real star of the film turns detective in trying to find out why "Swede Anderson" (Lancaster) had been murdered. The story is okay, not super but worth watching for the Ava and the photography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hit men kill an unresisting victim (Burt Lancaster), and investigator Reardon (Edmond O'Brien) uncovers his past involvement with beautiful, deadly Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner).The Siodmak brothers never get enough respect. In this case, I would be referring to Robert Siodmak, who directed this picture for Universal. While it may not have been the first film noir, it is a good example of how the genre works. Anonymous killers, questionable situations, and the stark shadows of black and white. (Noir can be in color, but it rarely works as well.) For Burt Lancaster fans, this also happens to be his first role, one he hits out of the park. I am not that familiar with his work, I freely admit, but if this is an example, he has a lot of potential and I should seek out other hidden gems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superb crime-drama. Clever, original, complex (but not overly so) plot, based on an Ernest Hemingway short story. Well directed by Robert Siodmak.Performances are top-notch. Burt Lancaster, in his debut role, plays the easily-lead dumb boxer, Swede, to a T. Edmond O'Brien is solid as Reardon, the insurance investigator. The performance that stands out, however, is that of Ava Gardner. Surely one of the most beautiful women to ever grace the silver screen, she does not disappoint here. The fact that the movie is in black and white doesn't understate her beauty, and she plays the femme fatale perfectly. An absolute classic, and no doubt a movie that inspired people like Scorsese and Tarantino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not too hard to find a "Noir" with a double-cross . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . or two, but THE KILLERS throws in a triple- or quadruple-cross (depending on how attentively the viewer is watching). Famously plagiarized by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa for his derivative 1950 offering RASHOMON, this film is the MOBY DICK of America's private eye genre. As "Jim Riordan," actor Edmund O'Brien plays the Captain Ahab role, and his white whale-like quest is the $254,912 Prentiss Hat of Hackensack company's payroll stolen six years earlier. Furthermore, Jim is not even a licensed P.I., but rather an insurance claims investigator (like Fred MacMurray in DOUBLE INDEMNITY). Still, Jim's able to make a cop HIS sidekick, as he tracks down the elusive Mystery of the Green &amp; Gold Bandana. "Kitty is innocent, Kitty is innocent, Kitty is innocent, Kitty is innocent, Kitty is innocent . . . !" serves as a haunting final refrain, as the author of THE KILLERS' original sin protests too much. If cinema actually had had the power to influence Society that the 1940s American movie censors claimed, there would be far fewer of us around today, as any guy exposed to Kitty wouldn't touch women again with a ten-foot pole. But the Baby Boom began with THE KILLERS filling the theaters, proving that film has little, if any, effect on real people's actions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title sounded distinctive enough when I read it in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was rated highly by the critics, and it is based on a short story by Ernest Hemingway, so I hoped for the best. Basically in a small town gas station attendant and ex-prize fighter Ole 'Swede' Andreson (introducing Burt Lancaster) was warned by a co-worker that two hit men, Max (William Conrad) and Al (Charles McGraw), were coming to kill him, but he made no effort to get away and they kill him. Life insurance investigator Jim Reardon (Edmond O'Brien) is assigned to find and give the dead man's insurance to the beneficiary, and along the way he pieces together the story that lead to his killing, as he interviews many friends and associates, and he has help especially from the Swede's longtime friend Police Lieutenant Sam Lubinsky (Sam Levene), in fact the Swede rejected a suggestion by Lubinsky to join the police force. Through flashbacks we see the Swede as a professional boxer with his career cut short by an injury to his right hand, he gets mixed up with Big Jim Colfax (Albert Dekker) and a bad crowd, he starts a relationship with glamorous Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner) after dumping his girlfriend Lilly Harmon Lubinsky (Virginia Christine), and when he is caught for possessing stolen jewellery he confesses and serves three years in prison. Getting out he is hired by mastermind Big Jim for a robbery, alongside 'Dumb-Dumb' Clarke (Jack Lambert) and Blinky Franklin (Jeff Corey), complications comes when Kitty is revealed as Big Jim's girl, the gang manage to steal $250,000, the rendezvous point is burned down however and the Swede is the only one not told where to meet instead, he is being double-crossed, so he takes all the money himself, meets Kitty in Atlantic City, and then gets away. Back in the present, the whereabouts of the money is unknown, Dumb Dumb even shows up at the Swede's boarded house to find it, but escapes arrest, and Reardon has a plan to catch the guilty party, lying to now successful building contractor Big Jim that Kitty is the guilty one, but when a meeting is set up Max and Al are hired again to try and kill the investigator, but his and Lubinsky were ready for them, and they are killed in an attack instead. Dumb Dumb and Big Jim got into an argument and killed each other before Reardon and Lubinsky got to them, Reardon works out though that the rendezvous point fire was caused by Kitty, who was married to Big Jim, they set up the Swede, and Dumb Dumb found this out too, Big Jim in his dying moments explains he wanted to kill the Swede first as he wanted to stop another gang member finding him and the money, and Kitty is not cleared of any charges as he dies before he say anything about her involvement. Also starring Charles D. Brown as Packy Robinson - Ole's Manager, Donald MacBride as R.S. Kenyon, Phil Brown as Nick Adams, John Miljan as Jake the Rake, Queenie Smith as Mary Ellen 'Queenie' Daugherty, Garry Owen as Joe Smalley, Harry Hayden as George, Bill Walker as Sam, Vince Barnett as Charleston, Jeff Corey as Blinky Franklin, Wallace Scott as Charlie and Gabrielle Windsor as Ginny Bryson. Making his film debut Lancaster is fantastic as the focused victim to the killers, and Gardner is good looking beautiful and being suspicious, I admit what I have written on the story is not all my personal input, I did find a lot of it a little slow and not all that easy to understand, but it had good interesting bits, and I guess I can see moments that would be influential to other filmmakers, it is a worthwhile classic film noir. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Robert Siodmak, Best Writing, Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Miklós Rózsa. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie. It is well acted and has excellent continuity. The cinematography captures the sinister and dark mood of the story. The entire cast is excellent with Edmund O'Brien giving an especially strong performance as an insurance investigator who is on to something big and doesn't give up until the case is solved. For the insurance company, solving the case is not a matter of justice, rather it is a matter of recovering money. The police get involved too, but only peripherally. The hero is the insurance investigator. Burt Lancaster plays a boxer turned gambler turned armed robber, and plays the role well. He is quite believable. He also plays a sap for a woman and that weakness proves to be his undoing. Albert Dekker is excellent as the gangster who almost gets away with murder and robbery. Ava Gardner is beautiful and does a great job portraying a sophisticated gang moll who is as cunning as she is beautiful. The movie starts strongly and then changes into a more conventional crime drama while maintaining a high level of suspense. The film noir style suits this story. The characters are troubled, violent and amoral. The use of flashbacks works well, and all the loose ends are tied together at the end of the story.</fullReview>

The Post-War Genre that Delivered Hard-Boiled, Edgy, Fatalistic Realism for those that Lost Their Innocence on the Battlefields and other War Weary, but Clear Eyed Citizens.This one, along with Out of the Past (1947) and Double Indemnity (1944) are Movies that Solidified the Style and Began and gave a Title (thanks to the French Film Critics) that seem to Manifest Itself rather than be Created.The Opening, in this Crime Story is an Unforgettable, Quintessential, Dark First Act that could be a Primer for all Noir Students. As this Ends and Act Two Begins, the Flashbacks Start and Never Stop (another Film-Noir Staple). Burt Lancaster, in His Film Debut, is Dead On. Ava Gardner's Femme Fatale is Drop Dead Gorgeous. Albert Dekker is Deadly. Edmond O'Brien is the Centrifuge to all this Chaos.Director Robert Siodmak is a Stylist of the First Order and here He Crafted a Low-Key Look and Lighting Style with a Glossy Expressionism. The Miklos Rosa Score is Influential (no credit from TV's long running Dragnet). So this is a Group Effort where all the Elements Blend into a Cohesive work of Art. Essential Viewing for Students of Cinema and Fans of Film-Noir, Crime-Dramas, Thrillers, and just about Anyone who Admires the Art of Cinema.Don Siegel's 1964 Remake while not as Accomplished is a Fine Film in its Own Right and deserves a Look.</fullReview>

This adaptation of a Hemingway story is regarded as one of the great examples of film noir, but the structure of the film is rather clumsy and disjointed. After getting off to an intriguing start, it really bogs down in flashbacks, as O'Brien investigates the murder victim a la "Citizen Kane." There are two curious aspects to Lancaster's film debut: it came at the age of 33 and he gets top billing. Here he shows the tough-guy persona that would be his trademark for decades to come. Gardner is a sultry presence. The final film of Dekker, who plays the heavy here, would turn out to be "The Wild Bunch," co-starring O'Brien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stoic welcome of bullets from the void</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far I recognize three defining moments in film noir. Two are Mabuse films, the first back in 1922. The third is Zapruder's film. There is of course Welles and Kane, but a bit less specifically about noir cosmology. Inbetween Mabuse and Kane, we had the detective film, a writer's conceit.To appreciate what Siodmak missed here, we have to follow this a bit more closely.In all these cases, the mainstays were the presence of a detective, a man investigating 'truth', and life as a chaotic playground of fateful accident. If the noir model is so potent to this day, it's because we're all detectives in life, investigating to the best of our ability the machinations of the world we find ourselves caught in.What mattered in the two Mabuse films was the transition of the villainous mastermind from a person of more or less ordinary manipulation, who can be safely apprehended by police in the end, safely contained by madness and the mind, into a pervasive - ghostly - force of darkness attempting control of the whole of reality. In noir proper, Mabuse is no longer visible and has become what characters inside the films experience as callous whims of a trickster fate.Kane rendered the detective film obsolete overnight; gone was the Holmes type, a master storyteller who hoodwinked the viewer by solving the maddening story with a masterstroke of logic, there was a cheat of course, the whole thing only made sense when the writer told it in the end, in the protracted explanatory denouement. In Kane we followed an ordinary storyteller, a reporter looking for a story that unlocks 'truth' of a person, and suffered repeated frustration; reality was fractured, kaleidoskopic, unmappable, unreliable, obscured by time and emotional beings. Rosebud truth was eventually revealed to the viewer - Welles' sole regret - but not to the writer.So when we finally arrive at something like this, it is important to note that it has all the elements in the right place; iconic Lancaster, iconic Gardner, a great score, lurking shadows, agents of chaos showing up to remove a man from existence, the man stoically welcoming shrapnels from the void.It has overlapping authors vying for control of a nested narrative. Fractured testimonies, including alcohol-fueled memory and deathbed hallucination. The Swede, from his end perceiving that he would have won this round if it was not for money, the betrayal all in the money and a love of mysterious ways. Even deeper inside, two storymakers who have conspired everything between them, everyone else incidental pieces of the puzzle moved by them. There was never love, we come to find. The Swede was trapped in a chimera of desire.An interesting touch is that our man has to lie about testimonies he received - the hotel maid never saw Kitty in the room - in order to push the woman to reveal the agents that reveal the plot.Why I consider this a step back in noir terms, even though a gripping crime film otherwise, is clear causality as the way to navigate the world. Hard logic sees us through to the light of day, an attribute of the caper. The writer is always in control, so there is no fluid sweep to where names shatter and being and dreaming bleed one into the other.I like to think that Lynch saw potential in this. I like to think that it's the Halfway House that we see burning in Lost Highway, once and again in reverse. Why reversed again? But of course we're never sure if it did burn after all or it was only part of the conspirators' story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hemingway and Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To my limited knowledge this is the first of three movies thematically based on the man who is not afraid to die, because he is already dead. The other two are The Killers, 1964 (IMDb rating 7.00) and The Hit, 1984 (IMDb rating 7.00). Those latter ratings are criminally low: both movies are easily comparable with this one (IMDb rating 8.00).Hemingway's story, as a story, is not extraordinary. It is dead simple. There is hardly any plot, hardly any character development, and little description of the setting. Chaos is one theme. Masculinity is another theme. Hemingway is known for the "manly men" in his stories, but in his "The Killers", 1927, the hit men are comical and clownish. Hemingway describes them as the "vaudeville twins". They are quite comical and clownish in this film; and even, up to a point, in the two later versions. I can't remember if I've read Hemingway's original story. I may not have. The three films take the fundamental idea, and round it out, and fill it in. They introduce new characters and plot lines.Killers 1946 has the two most beautiful and handsome actors. Killers 1964 has by far the best hit-man in Lee Marvin. The Hit 1984 is the most mentally stimulating, entertaining and engaging. All three films have very dishy ladies, but 1946 and 1964 are women-hating movies, of the normal noir genre, whereas 1984 is positively female-friendly. Hemingway's story is about men without any women at all.Killers 1946 has a pointless character called Nick Adams, who has almost nothing to do with the plot. This is Hemingway under an alias; a nod in his direction.Hemingway won the Nobel Prize in 1954 and killed himself in 1961. It may be that suicides are not afraid to die since they've decided that they are already dead.I'm not going to give this version more than 7 stars, because the other two versions are sadly under-rated. Let's be fair. "Andersson" is misspelled. This gaffe seems to have been originally committed by Hemingway. The Swede's other name was Nilsson, as well as Lund. Not Nelson. Was the hotel maid beneficiary supposed to be Swedish?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O'Brien's movie, hands down!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people make a big fuss over the Lancaster/Gardner connection in this film almost as if it's the film's main draw or highlight. Granted, it is pivotal in it's importance to the overall story flow and film attractiveness, but I'll take Ed O'Brien's role as the indefatigable insurance detective/claims adjuster as the hallmark centerpiece in this film. His dogged persistence and cunning demeanor let the film take shape and keep the story buzzing along at a good clip with a solid script and story line that Ed metaphorically "eats up". Actually, without that dogged persistence, the story never gets told and all that's left is a routine insurance death benefit payment.Lancaster does very well in his first screen role alongside the seductive Ms. Gardner and is obviously the focal character in this entry, but Mr. Ed is the definitive boss in this one. Furthermore, the whole cast shines in this landmark "film noir" piece, in no small manner propelled by the skillful directorship of Robert Siodmak. Lots of emphatic flashbacks add to the dramatic pace of this clever crime drama.This film, along with "The Big Sleep" and "Out of the Past", ranks as a top entry in the realm of the so-called "film noir" genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neatly unravelled film noir which operates effectively on two separate strands resulting in a balanced, engaging picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killers is a really quite intense, highly charged two-part pot-boiler about a man down and out and winding up with the wrong people, as well as the wrong woman, before suffering a doomed fate as a result of it with one other man attempting to seek out the truth as to what happened in relation to him. The film is a triumph of two separate equilibriums, great tension complimented by an element of sadness infused within one of them; the other having that ability to bring us into the world of a character who's trying to piece together exactly what it is that's going on. Like most of the great crime films from over the years, from Double Indemnity to Snatch. by way of Carlito's Way, some wonderful direction twinned with equally involving storytelling has us close to all but forget about whatever present scenario the leads themselves face and enrapture us with the helmer's filmmaking ability.Its beginnings lie during a dark evening in a remote town located amidst great forestry, two hit men travel by car to track a man known as The Swede; the duo creeping along the deserted streets when out of the car to lengthly shadows and ominous, low and rumbling music courtesy of a Miklós Rózsa score. A scene in a diner tees the film off to a high-flying and gripping start, the dialogue snappy and not at all concerned with advancing the plot as customers and the business' employees are insulted and threatened. Unlike Cronenberg's 2005 film A History of Violence, there is no spur of the moment hero to put things right again; nobody to restore the balance, just a procession of events including concluding in a downcast and defeated lead whom willingly accepts his fate at the hands of these two killing machines.The Swede is called so due to his name, Ole Anderson, of which appears to be of Scandanavian ancestry. He's played, in a debut role, by Burt Lancaster; a one-time boxer turned crook whom went for the cash and went for the girl but in the grander scheme of things ended up with nothing bar the ability to echo the iconic words of Double Indemnity's lead, in that he "didn't get the money and didn't get the woman." Fewer and fewer films in today's modern movie making climate ask the question "Why?", but The Killers is mostly preoccupied with the "why" these hit men were after him than anything else, a separate strand in the present tense involving insurance investigator Jim Reardon (O'Brien) looking into Anderson's insurance that he had following the death and then the piecing together exactly what has transpired.Director Robert Siodmak knowingly and cleverly aligns his audience with Reardon's character when the easier thing to do would be to tell of Anderon's plight as a straight up crime story; his strand consisting mostly of vising people, exchanges, talking heads and flashbacks from other persons whom were more involved with The Swede. In the sense of what makes for spectacle or entertainment, Anderson's grubby journeying from boxing ring to retiree to jail and then out again to commit a robbery only to go on the run sounds like the more alluring tale to Reardon's poking around, and yet the triumph lies in just how much we're brought into Reardon's investigation. Again, the piece produced now in the more modern film making climate would be all too eager to explore this as a stand alone conciet than anything else. It is a mark of Siodmak's confidence in his own direction, and the strength of the story, that The Killers works just as well as it does as one long flashback being told alongside a slower, more observational strand.The rock in Anderson's life eventually rears its head in the form of Ava Gardner's Kitty Collins, an early exchange with our Anderson has her talk distastefully of seeing men pounding on one another when the subject of The Swede's boxing career pops up; an early deception tactic that hints at her true colours when later on it transpires she'd love nothing more than Anderson and the other crooks at one another's throats over the cash following a confusion with the rendez-vous. The film has Lancaster look off screen at her directly after these very early exchanges, and despite other people around him to which his attention would ordinarily be attuned, the film manages to establish here a sense of just how fascinated with her he already is.It is a job involving the thieving of a payroll down at a local factory which kicks everything into action, masterminded by a gangster named Colfax and to be carried out with two other people of whom later enter the fray as the money is still missing following the opening. A scene later on involves Reardon and one of the said crooks in a darkened motel room, the manipulation of light in this scene used to suggest a visual shifting of allegiances or moral codes from within Reardon, as the knowledge of the money being out there and the wanting it for himself becoming more of a prominent thought in Reardon's mind seemingly more evident. This, as a later lie to a police detective he's working with as to how he lost his gun enforcing this notion. Siodmak directs the film with aplomb, his ability to put across a slow burning, unravelling tension as the picture of what happened in the past becomes more and more clearer in Reardon's strand stands tall alongside The Swede's own tale, which mutates fascinatingly into a more punchy and more rapid tale of crime as the heist unfolds and the aftermath spills out into the narrative. His work is complimented by an array of acting performances, some great cinematography and a score of varied tones and genres which culminates in something most certainly worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply just a great film-noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is from the period when film-noir was at its very best. It's a movie with all of the right ingredients, that above all got made very well.Foremost thing that makes this movie a great watch it its story. It got based on an Ernest Hemingway story and it features plenty of great moments and mystery in it. The way the story is being told through flashback techniques works out quite well for the movie and its story and is one of the reasons why the movie works out so well and also original enough within the genre itself.A complaint about the movie would be that it starts to drag a bit after a while. Toward the end it gets a bit harder to keep your full interest but luckily the movie still ends well and not on a downer.One of the things that is also always important for a good film-noir is its overall look and feeling to it. Luckilly "The Killers" have nothing to complain about that. It has some great cinematography. It provides the movie with the right kind of mysterious and tense atmosphere. It's also a movie with a rather good cast, that consist out of actors that you would perhaps not immediately expect to see in a film-noir. It was actually the first time Burt Lancaster appeared in a film-noir and just movie in general but he immediately starts off by playing the lead in it. He simply did a great job, though I suspect he had studied some of his colleagues thoroughly before playing his role. He has a sort of Bogart touch and look over him in this movie.All in all it's a really solid film-noir that is truly recommendable.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I wouldn't want to give away anything to spoil it for someone who hasn't seen it.Mcgraw and Conrad aren't favorites of mine but they were powerful in those 15 minutes and made me wonder...WHAT is going on here?

Let a cornball crime writer give the response......The first time I saw her there was chemistry I was nitro she was glycerine,a slight movement and there would be an explosion.She was special but in the end she was just another broad......The third word to sum up this movie? Aside from O'brien,when thinking of the main characters the first word that comes to mind........SUCKER.</fullReview>

Life isn't worth living for him, so he awaits the inevitable with stoic surrender.Ava Gardner?....her Kitty Kelly is as evil as they come and she moves through this film like the proverbial black cat which can only bring bad luck and destruction to those who cross her path.Edmund O'Brien?....he is the everyman of film and he plays the insurance investigator on a mission with his usual skill.Albert Dekker?.....he is the "big cheese" here and you can just bet he will double cross anyone for anything.Those two consummate bad guys, Charles McGraw and William Conrad (before his TV "Cannon" days)?...they cruise into the small town diner and terrorize the occupants while you never know for sure if those persons will get out alive.This film fleshes out the Hemingway story but yet you don't feel that the additions are extraneous. It's a compelling film told in flashbacks which tie up all the loose ends into one of the great, if not the greatest, noir of that genre. Don't miss it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to figure just how ex-circus acrobat emerged a superstar in his first film. Notice his name's over the title, not a special "Introducing Burt Lancaster," as normally done. Obviously the studio recognized he deserved this billing and gave it to him.Where'd he come from and where'd he get his training? According to his bio, he never studied his craft, opting to teach himself on-the-job.Few actors have enjoyed such above title credit in their first film (Gregory Peck was another, but even he came from the New York stage with formal training).In film after film thereafter Lancaster scored bull's eyes with his naturalistic style of acting.Here, in "The Killers," he's joined with young Ava Gardner, who holds her own co-star billing, and the fine Edmond O'Brien.Miklos Rosza's score enhances this atmospheric production, that was one of 1946's most successful films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE KILLERS opens with what must surely be one of the greatest shots in the history of Cinema: a back-lit diner, just after dark, as two killers (played by William Conrad and Charles McGraw) arrive to murder "Swede" Anderson (Burt Lancaster). And it just gets better from there. In fact, THE KILLERS overall is superior Noir filmmaking, masterfully directed by Robert Siodmak. And who can argue with their choice of femme fatale- the strikingly beautiful Ava Gardner? THE KILLERS is a textbook example of how to adapt a short story for the screen: it logically builds on what Hemingway had to offer, and it never disappoints. Truly exceptional filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expanded Hemingway short story is better on screen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE KILLERS is one of those rare exceptions when Hollywood was able to take an Ernest Hemigway story and turn it into a film superior to the written work. What they did was take the framework of the short story and expand on it with a look at the background of "Swede Andersen" and why he was killed.The film's opening scenes are the most memorable and are essential film noir for those interested in that genre. And aside from the skillful camera-work amid dark shadows and the presence of haunting music from Miklos Rozsa to heighten the intensity, BURT LANCASTER makes his film debut in a striking role as the Swede. We see him waiting in the dark for the killers to arrive. We are introduced to them in a diner scene that starts the story, with WILLIAM CONRAD and CHARLES McGRAW chilling as the hit men on the trail of their victim.The story expansion really works, despite flashbacks within flashbacks which were so common in films of the '40s. The femme fatale requirement is filled by AVA GARDNER as Kitty, a role any glamor girl from the '40s could have played (Veronica Lake, Rita Hayworth, Hedy Lamarr), but Gardner has a striking film presence and, like Lancaster, is cast in a role that could have been tailor-made for her kind of sensuality.Hemingway has been treated with overblown stories on screen (FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, A FAREWELL TO ARMS), but his short story has been turned into a tight, taut and very suspenseful film that should please anyone interested in the film noir of the '40s.Trivia note: Hemingway himself said that of all the films Hollywood made from his stories, this was the only one that he was very proud of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Hemingway short story doesn't show as much as Siodmak's direction and Lancaster's great, flawed protagonist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally, I'm not too big on Ernest Hemingway. Mostly that's to do with a lot of his macho-male-posturing and a lot of his books being sparse but with little substance within it. But The Killers is based on one of his short stories (and those actually aren't *that* bad, some are quite good. So comes this first adaptation of a short story he wrote called 'the Killers', about two hit men who come into town, kill a man, and then the investigation-side comes in to see how 'the Swede' (Lancaster) came into this predicament. From what I heard too, Hemingway's story was even more sparse, with just the killers coming into town section. I saw this film a while ago, but the power of Robert Siodmak's direction and the skill added to the layered script by the writers, not to mention the screen presences of Lancaster and Gardner still stick with me. The story is rather complex as it goes through its flashbacks within flashbacks, of a certain boxer, err 'Swede', and a dame and the insurance investigator trying to put it all together.It's a credit to Siodmak that what I remember most are big scenes and moments; I love when the two killers first go into the little diner in the town, it's a very striking scene with some dark humor and genuine grit. Then when it comes time to the Swede's main scenes, it's even more enveloping. But if anything the way the script is constructed it allows for its stars to get deeper into the characters than might be in a lesser B-movie. It might not be one of the film-noir of the 40s I would rush out and recommend right away; it's not as fire-cracker sharp and impressionable as Doube Indemnity or Gun Crazy or Out of the Past. Yet what does stick in me, the shards of the picture, still do move quite well, with a sense of fatalism, creeping around the bend at times through the potent style of the camera and twists that are taken in never for granted. It's an entertaining piece of dark material. 8.5/10(A-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great opening is let down by an increasingly boring story. This seems to be the norm. It's the opening twenty minutes and some other isolated bits of drama interspersed throughout the film that save it from total failure. You couldn't say too much about how great the opening is. Many individual scenes are great, but there's too much Edmond O'Brien as the determined insurance investigator, and not enough of Charles McGraw, William Conrad, Jack Lambert, Jeff Corey, and the other characters who are part of the gang. The title is THE KILLERS, but the film isn't about them. It's easy to like the film for the fact that it introduced Burt Lancaster. But it's not very gritty or edgy, or even that dark, minus the beginning, and a later scene where Conrad and McGraw are entering the restaurant where O'Brien is, which is worth the wait. Overall, this isn't Siodmak's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film noir based on an Ernest Hemingway short story has two killers(William Conrad and Charles McGraw) arriving in a small town with only one thing to do...kill a gas station attendant named 'Swede' Anderson(Burt Lancaster). After the deed is done insurance investigator Jim Riordan(Edmond O'Brien) is nosing around getting info on Swede's life and ends up uncovering a well planned robbery. Jim Colfax(Albert Dekker)uses Swede in the robbery; but wants to cut him out of a share of the haul and set him up for the fall, because he thinks Swede has a thing going with his girl Kitty(Ava Gardner). Its discovered that in the middle of the complex crime there is enough evidence linking Colfax and Kitty with the murder for hire. This movie is well paced and evocative of the dark dramas turned out in the 1940's. Cinematography and scenery is as outstanding as the acting. Others in the cast: Sam Levene, Jack Lambert, Virginia Christine, Jeff Corey and Vince Barnett.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killer movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great film noir, from its mysterious beginning with two killers casually taking over a cafe to stake out their victim, right through to its "crime doesn't pay" ending with everyone in the gang that committed the big robbery dead and the woman who outlived and outsmarted them all put behind bars.It's a real A to Z plot-line but is just about follow-able despite or perhaps because of the frequent multiple-viewpoint flashbacks which are employed. The camera work and overall direction are both top quality, with lots of imaginative settings, perhaps the best of them being when insurance investigator Edmond O'Brien rendezvouses with dangerous woman Ava Gardner in a bar and they take their seats reflected in an off-centre mirror.Music too is skilfully used to build tension and drama, particularly in the scene where the laconic, near silent killers attempt to slay O'Brien, while the dialogue, if not quite hard- boiled a la Hammet or Chandler, is crisp and to the point. The diminution of O'Brien's investigative efforts to the tiny percentage difference it will make to the company's insurance premium next year is just one example of the down-to-earth realism employed. All of the acting is fine but Burt Lancaster as the all-time loser "The Swede", who "did something wrong once" and Gardner as the femme fatale whose last words to her dying husband are of self-preservation rather than consolation, both in more or less breakthrough roles shine brightest.This is a great example of noir at its best and is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For lovers of film noir, "The Killers" is a highpoint in the affair.This was Burt Lancaster's first movie and is fascinating for that fact alone. He was never an actor who submerged himself totally in his characters in the way that Anthony Hopkins could be Richard Nixon, William Bligh, Hannibal Lecter or Alfred Hitchcock, but his powerful personality and aura of danger made him seem right for all the parts he played. He started his career as he meant to go with raw intensity and a screen presence like no other.Matching him was a young and luminous Ava Gardner. Although "The Killers" wasn't her first movie, this was the one that really announced her arrival. When you watch this film it's easy to see why many contemporaries considered her the most beautiful woman in movies.When a car pulls into a small-town gas station, the driver recognises the attendant who washes his windscreen as Ollie Anderson ? Burt Lancaster's character. Later, two gunmen arrive in town looking for Ollie. Charles McGraw and William Conrad play the gunmen in a memorable sequence set in a diner. Although he is warned of their arrival, Ollie does not attempt to escape and meets his fate with composure ? almost as though it was a relief.Insurance agent, Jim Reardon, played by Edmond O'Brien, investigates the death. He becomes intrigued with the case when he learns how Ollie was resigned to his fate. Edmond O'Brien brings his well-established screen persona to the role. This was a no-nonsense, cynical character that was interchangeable whether he played a cop, a politician or an insurance agent.Reardon learns how Ollie Anderson, a washed-up boxer whose dreams have been shattered along with his hand, became involved with dangerous people and an even more dangerous woman ? Kitty Collins ? played by Ava Gardner. Ollie's death appears to have been brought about by this woman who double-crossed him and stole the money he had in turn stolen from accomplices after a payroll robbery.Reardon tracks down Jim Colfax, played by Albert Decker, the ex-criminal associate of Ollie who planned the robbery. Some of the most powerful scenes in "The Killers" are the confrontations between Ollie and Colfax ? two Alpha males competing for the same woman. When Ollie punches him, Colfax menacingly warns, "The job comes first, but afterwards we'll have business together". The taut script was partly the product of John Huston and Richard Brooks ? the dialogue crackles from start to finish, and the film has a clever plot with a twist that still works.Reardon eventually finds the answer to his question and matters are resolved without a happy ending ? Ollie remains dead at the end, and as is often the case in film noir, has been joined by many others.The scenes between Gardner and Lancaster are highly charged. His obsession with her and her betrayal of him make this compelling cinema, all bathed in the chiaroscuro effects of Edward Bredell's photography. Despite the use of studio sets for indoors and out, the direction of Robert Siodmak elevates just about every scene of this film into a work of art.Filmmakers can set out to make a good picture, maybe even a great one, but they can't set out to make a classic. That is a status that comes with the test of time ? "The Killers" is a movie that has passed that test.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly great film noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killers is loosely based on a short story by Ernest Hemingway. I have not read the story, but apparently only the first ten minutes or so is based on Hemingway's writing and the rest is a series of flashbacks sprung from Hemingway's story. The film was remade by Don Siegel in 1964, though that version gave a different slant on the story; here, the actual killers themselves are fairly incidental to the plot, which revolves around the character named 'The Swede' who is bumped off towards the start. The plot springs from an investigation lead by Jim Reardon, a man who works for an insurance company and is investigating an insurance payout from the dead man to a hotel owner who didn't really know him. His investigation leads him to numerous characters that knew 'The Swede', and gradually a story starts to develop from the information he gets from the dead man's acquaintances. Many of the stories involve a dame named Kitty Collins, and the reason for the Swede's death soon becomes clear to the insurance investigator...This really is a first rate film noir flick. The way that the story comes together gradually ensures that it's always fascinating as we are fed various clues one at a time. Perhaps the main reason why this film has aged so well is down to the way that the plot is put together, as a story like this is bound to be interesting no matter when the film is seen. Robert Siodmak directs well as always and also gives the film the thick, foreboding atmosphere that defines the 'film noir' style of film-making. The Killers benefits from a terrific cast. Burt Lancaster fits into to the central role well and really convinces as the ex-boxer 'The Swede'. He is joined by the beautiful Ava Gardner, who is stone cold in the 'femme fatale' role. The film is really lead by Edmond O'Brien, though his performance isn't a huge standout; he does well in holding the audience's attention while the more interesting characters further the plot. I can't profess to have seen any great number of film noir's, but I've seen at least a couple of dozen; and The Killer is undoubtedly one of the best! Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. It is absolutely mind boggling to see Burt Lancaster with such natural strength and sexuality. I just don't see any current movie celebrity who can even come close to his stature. His role shows a weakness to Ava Gardner (can you blame him?),while standing up to the boss of the gang to protect the cool Kitty Collins (fantastic beauty Ava). It is well written, flashbacks are great, and his jail partner is a joy to watch as he drinks giving away the information about the Swede to O'Brien. The character actors also bring us memorable performances. Now, as for Ava Gardner: she played her part with such sexuality and at such ease. She could walk into a crowded room and command complete attention without effort. She was very nervous about portraying this role but didn't indicate any weakness in being Kitty Collins - dismissing any thought of the Swede with a shrug of her shoulders while talking with O'Brien. Absolutely heartless, no regrets about the Swede's demise. Brrrr. Talk about cold heat. Get the popcorn out, relax and see what a real film noir is all about. They just don't make them like the used to. They can't because these stars' cannot be replaced.This movie really has it all: complex characters, beauty and greed, with sympathy for the Swede while hoping he would realize Kitty was being truthful(in her way) that she was "poison" to others, and the mystery to be solved. This is great in black and white - don't ever have it colorized. This was well acted and directed out of a short story written by Ernest Hemingway. I've read some of his works and appreciate the writing being faithfully expanded for the movies.To summarize: the remake of this 1946 film noir was no way near the original. The latter's attempt had a cast of no reaching out to the audience to be believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a pure treat from start (menace and sarcasm in a normally non -threatening setting) to the final surprise end. The story starts with a murder, then follows the subsequent life insurance investigation. This investigation turns up information from unwilling informants, spinning out the facts in flashback. "A Soldier's Story" copied its structure entirely from this earlier film.One complaint -- after all is said and done, there's what I like to call a "Scooby-Doo wrap-up." You know, where Fred and Velma explain the mystery to the 3 and 4-year-olds who might not be able to put it together by themselves.

		<shortDescription>Superb noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a superb noir. The anti-hero "the Swede" played by Burt Lancaster in his first credited performance calmly accepts being killed at the start of the movie. The remainder of the movie is told in flashbacks as the insurance investigator Edmund O'Brien in a superb early performance tries to find out who he was and why he was killed.Visually the film is stunning throughout. The whole insurance angle and flashbacks are reminiscent of Double Indemnity (made two years earlier). Ava Gardner plays the femme fatale. Its been said that there is no chemistry between her and Lancaster. Actually, thats obvious because she shows little interest him while he is madly in love with her.I recommend this as a worthy noir. Its interesting that after the robbery, the Swede and Kitty hole up in Atlantic City, the setting for Burt's last great film - Atlantic City. Things come full circle and he does play a older version of "Swede" in his Atlantic City character.This is more of an ensemble piece than a Burt Lancaster film and the entire supporting cast is A-Grade (most notably O'Brien). The Killers doesn't appear dated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black and downbeat - but cracking entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burt Lancaster is a gangster holed-up in a sleaze ball small town, patiently awaiting the men that will probably take his life. Through the unfolding film we learn his rational and reasoning.Certainly a movie before its time, and maybe not finding an audience because of it, but hard not to regard it as anything other than classic film noir. Hard to believe that this was made in 1946, given that so many of the devices (especially time-shift) seem modern.The plotting and the pacing, towards the inevitable finale, are a joy to behold. Equally it should be taken as an antidote to also those "gangsterism is fun while it lasts" films that we see so much of. The story was created by Ernest Hemmingway, but it is alleged that the hand of John Houston was involved in the script (although not credited). True there is nothing really new on display here, but the special quality is that of restraint and pacing, resisting wallowing to long its own self pity and becoming a drag.A film makers film, in that it shows that you can set up a movie in such a way as the audience think they know something, then still surprise them with twists, turns and developments. Lancaster in the lead is the biggest plus, one of the few actors that can play sour and jaded, but not lose his humanity. A big man in more ways than one and sadly missed.This film should be shown on TV more, but maybe its themes and attitude make it hard to schedule. Certainly a must-see if you are a fan of film noir or are a fan of gangster films generally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killers is a well done "who done it" that does not give away the answer until the end of the picture. Burt Lancaster is great in his first film role, as studio heads opted to save the money they would normally pay to a big star. It worked! Ava Gardner too is great and both would spring-board to stardom soon after this effort. Of note is the music written by Miklos Rozas. You will recognize the theme from the popular TV series of the 50s, Dragnet. A lot of credit goes to cast member Edmond O'Brien who had a larger part in the film that did Lancaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hemingway liked this best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernest Hemingway's books have always been notoriously hard to turn into successful films; "The Killers" is an excellent adaptation, and was Hemingway's favorite adaptation of his work.This is the film that launched Burt Lancaster, and it's easy to see why. Lancaster plays a The Swede, a former boxer who turns to crime when his fighting days are over.The film begins at the end, with two killers (William Conrad and Charles McGraw) coming to town to kill The Swede (Lancaster). He's warned, but he stays in bed, informing his friend that he's not going to do anything about it. Moments later, the killers arrived, and the next thing we know, The Swede is on a slab in the morgue. Edmond O'Brien plays Jim Riordan, investigating the death for his insurance company. The Swede left everything to a cleaning woman at a hotel where he once stayed. As Riordan starts talking to people and hearing the Swede's story, he becomes more and more intrigued.In flashbacks, we find out that one night, while in a nightclub with his girlfriend (Virginia Christine), he sees the singer, Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner) and is a goner. And who can blame him - she's absolutely gorgeous, maybe the most beautiful woman in films.Kitty is the girlfriend of Colfax (Albert Dekker), who has an idea for a big robbery of a quarter of a million dollars - doesn't sound like much today but in 1946, it was the equivalent of $3 million today. Colfax wants $100,000, and the other guys can divide the rest.Really excellent film with sinister performances by Dekker, Conrad, and McGraw. Dekker's very presence is scary. Lancaster does a terrific job - he's handsome, passionate, and one has sympathy for him. Gardner is sultry and sexy. She really had it all - the looks, the speaking voice, decent acting ability, and charisma.Great noir, great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killers is directed by Robert Siodmak, is based on a story written by Ernest Hemmingway and stars Burt Lancaster, Ava Gardner and Edmond O'Brien.All the things we have come to recognise and love about film Noir over the years are present here. The atmosphere,the hero being destroyed by his love for a bad girl, the shadows and lighting,the cigarettes and all those double crosses.In the quiet little town of Brentwood,New Jersey two assassins enter a diner looking for a man called Ole Anderson known as the Swede(Burt Lancaster)their reason?they have been sent to kill him.Getting no joy at the diner they head on over to his apartment and gun him down.Enter insurance investigator Jim Reardon(Edmund O'Brien)who discovers Ole has left money to a chambermaid at hotel and upon talking to her Jim discovers things about the dead man that pique his interest deeply.Getting permission from his boss he teams up with Police Lt Sam Lubinsky(Sam Levene)who's an old friend of Ole's, together they investigate his life and piece together his story.The investigations lead them to the beautiful and seductive Kitty Collins(Ava Gardner)looking every inch the classic femme fatale,who used to be Ole's girl. They also come across big businessman Jim Colfax(Albert Dekker)who organised the robbery which led to the events in Brentwood.With superb performances especially O'Brien,Gardner,Vince Barnett as Charleston a former thief who befriended Ole and Lancaster,an unforgettable theme by Mikolas Rozsa(which later became famous as the theme of Dragnet)and a gripping screenplay by Anthony Veiller.The Killers is one of the best Noir films ever made and a highlight in the careers of Ava Gardner and Burt Lancaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seventeen years ago this day,Siodmak's career began in Germany,and who could have predicted it would come to this,one of the best films noirs (who said best?) of all time.With hindsight,it's the American Masterpiece Siodmak had threatened to make since he started working in Hollywood.Compared to "the killers" ,both "phantom lady" and "Christmas holiday" can be looked upon as (brilliant) blueprints.But the roots of "Killers" are to be found in Siodmak's early "Stürme der Leidenschaft " aka " Tumultes " where Charles Boyer was under a femme fatale's charm,just as Lancaster is here.By the same token ,"the suspect" finds its roots in "Mollenard " aka "Mollenard Capitaine Corsaire" for both films feature the character of the wife/shrew and "Phantom lady" is the son of "Pi?ges" (the psycho killer is featured in both) Of course ,Siodmak made turkeys (in France ,his remake of "Le GRand Jeu" by Jacques Feyder was a big failure ,in America ,what can a Siomak buff do with ,say,"Cobra woman"?.But he was a true auteur,and his best works form a whole .His flair for a disturbing atmosphere,which was glaring in "Mollenard" "Pi?ges" "Dark mirror" "Spiral staircase" or "phantom lady" works wonders here: the restaurant;the room where only a small ray of light enters,almost a coffin;the party where ,like a spider on a fly,the femme fatale is waiting...Lancaster just says "she's beautiful" and then he only has eyes for her ,whereas he came with another girl."The killers" screenplay is astounding.Getting ahead of HItchcock,Siodmak kills his lead in the second scene!Then begins an investigation ? la "Citizen Kane" ,a giant jig saw puzzle ,the last piece of which packs a real wallop .This final unexpected twist,the hero will never know it.Each new character reveals a short chapter of Pete "Swede" alias Ole ,sometimes flouting the chronological order (it's THIS movie which should replace "memento" in the IMDb top 250;like it or not,there were people who were doing cleverer things earlier),always coming at the right place.Something which is not common:sometimes we have the strange feeling that Lancaster and Gardner are no longer the stars of the film;they seem to work behind the scenes and the real hero is James Reardon (Edmund O'Brien) whose time on screen exceeds those of the two stars put together.Siodmak wanted it so : Swede and Kitty gain in mystery and they become almost abstract: Garner is the femme fatale who ,in her brief appearances ,has almost nothing to do,just to be.Lancaster is the loser,but a loser in a world devoid of a social context (all that we know is that he is a failed boxing champion.The loser/femme fatale pattern would continue in "Criss Cross" where Yvonne de Carlo replaced Ava Gardner,then muted in "Cry of the city" where the main female character (whose time on screen consisted of two scenes ) was no longer a femme fatale but a pure young girl.I urge the users to try and see Siodmak's European movies (those which he made before the war,the last part of his career being much less exciting)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inarguably One of the Greatest Film Noirs of the Silver Screen Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never read Ernest Hemingway's original short story, so I have no idea what screenwriter Anthony Veiller added. All I know is that this is undoubtedly one of the greatest scripts of the 1940s. It has little if any trappings of old movies. The woman is a strong character, the plot is not rerouted from its natural path to suit a superficial formulaic requirement, and the dialogue is as fascinatingly dated as any great film from the time. Mark Hellinger was a producer of that era that didn't seem to allow cheery standard fare and preferred realism and natural creative sensibilities in the films he produced, which is very clear here as it is in his later classic noir The Naked City by Jules Dassin.Burt Lancaster, though an intimidating presence, makes quite an intense debut. Ava Gardner is no comparison to many other actresses whose femmes fatale grace the film noir era, but she delivers in a strong, affectingly wicked performance. O'Brien and Dekker balance the cast with easy style and laid back grace.Not many films, no matter how great they may be, open with such a hook as The Killers. Its opening scene has you smoldering in your seat as you have no idea where this story is going to go. It's dark, gritty, and edgy, and has every instinct for the audience's current mindset at any point in the story.The highest point in the film is the scene of the heist, which is masterfully and powerfully done in one shot. It's a heist that is simplistically clever, and the camera cranes in from a high angle on each step of it, gracefully moving along. It's one of the most well-directed scenes I've ever seen in a film from the '40s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Women can trap your soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies. I must confess that I love Film Noir. Ava Gardner was never better than she was as Kitty Collins, and I can understand why the Swede would throw it all away for her. This is also my favorite Hemingway short story and Robert Siodmark uses shadows and light as well as any director ever. You want to reach into the shadows to warn Burt Lancaster, "don't, she's no good". The story may seem fairly straightforward, a robbery gone bad, but the atmosphere of danger, plus the sexual tension whenever Gardner is on-screen is palpable, and the acting is first-rate by all.This was Lancaster's first movie and while his line readings were not always the smoothest, nobody ever has moved on screen with the combination of catlike grace and barely suppressed rage that he did. You can easily see why he became a great star. After you see the movie as many times as I have, you realize that it is really about the dislocation that the Depression and WW 2 made in peoples' traditional ways of thinking, and their increasing belief that they could no longer control their own fates. It is really is an interesting character study and I recommend to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This great noir thriller introduced Burt Lancaster to the public as the ill-fated protagonist of the story. With Ava Gardner as the femme fatale and Edmond O'Brien as the investigator of Lancasters misfortunes, the acting is in more than capable hands. The film frames the story through different flashbacks,and the fact that we know the outcome of the story does not diminish the tension director Siodmak creates in this movie. A great performance by Sam Levene as the cop friend of Lancaster heightens the enjoyment of the film. I will watch the 1964 remake with Lee Marvin some time later.I'm looking forward to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening sequence it becomes clear that "The Killers" is going to be an interesting investigation into murder. The film starts with a murder then, through the work of the investigator, slowly unveils why the murder took place. The film offers baddies and double crosses galore, and the femme-fatale, Kitty Colins, does an effective job at being deceptively bad. This film does not give you a chance to lose interest, pacing the plot at a level which never leaves you confused but will never bore you either.An excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Noir Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies of the late 1940s, and of the film noir oeuvres in general. The cast and directing is tiptop, and the script a remarkable demonstration of developing a short tale (almost a sketch, really) into a full bodied movie. The short story by Ernest Hemingway does not explain more about the killing's background except Swede did not throw a fight. That is discarded to develop the robbery and the triangle between Lancaster - Gardner - and Decker. The crosses and double crosses (some of which are actually mistaken acts of kindness - Lancaster's taking the blame for Gardner's possession of stolen jewelry and his knocking out his friend Sam Levene in order to cover his lie as the truth) proliferate. But the final effect is like a successful ride on a slickened roller coaster - and quite effective at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ole "Swefe" Anderson (Burt Lancaster) is viciously gunned down by hired killers--and doesn't resist. Insurance investigator Jim Reardon (Edmond O'Brien) tries to find out why he left all his insurance money to a maid in a hotel and finds himself getting involved in murder, double crosses and a very deadly woman (Ava Gardner).Very good film noir taken (and expanded) from a short story by Ernest Hemingway. It's shot appropriately in almost total darkness, has hard-boiled tough guy dialogue, dangerous characters and a deadly female. The plot comes out slowly but I was never bored. The direction and acting kept me glued to my seat. This was Lancaster's film debut and (understandably) made him a star. He's not good all the time (he has a few weak moments) but for a first timer he's incredible. Gardner is ridiculously beautiful and excellent in her role. The rest of the cast is populated by some very experienced character actors who are just great. Also Gardner and Lancaster are so incredibly beautiful that you can't take your eyes off them. A big hit in its day--even Hemingway liked it! Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A phenomenal story dealing with the double-cross of double-cross. Burt Lancaster began his memorable screen career in this one. In the first scene, he is shot to death and the film then goes back to trace why.While Edmond O'Brien, as an insurance investigator, gives another solid performance, Albert Dekker as the gang leader and his moll, Ava Gardner, are horribly miscast in this film. Dekker shows no grit as required as by the role. As for Miss Gardner, I believe that she was one of the most over-rated actresses. With the exception of the remake of "Show Boat," in 1951, her performances were generally flat. She does some splendid acting in the next to last scene in this film, but by then she has failed to create any depth in other appearances in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential Lancaster noir on a great DVD package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernest Hemingway's The Killers : The Criterion Collection is about as complete a collection as I have encountered- 2 feature length editions of the Killers- the 1946 black and white noir version directed by Robert Siodmak starring Burt Lancaster,Edmond O'Brien &amp; Ava Gardner,the 1964 version starring Lee Marvin with a supporting cast that includes Claude Akins(sheriff Lobo), John Cassavettes, Norman Fell(Mr.Roper), Angie Dickinson &amp; future president Ronald Reagan.Both versions have merit- the 46 version features a great performance by Burt Lancaster as the doomed Boxer Ole Anderson,tons of great Siodmak shots and the lovely Ava Gardner.The 1964 version is very different - it strays far afield from the Hemingway short story( the screenplay is by future Star Trek exec Gene L. Coon)- the athlete is now a race car driver- we see Lee Marvin in a dry run for his future role as cold-blooded killer in Point Blank and we see the oddest group of supporting actors all doing a good job- Ronald Reagen as the plotting and scheming bad guy- with his sidekick Norman Fell- we see Claude Akins loyal to the point of tears- we also get a disturbing opening and a great ending- it is a flawed movie- but worth seeing.I am not going to say the 46 is flawless- but it is gripping from the opening dinette scene to the climax.The DVD also features a student film version of the Killers by Andrei Tarkovsky, an audiobook reading by Stacey Keach and a radio theater version with Lancaster and Shelley Winters.The DVD also has essays on film noir and a video essay by Stuart Kaminsky.

		<shortDescription>twisting and turning: one of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The marvellous and tense b/w cinematography by Woody Bredell (Phantom Lady '44, Inspector General '49) captures Lancaster and Gardner at their best and Robert Siodmak (Phantom Lady, Criss Cross '49) keeps the pace up and obviously is the brain behind the solid piece. There are all kinds of great things about this movie, but the best is the fact that everything falls into place and it has inevitably become a classic. Regardless of the changing point of view and other distracting elements, there even is room for a two-minute shot of the robbery with 'newspaper voice-over' @55 min. All this fabulous contrast and, more importantly composition makes it a film that I would rather see again immediately than, say, Maltese Falcon.And then there is the story by Hemingway. I don't know whether Veiller stuck to the original plot (didn't read it), but I think it creates enough suspense in the way it is presented here. You are presented with the dirty trick , and then the necessary parts of the whole mystery, that spans about ten years, is unfold by several people in the form of flashbacks. Therefore the point of view shifts continuously. A big flaw is the constant anticipating by most actors, but that is nothing compared with the futile remake of '64. The storytelling and visual quality makes this come close to The Third Man, although that one might be better appreciated by both sexes.Some crucial scenes are used with great humour in 'Dead men don't wear plaid'. That movie even re-uses the pregnant music in a way I have never seen before in a persiflage/comedy movie. If you're a fan of film-noir and want a good laugh, try that one (Steve Martin actually in a good role!).Still, I like Linda Fiorentino and Famke Janssen better as a femme fatale than Ava Gardner (Cassandra crossing): the looks AND the acting! 8-) And Burt Lancaster (il Gattopardo, Sweet smell of success) looks like Corey Haim :(9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never read Ernest Hemingway, nor do I ever intend to. That much said, let me review this film noir. In true black and white with good lighting and patterns the visual is a good watch, but it's by no means the best of its genre.Two goons buffalo into a small town to hit a gas station attendant. An insurance adjuster pursues the case and solves the murder mystery. It is all flashbacks as he interviews everybody associated with the Swede's death. Burt Reynolds is a washed up prizefighter who broke his knuckles and became a two-bit hoodlum. He takes the rap for a selfish, double-crossing girl, and upon his release from prison takes part in a robbery. If he'd been successful, he'd have been set for life, but remember about the double crosser? She played the poor smitten pug to the point that his life was no longer worth living, which was why he didn't put up a fight during his execution. If this sounds depressing, it really isn't. It's simply a crime drama.Tip: the Ronald Reagan remake is much better, but in color.</fullReview>
