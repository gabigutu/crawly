		<shortDescription>Lyrical relic of a vanished civilization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This charming comedy is justly famous as the film that made the whole world fall in love with Audrey Hepburn and half the world want to run out and buy a Vespa scooter. Hepburn was always beguiling, but in some of her later roles she tended to overplay the winsomeness. Here every note she hits is just about perfect.And speaking of notes, pay special attention to the score by the great Georges Auric. If the film had been produced in the manner of modern romantic comedies, the sound track would have been larded with pop hits by Perry Como, Dinah Shore, and Frankie Laine, which would have done an awful lot to destroy the magic. Instead Auric's complex, vibrant, evocative music complements the story's inherent lyricism without upstaging it. In an era of bombastic film scoring, this seems a miracle.Someone once said that Audrey Hepburn's was the beauty of possibility and transformation -- she was always in motion, always becoming something else. "Roman Holiday" is very much of a piece with that notion. On the surface, the film is about a princess who disguises herself as a "commoner". But in truth she's actually pretending to be a princess, at least at first. She finally becomes authentic -- is transformed and prepared to deal with her destiny -- only through the ennobling power of love and sacrifice. That's one heck of a mythic subtext and does a lot to explain "Roman Holiday's" enduring power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently caught this little gem of a film on a retro program and it was a trip well worth it. William Wyler was a genius directing throughout his film career. Here he's in top form.The only way this film could have been conceived was with the charming presence of Audrey Hepburn in her first appearance on a Hollywood film. She is without a doubt, an angel who was sent to this earth to delight the movie audiences in whatever movie she happened to dignify with her appearance in.Some people have compared Audrey Tatou with the incomparable Audrey Hepburn. Seeing Ms Hepburn in Roman Holiday will certainly change the minds of those comparing fans. Audrey Hepburn was a star's star! She exudes charm, intelligence, elegance, and beauty. Just one look from her could disarm Gregory Peck forever.The only wrong note of this production was the way the writer, Dalton Trumbo, was treated since he had been blacklisted by the anti-communist faction lead by Sen. McCarthy and company. In the end, Mr. Trumbo was vindicated in having his name recognized as the writer of Roman Holiday.This film is a feast to the eyes in that glorious cinematography and Rome as a background. This was Hollywood at its best. Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn will be forever young any time we take a look at this classic that I'm sure will live and charm its viewers whenever they take a chance to see it for the first time, or like some of us, for another loving look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A plot as slender as Audrey Hepburn but oh what magic! If you've never seen this jewel, you're to have one of the best evenings of your week, your month.Perhaps the key to this movie's success is restraint - in the dialogue, in the music, in the cynicism of Peck and cronies at the movie's beginning. No one gushes - all is understated - but how one feels its power.I hope everyone has experienced a day such as they - with someone they come to care for - as much as they. It's my wish for the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>catch the beautifully restored print of this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn's first big film role cast her as a Princess of country unknown, making a state visit to Rome. Bored of the endless run of openings, dedications and so on, she decides to see something of the city, and runs into American newsman Gregory Peck. He recognises her as the missing Princess and plans to scoop a major interview for his syndicate, with the help of pal Eddie Albert and his hidden camera.Hepburn is an absolute joy, particularly when her hair is shorn down to the classic urchin cut and she takes a motorcycle ride. Peck, too, is served well by this kind of role, and the romance of the city of Rome helps their relationship to develop during their 24 hours of freedom. Roman Holiday is one of those rarities which are truly perfect and memorable, a real girly flick with beautiful photography and a sparkling script. Highly recommended, and especially so in the wonderful recent restoration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Holiday worth celebrating every day of the year. The Princess awakens from her slumbers in this classic fall-from-innocence, coming-of-age tale with a royal twist. Audrey Hepburn stakes her claim as the most perfect woman who ever lived. Gregory Peck at his best as the ne'er-do-well American reporter who guides her chastely from girlhood to womanhood. What can I add? One of the finest movies ever made. Now will you please stop reading this review and rent the movie, for heaven's sake? ...Now, according to the rules, this review has to go for at least 10 lines. And yet I've said everything I have to say about Roman Holiday. It is perfect. Rent it. Or better yet, buy it. You won't regret it. There, now that's 11 lines, that ought to do it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Nice Blend of Fantasy &amp; Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a very nice blend of fantasy and reality, and two very likable stars, "Roman Holiday" is both entertaining and thoughtful. Sometimes it is very funny, and at other times it makes you feel a great sympathy and warmth towards the characters. Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck are ideal in the leading roles, and the story is very clever in getting a lot of mileage out of a simple idea without pushing things too far, which makes it quite effective.The idea of Princess Ann (Audrey) slipping away unnoticed and unrecognized for a day of fun and freedom from responsibility is of course fanciful, but it works for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is Peck's role as a pragmatic newsman. He is a good balance for Hepburn's charm and energy, remaining calm and logical without ever becoming cold or distant. You feel as if you could spend a lot more than a couple of hours in their company. And how could you improve on Eddie Albert's performance as Peck's photographer friend? The movie also adds in the atmosphere of Rome itself, with some creative scenes that make good use of the setting.There are many fine moments in a story that at times seems almost like a daydream, and then it brings the characters back to reality in a moving way. It's not an easy combination to pull off, but here it all fits together very well, to make the kind of classic worth remembering, and one which you can watch and enjoy more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn doesn't have a vulgar bone in her body: she breezes through this comedic romp with the spirit of a saint on holiday. When a princess escapes the castle while touring Italy, a down-on-his-luck American reporter chances to meet her and smells a good story. A joyful fairy tale, but with the heartbreak of reality at the finale, and what sweet sadness there is in those final shots! Hepburn won an Oscar for Best Actress, and deserved it. Gregory Peck is almost playful in his scenes with her, and Eddie Albert is a perfect buddy-match. Director William Wyler sets up the story very gingerly, but he cuts loose as well, and the whole picture plays like a delectable dessert. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey Sparkles Through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Roman Holiday was in the planning stages William Wyler envisioned either Elizabeth Taylor or Jean Simmons in the role of the princess. When neither proved available, he and Paramount studios decided to do a Scarlett O'Hara type search for an unknown for the part. The film then would only have Gregory Peck as the star to draw the people in.But when Peck saw the screen test and also realized the film would rise and fall on the performance of the princess part, he insisted on top billing for Audrey Hepburn. Audrey had only done a few small bit parts in some English films up till then, however Peck insisted on the billing of her right after him with 'introducing Audrey Hepburn' as her title credit. In the same way that William Holden credited Barbara Stanwyck with helping him get through Golden Boy, Audrey Hepburn credited Gregory Peck with her performance in Roman Holiday. As well as William Wyler who still has a record of more people getting to the Oscar sweepstakes for his films than any other director.Roman Holiday is simple and delightful film about a young princess of some unnamed European country who gets tired of her programmed routine and wants a break from it. In Rome while on a European tour, princess Audrey fakes an illness and runs off for a day of fun.An American wire service reporter Gregory Peck finds her and realizes he's got an exclusive. So he chaperones her around without letting her know she's on to him. He even gets photographer Eddie Albert to help him out.Eddie Albert got the first of two nominations for Best Supporting Actor for Roman Holiday, the second one being The Goodbye Girl. He lost to Frank Sinatra for From Here to Eternity. Though Albert is funny in this film, for dramatic work I never understood why he was not nominated for Attack or for Captain Newman, MD.If you're thinking that the film is starting to bear a resemblance to a continental It Happened One Night you would be right. And if that's your thinking it will come as no surprise to learn that Frank Capra originally had the idea to film this. The property reverted to Paramount as part of his settlement to leave that studio after doing two Bing Crosby films.I wish Paramount had done Roman Holiday in color though. Darryl F. Zanuck over at 20th Century did Three Coins in the Fountain in gorgeous color and later on MGM did The Seven Hills of Rome also in color. Still the Roman locations really add a lot to Audrey's adventure.When Oscar time Audrey Hepburn in her first starring role and really first role of any consequence won an Oscar for Best Actress. Until the day she died Audrey Hepburn had charm enough for ten, you can't help but love her in anything she ever did. Even if the film she did was not that great, Audrey sparkles through.Even in black and white, the Eternal City with Audrey and Greg make anyone young at heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enchanting is the word that comes to mind to describe "Roman Holiday". It's got that escape from reality wonder about it that might be envied even by royalty. Audrey Hepburn is luminous in her first American film appearance, allowing the viewer to believe that she really could pull off the disappearing act for twenty fours hours for the purpose of living life on a 'fun schedule'.I was impressed by how much mileage Princess Ann got out of that five thousand lira note; could one really buy sandals, a haircut and a cone of gelato all for less than a dollar and a half in 1953? That would have made Joe Bradley's (Gregory Peck) five thousand dollar payday close to a king's ransom, or at least a princess's. Bradley's put into a predicament when Ann comments on his sacrifice to spend the day showing her around Rome; she describes it as 'completely unselfish'. By that time, one gets the idea that just maybe he'll wind up doing the right thing.Slow to pick up on Bradley's non verbals, photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) bears the brunt of Joe's spilled drinks and takes a pratfall or two. Sadly, one of his remarks to Joe brought to mind the unending scrutiny suffered in real life by Princess Diana - "She's fair game Joe, it's always open season on princesses." Odd how art imitating life, in this case predicting it, could end in such tragedy.It was heartwarming then to see how Joe and Irving turned their back on a story, and instead opted to reaffirm humanity. The finale is both uplifting and bittersweet, echoing one of Gregory Peck's lines to Hepburn earlier in the story - "Life isn't always what one likes, is it?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romanitic comedy with the beautiful Audrey Hepburn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie. The chemistry between Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck is magnetic. You can tell they truly enjoyed each other. Audrey was quoted as saying for her first major motion picture Gregory Peck was the perfect choice due to his genuine warmth of character. In fact, Peck insisted that Audrey name be placed next to his because to do otherwise would be "silly" (this was her first major role). My favorite scene, though a sad one, is the ending where the love they have for one another is seen in their faces as they both know they can never be together. Just a fantastic movie both light hearted, funny and a unique love story all in one film. Any fan of Audery can't miss her Oscar winning performance in this film. She truly was one of the most beautiful actresses of all time and a remarkable human being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman holiday is the most incredible movie I have ever seen. I came across this movie quite by chance. I like suspense movies and I watched Charade starring Audrey and Cary Grant. Audrey's acting in that movie impressed me so I decided to watch Roman holiday too. Too be very frank I was not really looking forward to watching this movie. Like most people of this generation I dislike black and white movies.Man was I wrong. I have never seen a movie, which had so much romance, comedy and emotional drama. It would be fair to say that magic was created in this movie. The plot I guess everyone knows, a young princes tired of her regulated life runs away and hooks up with a reporter (Gregory Peck) for a day of fun in Rome. The reporter lies to her that he is a businessman and she lies to him about her true identity. They both have fun visiting Rome's historic places. But the reporter has a hidden agenda. He wants to write a story on the princess's escapades in Rome and enlists the help of his photographer friend (Albert). Things work according to plan for the reporter until he finds that he is really starting to fall in love with the princess.The story line may appear to be simple but take my word for it that Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn create magic and the movie will take a hold over you like nothing else you have ever seen. This is Audrey's best movie and the only movie she got an Oscar for and she was never so charming, innocent and beautiful as she is in this movie.One of the reviewers has suggested that Cary Grant would have been ideal for the role that Gregory Peck plays. I only have to say this to the devotees of Cary Grant that he would never have worked as a romantic lead in this movie. He was 50 years old at the time this movie was made and the sight of him cavorting around with a girl half his age would have removed from the movie it's romantic element. It would have become perhaps a slightly funnier movie but without the heart wrenching almost magical hold it now has. Also it is my humble opinion after seeing Charade that Cary Grant is too suave to play the role of a struggling reporter convincingly.History has already spoken; this movie is regarded as one of the all time greats, why would we want to change something, which is already perfect. Gregory Peck is ideal for the role of the reporter, he is incredibly handsome in the movie, a kind of man a young girl could fall in love with even after being with him only for a few hours. In this movie, Gregory Peck acts his heart out, especially at the end and he has a wonderfully chemistry with Audrey, which is the reason this movie still seems so fresh and charming even after 50 years.This is one of those rare movies that works across cultural and national borders. I was surprised to learn that according to a poll in Japan even after so many years Roman Holiday still is the number one foreign movie of all time.This movie is simply the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Wyler's 'Roman Holiday' is a sparkling gem. Even though it's a black and white movie, it's a splendid treat to the eyes. The cinematography gives Rome a wonderfully spacious feel (in spite of its crowdedness). Then there's the pleasant score which is used minimally but still manages to bring out the liveliness. Rome is presented romantically but it's not overdone and the film cleverly avoids clichés. Thankfully, Dalton Trumbo (who had been blacklisted) is finally credited as a writer.Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn sizzle together in this romantic adventure. Hepburn in her first Hollywood studio movie is a complete delight to watch as she displays her natural charm and innocence with grace. Peck makes a surprising turn in his first romantic comedy and delivers a great performance while sharing a warm chemistry with Hepburn. In a supporting role, Eddie Albert is hilarious as Joe's friend.'Roman Holiday' is an example of romantic comedy at its best. I loved how the ending was unconventional and quiet (not your typical ending of a rom-com) where the actors' silence speak volumes. This gem has got more than all the ingredients that make a film of this genre successful because not only was it a hit, it's a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a college aged guy with several younger sisters, I'd seen far too many chick flicks as they were being watched and couldn't get over how bad they were. Even ones they claimed to be good were extremely lackluster and I was beginning to wonder what, if any, good romantic movies existed. Then one afternoon I randomly happened to catch Roman Holiday on TV just as it was starting. For some reason I cant really remember, I sat through and watched it and now am quite glad that I did.Aside from the romance element, it's essentially the polar opposite of what I despised. Great acting, excellent script, and most importantly, an effective and beautiful story. I won't spoil a thing about the plot here, but it works. While the movie can be called a romantic comedy, the humorous elements aren't the cheesy kind of thing you might expect from recent entries in the genre. I All I can say to you is: coming from a guy, this is the first and so far the only romantic movie I have thoroughly enjoyed watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many other people, this is the film in which I fell in love with Audrey Hepburn. I remember the exact moment too. It was the ad-libbed scene at the mouth of truth. After Gregory Peck plays his prank, we see Hepburn's (not her character's) genuine reaction. We see that Hepburn is as delicate, innocent and kind as the princess she is portraying. I can watch this scene a dozen times and not get tired of it.Roman Holiday really is the perfect romance film. Hepburn and Peck are not only very attractive leads, but also have a wonderful chemistry. Eddie Albert provides just the right dose of comedy as Peck's sidekick. And the location... I don't think Rome has ever looked more delightful on film. Sure there are a few Italian stereotypes, but hey, it was the 1950's and none of it's done with any mean-spiritedness.***Warning Spoilers***The ending of Roman Holiday, while utterly heartbreaking, is entirely fitting. This was a romance that was too good to last. And yet, when I see the final scene where Peck trudges out of the press conference all alone, I keep hoping that Hepburn will run after him and declare her love and renounce her throne or some such rubbish. If only they had DVD back in 1953, then they could have shot an alternate happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn is a princess who, stoned on a hypnotic administered by her doctor, escapes in a half swoon and wanders the streets of Rome until she bumps into reporter Gregory Peck. Peck, not recognizing her, takes her to his shabby apartment and dumps her unceremoniously onto his couch. Next morning, realizing that he's got a seriously major story on his hands, he enlists the help of his friend, photographer Eddie Albert, and together they take Princess Audrey on a one-day tour of the delights of Rome, ranging from a modern haircut to a comic fist fight on the barges at San Angelo. Inevitably, Hepburn and Peck fall for each other, and at midnight she returns to her embassy and her duties. Peck and Albert agree not to publish the story and meet her for the last time at a public appearance, during which they reveal all to her. Hepburn returns to royalty and Peck and Albert go back to being broke, roustabout newsmen.It's an extremely amusing story and, in the end, a sweetly romantic one too. The heart has its reasons which the wallet will never know.One of the things that makes it so successful is the presence of the elegant and stunningly beautiful young Audrey Hepburn. Not just the delicately feline features of her face but her slender and sinewy, ballet-trained figure. Paul Desmond, Dave Brubeck's wildly popular alto saxophonist at the time of this release, claimed that during his more melodic solo passages he used as inspiration the image of Audrey Hepburn entering the room and walking towards him. And, who knows? He could have been telling the truth. No one has ever been more princessly than Audrey Hepburn in this film. She seemed to age rather quickly, from late adolescence here to middle age ten years later, but remained fragile and good natured. Her later years, before an early death, were devoted to helping children in third-world countries though the auspices of the UN. Taken, all in all, not a bad life.Peck was never a notable comedian, however funny the vehicle, but he's at his best here. The script gives him a chance to register his growing guilt as Hepburn places more of her trust in him and finally comes to love him. His conversion at the end is believable, although he never bothers to explain it to his partner Eddie Albert. He doesn't have to. Men don't talk that way.It could never happen in real life, however, which is what keeps the story in fairy tale territory. Most ambitious, penniless young men, confronted with Hepburn, her love and her wealth, would immediately sling her over their shoulders and run off to Pago Pago.If you miss this, you're missing a well-constructed film, a big commercial hit at the time that garnered a couple of deserved Academy Awards.</fullReview>

There is no need for them. I have seen this film many times and never failed to be deeply moved by the looks that they exchange. There are probably only one or two other films that achieve anything near the same effect: one of them is Shadowlands, the other the Remains of the Day: Hopkins is lead in both, but they also share an era, the 40s and the 50s, a time when one buried emotion and placed duty above personal desire. In this film, the lovers are truly ennobled by their personal sacrifice, and the effect is profound and, as I have said, deeply moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Comedy / Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is another glittering feather in the cap of William Wyler which can easily be regarded as an all time great comedy/drama. Considering along with the legendary and evocative historical drama of BEN-HUR, these two movies directed by William Wyler are more than enough to engrave his name in the list of immortals.The subtle and deep focus of emotional expression which had always been characteristic of movies directed by William Wyler is candidly evident in this graceful and touching comedy. The scene where Peck puts his hand in the mouth face of Truth, and pretends as if somebody has grasped him; the subsequent frenzied shouting and acting of Hepburn is said to be taken in one shot by Wyler, with Hepburn impulsively reacting without been foretold about the particular shot and naturally without a retake.... something very unusual for the direction of Wyler.It is very difficult to resist the temptation of viewing the movie to the last scene although it is pictured in black and white. Audry Hepburn won international acclaim and recognition for depicting the role of an unruly and vivacious young princess. The cool and calm demeanor of Gregory Peck is also worth watching. Had this movie been directed in color, it would definitely been more impressive and absorbing, given the historical and befitting filming location of Rome. The last scene of Roman Holiday where Gregory Peck meets for the last time with a regal and suave princess who hides her free spirit under the veil of worldly vanity and finally Gregory Peck leaving the premises of a deserted Roman pallazeo with anguish and perplexed vibes, stirs the soul of every viewer with sublime imagination which discerns the lifestyle of a commoner from the privileged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps THE best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Robert Osborne of TCM says, Roman Holiday is one of the best movies, maybe the best movie. It's not grand in scope, like Gone With the Wind or Citizen Kane. It's really a simple romantic comedy: Royalty goes slumming for a day to rub shoulders with the commoners, while a couple of benign hustlers try to make a buck from it. Hustler and Blue Blood fall for each other, big surprise. The settings in Rome are nice, the photography is OK. The plot is sweet, the dialog clever. So what makes this movie so great? It's Audrey and Gregory. One could say she was the most beautiful woman in the world at that time. (Along with Liz Taylor?). Her youth, enthusiasm, sweetness, charm, pretty face and slender figure make a package that is so spectacular it's probably never been surpassed since. It's hard not for anyone not to fall in love with her. And they dress her to show it all off! Gregory, himself tall, dark, handsome and slim, is also remarkable with his comedic style. He also has a charm that is unique to him and is very attractive. They are both the best of actors, and the script let's them shine.What some consider the best scene is when Gregory puts his hand in the mouth of the statue and pretends his hand is being bitten. Audrey's reaction, they say, was completely natural, as Greg's acting was so good it fooled her.Eddie Albert is very good, as is his beard!Of course, when you look at who directed it, Wyler, who made some of filmdom's greatest, like Wuthering Heights, Ben Hur and many others, it may make sense that this movie is so good. But putting together a "dream team" has often flopped. But there's no smugness or overconfidence here. Like in the scene when Princess and Reporter separate in front of the palace. The vulnerability and emotion is remarkable. And the end, with the "making love", as they used to say, with their eyes, again remarkable.For such a lighthearted movie, it has at bottom a dark theme: the classes cannot mix. The audience feels this as the source of the sadness at the end of the film. It's reminiscent of The Great Gatsby: people can interact with the Rich, thinking they may be treated as equals or even ascend, but in the end the Old Guard accepts no newcomers and even tramples whomever it encounters.A rating score of 10 is the best that can be given in IMDb. This movie rates higher than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey... Brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Holiday is one of the very few "flawless" films in the history of film making. In Audrey Hepburn's first American film, she steals the show. It is impossible to take your attention off her. Not only is she beautiful, but talented as well. She has a great sense of timing, and this is so important for any actor in a comedy. Each scene is beautifully shot in the city of Rome, making it a delight for the eyes. Gregory Peck has incredible chemistry with Hepburn, and is a delight to watch. I would recommend this film to anyone; young, old, male or female. This is a timeless classic and the platform from which Hepburn became a huge star and made her mark on American film, fashion, and style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Royal Introduction to Audrey...But Peck Delights Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a beautifully restored print, this fairy tale movie provides a most enchanting introduction to the then-24 year old actress thanks mainly to director William Wyler's expert direction and Dalton Trumbo's sweetly observant script. In hindsight, it is a modest performance compared to Hepburn's later work, but Wyler knew enough to let her natural breeding serve its purpose in conveying the carriage of a princess. The approach works wonderfully, as she is perfectly believable as a royal who experiences her first glimpse into the world outside her hermetically sealed world. One can see her star rising most precipitously throughout this film, even in scenes as seemingly minor as the one where she sits on the Spanish Steps breathlessly describing her perfect day. Nonetheless, the revelation here is really Gregory Peck, handsome and stalwart as always but in this movie, quite relaxed with a surprising light comedy touch. It is actually his Joe Bradley that goes through the dramatic character arc from opportunistic reporter to smitten commoner that makes the ending so bittersweet.Even though this film is hardly mentioned in the same breath as his other classics like "Wuthering Heights" or "The Best Years of Our Lives", Wyler's humanistic touch is everywhere - from the comic haircutting scene with the smitten barber to the famous Mouth of Truth scene where Peck pretends to lose his hand to the concluding press conference, which turns into a dance of acting nuance and unspoken feelings. This DVD has some nice extras, including an excellent documentary on the production itself (watch for Hepburn's first Hollywood screen test) and other short films on the film's restoration process and Edith Head's contribution to movie costuming. A lovely reminder of what great stars Hepburn and Peck were during Hollywood's golden age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn simply dazzles in this gem of a movie. Princess Ann (Hepburn) escapes the confines of her rarefied royal existence for a day, to be rescued by a reporter, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck).Bradley senses a scoop and seeks to inveigle the Princess into a story. However, this is a fairy tale, of the Princess and the commoner. Love blossoms, the beautiful Princess experiencing everyday things we might take for granted with a delight we cannot know. Sitting at a roadside café, getting a haircut, enjoying an ice cream, dancing on a riverboat. She soaks in these experiences in the company of her handsome saviour, not realising his intentions.It's beautifully done. Hepburn is radiant, refined, beautiful, enchanting - things she went on to display in many movies. However, she was at her most perfect here, as the beautiful Princess needing love and wanting happiness. Peck is an ideal foil. Tall, dark, and handsome, his only thought being the scoop placed before him, his ambition wilting in the face of his developing love for a Princess he can't hope to attain. Both are ably supported by Eddie Albert as Irving Radovich, Bradley's photographer colleague. Indeed, Albert is involved in many of the funniest scenes.It's a fairy tale, beautifully told. William Wyler makes the most of his location, showing us Rome in all it's splendour. The perfect backdrop to the perfect fairy tale.However, this film belongs to Audrey Hepburn. She shines and dazzles, brightening nearly two hours of every viewers life. How could you hope for more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely sublime!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know where to begin praising Roman Holiday. How about saying it is one of my favourite Audrey Hepburn movies? Also it is one of Audrey's(who I've been a fan of since Charade) best roles too.STORY Roman Holiday has a very charming story. A charming and romantic love story between the beautiful Princess Anne and a reporter during an unofficial visit to the Eternal City. It is well paced and never loses momentum, and also has endearing action.SETTING One of my favourite assets of Roman Holiday. The settings are absolutely exquisite, with Rome the epitome of postwar chic(same with Hepburn and the motor scooters). Equally the cinematography and costumes are just as lavish.MUSIC A beautiful, gentle score. No wonder, as it is in courtesy of Georges Auric, the composer who penned the beautiful score for the stunning La Belle et La Bete.DIRECTION I only have one word for William Wyler's direction, immaculate.SCRIPT Roman Holiday has a perfect balance of humour and grace with dialogue that sparkles like bubbles on top of a champagne glass, while thanks to screenwriter Dalton Trumbo deals with issues of personal freedom close to the heart.ACTING Nothing to complain about here! Audrey Hepburn epitomises beauty, style and grace as Princess Anne, her final moments are so moving, while Gregory Peck is also marvellous as the dashing reporter Anne falls in love with. The supporting performances also go without fault.Overall, sublime and a film to really treasure. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun to watch if only for Audrey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do love this movie, but mostly for the fact that Audrey Hepburn is my favorite actress and she is so lovely and funny in this Oscar-winning role. There is bias here, but watch it just once and you will see how fun it is to see this modern-day princess run around the great ancient city of Rome trying to have a good time away from her royal duties. Gregory Peck is good here, although one can't help wonder what Cary Grant could have done with this role. Still, Peck is charming as is Eddie Albert as the goofy, bearded photographer at Peck's side. Stylishly directed by one of the Golden Age's greats, William Wyler, this is one of the better productions of the 1950s and stands tall as one of the best comedies ever produced by Hollywood. It is more than that though; it is also a star-making performance of one of the best actresses in the history of cinema. It is a pleasure to watch Audrey again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly charming and lovable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is the beautiful heiress to an Eastern European country who is on a goodwill tour of Europe. During her stay in Rome, she becomes sick of her routine and sneaks out of her hotel - unfortunately while under the influence of a sedative. Ne'er-do-well American journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) accidentally comes across Ann and after realizing who she is, enlists photographer buddy Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) to give her a tour of Rome while covertly creating a big news story around her. Exploring Rome and avoiding detection from the police, Ann and Joe fall for each other - but both are forced to face up to their respective duties in the end.The charms of "Roman Holiday" have been described a million times over, and undoubtedly better than I possibly could. The leads are utterly charming and lovable, the Roman scenery is gorgeous, the story is a wonderfully enjoyable fantasy, the humor is slight and unsophisticated yet remains charming and funny. For sheer enjoyment, it's hard to find a better film, which proves arguably the greatest romantic comedy of all time.The film largely succeeds on the petite shoulders of Audrey Hepburn, only 23 when this film came out. Having appeared in bit roles in a number of British films (check out her walk-on in "The Lavender Hill Mob" with Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway) and as the star of the Broadway show "Gigi", Hepburn was on the verge of stardom already. But this film catapulted her over the top, and Hepburn immediately became one of Hollywood's most recognizable and popular icons - a superstar of the type rarely seen today.Audrey Hepburn is simply adorable as Princess Ann, the spoiled, sheltered European princess who wants to enjoy the simple pleasures of life - having a gellato, attending a dance, getting a haircut, riding a Vespa through the streets of Rome. Audrey has a perfect combination of innocence, beauty and insouciance in this role; she seems like a petulant child, but is so lovable and sweet it's impossible to hold it against her. And certainly, by the end of the film, Ann comes to realize the importance of her role as a Princess. The scene where Ann stands up to her scolding minders shows a much stronger and deeper character than we could have guessed from her early scenes.Audrey Hepburn's status as an icon, of fashion, class, grace, beauty, and humanitarianism cannot be overstated. Audrey is a timeless symbol of femininity who is much more relate-able to the average girl than, say, Marilyn Monroe or Sophia Loren. Millions of girls worldwide aspire to be Audrey Hepburn, because she made being a slim, small, shy girl - qualities usually frowned upon in Hollywood and the media - something desirable. Marilyn might be more overtly sexual, but Audrey's screen persona is a believable "real woman" with relate-able personality and desires. She may not be the most versatile actress in Hollywood history, but she was one of the most honest and lovable. And here, in her first major film role, Audrey showcases why.Gregory Peck is also charming. I'm not inordinately fond of Peck, who even is best roles comes across as a bit stiff, but he is perfect for this role. Joe Bradley is convincing in all of his guises: a lovable, self-serving rogue, Anna's learned protector, and the honest, love-stricken man unwilling to betray the girl he loves. It's one of Peck's best roles, and he pulls it off beautifully.Eddie Albert as Peck's photographer buddy, Hartley Power as his flustered boss, and Margaret Rawlngs as Anna's stern minder turn in effective supporting performances which add to the film as well."Roman Holiday" is just a classic film. Its status as an icon of cinema is well-deserved, and only the most bitter, mean-spirited cynic could possibly dislike it.9/10</fullReview>

She is paired here with Gregory Peck, in creating possibly the most beautiful couple in Hollywood history.Peck's restrained performance is a perfect foil for Audreys's exuberant one and we see her through his eyes. Her sublime innocence and sense of wonder, not to mention that smile, the sweetest smile that ever graced a movie screen, win him over and inspire him to be better than he would have been without her. She is truly the embodiment of beautiful on the inside as well as on the outside.With a wonderful supporting performance by Eddie Albert and those mouth-watering Roman locations, this film is a delirious respite from the every day cares of life.</fullReview>

Gregory Peck is one of my all time favorite actors and the two of them have such great chemistry, it is a pure pleasure to watch their romance unfold. Not only is the romance so moving but there are plenty of hilarious comic moments, no small amount of them provided by Peck's reporter friend. The conclusion is so poignant I can't recall off hand another film in the genre that handled its ending with such aplomb. I should also mention that the location shooting and Hepburn's fabulous costumes add considerably to the film. In case you couldn't guess, I think this is a romantic comedy of the highest order. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of both Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn, and heard this movie was good, but I didn't think it'd be much more than a lighthearted romantic comedy. The high-jinx Peck, Hepburn and a bearded Eddie Albert get into are great, but the film also carries a message about high-born people wanting to have some of their privacy respected. The scenes where Peck pretends a great stone mouth has bitten off his arm and where Hepburn hits an Italian secret service man over the head with a violin are tops. Classic comedy with a message. You don't see much of that these days. Don't know how different it would be if it were made any later than the rather straight-laced 1950s, but it's suitable for families without being too straight-laced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a big romantic movie fan but I loved this movie very much. The cinematography that shows the definite sight of Rome not only adds the athetic point to the movie, but also helps enjoy the story more, such as Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn's scooter tour scene. Also, a bit emotional ending proves that it's not one of the cheezy happy Hollywood romantic comedies. I also liked music, which is brisk but not shallow. However, the most enjoyable fact about this movie is Audrey Hepburn. One moment, she is a ultra sophiscated princess and the next moment, she is a cute, adorable girl next door. Hepburn acts each roles so naturally and superbly that she shines over Gregory Peck. I can't imagine this movie without other actresses beside her. With Jennifer Love Hewitt? Yuk!! Today, there are many other actresses who act innocent and cute, such as Sandra Block and Mag Ryan, but noone does it better than Audrey Hepburn. Audience has to love Audrey Hepburn after the movie is over but they wouldn't have a sexual desire towards her. Rather, they would want to hold her hand and walk on the street listen to her chat. Other actors were realistic and great as well. I would've loved this movie even more if it was shot in color because I'm dying to know what color of dress Hepburn is wearing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This casual line of Joe's near the end of the movie--that life isn't always what one likes or wants, but that living with what we have to is our lot--pretty much sums up the main thrust of this movie. Princess Ann has a wonderful time in Rome, does many things, including perhaps falling in love, for the first and the last time...yet realizes that it can't go on. Ann and Joe Bradley are more mature and realistic than current-day Hollywood moguls, who no doubt would have changed the ending to have her unite with him somehow, in a soppy B-movie ending. Very, very glad to see that it doesn't happen here; the ending is perfect.Impossible to watch this movie without falling in love with Audrey Hepburn....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen "Roman Holiday" three or four times, and I don't know if there's a limit to how many times I could see it. This is a film that manages to be delightfully funny, sweetly romantic, and heartbreakingly sad at the same time. By comparison, every so-called romantic comedy made today seems trite and flat. (Today, needless to say, Hollywood would have slapped an artificial "happy ending" on this movie.)As Princess Anne, who longs to escape from the duties of a life she never chose, the luminous Audrey Hepburn creates a completely believable and unforgettable character. She is just such a pleasure to watch, not only because she is so lovely it takes your breath away (no offense to the memory of the late Princess Diana, but she didn't have one-tenth of Audrey's charm and grace), but also because her acting is so beautifully natural and so effortlessly conveys a wide range of emotions. Gregory Peck can be a little stiff at times, but he gave an excellent performance here. Still, this is definitely Audrey's picture. Princess Anne is one of the most wonderful characters ever to appear on the silver screen, and Audrey Hepburn is a treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A joy, and a first look at Audrey Hepburn, which is a whole other joy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Holiday (1953)Gregory Peck's calm, dignified way of having fun and Audrey Hepburn's girl-like joy for simple things in life made a perfect combination in this William Wyler film, now famous for introducing Hepburn to the world. The location shooting sometimes leans toward travelog stuff, but rarely, and always with these two very likable stars holding it up. And when it's pure romance, both hinted at and then blossoming, a little, it's great. And Rome looks and feels great, of course. Even when the scenes turn to slapstick, as during the night dance on the boats beneath all those nice Bernini statues (on the bridge), you are reminded how beautiful and romantic the city is. If you go to Rome now, many of these scenes (most of them, even) are rather the same. The streets are more crowded with newer cars, but the monuments, and the light, and the feel of the place isn't so different, not in the large view. The one more serious thread here is whether a girl in Hepburn's position should feel free to feel free. That is, can a member of the royalty really do what she or he wants sometimes, or all the time? I've heard some people really think she has to be true to her role, that she isn't free at all, but has an obligation to fulfill her station in life. And others say that everyone should have the right to choose their own destiny, even if it means disrespecting the powers that be. This all relates to how you might take the end of the movie, because all the lighthearted joy and giddy tip of a romance get very serious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rome! By all means, Rome. I will cherish my visit here in memory as long as I live"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler's "Roman Holiday" is one of the very best, most charming fantasy/romantic comedies ever made. It is sweet, funny, simple, beautiful, and tender. It takes place in the eternal city of Rome during 24 hours that its heroine as well as every movie lover in the world will cherish for as long as they live. The heroine is a young princess, the sole heiress to the throne of an unnamed European country. One evening while visiting Rome, she decides to take a holiday from her royal duties and stiffing life style and explore Rome as one of commoners on her own. She is accompanied by an American newsman, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and his cameraman and sidekick, Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert).Everything and everyone is perfect and highly enjoyable in "Roman Holiday". Wyler's idea to direct the film entirely in Rome proved to be extremely successful. The script by Dalton Trumbo is terrific. Peck as a handsome journalist who seems to hit a jack pot with the story about a runaway princess that can make him both famous and rich but whose plans collapsed when he fell in love with her was perfect for a role. So was Eddie Albert in his Oscar nominated performance.The film belongs to Audrey Hepburn. With her blend of innocence, vulnerability, inner strength, and real class, she was perfectly cast in her first Hollywood role that brought her the Oscar. Hepburn was the daughter of a Dutch Aristocrat mother and a British father. She spent the WWII years starving and hiding from Nazis in occupied Holland. The article from the time of "Roman Holiday"s release describes Audrey as an original, "A thin child-woman with irregular teeth, wide jawbone, flaring nostrils and upswept brows, yet she carries herself with ethereal grace and entrances with a smile both wistful and radiant, and has remarkably large and expressive eyes." Gregory Peck predicted from the very first day of shooting that Hepburn would win Academy Award for her performance and she'd become a huge star. She went to many screen successes including "Sabrina", "Breakfast at Tiffany", Charade, and "My Fair Lady" among others. Her death from cancer in 1992 at the age of 63 left a gap that will never be filled. There will never be another Audrey Hepburn but the final scene of her first film with the close-up of her marvelous face and that "wistful and radiant smile" will live forever as one of the cinema's most precious images.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I just rented and saw Roman Holiday, weird thing is mainly because of my books "1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die" and "501 Movies You Must See", both books recommended Roman Holiday. Not only that, but would you believe I have seen 1300 movies, and I have never seen an Audrey Hepburn movie? Crazy, I know. But I figured if I'm going to start, why not with her Oscar winning role? Roman Holiday is a simple, yet nevertheless, entertaining romantic comedy that I'm sure you'll get a smile out of. It's just beautifully done and makes you feel very good.Anya is a princess, so used to her busy and hectic scheduled life, she's actually now getting very sick of it. She wants to have one day where she could just be a normal person, while touring Italy, she breaks down one night about her hectic life, her doctor gives her some sleep medication, but she sneaks out before it kicks in to go for a night on the town. But Mr. Bradley, a journalist, finds her asleep on a bench, and offers her a night in his little cheap apartment, but when he finds out who she is, he takes this opportunity to get a real story for a lot of money, not revealing his true identity to her and vise versa with her, but he shows her the day of her life time and they fall for each other. Only one problem, Anya knows that she must soon return to her life of scheduled hectic life.Roman Holiday is a beautifully made film that I'm sure anyone could enjoy. It's one of those films that is just impossible to not like, Audrey and Greg had great chemistry and I just miss these old romantic films, they have such a magical charm to them. I would highly recommend Roman Holiday, it's a film that truly captures a day of making wishes come true with someone that you care about.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film That Made Audrey Hepburn A Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Holiday (1953): Starring Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Eddie Albert, Hartley Power, Hancourt Williams, Margaret Rawlings, Paolo Carlini, Tullio Carminati, Claudio Ermelli, Paola Borboni, John Horne, Henz Hindrich, Alfredo Rizzo, Laura Solari...Director William Wyler, Screenplay Ian McLellan Hunter.Director William Wyler's 1953 "Roman Holiday" was yet another triumph for him as director, it was the film that launched the career of Audrey Hepburn, and a thoroughly well-made and touching romance straight out of the early 50's so beloved by the public it won the Oscar for Best Picture. William Wyler had previously directed great stars before this film. In 1938, he directed "Jezebel" which starred Bette Davis in a role that she credited as her first great performance and gained her notoriety as a star, earning her an Oscar. In 1949, Wyler directed Olivia De Havilland in "The Heiress" for which she also won an Oscar. For a star to work with William Wyler meant success one way or another. Audrey Hepburn walked away with the Oscar for Best Actress (quite an accomplishment when you consider she had'nt made any American films) and William Wyler for Director. In Roman Holiday, Audrey Hepburn plays the beautiful and sensitive European princess Anne, who, tired of living a repressive public life and seeking to escape from its dull and stifling facade, runs away during a European tour, becoming familiar with the city of Rome on her own. The public press is totally unaware she has decided to quit the last leg of the tour and instead the press deceive the public by stating she's suffered a mysterious illness. She meets Joe Bradley, a photographer for a paper that specializes in celebrity news (like the Hollywood Reporter or People Magazine today). Together, they roam the city of Rome and fall in love with the city and with themselves. Ann looks at the world with new eyes and finds herself doing things she had never been allowed to do before - getting a bold new short haircut, eating ice cream and she is genuinely enthralled by the Eternal City. Joe has an ulterior motive. He is photographing her adventure in Rome and hopes to make good money off it but as they spend time together, they fall in love and he has a change of heart, opting not to expose the Princess. In its own way, this film, much like Sunset Boulevard criticized the movie industry, this film criticized the paparazzi and Hollywood press industry. It's not long before her royal connections catch up with Ann and she is forced to return to the public life. Joe returns the photos to her during a Farewell Speech at an Embassy, the last time they see each other. That long, final overhead shot of Gregory Peck leaving the Baroque interior of the building is priceless and one of the few great endings that year. It was also the first of its kind for a romantic comedy, which usually ended in happiness for the lovers. Gregory Peck was by this time an established star but the film was never about him, because this is the first great film Audrey Hepburn made in the US and she would only move on to bigger and better things. The cinematography is absolutely exquisite, expressing the new innovations in camera work as the decade of the 50's began. 1953 would see other great and modern films, including director Zinnerman's "From Here To Eternity". "Roman Holiday" also packed a powerful punch because that year ('53) was the year that Princess Margaret, sister to England's Queen Elizabeth II, went public about her relationship with the "commoner" Peter Townsend. Many people believed Princess Anne is either consciously or unconsciously based on the real life Princess Margaret. And the ending, which does not result in the lovers' happiness, mirrored Margaret's real life tragic romance. Filmed on location in Rome, we get nothing but gorgeous shots of the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, the Castel San Angelo and other monuments, but never in a such a hurried or showy way. Instead each scene flows to the next as Ann and Joe journey from one tourist spot to the other. Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck have strong chemistry and carry the film themselves. For me, this is Hepburn's best work with a leading actor, despite all the critical acclaim she received for later films with Humphrey Bogart/William Holden (Sabrina) and with Cary Grant (Charade). There is something truly moving about the unhappy princess who finds one fleeting slice of happiness in her life, a moment in her life when she learned to live freely and to experience the world on her own without owing anything to the future. Being the early 50's, we don't see Peck and Hepburn making love and we see them only kiss once but their feelings for each other are quite evident in subtle ways. This is an American movie classic and should be in every good classic film lover's collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are people in the world who scorn old black-and-white movies as boring and uninteresting. I'm not one of them. I am also a romantic, which I think is a must if you are going to see this movie."Roman Holiday" tells the story of Princess Ann, a young princess who is utterly bored with her life as royalty and so one night in Rome, she sneaks away from the embassy - only to fall asleep on the streets of Rome. She is found by an American journalist named Joe Bradley, who takes her home with him (remember, this is an old movie so don't expect any sex). He recognizes her as the princess, but goes along with her when she says that her name is Anya. "Roman Holiday" shows the one day that they spend together, and the memories that it will give them.When I saw "Roman Holiday" for the first time, I was blown away. It is made simply, and that is what makes it so perfectly beautiful. The story appears to be simple, but when you watch the movie you realize just how complex it is and you feel yourself being drawn into the world that these two characters live in. Since it is an old black-and-white film, you aren't distracted by all the colors and special affects. Instead, you just focus in on the emotions and on the two characters.Audrey Hepburn (in her debut role), truly earned her Oscar for Best Actress. She (her character) grows so much during the movie and you really feel like you know her. Gregory Peck is amazing. His facial expressions are perfect and well beyond anything that most modern day actors could achieve. He holds just the right amount of yearning, pain and total bliss in just one look so that you are immediately captivated. Togetehr, Hepburn and Peck have what I consider to be the best on screen chemistry of all time. I loved it.The ending is perfect (I won't tell you what it is though). I can guarantee you will feel a tear trickle down your face towards the end and that you will be utterly outraged when the end occurs. This is a movie for all hopeless romantics and for those who just want a good, sweet tear-jerking movie. A perfect movie for a girls-night out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most romantic movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Audrey Hepburn's debut in a starring role. She was 24-years-old and had appeared in two or three other movies but just in bit parts. Here she plays a reigning European princess visiting Rome who would like an escape from her daily regime of official duties, thus the title and theme of the movie, a Roman holiday.Gregory Peck plays an American newspaper reporter living in the Eternal City. We first see him playing poker with his cronies, and losing. His relative "poverty" and Princess Ann's fabulous wealth and station present a formidable barrier to their ever finding true love and marital happiness. Part of the fun of the script is in seeing how this will play out and how their differences are resolved in the end. I will give you a small hint: very carefully!The script comes from a story by Dalton Trumbo who is perhaps best known as the author of the anti-war novel, Johnny Got His Gun. Trumbo was one of the "Hollywood Ten" who were blacklisted from working in the industry during the excesses of the McCarthy era. He went to Mexico and continued working on film scripts but under assumed names or had his scripts presented by "fronts." In this case Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for Trumbo and won an Academy Award for the story. Later the Academy awarded Trumbo a posthumous Oscar for his work.Long time Hollywood studio director William Wyler directed the film entirely on location in Rome. He has a formidable list of credits going well back into the silent film era including such outstanding films as Wuthering Heights (1939), The Letter (1940), The Little Foxes (1941), etc. His clear directorial style and his attention to detail work well here. The sets in Rome are charming, especially Peck's bachelor apartment. The bit players, especially Peck's landlord are excellent and the events are dreamy in just the way a romantic meeting in Rome ought to be. Wyler is especially effective in presenting Audrey Hepburn in the most flattering light and getting the audience to identify with her.Gregory Peck's character should be a bit of an adventurous rake who finds that love is more important than money or fame, but it is impossible for Peck to play a morally compromised character, and so even as he appears to be using Princess Ann for his own ends, his behavior is always correct. I was somewhat amused to notice that at all times Peck appears wearing a tie! Eddie Albert plays Peck's friend, a photographer/artist. It is interesting to note how Hollywood's perception of the paparazzi has changed over the years. Here blood-sucking, intrusive greed does not exist. Instead we have noble self-sacrifice!I have seen most of Miss Hepburn's movies and I can say that she was never more enchanting than she is here. She is gorgeous and cute at the same time, charming and impish, sweet, regal and very winning. In a sense she started at the top with this film, garnering her only Oscar as Best Actress in 1953; but as her fans know she never came down off that pedestal. Even playing poor Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady (1964), there was never any doubt about the quality of her style and character.This is the most romantic film I have ever seen, perhaps partly because Miss Hepburn is so wonderful, but also because the script in a sense turns the usual woman's romantic fantasy upside down. Instead of the woman finding that the man she is in love with has fabulous wealth and position, it is the other way around!The ending manages to be realistic yet romantic. There is a hint of something almost spiritual beyond what happens. So convincing are Hepburn and Peck that one can almost believe the story is true; and indeed I am sure that Trumbo lifted the essentials of the plot from some ancient tale.I have a weakness for movies about unrequited love, or love that goes on forever, or love that is caught at some perfect moment and lives eternally in that moment. Roman Holiday is one of those near perfect movies that plays beautifully upon one of these themes.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>A captivating romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a sap for a good romantic comedy and this has to be included among my all time favorites. It is sweet, romantic, schmaltzy, enchanting and funny. Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is feeling overwrought by her royal obligations and tight schedule. She longs to be free of the burden of privilege, so one night in Rome she slips out of the royal accommodations late at night to see the city. The trouble is she has just been given a sedative, which has a similar effect to that which alcohol has on a lush on a bender. She is discovered sleeping near a fountain by Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), who takes her to his apartment to sleep it off despite his better judgment. Joe is a reporter who is supposed to interview the princess the next day, though he doesn't recognize her (extremely implausible, but alright, it is a necessary plot device and this was before TV was ubiquitous).When he realizes who she is, he plots to conduct a surreptitious personal interview with her by showing her around the town and not telling her that he is a reporter. What results is a charming jaunt about historic Rome that turns into instant love. There are numerous zany scenes and lots of slapstick humor, but it all works because Hepburn and Peck are so fabulous together.This film was directed by legendary director William Wyler (Ben Hur, The Best Years of Our Lives, Wuthering Heights), who chose wonderful locations throughout Rome to give the romance a storybook flavor. Audrey Hepburn won a best actress Oscar for her performance as the lovely and impetuous princess. It was a rich and adorable performance, which that was both captivating and amusing. The scenes where she was intoxicated were precious and her na?ve view of the world was endearing. Gregory Peck was dashing as the knave, with his understated flair for ironic and physical comedy. Eddie Albert (most famous for TV's Green Acres) adds to the fun as Joe's scheming photographer who spends much of the film getting drenched and falling down.This film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including best picture, director, actress, costumes and story. It won only three (actress, story and costumes) in a year dominated by `From Here to Eternity'(Eleven Nominations, Eight Oscars). It is a delightfully entertaining story that is as enjoyable today as it was in 1953. I rated it a 10/10. If you enjoy romantic comedies, you can't go wrong with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn: Princess of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A flat-out amazing movie. William Wyler, famed director of "Ben-Hur" [1959] among others, is the perfect director for this film. While not noticeable in the way some films of the 60's and 70's were, the directing technique in this movie is original and very good. Wonderful use of the camera for sure. Especially in the exciting climax of the movie. Also it was filmed in beautiful black and white that really adds to the picture.The screenplay by Ian McLellan Hunter and John Dighton is very charming. With a script this good you can see why so many marquee stars of Hollywood were attracted to this project. Many memorable scenes stem directly from the witty dialog.The acting in the film is, of course, amazing. Audrey Hepburn screen debut is the one she received her, regrettably, only Oscar for. But boy did she deserve it. As soon as I start talking about Ms. Hepburn I speak only in hyperbole. Obivously the best actress ever, bar none, Her screen presence, charm and beauty radiate off the screen. Gregory Peck does a pretty good job himself though. He slowly becomes intoxicated with Ms. Hepburn throughout the movie, as I'm sure any man would in a similar situation. Eddie Albert is thrown into the mix for some comic relief and he is quite funny but the movie is really about the two leads.Set in the stunning beauty of Rome this is one of my all-time favorite romantic comedies. What a great film. Truly a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an enjoyable film this is, who could ask for more Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, Rome and a love story that is actually true to life, i.e not a happy ending.So it's got that "It happened one night" feel about it, similar story, only this time it's a princess running away from her stifling responsibilities. The princess in question is Audrey Hepburn in her first starring role and what a delight she is, capturing the spirit, venerability and naivety and at the end producing such controlled emotion that she was truly deserving of her best actress Oscar. Gregory Peck plays, with his usual adeptness a newspaper man, pretending to be ignorant of her identity so her can take her round Rome and get an exclusive story. Needless to say they fall in love and at the end he does not publish her story and they go their separate ways because she has a duty to her country.It makes you want to go and see Rome on a moped, and it makes you want to fall in love. Especially with Audrey Hepburn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to be churlish not to like this film, which introduced Adrey Hepburn to the world. It's fun, and raises interesting issues regarding duty, integrity and love. Gregory Peck is the perfect journalist. Aided by Eddie Albert (in a good supporting role) as his best friend, the film traces a day in the disappearance of Princess Anne (Audrey Hepburn).Thankfully the world has altered (I'm not a royalist, personally!) but the film still manages to "speak to" an audience some 50 years later. It's an interesting movie, looking at love and attraction.There is a palpable chemistry between the two leads, and this film is a good example of romantic comedy: despite the lightheartedness, this film hints a lot about values and decency, yet is not moralistic or stodgy.It's a delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing date movie with oodles of intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Trumbo we decided to watch one of the films of which Dalton Trumbo wrote the screenplay for. Roman Holiday is a 1953 American romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. Hepburn won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance; the screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003. On December 19, 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.The DVD sat on my shelf for the longest time and I am so glad I took it out to watch. The screenplay is subtle, filled with nuances that Hepburn and Peck teased them out beautifully. I can hardly detect an air of pretension and emotional manipulation. This is as romantic as it gets between a princess and an everyday man. The ending in the big hall really hits the spot. So much is left unsaid but yet what is said speaks volumes. It never betrays the tone of what the film sets out to be but yet my heart was beating with the full desire of wanting to see the relationship go a certain more familiar way. This is an amazing date movie with oodles of intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautifully charming comedy film that everybody knows as the film that made Audrey Hepburn's career. It was also superb advertising as everybody then ran out to buy on of them vespa scooters. This is one of Audrey's best films, I feel in future films she tended to over play her roles somewhat but in this she is just perfect. The soundtrack of this film is equally amazing, kudos to Georges Auric on that score (pardon the pun), I guess if modern soundtrack styles were applied to this film we might have ended up with Perry Como some Dinah Shore and even some Frankie Laine, but in my opinion that would just have ruined it. I truly the believe that Auric's film score just gives a little bit of extra magic to this movie. Can I say looking at the way modern films are made this one is just simply put a miracle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two.Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented.The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants.The two movies are packed with actor talent.Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphry Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923).Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling.The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome.New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is.At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points).The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things.The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way.Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family).Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career.But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all.She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954).A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954).----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.Email Tex Allen at TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Visit WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen for Tex Allen movie credits and biography information.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" Rome. By all means, Rome. I will cherish my visit here in memory as long as I live." Princess Anne ( Audrey Hepburn) is touring Rome, on a highly publicized tour of European capitals. She begins to rebel against her restricted, regimented schedule, and one night Anne sneaks out of her room, deciding to get 'out and about' away from her normal life, escaping her luxurious confinement.She then meets Joe Bradley, ( Gregory Peck) an American newspaper reporter stationed in Rome, and his photographer friend (Eddie Albert), who show her the sites. At first, Bradley is initially more interested in a story than the Princess, but not long after he meets her, he begins to fall for her.This film stands out for one main reason, Audrey Hepburn! :blush: Audrey Hepburn was one of a kind! She exudes charm, intelligence, elegance, and beauty. Just one look from her could disarm Gregory Peck, and the audience forever.Gregory Peck is great as always, as the handsome, gentle, hero. There is something about Peck- he was always a statue of strength, he had a real presence to him....something that sadly is lacking in Hollywood these days.This film directed brilliantly by William Wyler is a feast to the eyes, for both the stars involved, and its glorious cinematography- of Rome as a background. This was Hollywood at its best and it is one the most enjoyable films of all time.Favorite scenes include: the scene where Hepburn first realizes where she is..." Good Morning," she says with a giant smile! Ahh, that big smile! The motorbike scene with Eddie Albert's reaction, priceless! Oh, and the famous, mouth of truth scene, where Peck sticks his hand in and completely fakes her out. (Which Peck did on one take, without telling Hepburn what he was going to do)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful romantic fairy tale of runaway princess and journalist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an enchanting comedy romance, something of a fairy tale. Its memorable qualities lie primarily in its two leading stars, who are both perfect in their roles. Audrey Hepburn is radiantly beautiful and quietly spirited as the wispy young princess of a country unspecified, finally free in an exciting foreign city. Gregory Peck plays to perfection her steadfast and honorable journalist escort around Rome.The movie tells the story of lovely young Princess Ann who is on an official European tour. Having carried out state functions in London, Amsterdam, and Paris, she arrives in Rome...before her next stop, Athens. By this time she has grown weary of the grueling and rigid schedule of dedications, luncheons, balls, news conferences, and other ceremonies she must attend, dreaming of life as an ordinary carefree tourist. She manages to escape her temporary Embassy residence and encounters an out of luck American journalist named Joe Bradley, who recognizes her and plans to do a story. However, he ends up instead as a sort of tour guide to Rome, with the runaway princess blissfully unaware that Bradley knows her true identity and intends to use that knowledge for profit. Princess Ann has 24 hours of glorious freedom... long enough for feelings to develop between her and her guide.Hepburn depicts with equal brilliance both aspects of the princess's persona. Her Royal Highness is elegant and serene at the official press conference and ball, surreptitiously slipping off one uncomfortable slipper and later inconspicuously retrieving it to maintain her air of poised grace. Later, traveling incognito as Anya, she is adventurous, whimsical, and charming with her elfin like short hair as she enjoys an ice cream cone, zips through the streets of the Eternal City on a scooter, and dances with her handsome American escort at a barge on the Tiber River. The movie was filmed entirely in Rome and I love the background scenes of the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and so forth. Also, Bradley's charming little bachelor apartment makes the perfect spot for the princess's unexpected sleepover, wearing her reluctant host's pajamas! Bradley does not take advantage of the situation, either during her earlier drowsily drugged state or later when the sophisticated yet equally naive princess innocently asks him to help her undress.Too soon her fairy tale comes to an end, and the princess must choose between newly kindled love and royal duty. Her escort, Bradley, must in turn decide which comes first, his integrity and his heart or a news scoop. Duty prevails for Princess Ann, while Bradley's love triumphs over the news story and winning the wager he has also placed on obtaining it. Their parting scenes at both the Embassy gate and the following day's press conference are compelling. Surely no face but Gregory Peck's could capture such an expression of loss and regret.A tear can also be seen lurking in the princess's eye during her formal press meeting with Bradley, but there's a sense that both her brief taste of unscheduled freedom and her experience of first love have given her maturity and self assurance. It will be a dutiful but somewhat altered princess returning to her home country after this European tour. At her Embassy suite after leaving Bradley, she takes charge of her handlers, announcing very confidently that she does not wish her customary bedtime snack of milk &amp; crackers. Also, when questioned about her city preference next day at the news conference, she begins with the standard reply that all had their unique charms. Later, however, she again confidently speaks the truth...that her favourite was definitely Rome. Likewise, although the formerly pragmatic and rather cynical journalist, Bradley, realizes the lovely princess is trapped forever in a world of obligation, his own life seems forever changed by their brief encounter. Bradley's photographer sidekick, Irving Radovich (competently played by Ed Albert), has originally intended to publish his sensational photos of the unrecognized princess touring about, but instead gives them to her as personal souvenirs of her wonderful Roman holiday. This is a lovely old fashioned tale and truly a classic that no romantic should miss.</fullReview>

Audrey is simply beautiful, Rome looks stunning, Gregory Peck is pretty slick and solid in a sort of Cary Grantish way. It even manages to communicate quite a bit of sexual energy which, given that when it was made naked flesh was very much a no-go area, shows that romance can be just as powerful as raw sex appeal.You could worry that it isn't very deep, it doesn't really try to break new ground and that the ending is a bit empty. However, as Ron Manager might have said, the lads give their all and at the end of the ninety minutes clichés can be pretty good fun.</fullReview>

Princess Ann is tired of living in the fish bowl, and one night, she escapes the compound and meets Joe, who thinks she's drunk (but actually sedated).Joe, in a moment of weakness, takes her back to his apartment to let her sleep off the "hangover". Only the next morning does he realize the true identity of this stranger. He calls his friend Irving (warmly played by Eddie Albert) in a scheme to get the big scoop: a story and pictures of the young princess doing very un-princess like things.Princess Ann goes along with the ploy, not knowing their true motives but realizing an opportunity to be no one.We follow them throughout the day as they laugh, play, and bound.

According to Joseph McBride's biography, Capra bought the story "Roman Holiday" from Ian McLellan Hunter. Hunter, who fronted for blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo, said Capra (who was having his own problems with HUAC and was even accused of being a communist by a Hearst paper's columnist) did not know the original story was Trumbo's.Capra, who envisioned Elizabeth Taylor and Cary Grant as the leads, supervised Hunter's writing of the screenplay for 14 weeks. Hunter recalled him as disengaged and dispirited, unwilling to fight tightfisted Paramount Pictures, which refused to spend any money on location shooting. When he left Paramount, Capra turned the project over to William Wyler, who was better able to twist the studio's arm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superior performances by both</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck were both perfect for their roles. The acting that went on between them was magic. This was Audrey's first movie and having her paired with such a great actor brought her out into the open in the movies. Her acting was so great that it almost stole the movie from Gregory Peck. THe theme of this movie is one that has been used many times over the past years.The wonderful tale of a princess wanting to lead a normal life and finding love along the way. This movie also shows us the theme of ones duty's coming before one's own wants. Even though these themes have been used in countless movies over the years it comes more alive in Roman Holiday than in any other movie. With an exceptional ending, this movie will go down in history as one of the greatest classics of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Roman Holiday" is Princess Anne's story, one mad-cap day of freedom away from a highly constricted life. She is intelligent, sensitive, aware of her duty as 'heir to the throne', yet she yearns for a 'normal' life. With reporter Joe Bradly's help, she has her mad-cap day of being normal, and finds love. They both do. In the end, Bradly gives her unselfish love in the form of a 'gift' that costs him quite a bit of money.And for the first time, after seeing this film about 10 times, it struck me that it has a sad tone. That was the only day in her life that she has had, or will ever have, pure unqualified, unselfish love. Even her eventual marriage will most probably be for 'reasons of state' rather than for love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is such thing as a perfect film, this is it! Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn, how could it get any better? Peck and Hepburn have such great chemistry and work so well together. I personally wished they would have made another film together. This film really proves that Gregory Peck can do comedy. Some people feel he is a better 'serious' actor. But Peck really shows his funny side in Roman Holiday.This movie has everything from laughter to tears. It is not a romantic movie that is long and boring, with tons of kissing. The romance in it is perfect.So check out Roman Holiday, you will love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peck is an American journalist in Rome. Hepburn is visiting royalty who breaks free from her entourage and happens to end up sleeping it off in Peck's apartment. When Peck shows Hepburn the town she doesn't think he knows her identity. Meanwhile Peck has enlisted his photographer buddy (wonderfully played by Albert) to take candid pictures of the Princess for publication. There's some interesting stuff behind this one - supposedly, Peck was winding things up with his then-wife, and the star chemistry is for real. Also, there was at least one other ending seriously considered (it's not too hard to guess that ending). Part of the magic is the respective leads' chosen innocence and morality, something for which Hollywood of today wouldn't have near enough discipline. A unique and fanciful experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman Holiday is excellent without a doubt!!! Instead of having the true fairy tale ending it gave us a bit of reality. I was disappointed with it at first, but then realized that not all life ends like a fairy tale. This movie showed me that. Both people made sacrifices for who they loved. It was a true romance and comedy driven film. When I saw it I never knew how funny it really was and at the same time is a drama and romance. I watched this movie with my mom and grandma, it is a film for all ages. My mom reminisces about when she first say it and how she loved it and still loves it. Gregory Peck is one of my favorite actors, he will always be. He was great in To kill a Mockingbird, which was the first movie I saw with him in it and I just adored him and his acting since. I know I sound old writing this, but I am not. I just love to watch old films and I love to see the old actors. Acting is fun and they are more of role models for me than some of the actors out now today. I think that watching older films is something my family and I can do together, so I guess that is why I like them so much. As a child you do not really appreciate old films until you get a little older and that is how it was with me. Well, any ways this is one of the greatest films I have seen all year and of all time!!! I think that everyone should see this movie!!! I truly think it is one of the greatest out there!!! The acting is awesome!!! So everyone go see it and have a good time when you watch it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adorable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of this movie has been reused so often it's become a stereotype; a prince or princess tired of the stuffy royal routine sneaks off to see what life is like outside the palace walls. Usually the result is an obnoxious royal whining about housework or expecting to still be waited on hand and foot by others, but this is the exception. Audrey Hepburn's princess is charming and innocent. She takes delight in trying for the first time simple things others take for granted, like eating ice-cream, dining at a quaint open-air cafe, going sightseeing, even just getting to choose her own haircut (which is completely adorable!), and it's that childlike wonder of experiencing life for the first time that draws us into her character. I'm sure that's also what draws Gregory Peck's reporter in. He sees nothing wrong, at first, with selling out the young princess for the sake of a bet and a news scoop, but through the course of the day's events, he finds himself genuinely falling for her. In the end, love wins out, and though he really could use the money, he finds he can't betray her. In a more modern movie, we would expect the two to run off together, but in a way I think it's better as it is. She knows it would be selfish to abandon her family and countrymen that way, and that's not who she is. But even good responsible princesses could use a holiday once in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Romance Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's plot is very creative and original, yet at the same time embracing a certain cliché and cheese that is to be expected of classic films of this caliber that set the standard for romantic comedies. For Audrey Hepburn's debut is very strong, and it is a very proper introduction into the cinema world for this terrific star. All three of the main roles (Hepburn, Peck, and Albert) did terrific jobs, being the overwhelming backbone of the film. I found the simple story to be very pleasing, and the shots of Rome were very terrific. I was very impressed with the general feeling that the film is able to exude by merely shooting it with the backdrop of Rome. This film is very classic, and rightfully so -- everything from the love story to the moral message were terrifically delivered by director William Wyler; it is a must see for people who enjoy romantic comedies on any level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Star is Born</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even today, almost a half-century later, there is excitement in watching "Roman Holiday." How even more thrilling it must have been to be in a 1953 theater, watching this story unfold, and knowing that you were witnessing the birth of a truly remarkable star.Of course, that star is Audrey Hepburn, and her American film debut earned her a Best Actress Oscar and the hearts of millions. Miraculously, "Roman Holiday" still holds up and doesn't collapse under the weight of years and myth.The story is simple and well-known (POSSIBLE SPOILERS): Princess Anne (Hepburn) is a young, popular European princess on a goodwill tour of Europe. In Rome, she finally tires of smothering protocol, slips out of her embassy disguised as a schoolgirl, and meets Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), who takes her on a whirlwind tour of Rome. Bradley is a newspaperman, unbeknownst to Anne, and is recording this carefree day with the intent of selling the story and accompanying photos for a high sum. Of course, Bradley falls in love with Anne; she returns to her duties as princess an even more regal and endearing leader thanks to having discovered love, and Bradley loses some of his cynicism as he forfeits the story (and its price) for the sake of his love.Don't be put off by any details of the plot which may sound trite. Of course, the very idea of a princess running away from the palace to mingle with the commoners requires the suspension of disbelief anyway. The script is so well-written, and the performers are so persuasive, natural and beguiling, one cannot help but believe in it, as well.As Princess Anne, Hepburn never hits a false note. While radiating, even at that early age, the serene elegance that would become her trademark, she also projects a charming awkwardness that fits Anne's naitivity and youth. This writer, I think, fell in love with her in the moment that the Italian hairdresser tells Anne that she is the prettiest girl. There is a moment of shock that crosses Audrey's face, then a shy and utterly delighted smile--as if she's never been told she was pretty before. Such scenes as Anne on an impromptu, reckless spin on a Vespa, could come off as contrived or forced in other hands. Hepburn's joy and exuberance are contagious, and we willingly go along for the ride. The ending, too, is extremely satisfying (SPOILER CNT'D!): Anne, having returned to her royal duties, holds a press conference at which Bradley is present. They can only express their mutual affection and sadness through their eyes--a trick which invites silent-star-mugging, but which Hepburn and Peck carry off effortlessly. At the close of the conference, Bradley remains after all the other journalists have left, perhaps hoping that Anne will reappear. Then, slowly, he walks down a long corridor, toward the exit. Throughout this long sequence, one expects (hopes?) that Anne will reappear, cry "Joe!", and rush into his arms as the studio orchestra swells to a big Paramount Pictures finish.But she doesn't. Joe keeps on walking. And, even though our hearts have dropped, it is the perfect ending. A "fairy tale" ending would have cheapened and lessened the film. Instead, there is the bittersweet knowledge that Anne has learned through her one-day experience of complete freedom (her perfectly-played confrontation scene with her advisors and chaperones, as well as the press conference scene, conveys this wonderfully), and Joe has learned a few lessons as well.This is as good a time as any to point out that, though Hepburn obviously steals the show, Peck is a fantastic leading man. Combining Cary Grant's smoothness with Bill Holden's ruggedness, Peck is the ideal match for Hepburn's first major pairing. He doesn't overshadow her, but neither is he a colorless sop. Eddie Albert is also extremely engaging as Irving, the smart aleck photographer, and Paolo Carlini is adorable as the Italian hairdresser who cuts Princess Anne's locks, and tells her how pretty she is. He may have been the first; we have lined up to echo his sentiments ever since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spalding Gray writes of a "perfect moment" which one strives to have on a holiday -- a moment in time where there's not a stitch out of place, and you can go home knowing the holiday has been worthwhile. For me, much of Roman Holiday is one sustained perfect moment.In fact, it's hard to believe the entire film takes place over little more than 24 hours. During this short day, Princess Ann rebels from her old life, falls in love and grows up enough to accept her destiny. And she even has time to stop for a haircut and an ice cream en route. Audrey Hepburn's transformation from a VERY young looking girl (honest, she looks 14 when she gets ready to go to bed near the start of the film) to a desirable woman is truly remarkable. No wonder Gregory Peck's character (and, arguably, Gregory Peck himself) fell in love with her. He wasn't alone. The film is nearly 50 years old, and it still holds that same power.In her first major film outing, Hepburn displays fine comic timing, and a sense of bizarre humor. Check out the subtle scene where Ann accepts what she claims is her first cigarette ... and then smokes it like an expert! Considering the temperature averaged around 100 F during filming, she also seems to enjoy her ice cream cone a little TOO much.For me the perfect moment of perfect moments is when Audrey (NOT Princess Ann) reacts with sudden fright when Gregory Peck appears to get his hand bitten off in the Mouth of Truth -- only to break into laughter when Peck pops his hand out of his "empty" sleeve with a perfectly timed, "Hello!" Apparently, this was a practical joke Peck and Wyler played on Audrey. For a few seconds, the real Audrey Hepburn is on screen for the world to see. It's a moment to cherish.Peck is his usual solid self -- and as a reporter myself, I can identify with the pressure Joe puts himself under to protect his big scoop. I should be so lucky as to find myself on the receiving end of a princess's affections. It's hard to believe that the Eddie Albert who plays Peck's bearded (and skillful) photographer is the same guy who went on to do "Green Acres." He's excellent here, and I'd give my eye teeth to have a cool lighter camera like his.It's sad the film was never made in color, but the black and white gives it such a classy feel, you don't miss it. And if you don't know the ending -- don't let anyone spoil it for you. Just have the hankies ready.This is one of the best films of the 1950s -- a relic of a carefree era long past and the precious debut of an actress who is still mourned years after her loss. .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, vivacious romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A super, classic romantic comedy. It's a pretty straightforward A-list matinée romance; the added twist being that Rome - place and people - is as big a star on the screen.Doing so much on location in a busy, Latin capital city must have been quite a gamble for Wyler. However, the vitality and verismo of filming al fresco really pays off. Rome is brilliantly shot, be it from a set position or from the back of a truck, tracking the couple on the Vespa. Yet everything is incorporated, nothing inserted. The public often stop to stare at the spectacle of the filming but the brisk pace of the story and the see-sawing between the characters and their magnificent backdrop takes one's eye off the necessarily clunky cuts.Even the local actors are all excellent, from the concierge to the carabinieri. Both Peck and Hepburn are equally compelling - there's a lot of spontaneity to their performances which not only serves their characters but also operates as a part of the New Wave feel to the movie that the location street-filming suggests. Eddie Albert's supporting role as Peck's photographer is also first class.A real achievement. Panoramic yet intimate, bursting with a youthful vigour despite (because of?) the hoch-formality of one's position and the grinding cynicism of the other. It's a exhilarating story well told in script, pacing and picture. Marvellous. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Roman Holiday' was Audrey Hepburn's breakthrough film, and won her an Academy Award. As the Princess Anya, Hepburn is luminous and enchanting. Her performance is natural, refreshing, and free of the obvious acting technique which would turn the whimsical spontaneity of her earlier work (this and 'Sabrina) into a more practised charm in 'Breakfast At Tiffany's' and 'My Fair Lady'. The great Gregory Peck co-stars as the news reporter who falls in love with Hepburn. Directed by the masterful William Wyler, and beautifully photographed, this film is a true delight.It's a wonderful love story. Hepburn becomes tired of the constraints of royal life during a tour of Italy and escapes into the streets of Rome at night. Peck so happens to come across her, not knowing who she is, and takes her back to his apartment (she is groggy from sedatives, but Peck thinks her drunk!). He soon discovers who she really is, and realises that he has the scoop of a lifetime- a report on 'The Runaway Princess'. She wants to explore Rome as a commoner; he accompanies her in her journey, documenting her day in Rome every step of the way with his photographer pal Eddie Albert. But the pair start to fall in love, and Peck's perfect plan goes awry.Hepburn's character transformation is stunning. At the beginning of the film she looks so young as the childlike Princess, with long hair and modest nightgown. At the end, she is a mature young leader with an understanding of the limitations and duties her position entails (with a short hair style to match). So many amazing moments shared by Hepburn and Peck in this film- her Vespa ride, the 'Mouth Of Truth', Audrey's first cigarette (which she smokes like an expert!), Audrey and Greg's dance, their final meeting etc. The ending is bittersweet, but fits the film beautifully. This would not be the classic it is today if it ended any differently (see it and you'll know what I mean).There are some long sequences, and it takes a little while to set up the action, but 'Roman Holiday's' good points far outweigh the negatives. Hepburn is never anything but convincing in her role, and the the filming of Rome makes the viewer feel like they too are exploring the city for the first time.There has been some criticism of Peck's acting in this one. Gregory himself realised it was Hepburn's film, demanding she get equal billing as he was convinced she would win the Oscar for her performance. The insightful Peck was absolutely right. But he is very, very good in his role too. Peck's quiet, measured style certainly benefited any film he starred in, and he is quite believable as the reporter (aside from the fact that he is impossibly good-looking, perhaps too gorgeous for a lowly American ex-pat in Italy).Catch this on the newly restored DVD. It's a beautiful, pristine print that makes another viewing of the film feel like the first. This is a monument to film-making in the Golden Age of Hollywood- a great romance, an enchanting film that the whole family can enjoy.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you feel when you create something so beautiful but you can't take the credit for it? How painful it must be when and you have to let someone else take the highest award for your creation? Well, Dalton Trumbo got the credit and an academy award for the screenplay of 'Roman Holiday' 40 years after the movie and almost 20 years after he had died of a heart attack. What a tragedy!This was Audrey Hepburn's first major motion picture for which she received an academy award as well. One of the most beautiful and graceful actresses of our times who plays the role of Princess Ann who sneaks out one night during her official visit to Rome. Her encounter with Joe Bradley, a reporter for an American newspaper is what becomes her "roman holiday". Most of the film was shot in Rome at real locales and has a wonderful feel to it. I was looking at some Piaggio brochure and it was mentioned against one of the models 'Audrey Hepburn rides this model in roman holiday', that's the kind of pride Vespa Piaggio takes about the fact that they were a part of this movie. That sure was a very beautiful scene and sticks in your mind like so many others in the movie.Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn together looked fabulous in this one. Easily one of my all time favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so "Roman Holiday" is basically a fairy tale. But Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck do such a great job with the roles that you can't not like the movie. The plot has pampered Princess Ann (Hepburn) touring Rome when she decides to leave her rich companions and see things on her own, at which point she meets reporter Joe Bradley (Peck), and they hit it off.If this movie is a fairy tale, then it's a very watchable one. If nothing else, we get to see the Eternal City in all it's natural beauty. And personally, I prefer to remember the recently deceased Eddie Albert for his role in this movie (he plays Joe's friend) and not for that awful "Green Acres"; and I of course will remember him for his environmental activism.But let's not get sidetracked. "Roman Holiday" is a beautiful movie, just like Audrey Hepburn was a beautiful woman. This is what classics are all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman Holiday is why we love movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies, the most contrived of the popular arts, can also have the most emotional power of those arts when then work. And Roman Holiday works. It's simply a magical combination of diverse and unreproducible elements that came together one magical summer in Rome.Audrey Hepburn, a young beautiful, multilingual war refugee was just catching the attention of the film world after abandoning a dance career. Everything in her background made her the ideal modern day princess.Gregory Peck, having established himself as the first great postwar leading man, in the mold of Jimmy Stewart, Clark Cable and Gary Cooper, was looking to demonstrate his comic chops and loved the script.William Wyler, a deft and non doctrinaire director, believed the character's emotional journeys and not his own psychological demons made a memorable film. He was no less an auteur for this, he just knew how to get the hell out of the way.Money! The studio had enough of it tied up by tax laws overseas that it didn't wish to repatriate it under Obama's( oops...Truman's) high tax rates. The solution...shoot a film in Rome with the loot.Rome....By all mean Rome...in glorious, sharp Black and White which allows tremendous depth of field in each frame. No fuzzy close-ups here. In almost every frame Rome is the co-star un-nominated for an Oscar.History. Europe was divided, in ruins, and yet still the wellspring of the American mind and soul. And there were two young princesses in England, one dating a commoner, that provided a real world context to the fantasy we enjoy on screen.Spoiler Alert. Finally, it is a romantic comedy about loss. The boy does not get the girl because she chooses duty over love. We love many during our lives, and lose most. Roman Holiday does not gloss over this, but shows why, in the end, we can never not take the trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Permanent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.We all have different solvents with which we are able to assimilate the world into our beings. With film, most people take it as intended, as the engineers desire. Its in my own makeup to experience the wonder of the creative process in the project. Sometimes the content of the film acknowledges that creative juice in something I call folding. Rarely do I come across a project where the attraction of the engineered effect is as strong as the wonder about what happens behind the curtain. This film does that.Here's the amazing thing: the script was written, the project turned on, the director, lead actor and location selected. The STYLE of the film was designed, after the fashion of `The Bicycle Thief,' which exploits the innocent face in a then shockingly natural urban context. All of this was engineered for someone who could exploit the material with a childlike attitude in a graceful adult body. All this was done to prepare for Audrey Hepburn before they even knew she existed! So there are several types of magic here.One type of magic is that she was able to inhabit the role. This can only be done naturally. There isn't much acting involved if you consider acting to be the craft of Streep, Moore, Blanchett. The DVD has some footage from the original screen test, where the camera surreptitiously filmed her after the test. She's precisely the same. The best part of this picture, the soul of it, is her natural reaction to the `eaten hand' trick.But the other type of magic is even more impressive: that the film industry - including technicians on both sides of the Atlantic - would all know exactly what type of film personality needed to be invented.My interest is `folding:' that's often where the contents of the movie say something about the way it is made. This business of truth or `acting' is a matter of folding; compared to Peck Hepburn isn't acting. Compared to Joe, Anna's lies are trivial. The business about leaving a `stage' and `going urban' is folded as well, and that depends on the most common notion in this kind of folding: that the guy is writing a `story' about what you see (usually of course a girl).Audrey would of course become a princess of sorts, at least the diplomatic sort we see here. After her holiday with movies, she became (for a longer period) an important icon of UNICEF.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the Press Still Showed Some Respect For Celebrities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trivia Question: How many times was the Best Actress Oscar awarded to an actress whose last name was "Hepburn"?Answer: Five times. Four times to Katherine Hepburn (MORNING GLORY, GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, THE LION IN WINTER, and ON GOLDEN POND), and one for Audrey Hepburn (ROMAN HOLIDAY). It's hard to think of the two Hepburns together (they never did appear together on film), but their is a similarity in their first Oscar films (in Audrey's case her only Oscar). Kate Hepburn had only made a few films before MORNING GLORY, where she played a naive actress determined to make it on Broadway. Audrey Hepburn made only a handful of films in bit parts (most notably as Alec Guiness's girlfriend in an early moment of THE LAVENDER HILL MOB) before she played Princess Anya, the runaway royal heiress who runs away from her diplomatic duties in a panic. Both are trying (in their Oscar roles) to come to terms between their careers and the real world. But the similarity goes only so far: Kate's character fully embraces the glitz of Broadway success without realizing that her career may not always be so successful (as C. Aubrey Smith tries to tell her). Audrey finds a degree of backbone when she runs away and falls for a reporter (Gregory Peck), and when she resumes her post from a sense of duty she does so on her own terms.ROMAN HOLIDAY was based on a story that was originally written by Dalton Trumbo, but was fronted by another writer who won the Oscar for the story (eventually Trumbo's widow got the Oscar in 1997). It has been suggested (I am not sure how truthful this is) that the real life story of the romance between Princess Margaret Rose of Great Britain and the war hero Group Captain Peter Townshend. It made big headlines in the early 1950s, as the Royal Family and Prime Minister Churchill scotched the romance (it was too reminiscent of the 1936 abdication crisis of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson, although Margaret Rose was not the immediate heir to the throne). If there is any truth to the connection, then the film's story gives Princess Anya a degree of personal success that was somewhat denied real-life Princess Margaret).Anya has been making a good will trip through Europe, visiting one major country after another. The last city/capital to visit is Rome. But she has gotten sick and tired of the officious people on her staff, and has a really big explosion. She flees the embassy, not realizing she has been given a sleeping drought in her milk. While sleeping on an outside street she is found by Peck, a newsman working for an American press syndicate. Due to the sudden circumstances, Peck has to take her to his apartment to prevent her from being arrested by the police. The next morning he discovers who she is, and decides to do a news piece on her day of freedom from her regular duties, getting his pal Eddie Albert (a photographer) to take pictures of her with his secret camera (inside his lighter). At the same time the government of Anya's country sends a plane of secret agents to Rome to locate and return her to the embassy. Many lovely bits in the film, such as Hepburn's haircut by barber Paolo Carlini (who never stops improving on his work - he even combs her curls while dancing with her that night). There is the difficult relationship between Peck and his boss Hartley Powers (best remembered as "Sylvester Kee" the ventriloquist Maxwell Freer - Michael Redgrave - almost kills in DEAD OF NIGHT): Powers catches Peck in a lie about completing an interview that Peck could not have done, but is fast to accept an offer from Peck for that article about the Princess. There is also the moment when Peck is dared to place his hand into the mouth of the God of Truth after Audrey has done so. And Albert keeps on getting knocked down or tripped before he spills the beans to the wrong person.With firm direction by William Wyler the movie is a bittersweet triumph, which ends with the only logical conclusion to Peck's relationship to Hepburn. But it is done with style, grace, and dignity, and is unforgettable.One final point: if Trumbo's story was based on the Princess Margaret Rose - Townshend Affair, present day viewing is affected by thinking of another popular royal Princess of a later generation. Thoughts of Princess Diane and her tragedy keeps popping up, especially when comparing the final actions of Peck and Albert towards Hepburn, as compared to the pursuit and death of Diane at the hands of paparazzi in Paris in 1997. Albert's final sacrifice of his work is a sweet moment at the conclusion of the film, and it certainly is light-years away from the harpies photographing the wreck of Dodi and Diane's limousine in the underpass. But then, in 1953 there may have been more respect for the rights of celebrities than there are today. We're the poorer for all that now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few weeks ago I said Judy Garland gave the best film performance ever by a teenager. After seeing this, I thought I would have to qualify that statement, but the fact is Garland would still have a slight edge even if Audrey Hepburn had been a few years younger.Hepburn does such a fine job here of being the sophisticated princess, but it is as the 'normal' teen that she really shines, at least for me. She is so adorable when she says she would love to be like other girls, and when she is found by Joe Bradley, who thinks she has been drinking.And Hepburn is so funny and so adorable in her scenes with Gregory Peck. Peck also delivers a very good performance as the less than confident reporter Bradley. There are plenty of other good performances here, including Eddie Albert as Bradley's photographer friend Irving. I have to say, though, I didn't see Albert's performance as Oscar caliber. I liked him a lot better as the high-powered lawyer trying to make it as a farmer.I saw 'To Kill a Mockingbird' a few years ago and thought Peck was great in that. I would like to see more of his work.I've seen only a few Audrey Hepburn movies. 'My Fair Lady' was great. I wasn't that impressed with 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', though Hepburn was adorable in that one. I want to see more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by William Wyler, "Roman Holiday" stars Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess who visits Rome. Here she meets Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), an expatriate American reporter. Hepburn's character wishes to be free of royal duties for a day, a whim which Bradley facilitates.The 1950s witnessed a wave of "travelogue movies" ("Summertime", "To Catch a Thief" etc), a wave to which "Holiday" belongs. Much of the film consists of Hepburn and Peck frolicking amidst beautiful Mediterranean scenery, she elegantly poised, he immaculately chiselled. Charming, frothy and fantastical, the film was one of Wyler's attempts at emulating the comedies of Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch. "Holiday" finds Hepburn as a commoner playing a princess playing a commoner. In real life she was the sickly child of a dead aristocratic line. She was then plucked from obscurity to become the princess of 1950s/60s style and fashion. It's a rags to riches journey which most of Hepburn's films ("Sabrina", "My Fair Lady", "Funny Face" etc) are themselves about.7.9/10 ? See Vincente Minnelli's "The Clock" for a better, similar picture. For a more subversive take on such "travelogue escapism", see Antonioni's "Beyond the Clouds" or the films of Wim Wenders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this film at a local theater viewing recently. I had never seen it and knew nothing about it going in, but it was great! You're told in the introductory credits that it was shot in Rome in its entirety, and the story features a young foreign princess who travels to Rome where she winds up escaping from her scheduled mundane royal life for a day to get into adventures with a gentleman who befriends her. Little does the princess realize that her beau is a reporter who is keen to her game of hooky.Audrey Hepburn shines in this movie, and Gregory Peck is impeccable. The film is in black and white but features good cinematography for its day. The script is lighthearted and fun. 8/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gregory Peck - usually when I see this actor in a movie, and in large part as I remember him from To Kill a Mockingbird and, of all things, The Paradine Case (why I don't more-so from his great turn in Moby Dick I don't know), he comes off as kind of upstanding and fine, but not a terribly charming presence on screen. Formidable may be the word most associated for Peck, and yet in Roman Holiday somehow William Wyler got a fantastic performance from him, full of warmth and great comic timing.It doesn't hurt, only helps, that Peck's playing opposite Audrey Hepburn, who is, of course, wholly beautiful and the ideal of a Movie Star (in caps) here. More than that - whether her hair is long or short, she's one of those beauties of the screen that the film camera loves to take in. It's mostly in the eyes, but it's really the whole package, her grace and own sense of comic timing that works so well. Take when she first gets out of her royal palace and goes about in Rome at night, increasingly getting tired until she's just mumbling a poem by Yeats (sorry, it's Shelly), and keeps nodding off with her new friend played by Peck.I sometimes don't like characters in romantic comedies, who may be more like figures of a plot wheeling forward than having any great personality. But between recently seeing The Philadelphia Story and then this, I have a better appreciation for this kind of ebullient filmmaking. Here especially the backdrop makes things lively, it's basically like you're there on vacation with them in the mid-section of the film, and Rome is of course the third star of the film, to use the cliché. I was worried at first the sort of colorful side characters might be over-exaggerated. And maybe a few are. But I think Wyler's casting of non-professionals helps a great deal, and even people with more than one line like the house-manager Peck's staying at or the cab driver get to have moments showing their character well for the sake of the story.It's a fairy tale set up - I could picture a Disney movie taking this very same path (actually, come to think of it, Aladdin had a few scenes that followed the Princess-Goes-out-in-Public sequence of events) - and it has that level of innocence. Even when figures who may bring doom to our characters come forward, such as the men in suits at the dance at night, they're just coming to take her back to the palace. The writing and directing has a lighter-than-air quality that is hard to resist, and in large part because the director gets Peck to open up a bit as a star, and makes Hepburn one in just under two hours.If you got a date, and they like classic movies, this is one to show them for its class, its real sense of fun, and the charm of the two stars. Not a great 'film' but certainly an excellent 'movie' in the old-time Hollywood sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ROMAN HOLIDAY is one of the best romantic comedies I've watched, and I'm not normally a fan of the genre. It helps that it contains performances from a couple of great actors and a wonderful setting in its depiction of a bustling post-war Rome. The film may have been shot in black and white due to budgetary constraints, but the lush photography really brings out the vibrancy of the city without it overwhelming you.The plot is the usual kind of unbelievable fantasy nonsense for this genre. Audrey Hepburn is a jaded young princess who just wants to experience normal life, even if only for 24 hours. To which end she escapes into the city and goes on various adventures with Gregory Peck, with whom she soon falls in love. The comic interplay between the two actors is expertly staged and it helps that Peck is at his very best in this one.ROMAN HOLIDAY has plenty going on in the storyline throughout and indeed it's very hard to find a part of the film that's not completely likable. I particularly enjoyed Peck's slapstick bouts with his associate, played by Eddie Albert. I'm also delighted that they finished with such a bittersweet ending; I would have hated anything else but this finishes the film perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Roman Holiday" is a comedy movie in which we watch a bored and sheltered princess who escapes from her guardians and spend a little free time alone and calm. In this time she falls in love with an American newsman and they have a really great time as they are all the time together and they are also inseparable. Although both of them know that this 'free' time will end so they have to do whatever they want very fast.I liked this movie because it shows us the utopia of true love between two people and also shows us the difference between the social levels that divide these two people. I also liked this movie because of the direction which made by William Wyler and he did great job on it. In addition to this we have a great interpretation which made by Gregory Peck who played as Joe Bradley and he was simply outstanding. Equally good was the interpretation of the beautiful Audrey Hepburn who played as Princess Ann (won the Oscar for the Best Actress in a Leading Role).Finally I have to say that "Roman Holiday" is a great movie to watch because it combines very well comedy with romance and the result from this combination is simply the best. I strongly recommend it to everyone because if you watch it I am sure that you will have a really great time and you will enjoy it very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman Holiday is a strong film in all areas. It gives two actors an incredible script and puts it to the beautiful backdrop of Rome to make one of the most memorable rom coms and creates two instantly recognisable characters. The combination of both humour and genuine sentimentality makes this film highly memorable and definitely worth the watch if you get the chance. The plot outline is simple enough. A sheltered princess escapes her guardians meets a boy and begins to fall in love. It's a clichéd story that's been done before the film was released and has been reused many times since. But whilst it does meet the clichés of the Romance genre, it uses them well and proves that the clichés can still be great. Together Peck's great charm mixed with the kind and playful nature of Hepburn makes for one of the most memorable romances put to film. At first they don't seem to have any real affection for each other with both of them using one another for their own benefit. Hepburn lies so she can have a day of freedom and Peck lies as he wants nothing more than a good story.But over the course of the film we really begin to see genuine affection grow between the two. It never feels forced, but instead evolves naturally as they begin to enjoy the others company more and more over the course of the day by becoming more playful with one another and bonding because of it. Largely this is because both Peck and Hepburn's brilliant on screen chemistry with moments like the Mouth of Truth scene being entirely improvised to add realistic charm to all their scenes. Mixed with this is the beautiful and romantic backdrop of Rome with their exploration over the city containing many memorable and beautiful settings. Everywhere they go is as new to the leads as it is to us allowing us to experience their journey with them. On top of this the beautiful sights go with the couples growing relationship to create an even greater feeling of romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though it has been told a thousand times, there is something to be said about a film that can touch you even when you know how the story goes. Its an escape movie. If you ever want to just escape from life and enjoy a nice tale of a princess trying to live a normal life and meeting a reporter along the way this is the film for you. Audrey Hepburn in anything is a good watch. But its the chemistry that develops as the movie furthers with Gregory Peck that makes this one special. It can be slow for the first 30 minutes or so but really as the film progresses and they explore the streets of Rome it becomes an instant classic.I have to say, there aren't many characters that are as slick as Gregory Peck's in this movie. He instantly reminded me of all of Cary Grants movies, as he just has a way of demanding attention when hes on screen. As the camera man says, the day was full of memorable images and events that transpire. Audrey Hepburn has to be one of the most beautiful women of all time. No matter the length of her hair, she also has great presence on screen. And the fact that this was her first starring role and won an Oscar for it just goes to show you how much a Hollywood legend she is. This is just one of those movies I will one day show my kids as the type of feel good but also somewhat sad adventure of what life is really about. Its about living life to the fullest as much as you can whenever you can. I really liked that Anne realizes that running away with him is impossible and still goes on to lead her country. Most Hollywood movies don't consider how unrealistic their love stories turn out to be but this one is grounded with reality. The last scene is stuck in my head as it was beautifully written, directed, and acted.One of the only complaints I had was the slow start. It takes awhile for us to get involved with the characters and the first 30 minutes drag a bit. But in reality its a film I will be sure to re-watch multiple times. One of the most enjoyable classic love stories you can find.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iconic classic and one of a kind. Script by Dalton Trumbo -- who was later "blacklisted" but that's another story -- is anti-Hollywood in every possible way, takes place in a foreign country, the stars initially appear mis-matched, and, most extraordinary, the ending, the hero does NOT get the girl. Considered the launchpoint for Hepburn's career. Like Rachel McAdmans in the present era (2013) she more or less "glows" on-camera and your eye is naturally drawn to her. Diction also one-of-a-kind. Has any actress today ever matched Hepburn's delivery? Way ahead of its time, the tale deconstructs the "princess and the frog" theme in a way that had never been done before. Direction by Wyler. Eddie Albert (before he reduced himself to TV roles) supporting Peck. And Peck was never more Peck-ish, the scene where he carries Hepburn, unconscious, to his bedroom had female viewers swooning in the aisles. The real question, does this hold up over the decades. OMG, yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Royal Romance in Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sparkling movie turns a royal tour into a very funny behind-the-scenes romance after a glorious, wedding cake opening. Audrey Hepburn as the princess of a small country plays the role of a royal icon on a visit to Rome. The royal visitor manages to escape for some fun with journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert). Made shortly after a youthful Elizabeth II came to the throne of Great Britain, this movie shows how public and media fawned over young royals. To a large extent, this is still as true as ever. A number of vignettes liven up this wonderful romantic comedy. The shoe scene is a light treatment of the perfection required by royals at every public moment. The hand in the mouth of the ogre gag is nicely pulled off by Gregory Peck. A night out dancing by the Tiber turns into a hilarious brawl. The spontaneous decision to have a haircut turns into a delightful change of hairstyle for the young princess.The show is still enjoyable today because royal ornamentation is always stunning and the story is a classic. Filmed entirely in Rome, the DVD version I saw is sharp in black and white with landmarks like the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain making grand backgrounds as action takes the viewer from palace to marketplace to bachelor apartment. This has to be one of Audrey Hepburn's signature roles, even though she was very young. Peck had already made his mark but is still youthful enough to pursue the princess. He is a great actor who always seemed to move and perform almost effortlessly in his early roles during the forties and fifties, as he does in this one. Eddie Albert is outstanding as his press buddy assigned to the royal tour. Another achievement in the great body of work by director William Wyler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a sucker for a 1950's romantic comedy like I am, than you will adore this film. Audrey Hepburn's charm shines in this 1953 Oscar winning film. This coming of age movie reminds us to take time for ourselves to remember who we really are and to follow our hearts once in a while. Hepburn plays a sheltered young Princess Anne whose life is structured and planned down to the very last second by her royal staff. While on the Rome stop of a goodwill tour of Europe, the stress of her controlled life finally gets to her. She is given a shot to help calm her down and sleep but before feeling the full effects of the drug, she sneaks out of her room and into the night streets of Rome. Gregory Peck plays a tall dark and handsome struggling American reporter stationed in Rome named Joe Bradley. After a late night of cards, he stumbles upon Princess Anne sleeping on the streets. He attempts to help the young lady home, not yet knowing of her royal status, but realizes she is far to intoxicated to help herself so he brings her to his apartment to sleep it off on his couch. It's not until the next day that Joe realizes that he has the biggest story of his career sleeping in his apartment. He encourages Anne to spend the day out doing everything and anything she has ever wanted to do, all the while Anne thinks she has fooled Joe into thinking she is Anne Smith, the student, but Joe's intentions are to sell his princess story to the press. As the day goes by, he realizes that this private day they have shared means more to him than the price he would get for the story.Spoiler!Anne's day in Rome with Joe helps her discover herself in more ways than she expected. She lives, laughs, and loves her way through Rome with Joe by her side. Most of the scenes with Anne and Joe are shot from a lower angle, I believe this was done to make Joe appear taller and more like a protector to Anne. But, like Cinderella, Anne rushes back by midnight to her royal responsibilities and she must say goodbye to her beloved Joe. In the closing scene, Joe is walking out of the royal press conference being held in a lavish and large room. You see the empty throne over his shoulder getting further and further away. He stops at the end of the room and looks over his shoulder. This signifies the distance and impossibility of his relationship with Princess Anne. The movie is only shot over a 3 day period but you feel as though you have witnessed Anne grow up in front of your eyes from a spoiled Princess to a lovely young woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An overprotected princess travels to Rome, where she befriends an American journalist ... that's the story told in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953), a romantic comedy classic starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn.It is a tender story that is about the desire you have to find the person who you really are, your desire to get out of social pressures and be yourself. It is narrated in a linear fashion and we see how the characters evolve throughout history, learn through everything they live.The story is simple and flows through the personality of the characters, how they react to the situations they face. We see the characters astonished to do things for the first time, go through changes to start over, trying to be someone else for people to accept them for who they really are ... all to finally build confidence and trust.It's a movie that offers a glimpse into the life of a person "lucky" by his social position, which apparently seem more extraordinary and simple for the luxuries and comforts, but despite that fails to be happy and admire the grandeur of the life "common", is surprised by what others do may seem ordinary.While Wyler directs this classic with great performances of Hepburn and Peck, in this story that could be a rare version of "Cinderella" but that account so that the characters generate empathy with the viewer and make him spend some quality time.</fullReview>

He is excellent in the comic scenes and truly mind blowing in the romantic ones. The scenes are shot lovingly and the direction by Wyler who would go on to create the epic Ben Hur six years down the line is masterly.The one scene which still lingers in my mind is the first kiss between the two leads. It will give you goosebumps. This is a true classic, one which hasn't lost its magnificence even 70 years down the line. 4 out of 5 for this.

		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn Brought The Viewers To Their Knees In Roman Holiday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Holiday is a romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. The screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003 and in 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.Eddie Albert,Hartley Power,Harcourt Williams,Margaret Rawlings,Tullio Carminati,Paola Borboni and Laura Solari co-star to play key supporting roles.Princess Anne is weary of protocol and anxious to have some fun before she is mummified by "affairs of state". On a diplomatic visit to Rome, Anne escapes her royal retainers and scampers incognito through the Eternal City. She happens to meet American journalist Joe Bradley, who recognizing a hot news story, pretends that he doesn't recognize her and offers to give her a guided tour of Rome. Naturally, Joe hopes to get an exclusive interview, while his photographer pal Irving attempts to sneak a photo. And just as naturally, Joe falls in love with her. The film itself is a classic of romantic wish fulfillment, exactly the sort of beautiful lie that Hollywood specialized in.Audrey Hepburn gives the popular old romantic nonsense a reality it has seldom had before.Maybe it doesn't quite live up to its sterling reputation, and maybe the leading man and director were slightly miscast. But who cares? Roman Holiday is the film that brought Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees.That is why it was a great fun watching as the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the 1950's.Finally, this romantic comedy ranks as one of the most enjoyable films of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gregory Peck was already a movie star who got parts passed on by Cary Grant, another Hollywood legend. He played Jim Bradley, an American journalist working in Rome, Italy. Audrey Hepburn wins an Academy Award and audiences hearts in her first major performance in a Hollywood film as Princess Ann. Hepburn wasn't the first choice, Elizabeth Taylor or Jean Simmons, who were both busy and unavailable. Audrey Hepburn performed perfectly in this performance. Audiences believed her as Anne, the Princess playing hooky in Rome. Eddie Albert is unrecognizable as Jim Bradley's friend and photographer, Irving, who helps keep her identity a secret while she has an adventure of her own. The screenplay and writing isn't outlandish but realistic thanks to blacklisted genius, Dalton Trumbo, under another name. William Wyler directed the film and Edith Head was the costume designer. The film would earn 10 Oscar nominations and two awards for the film (one for Audrey as Best Actress) and another for Edith Head. This film reminds me of the golden age of movies in Hollywood where films were pieces of art put together by collaboration. Gregory Peck is stellar as Jim Bradley. Peck is always the gentleman who lets the Princess have her moment in her debut spotlight. Peck insisted her name be placed above the title and rightfully so. Peck and Hepburn make a dynamic pair and duo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best things about Roman Holiday is its cast. Alongside Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Pack, and Eddie Albert's incredible acting, all of the Italian actors in supporting roles act with so much heart and soul that they add great energy and juice to the film.Some of the details like the wonderful silent banter with the florist guy, or the music loving agent who is "crowned with" the guitar were just heartwarming. The scenario works so well that while you feel the uplifting romance in the escapade, you also feel the joy of a paparazzi in every picture taken. The two man's later on mental construction of the news story with the pictures spread on the bed was priceless. In so many aspects Roman Holiday is Hollywood at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and enjoyable romantic comedy with an unforgettable Audrey Hepburn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enchanting romantic comedy about a bored and sheltered princess (Audrey Hepburn , whose role won an Oscar) who escapes her guardians and falls in love for a reporter (Gregory Peck) who is aware of his true identity and spending one day incognito in Rome . The princess tired with her official visit to Rome and subsequently getaway walking throughout the streets . A journalist discovers his little charade and helped by his photographer (Eddie Albert) decides to catch in a scoop , but then love calls .This moving film contains a marvelous story love along with comedy , humor , entertaining situations and results to be pretty amusing . Wonderful romantic comedy with a charming Audrey Hepburn who brings a special blend of refinement , elegance and beauty that justly made her Hollywood newest star . Hepburn is top-notch and gorgeous with his sweet countenance , naive charm and agreeable interpretation . Audrey Hepburn won the role of Ann thanks to a legendary screen test. In it, she performed one of the scenes from the film, but the cameraman was instructed to keep the cameras rolling after the director said, "Cut." Several minutes of unrehearsed, spontaneous Hepburn was thus captured on film and this, combined with some candid interview footage, won her the role . Gregory Peck offers a splendid performance , he is ideally suited to the character of the attractive and upright journalist . Richly humorous acting from Eddie Albert as a sympathetic and botcher photographer . Truly stirring and moving final highlight with moments really sensible . Blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo was fronted by Ian Hunter as writer who accepted screen credit and the best Academy Award in Trumbo's stead . Many years later , in 1992 the Hollywood Academy voted to posthumously award Trumbo his own Oscar . Shot in black and white by Franz Planer and Henry Alekan , so that the characters wouldn't be upstaged by the romantic setting of Rome . This is the first American film to be made in its entirety in Italy and was produced by Paramount Pictures that had assets frozen in the country and was delighted to take advantage of the opportunity to film in Rome.The motion picture is compellingly directed by the maestro William Wyler . Wyler was considered by his peers as second only to John Ford as a master craftsman of cinema and the winner of three Best Director Academy Awards . Wyler was a great professional who had a career full of successes in all kind of genres as Film Noir : ¨Detective story¨ , ¨The desperate hours¨ , ¨Dead End¨ ; Western : ¨The Westener¨, ¨Friendly persuasion¨ , ¨Big Country¨ , but his speciality were dramas as : ¨Jezebel¨ , ¨The letter¨ , ¨Wuthering Heights¨ , ¨The best years of our lives¨, ¨Mrs Miniver¨, ¨The heiress¨ , ¨the little Foxes¨ , ¨The collector¨ and Comedy as two films starred by Audrey Hepburn : ¨How to steal a million¨ and of course ¨Roman's holiday¨ with Audrey at her Oscar-winning best and immortal comedy-romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman Holiday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar nominated director William Wyler (Wuthering Heights, Mrs. Miniver, Ben-Hur, Funny Girl), I recognised the title well, knew the leading actress, and saw it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, I was very keen. Basically Princess Anne (introducing Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Audrey Hepburn) is touring Europe, everyone knows about it, but all of the sudden she feels overworked and is bored of the royal duties and lifestyle. The doctor may give her a sedative to calm her down and help relax for a bit, but she wants some adventure, and at night secretly sneaks out of her room and onto a delivery truck into the city of Rome, Italy. Not long after getting out the truck however, the sedative she took takes effect, and she dozes off on a park bench, to be found by American newspaper reporter Joe Bradley (BAFTA nominated Gregory Peck), who thinks she is drunk. He offers her help in any way he can, and when it looks like he has to take care of, he takes her to his apartment, he is unaware of her real identity, even with her rambling royal things while still really tired. Coincidently, Joe was due to see the Princess at a press conference, and he goes to see his editor Mr. Hennessy (Hartley Power), who informs him that she has been "taken ill", this is a lie by the royal staff, and then he recognises her from a photo. Knowing he has Princess Ann in his apartment, he makes a bet with his boss that he can get an exclusive interview with her before anyone else can, and so begins his giving her a tour of the city. Joe gives her the fake name "Anya Smith", and after meeting up with his photographer friend Irving Radovich (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Eddie Albert) he offers him the chance to help with an interview, by having him take some secret photos. Taking advantage of her newfound freedom, Ann gets a haircut, and obviously she knows that he knows her identity, so she tells him her wishes to be like any normal person. After a dance with Joe, a fight at the club, which produced some great exclusive shots for the camera, and getting very close to Joe, she realises any romance can't carry on. So she returns to the embassy, meaning Joe can't win his bet, and knowing he had feelings for her Irving agrees not to sell the photos. The final scene sees Joe attend a press conference, and Princess Ann answers the questions the other reporters have, and from Joe, before deciding to shake hands with them all, leaving the room, and Joe slowly leaving wondering what could have been. Also starring Margaret Rawlings as Countess Vereberg, Harcourt Williams as Ambassador, Tullio Carminati as General Provno, Paolo Carlini as Mario Delani and Claudio Ermelli as Giovanni. Hepburn deserved her Academy Award for her first film role (although she has a small role in The Lavender Hill Mob), she is charming and beautiful, Peck is a nice guy in the story, and Albert is funny when he is on screen, it is a simple story with a nice slow love story, and a lot of the time it is really funny, a good fun and very watchable romantic comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design and Best Writing, Motion Picture Story, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Audrey Hepburn was number 13 on The Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a holiday with Hepburn &amp; Peck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Roman Holiday" is a classic romantic comedy about an exasperated princess (Audrey Hepburn) who slips away from her guardians in order to look for some excitement while in Rome. What she finds is American newspaperman Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), who keeps his profession a secret in order to snag an exclusive story. The pair experience Rome together and begin to fall in love although their relationship is built on deception.This is the film that made Audrey Hepburn a star. She is exquisite as Princess Ann and it's no wonder that she (deservedly) took home the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Gregory Peck is stalwart as always and has wonderful chemistry with Hepburn. Additionally, Eddie Albert received an Oscar nomination in support for his spirited performance as Joe's photographer pal. The rest of the cast is fairly forgettable but nevertheless quite capable.Possibly the film's best aspect is the Oscar-winning script by then-blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. The high-concept story may seem hokey at first but the script wrings every possible bit of drama out of the situation. Of course, watching Hepburn, Peck &amp; Albert together is also just plain fun, which makes the ending all the more affecting.William Wyler's Oscar-nominated direction is good as always and the film features a wealth of quality location work. The film garnered a number of Oscar nominations in technical categories, including art direction-set decoration, cinematography &amp; editing. Meanwhile, the Edith Head costumes won the film it's third of three Oscars.In the end, "Roman Holiday" is deservedly lauded as a classic nearly sixty years after its release. Don't let the seemingly shopworn premise dissuade you from seeing this gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No wonder this movie is a classic. There is no other movie quite like it.Princess Ann portrayed by Audrey Hepburn is vibrant with youth and beauty, and news columnist Joe portrayed by Gregory Peck is a total gentleman. Unlikely story that a princess escapes the embassy, and ends up in a apartment of a news reporter who doesn't take advantage of the situation (not knowing the she's a real life princess) is almost impossible in our day and age, but there were times when such innocence and shivery were still honored.Joe lends the princess 1000 lira which is about $1.50 in those days, and what does she do ? She gets a shoes, gets a haircut, and buys a gelato. Today, you might easily spend $150 on those items. It's just so charming to watch that such times existed.Today, you can't make a movie like this. First of all, such innocence wouldn't be believable, and second you can't find an elegant and beautiful actors like young Gregory Peck, and Audrey Hepburn. No other movie like it and I'm sure that alone will secure this movies position in history, but also you can't get the charming experience you get from seeing this movie from any of the current movie studios. Just fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't see how you could ever resist this movie. It's simply such a charming and delightful movie that you just can't help but liking.It's being somewhat of a screwball comedy but since this movie got made in 1953, it's not quite the same as the usual average screwball comedy, made at the peak of the genre, during the '30's and '40's. You could say that the movie is being less goofy and is more about the hearth and warmth of the movie, that makes this movie such a charming and delightful one to watch.Of course you could really say that the movie helped to made a charming one because of the great presence of Audrey Hepburn in it. You could say that this movie really was the breakthrough movie for Audrey Hepburn. Not only because she won the Oscar for it but also because it was the first time that she was playing the female lead within a movie. She had appeared in several movies before but mostly in some supporting roles. Sometimes she was in a movie for only a couple of seconds. What a waste of such talent and beauty, or at least of course it seems that way now. She is just the perfect woman to me, with her girl like charm and natural beauty and she spoke quite well Dutch as well, as she also demonstrates briefly toward the end of the movie. So if you look anything- or are like Audrey Hepburn, you can drop me a line anytime. The modern Audrey Hepburn of this time and age is really Keira Knightley, who can also always drop me a line at anytime by the way. Not only do they look similar from certain angles but both also seem to have something very natural over them and also act that way, though Knightley broke through at even an earlier age and seems to be more versatile as an actress.But of course we also really shouldn't forget about Gregory Peck in this movie. He was already being somewhat of a star at the time, though he probably has never shined more in a romantic role. He handles the comedy, drama and romance in this movie all very well and believable. I also liked Eddie Albert in this movie, who probably provided the movie with most of its comedy. He even got nominated for an Oscar for his role in this movie.The movie can be seen as a modern fairy tale, though modern probably doesn't apply very much anymore for an 1953 picture, but you get what I mean. It's about a princess who is on the verge of a mental breakdown and on a given night decided to go out and hang around in Rome with 'normal' people for a change, incognito. Reporter Gregory Peck soon finds out who she truly is and decided to take advantage of the situation for his own personal gain but of course soon starts to grow a soft spot for Audrey Hepburn. Who wouldn't really. The movie has simply a great story because it all feels quite smooth and natural and the movie doesn't luckily goes to over-the-top with its situations and comedy, though it very easily could had.It's also a good looking movie, not only due to its main leads, but also thanks to some wonderful looking sets and locations in Rome. Yes, this entire movie got actually really shot at location, which also made it a quite expensive one for its time and genre. The whole movie, directed by William Wyler, is just simply an irresistible one!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"At midnight, I'll turn into a pumpkin and drive away in my glass slipper."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was about time that I was introduced to one of the silver screen's most graceful beauties. Though I had caught a brief glimpse of her in the Ealing comedy 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951),' I had not yet seen a film featuring the lovely Audrey Hepburn. Indeed, prior to the release of William Wyler's 1953 romantic comedy, 'Roman Holiday,' neither had most American audiences. The role proved one of cinema's most astounding breakthroughs, and, not only did the film receive three Oscars from ten nominations, but among the wins was Audrey Hepburn for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Despite a considerable age difference between the two leading performances {13 years separated Hepburn and Gregory Peck, already considered an acting veteran} the romantic chemistry between the two stars works faultlessly, and the manner in which Joe Bradley's relationship with Princess Ann gradually transforms from frustration to exploitation to love is so incredibly natural that it must represent one of the finest romances of the 1950s - a lovely "backwards" Cinderella story.Princess Ann (Hepburn) is a royal princess from an unspecified European country. Her past weeks have been dedicated to a gruelling, highly-publicised tour of European capital cities, her every minute tightly scheduled. For the duration of her travels, Ann has been forced to maintain the pretense of an elegant, proper monarch, her time expended on tedious official duties. In an excruciating opening dance sequence, which is later contrasted with the jovial celebrations aboard the barge on the Tiber River, Ann is forced to waltz with a progressively older selection of male dignitaries, each more unattractive than the last. Though we're not explicitly told the princess' age {Hepburn was 24 years old at the time, though her character tries to pass herself off as a school student}, such a lifestyle is understandably ill-suited to such a beautiful young lady. One night, after being given a sedative to quell her restlessness, Ann secretly escapes from her country's embassy and decides to enjoy a stroll through colourful Rome. A gruff newspaper journalist, Joe Bradley (Peck), finds her sleeping on a street bench, and begrudgingly takes her back to his apartment.'Roman Holiday' really hits its stride in the second act, once Joe has discovered the Princess' true identity and decides to exploit her innocence for the purposes of an exclusive story. Photojournalist Irving Radovich (Oscar-nominated Eddie Albert, whose performance struck me as surprisingly modern) is dragged along to secretly take photographs, but his apparent inability to take a hint leads to the systematic destruction of his clean clothes. The final touching scene, in which the pair communicate their love and respect for one another through official allusion {"By all means, Rome. I will cherish my visit here in memory as long as I live"}, proves particularly powerful. The closing shot, a backward-moving tracking shot following Joe as he retreats from the girl he loves, has a noticeable sense of tragedy about it. Throughout the shot, we are almost waiting for Princess Ann to emerge in the background to proclaim her adoration, but, alas, she never does. After all, life can not always be a fairy-tale, but sometimes one day is enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect in every way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's, which immediately sent me into a complete fixation with her, searching for and watching as many of her films as possible! So when I came across 'Roman Holiday' I had high expectations, and I wasn't disappointed at all! To sum the movie up in one word, Roman Holiday is just PERFECT. I couldn't get over how lovely Hepburn was as the charming princess, her beauty dazzled me throughout the whole film. She plays the role perfectly, and her transformation throughout the movie from the posh, high - class princess to an everyday 'commoner' was terrific. Quite a few people who have seen this film have said that Cary Grant would have been better as Joe Bradley, but I'm afraid I have to disagree with them! I thought Gregory Peck was brilliant, playing the awkward, self doubting reporter. And considering he had never done a comedy before, I thought he was fabulous! I could write ALL DAY about this film, but to sum it up, Roman Holiday is dazzling, touching, sad and also a very real story. It is well worth watching. A must - see for all Audrey fans. If you haven't seen it yet, you haven't lived!</fullReview>

I wish the real life could be similar but with better final. Somebody has ask for a second part of Roman Holiday, it would be a mistake because nowadays it is impossible to replace Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck and besides almost always a second part has less quality. If anyone has not seen this movie yet, I suggest to do it. Greetengs to every one and my apologize due to my bad English.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, this is one of the best classic movies ever.It stars Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. Just those two names should be enough to make you want to watch this movie. :-)The story is great, it's about a princess (Hepburn) who visits Rome, Italy and meets a reporter (Peck) who wants an exclusive story about her. Pretending that he doesn't know who she is, he hangs around with her hoping to get his scoop. But the plot quickly changes when they fall in love.This movie's called a Romantic Comedy because it's good as a romance and as a comedy... there are plenty of funny scenes, but you don't find yourself wondering why they bothered with the romance like in a lot of other comedy movies.Great camera work, too.It's Not Rated, but I would give it a G. There's nothing dirty in here, and no foul language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure when this movie was made that it wasn't seen as much more than a piece of romantic fluff. But it has a winning combination of professionalism and spirit that keeps the movie alive 50 years after it was made.Gregory Peck can't bring himself to play the seedy, irresolute reporter that was scripted, and ends up more like Atticus Finch than Hunter Thompson. Still, his portrayal works because the movie needs a straight man to play against Audrey Hepburn's radiant performance.At its most basic, Roman Holiday is a classic of the genre of opposites attract -- young vs. old, foreign vs. native, rich vs. poor. However, it also works as a hidden identity farce, a simple travelogue for a beautiful city, and a showcase for a solid actor and winning actress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sigh! - **SPOILERS**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the DVD print. I had actually planned to skim through it, but once the film started, I couldn't help but watch all the way through - for about, oh, the tenth time at least. And it still makes me smile, and laugh, and cry. In the film, 'Anya'/Anne speaks of a lack of sweetness and decency in the world. And you know what? It doesn't sound hokey - just very sad, and very true. The cynicism that abounds everywhere today (especially in film) is suffocating. And 'Roman Holiday' is the sweetest, most decent antidote. There are many bits in the film that stand out: the opening scene where Anne is literally uncomfortable being in the shoes of a princess, the mouth of truth where Audrey's reaction is absolutely genuine, the scooter ride, her very first cigarette, Eddie Albert's photo session with the model 'fishing' in his studio (always cracks me up!), the dance on the barge, the kiss on the river bank, the sudden, passionate yet sad embrace in Joe's apartment - the list is endless. But I think the part that really clinches it for me is when Anne returns to the palace and is being chastised for running away from her duty as a princess. She cuts off the General firmly with something to the effect of "If I were not perfectly aware of my duty to my family and my country, I would not have come back tonight,", here we cut to a sublime close-up where Anne is barely able to contain her tears, and then, "...or indeed ever again." There is the slightest tremor in her voice which belies her composure. Anyone and everyone who thinks/says Audrey Hepburn is not really 'acting' but just 'being herself' in the film, just take another look at this single, remarkable shot - she conveys everything with these four simple words, expressed as only she could have.Bravo!</fullReview>

There is really nothing unique in this picture and it's kind of the same old story(the fish out of water-Hepburn- warming up to the normal guy-Peck) but it's done with such a warmth and genuine emotion and with very quiet but effective performances that it's hard not to get pulled in by it's strings. These kind of movies have been imitated many times but they don't always have the same results. This one is a classic in the genre and should be left on it's pedestal despite it's simplicity.

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Holiday is the most perfect film ever produced. Humor, romance, slapstick, dialogue, and most of all, poignancy. I had never seen an Audrey Hepburn film until a few years ago when my girlfriend (now wife) picked it up on video and said I would like it. I'm a big Gregory Peck fan, so I was like sure, I'll watch it. From the moment Audrey first appeared as the delightfully charming Princess Ann, I fell in love with her. I know that's a commonly used phrase when describing Audrey's performance in this film, but I don't know how else to describe it. I literally fell in love. I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, and I think most movies are worthless crap that have done more to destroy our culture than advance it. But my god this is the best film I've ever seen! I've probably seen it 10 times now, and every goddamm time I see it I fall in love all over again and in the end my heart is left broken. Audrey and Peck's chemistry is magical. The scenery is beautiful, even in black and white. Dammit, even Eddie Albert is wonderful! Every time I watch this movie I want to hold Audrey in my arms and kiss her and never let her go. I never felt this way about a stupid movie. But I can't help it. I refuse to own it. Why? Because I would spend all my free time watching it, to see if maybe, just maybe, this time they'll end up together. I end up catching it every few months on AMC, after which I'm in a funk for a few days. I know this sounds ridiculous, but this is the only movie that hits me so deeply, so passionately. I'm almost angry that it does so, but what can I do? "Well, life isn't always what one likes, is it?"What also bothers me is why these two never worked together again? Does anyone know? Please tell me. After Roman Holiday, I've found every other Audrey film to pale in comparison. The major fault of all of them is the lack of chemistry she shares with her costars (grouchy Humphrey Bogart in Sabrina; the laughable Gary Cooper in Love in the Afternoon; a decent effort by George Pappard in Tiffany's; the "I-bet-I-can-be-more-suave-than-you" performance of Cary Grant in Charade; I could go on forever). Audrey is wonderful and beautiful as usual, but the films are generally poor. Peck went back to the gritty hero roles (and was perfect in all of them), while Audrey was pawned off to every Hollywood romantic lead. I just don't get it. But then again, I don't think I'll ever get Hollywood.</fullReview>

I can see and sense the freshness of her style of acting and grace on the screen. Her characters naive and participation for adventure is carried out with utmost plausibility and envy. Gregory Pecks character has honor, and stage presence. Peck is a man's man. The scenes are completely shoot in Rome, Italy, and what wonderful backdrop that was. So scenery was the easy part here. The characters are strong and believable. The film is in black and white and I hope that it remains that way. Everyone can have fun watching this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favourite films..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn is charming and beautiful in this wonderful film. She is totally believable both as a princess, and as a "normal" citizen for a day. From the start we feel that the princess appears to have more human characteristics than the royal people she is surrounded with, e.g. losing her shoe, and also her exhaustion and frustration with having to remember unrelenting daily schedules and routines. This helps to draw us in to her character to such an extent that we later delight in little things such as Anya getting her hair cut, and seeing her discover what it is like to have the freedom of being just a "normal" person.. something that we all take for granted. She thoroughly deserved her Oscar for best actress. Not that this was a one person film, Gregory Peck is also great as the news-reporter, and we genuinely believe that his character goes from initially seeking to profit from the princess, to actually falling in love with her.The film is successful at involving us with the adventures of the main characters. We feel that we are actually tagging along with the romantic excursions, but not to the point where we feel that we are intruders. Hence we seem to share a lot of the characters' emotions. In the end we develop such sympathy for both characters that we feel their individual pains, and the hopelessness of their situations in that they are denied what they want because of who they are. Perhaps drawing the audience in, to the point where they are able to empathise with the characters, is where a lot of modern romantic films fail.. sure this film might appear dated in it's black &amp; white form on-screen, but the emotions are timeless.. and it more than stands the test of repeated viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was romantic, and there were some excellent 'drop dead funny' parts. By the end of this movie, you'lll probably want to just pack up your bags, buy a ticket to Italy, and get a motor scooter. The only part of this movie I did not like, though, was the ending. Some people thought that it would be too much of a fantasy, and too unbelieveable of a movie if Gregory Peck actually got to stay with Audrey Hepburn. But that's the ending that most people expected. I sure didn't think that the end would be that bittersweet. Actually, I ended up throwing my empty tissue box at the television set and yelling at Peck to turn right around and run into Hepburn's arms. But, of course, he didn't. What else can I say? Audrey was fantastic, as usual. She was graceful, witty, goregeous, and most of all, charming. Gregory Peck was delightful, sneaky, and pretty handsome. I adored this movie. It is a must see. Iwould just go right out and buy it if you are an old romantic or just love Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck's acting!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is a movie that I can never get enough of. It could have something to do with the fact that I believe Audrey Hepburn to be the most elegant beauty to ever grace the silver screen, but I do believe that the movie stands on it's own merits as well.The pairing of Hepburn with Peck was perfect in the fact that their opposites play off each other. Peck was charming and debonair, while Mrs. Hepburn was young and had that spark of innocence that just made you fall in love with her. Together they turned a classic story idea into a fun movie that endears itself on your heart and in the process gave birth to the legend that is Audrey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romantic comedy that touches the heart and make people believe in magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Holiday is a beautifully romantic movie, with Audrey Hepburn playing the role of a princess with such grace that it is difficult to believe she really isn't one. Of course, everyone talks about the perfection of casting Hepburn in this role. It is hard to believe that Hepburn had been self-conscious about her looks in this movie, her very first. She was so beautiful as Princess Ann that she radiated and made the entire world fall in love with her (even the Academy, since she won best actress). Her innocence and beauty shines and outshines everyone else, even Gregory Peck, as hard as that may seem.Peck was brilliant himself though, in a type of role that he didn't normally play. It was an astonishingly well-played transition from the normal character roles he had played previously. He was handsome and debonair in this romantic lead.The setting is gorgeous, of course, since it was filmed on location in Rome. The streets are busy and filled with life. It is easy to see why so many people travel to Rome to get a taste of the beauty culture.Roman Holiday is one of the sweetest romantic movies I have ever seen, because it is subtle and warms the heart. It also brings out faith in the human spirit. Hepburn's wide-eyed innocence is a perfect example of the beauty of life, from the first time she steps out into the wondrous magic of the real world.I recommend everyone to see this movie because of it's magical embrace of life and love.</fullReview>

Audrey Hepburn was just coming into her prime (and won herself a much-deserved Oscar), Gregory Peck was the perfect guy to play her leading man, and Eddie Albert is an ideal second banana. It's too bad that Audrey is no longer with us today but at least she's left us her remarkable heritage of films, books and photos to remember her and the formidable mark she's left on the motion picture industry. Here's to Audrey and her remarkable career!!!</fullReview>

I cannot picture any other actress on earth can be able to play the innocent and naughty princess as well as she did. Not then, not ever. This is one perfect movie.

		<shortDescription>Charming but less entertaining than you'd hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Holiday is a movie of its time and place. In more ways than one. We can't go back to 1950s Rome. Or 1950s Hollywood. The alluring city of Rome is a wonderful setting for the film. It's Rome as we'd like to remember it, a Rome that in many ways doesn't exist anymore. Life was just different back then. Simpler, probably happier, definitely more charming. The movie is also the product of a Hollywood that no longer exists. This is a movie with a very definite 1950s style and feel. Unfortunately that 1950s style doesn't always translate for the modern viewer. It was a simpler time in movie-making as well as life but this film is perhaps a little too simple for modern tastes. The plot is threadbare. The movie doesn't have much energy to it. It's all very relaxed. Too relaxed. For whatever charms the movie has it just isn't entertaining enough. There's just not enough going on.Aside from the wonderful 1950s time capsule look at Rome the film has one other thing clearly working in its favor. Audrey Hepburn. In this, her first major role, Hepburn is relentlessly charming. It's so easy to see why she would go on to become one of the world's most beloved stars. But all her charms aren't quite enough to overcome the problems with the story. The central problem being that there isn't enough of a story at all. Hepburn plays Ann, princess of an unspecified European country. She's on a grand tour of Europe, appearing before teeming crowds of thousands everywhere she goes. She is obviously a quite notably famous person. Which makes the fact that she goes completely unrecognized by anyone when she slips away from her royal duties to wander the streets of Rome more than a little hard to believe. Even the supposedly astute reporter who will become her companion on her little getaway has no idea who she is until he sees her picture in the paper. Mind you, this guy was supposed to be interviewing the princess that very day. Is he really that much of a dunce? And then this story, hard to believe as it is, just kind of sits there. This is a movie which could really use some bursts of energy to drive it forward.The story of a princess who longs to be a regular woman, to get out there and live and love a little, has its possibilities. But this movie doesn't do enough with its story. And for a movie billed as a romantic comedy the laughs are very few and far between. Hepburn is terrific, no quibbles with anything she does. You just wish the movie gave her the chance to do more. Hepburn's co-star Gregory Peck comes across as a little wooden and unnatural. He's a Hollywood legend in his own right but there's no doubt that in this film it is Hepburn's star which shines much brighter. Peck's character of reporter Joe Bradley is so bland you wonder how the princess could possibly find herself falling for him. Maybe after leading such a sheltered life she's just so grateful to have the chance to fall for anybody. But the romance never really rings true. At least there's Joe's photographer friend Irving to inject some personality into the proceedings. Irving, as portrayed by Eddie Albert, has got a little life to him. But that's just a supporting part. If the main character of Joe doesn't work, which it really doesn't, the movie suffers. It's easy to understand why Roman Holiday was so acclaimed and generally loved upon its initial release. It has some things going for it, the wonderful Hepburn first and foremost. But it's a movie with a style which suits the era in which it was made, not playing nearly as well today. Not a bad movie but not notably better than average either. For as much as Hepburn may charm you the movie does not do enough to entertain you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What a lovely story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early 50s were, amongst other things, a time of fear and paranoia in Hollywood. After the HUAC hearings, it seemed many in the business were more afraid of being accused of being a communist than they were of the communists themselves. And so we see cases like Frank Capra turning down the chance to direct Roman Holiday, even though it appears to be right up his street, because he didn't want any association with its blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. You see, good director as he was, Capra worried immensely about his reputation. William Wyler, the eventual director and not such an obvious choice, simply knew a good story when he saw one, and didn't otherwise care who had penned it.And yes, the plot can be vaguely read as a left-wing political statement, although it has to be one of the most gentle and inoffensive of such ever devised. First and foremost it is a light and flighty romantic comedy, and in some ways harks back to screwball comedies of the 30s. What is nice about the humour is that it is all very much by-the-way, mainly coming from supporting characters or situations to one side of the main narrative, like the man dancing with Audrey Hepburn in the opening scene glancing down to see if she managed to get her shoe back on, or Giovanni peering judiciously at Gregory Peck giving money to Hepburn. None of this stuff is quite hilarious, good for a chuckle at the most, but it serves to give the whole thing a light-hearted atmosphere without distracting from the central plot. It's a careful balance ? on the one hand, Roman Holiday is not tragic or passionate enough to be straight romantic drama, but neither is it trivial enough to be a farce.Wyler made the choice to shoot in black-and-white so that the gorgeousness of the Eternal City would not overshadow the intimacy of the story. A couple of years later David Lean would shoot another Italian romance called Summertime in glorious Technicolor, and his picture is none the worse for it. But Wyler and Lean are very different directors, and Wyler's way is to bring out the truth and beauty of a situation through our total focus on people and performance, locations being of secondary importance. Wyler's style as a director seems far more relaxed than usual, although he is actually playing a number of very subtle tricks. Notice how, in the scenes where Hepburn is all "loved-up" as a result of her tranquillizer shot, we don't really see her that clearly ? she is often partly obscured or has her head turned away from us, so that all we get is an impression of her state, the wave of an arm or toss of the hair. This stops this extremely exaggerated part of her act outshining her later scenes, when she is more calm and natural, but must appear full of joie de vivre. For these moments Wyler films her front-on with many generous close-ups, and the effect is achieved.However, to quote another great picture from this era, even the greatest magician in the world cannot pull a rabbit out of a hat unless there is already a rabbit in the hat. In other words, this is a fabulous cast that Wyler had at his disposal. Audrey Hepburn is startlingly effective in her first leading role. So many Best Actor or Actress awards go to very intense, emotional performances, but sometimes it's nice to see someone simply capture the essence of a character in happy times, which is what Hepburn expertly achieves here. Peck is pretty good too, but this role is really no stretch for him and he is just going through the motions. Eddie Albert provides some nice moments, mostly comical, but he shows capability for great sincerity in the final scene. There's also a bevy of fine Italian actors, most of whom would sadly never again feature so prominently in a Hollywood picture. Best of these is Alfredo Rizzo as the taxi driver. If that guy had two scenes instead of one he'd have stolen the movie.Had Capra directed this picture, even if he made it shot-for-shot the same as Wyler did, no doubt everyone would call it a shining example of the famous "Capra touch". It would probably even have revived his flagging career, which had never really recovered from his split with Robert Riskin. After all, it certainly didn't do any harm to Wyler's, leading on to many more hits and Oscar nods throughout the 1950s. It also turned Audrey Hepburn from an unknown into one of the industry's most bankable stars. Even Dalton Trumbo won an Oscar for his screenplay, although he did it under an assumed name and had to wait until after he was dead to actually receive it. HUAC may have caused a stir, but Hollywood was weathering the storm, and still making good things in spite of the blacklist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn at her Oscar-winning best in an immortal comedy-romance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stifled by her royal entourage on a trip to Rome, Princess Ann escapes to explore the Italian city on her own. While incognito, she falls in love with an American newspaperman, Joe Bradley. When Bradley learns of Ann's true identity, he finds himself torn between following his nose for news--and turning her into a big story--or the growing affections of his heart.ROMAN HOLIDAY, for me, is what I would call an ideal romantic comedy. Everything in here is utterly delectable and almost perfect with a few minor flaws here and there. I found the plot to be perfect for a romantic comedy. It's almost like a mix of THE LAST HOLIDAY and HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS but, in this case, the girl is naive on what's going on around her. I also like the story because it has the theme of "do what you like before you won't ever do it at all." The film asks the question: Would you sacrifice your reputation to do what you would love to do despite that you're not supposed to?I also found some of the clever lines very witty and the movie funny. Also, the location of the film is really great. You're being put right in the middle of Rome. The performance by Gregory Peck is weird to describe by me. I could never get PAST his serious role in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, which is one of his most well known roles in his acting career. In here, he plays a very charismatic and comedic role. He plays alongside Audrey Hepburn, who also does a great job as the naive princess who's blatantly unaware of the scheming plot going on around her, which I actually thought was sweet. Eddie Albert also did a pretty great job as Peck's companion.When the ending credits rolled, a huge smile spread across my face. I really wasn't expecting this great of a movie. I found very little things to complain about because almost everything in here, in my opinion, is irresistible. Peck and Hepburn have a great chemistry together, which you can especially see in the last few shots of the film. ROMAN HOLIDAY is actually one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in my life because it's my ideal romantic comedy. Funny, romantic, and with a bittersweet ending, you should give this at least one watch before you die. After all, it's a classic for a reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lonely Princess finds love and adventure in Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Holiday is directed by William Wyler, has a screenplay by Ian McLellan Hunter and John Dighton,is based on a story by Dalton Trumbo and stars Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn and Eddie Albert.Princess Ann(Audrey Hepburn)is on a worldwide tour and when in Rome escapes from her countries Embassy one night to have some time to herself and do what she wants to for a change.Feeling the after effects of a sleeping drug her doctor gave her after an hysterical outburst she falls asleep on a street bench.Later she is discovered by handsome American journalist Joe Bradley(Gregory Peck).He takes pity on her and lets her stay at his apartment.He recognises her after a little while as the Princess and knows he is on to one hot story.He tells his editor he's on to something but he doesn't believe him.Joe goes back to Ann and after a few more encounters they strike up a genuine friendship and he takes her on a tour of the city helping her to do things she has always wanted to do.These include sitting at a sidewalk cafe and getting her hair cut short.Tagging along for the ride is Joe's friend press photographer Irving Radovich(Eddie Albert)who take snaps of Ann getting involved in various bits of mischief.The heart of the film is the friendship and growing love between Ann and Joe,who must search his heart about whether or not to write the story of a lifetime.Everyone know the legends of Roman Holiday like Gregory knowing Audrey was going to become an overnight star because of this role,the hysterical mouth of truth scene where Audrey's reaction was genuine because Gregory tricked her into thinking his hand had been grabbed while they filmed etc.All that adds to the experience so much but the real attraction of the film is Audrey.Her innocence, natural charm and grace made audiences fall in love with her and as Gregory predicted she became one of the biggest stars around. A wonderful romantic film, Gregory and Audrey have lovely chemistry and there's some great Italian locations.Magic from start to finish Roman Holiday is a touching,sweet,poignant and funny story of two people embarking on the biggest adventure of their lives and being brought back to reality.With a realistic and heartbreaking ending which makes it all the more believable that this could happen.Without a doubt Roman Holiday is a must see filled with beautiful sequences in Rome and unforgettable performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Today's romantic comedies should be ashamed. This is where it's really at.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With so much garbage being dished out these days by Hollywood under the label of "romantic comedy," films like "Roman Holiday" never grow old. The timeless fairytale elements like a princess trying to disguise herself as a commoner and the classic routine of two people being dishonest with each other falling in love only gets better played against the live backdrop of Rome.One of the first films to truly shoot on location, "Roman Holiday" is that quintessential romance in a foreign country picture. In it, a young English Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn), tired of her royal routine as an ambassador, sneaks away and into the path of American reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). After Bradley realizes who she is, he crafts a plan to turn the coincidence into an exclusive story and spends a day with her going about Rome. It's similar in premise to the 1934 Frank Capra classic "It Happened One Night" only less dramatic in terms of romance.Little can describe Audrey Hepburn, but she is outstanding in the role that shot her to fame and earned her an instant Oscar. She has an allure to her and a beauty that is not unparalleled, but incomparable to any other star of the era. She looks youthful and childish at times but is also emphatically elegant and classy -- she's a unique beauty.Opposite her is a perfectly cast Gregory Peck, whose experience and maturity really shows in a role that is ultimately a supporting one. This is a story about Princess Ann and her discovery and he recognizes that, never taking focus from her in their scenes together. William Wyler captures this excellent chemistry in a film that is really quite naturally entertaining. It doesn't necessitate serious conflict -- the premise alone and our anticipation of them both coming clean about their facades keep us going and even then, Dalton Trumbo (story) and Ian McLellan Hunter (screenplay) bring us that moment in a way that is implied rather than forced, avoiding clichés that most romantic comedies of today can't seem to let go of."Roman Holiday" is such a classy movie that despite moderate laughs and no deep conflict, manages to capture our attention and our lighter side. It's one of those films that just sweeps you up and gives you something to enjoy without redundant or overbearing tactics that the genre has been so used to see for a century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why I'm writing this review, there are already tons of glowing reviews of this film. Mine just makes one more. I just want to comment briefly on the three big stars of the film:o Audrey HepburnHere-to-fore, I'd liked Hepburn, but never been particularly a fan. This film made me a fan. She was just *perfect* for the role, I can't imagine it being done by anyone else.o Gregory PeckIt is well known that Cary Grant was originally offered the part, and I'm a huge Cary Grant fan, and consider him my favorite actor. But hands down, Peck was the right man for this role. He has a great chemistry with Hepburn that I don't think Cary could've pulled off.o RomeRome is absolutely delicious in this film. Just a couple years ago, I had a wonderful vacation in Rome, and watching this film brought it all back for me. Scene after scene after scene, I was going "I was there!" or "I know that place!" Rome is a wonderful city, and the decision to film entirely on location there really puts the movie over the top.Finally, for those who wonder what country Audrey was the princess of, well, while the movie never explicitly states it, the answer is obvious: Freedonia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, the Rome of the 1950s and...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler...that name, for many years, has made me think of one of the most famous Roman epic directions of all time, BEN HUR (1959). His ROMAN HOLIDAY (1953), however, is the film I had not had a chance to see for long but I heard about it from my friend who is a classic admirer and who had told me the whole story several times, including spoilers. Therefore, I knew generally what the movie is about. Recently, ROMAN HOLIDAY was broadcast on Polish TV and I decided to see it. The first impression I got was: there is something different about this movie than most of the classic films I have seen so far... And that impression I got is something I want to share with you.It is true that the classic pair of Audrey Hepburn as Princess Ann and Gregory Peck as Joe Bradley constitute a wonderful aspect of the movie. They will make your day when you see them in these various situations. Having ROMAN HOLIDAY without them is like having an apple tree without apples, they are just deeply attached to this timeless classic, like Liz Taylor and Richard Burton are attached to CLEOPATRA or THE TAMING OF THE SHREW. The whole story of ROMAN HOLIDAY is created in such a way that there is no focus on other performances. Indeed, in this film, there are two main cast, Hepburn and Peck and they are ... terrific.When considering the aspect of performances, it's important to mention lots of very funny and memorable moments where the famous pair do their best to entertain the viewer. Consider, for instance Joe Bradley's first meeting with Ann. Besides, it's just tremendous when she says: "I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my dress off, it's MOST unusual." Another wonderfully unforgettable moment is when they put their hands into the famous Mouth of Truth (Bocca Della Verita). The camera is so well crafted towards them and the great monument that the impression is like WOW! MAGICAL! The number of humorous moments also make for a great classic: who can forget Ann's visit at the hairdresser's or her talk with Joe Bradley on Scalinata Di Spagna (Spanish Steps).Besides, it is true that ROMAN HOLIDAY is a film set in the real Rome of the 1950s. This aspect has become even more powerful as the years passed by. Of course it is not the only film that shows the Rome of that period since we have many, for instance, Italian movies that do the same; yet, the presentation of the Eternal City is really charming in Wyler's film. Since I know Rome and this city means much to me, I was overwhelmed by the movie and involved in seeing what the world known places, including Scalinata Di Spagna, Fontanna Di Trevi, Piazza Venezia, looked like more than 50 years ago. What is more, you are supplied with the views of real streets.But all these aspects are not the most significant ones. Hepburn and Peck are no longer great stars, Rome has changed seriously and a Roman holiday would probably be entirely different nowadays. Yet, the movie by William Wyler is still watched and admired...I think that it is so thanks to the wonderful uniqueness of its classic, the CONTENT. When we see the classic films, these are usually dramas, overall sad films, like GONE WITH THE WIND. I don't say that these dramas lack popularity nowadays, but there are so many of them that you only select and see the ones that suit your taste. Meanwhile, ROMAN HOLIDAY is a comedy, moreover, a romantic comedy, a beautiful fairy tale about gentle love. There is nothing sad, depressing about it! It is a charming story of the princess who badly wants to be a normal human being for at least one day and...her dream is fulfilled. The love absorbs the pair and makes the Eternal City the most unforgettable for both. The picture is in black and white despite there were colorful movies in the early 1950s. It isn't there for no purpose. Black and white picture makes perfect sense in ROMAN HOLIDAY since it adds charm and gentleness to the whole story.I'd love to have this movie in my film gallery since ROMAN HOLIDAY is really a precious film. I don't find this a masterpiece but, undoubtedly, it is one of the most charming classic fairy tales with the terrific Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, the Rome of the 1950s but, most importantly, with wonderful content!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a great romantic film actually set in Rome of 1953</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler gets a great performance out of Gregory and Audrey. And the film received more than its share of awards. There are more than the average number of comments re this film.I saw this film in the theaters shortly after it came out, and was captivated by it. However, I recently watched it on TCM and thoroughly enjoyed it again.But...I could not watch it this time without wondering about some practical considerations. Dalton Trumbo is a great writer, despite his erroneous political beliefs. Was it Trumbo who created this fantasy about Audrey being a Princess from an Eastern European Country. Come on Dalton, all of Eastern Europe was under Joe Stalins's dictatorship in 1953. What remained of the Central and Eastern monarchies after WWI, was completely demolished by Stalin and the Communists. Isn't that what their revolution was about.Trumbo's dialog in the first minutes of the film makes it quite clear, that Audrey who in real life was born in Holland, is an Eastern European Princesses whose mission is tie her imaginary Eastern Monarchy with Western Europe. I began to wonder if Trumbo was trying to exonerate himself from his pro-red tag, by writing this endearing film that is a fantasy. In the last scene of the film I couldn't help but laugh at the "polite" press corps. I doubt whether there would have been many at Audrey's press briefing, but if there was an interest in her, the press would have not been as polite as shown. In reality, there would have been a mob scene as reporters and especially photographers grappled with each other.For those who find my observations picky, I apologize. This film is great despite my observations because it is an implausible love story that is credible with my above noted exceptions. The Roman background of post war Rome was a reminder to those who watched this film originally, that Europe was finally getting out from under the ruble of WWII. This is a wonderful love story without naked bodies doing all sorts of things that were better off left to our own wicked imaginations. This film lives on, as we forget the semi-pornographic films that have replaced gems such as Roman Holiday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn is the real star of the show here and she remains a fascinating figure to watch. A jumble of contradictions, if there's such a thing as "strong vulnerability" or "active passivity" she had it. Plus, as she rambles around Rome her reactions seem completely unguarded, which is a pretty amazing thing, really, for a movie actor to pull off. (I am less impressed with Peck here, who, while doing a professional job of it, just seems miscast. The role is crying out for somebody who's more convincing playing seedy, like William Holden, say.) A very clever movie that has an interesting subtext (the movie is in many ways a quiet celebration of the lies we tell each other, and sees love as a kind of mutually-accepted illusion) and seems ahead of it's time: this is the first movie I know of to see not just riches, but more specifically celebrity, as a kind of prison.Rome looks lovely here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film directed by William Wyler is a must-see classic. The film stars Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn, who I used to consider not such a great actress.Audrey plays a beautiful princess that is sick of the routine she would like to set herself free of all her royal duties and just live her life like a girl of her age. Gregory Peck plays a news reporter in Rome who is in constant debts and really doesn't enjoy living in Rome. (Spoilers) They meet and in Princess Ann Joe finds a solution to all his problems an exclusive interview with the Princess could make him win enough money to scape from his debts and return to New York, he doesn't tell the princess that he works for a newspaper and Ann/Anya pretends to be a girl that escaped from school they both lie to each other(but of course, Joe knows she is the Princess)and visit wonderful places in Rome and have a blast together. In one day they become friends, good friends and fall in love..she had never met anyone as nice as him, someone that treated her equally and talking to her directly and he met someone admirable that made him forget about all his problems.But time comes when she realizes that she must return to her Royal duties.It's a must-see, I've never laugh in a film so much and I have never cried so much in a film that makes me laugh so hard!Gregory Peck is GORGEOUS, Audrey is hilarious and Wyler just gave us a masterpiece.10/10..and yes, Audrey did give some great performances during her career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the all-time great romantic comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Roman Holiday" proved to be one of the most completely enjoyable romantic comedies I've ever seen. It was funny and romantic, with great performances all around. Gregory Peck was great as usual, as was supporting star Eddie Albert. In her debut (and Oscar-winning) role, it's no wonder that we saw more of the great Audrey Hepburn. Even today, this film's plot and writing seems fresh and original. One reason I enjoyed this film so much was because few films of this type can make me care so much about the main characters. Although the ending disappointed me slightly and wasn't the ending I would have chosen, I realize that the film went for a more realistic and believable ending, and I compliment Hollywood for that. If you want the film to end perfectly, it may not be for you. However, if you're looking for an otherwise enjoyable classic movie and a sense of realism in the film-making, this film is definitely recommended.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Difference A Day Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there anybody on the planet who has not succumbed to both Audrey Hepburn and this, her first leading role. Sadly the answer must be yes because there are always those who fail to 'get' it or to 'see' the enchantment. The fact that Dalton Trumbo has now been accorded his rightful screenplay credit could well lead to speculation about the basic premise given that Trumbo was often accused of 'smuggling' left-wing 'messages' into his pre-Hollywood Ten screenplays: Everybody and his Uncle Max is familiar with the Marxist credo, 'Workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains' but did, we wonder, Trumbo adapt this to read 'Royals of the world abscond, you have nothing to lose but your privileges' then have Audrey Hepburn's Princess Ann run away from the shackles of protocol. Alas, that's about as far as we can run with this because the true Marxist would then assassinate the whole Royal Family for an encore whilst Hepburn's princess, cognizant of her 'duty' returns to assume the role life has chosen for her. In that respect this answers the description of the bildungsroman in which a child comes of age via a rites of passage episode and if we feel sadness on Hepburn's behalf in the opening scenes when, as a grown woman she is treated as a child not least by her own lady-in-waiting we rejoice at the end when, for the first time, she asserts her authority and dismisses that same lady-in-waiting. In between lies some heavy-duty enchantment with Peck and Hepburn falling hopelessly into a hopeless love laced liberally with laughter and tears and great support from Eddie Albert. Along with Billy Wilder's Sabrina Fair this represents the best of Hepburn which is really saying something given the consistent high standards of her later work but just as you can only fall in love for the first time once so you can only play your first leading role once and she was so lucky to have Gregory Peck, one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, to share it with her. Total joy. Fifteen out of Ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Princess Has All Wishes Accomplished in One Day in a Delightful Romance in Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is a bored princess visiting Rome. One night, she decides to escape from the palace where she is lodged and visit the city as a common person. However, due to the medication gave by her doctor to relieve her anxiety and stress, she sleeps in a bank of a square. Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) is a broken American correspondent who finds Ann and feels sorrow for her. He brings Ann to his apartment to rest until the next day. Then he realizes that she is the missing princess and he sees the change to earn lots of money with a great article to press. He calls his friend and photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) to get some pictures of her to increase the value of the report. They spend a day in Rome together, where all the wishes of Ann are accomplished. This fairy tale will end in the most correct way. This fifty (50) years collector's edition on DVD was released in Brazil a couple of months ago. I have never watched this movie before and I am amazed: what a splendid story! This movie is the debut of Audrey Hepburn on the screen. What an outstanding actress she was! She could be fragile in a moment and great and noble (without arrogance) in the other. "Sabrina" is a good example of how easy she could perform any role. The great direction of the fantastic Wylliam Wyler is marvelous as usual. This director, as well as Frank Capra and Billy Wilder, knew how to explore and present on the screen the elegant and almost naive behavior of the society in the 50's. Imagine in the present days the malice and malevolence that the viewers would say about, for example, Joe brings home a beautiful girl like Ann. In 1953, this sympathetic action would be acceptable. Irving is the authentic paparazzo. However, this expression was created only after Fellini's "La Dolce Vita" (1960), with the character of Walter Santesso. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "A Princesa e o Plebeu" ("The Princess and the Plebeian")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn Is the Movie's Sole Reason for Existing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This bittersweet William Wyler romance is like an extended tourism commercial for Rome. The city that gives the film its name snares as much screen time as either of its two stars, and it looks just as beautiful.Speaking of beauty, this film's strongest selling point is its position as a vehicle for Audrey Hepburn, who burst on to the movie scene with this film and became one of Hollywood's most beloved stars. Many of the roles she played subsequently to this one had the same flavor -- she excelled at playing winsome waifs who were always just a tad too pristine for the rough world of men surrounding them --- think of her in "Sabrina" or "My Fair Lady." Here she gets to ride on the back of a motor scooter driven by Gregory Peck, and show off that dazzling smile. However, a happy ending for the charismatic couple is not to be, as this princess who gets to be a peasant for a day must accept her responsibility and go back to being a princess once more. It's slightly ironic that a star whose appeal rested on her uncanny glamour appeared in role after role that highlighted the limits which glamour can place on the world of those who suffer from it.Aside from its leading lady, the film itself is nothing special. Wyler provides solid if unfancy direction, and the story doesn't go anywhere you're not expecting it to. Eddie Albert provides some fine support as a randy photographer, but don't let anyone kid you into thinking that this movie belongs to anyone but Audrey Hepburn.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Romantic Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said about William Wyler's evergreen comedy that has not been said before? Suffice to state that it never loses its luster, even though it is over sixty years since its original release.Every element of the film seems perfectly shaped, from the memorable Hollywood debut of Audrey Hepburn, to the nuanced support offered by Gregory Peck; a witty script by John Dighton and Ian McLellan Hunter, based on a story by the then-blacklisted Dalton Trumbo; beautiful black-and-white photography of a Rome that no longer exists by Henri Alakan and Frank F. Planer; and taut direction by Wyler that gives plenty of opportunities for the actors to flourish while retaining the mystique of the Eternal City as a place where romance can occur, however briefly.The film has memorable nuanced moments, from the opening sequence where the Princess (Hepburn) undergoes an apparently endless series of presentations, while trying to stretch her feet under her voluminous dress; the sequence where she wears pajamas for the first time and falls asleep in Peck's bed during a chaste night away from the palace; the sequence taking place in the sidewalk café where Peck keeps telling his witless sidekick Nathan (Eddie Albert) to shut up about the Princess's true identity; and the memorable moment at the Bocca della Verita (aka the Mouth of Truth), where Peck puts his hand in and brings it out abruptly, scaring the living daylights out of the Princess as he does so.Nothing actually happens during the Princess's night away from her royal duties; her virtue remains intact, and she has a merry time dodging the Carabinieri and her Secret Service officers, in a comic fight sequence taking place near the Castel Saint'Angelo, which culminates in Peck and herself diving into the river and swimming to safety. ROMAN HOLIDAY conjures up a world that simply does not exist today of comic Italians waving their arms about expressively, of obliging cab-drivers and locals selling everything on the street from water- melons, flowers, and other junk. In these days of mass tourism commercial interests have taken over, and Rome's innocence - as well as a lot of its allure - has been lost in the process. Nonetheless we can enjoy a nostalgic wallow in the past through this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn is so cute.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched Audrey Hepburn wore in a dress, I couldn't help thinking she was like a fairy. Her elegant appearance attracted me. I'm Japanese, so it is difficult for me to judge an acting ability of foreign actors and actresses, but her acting is so charming and it made her popular in Japan, I think.And I surprised at her short hair style, maybe no one but her suits he style. Her fashion was also fresh. I love a classic movie, so I have watched lots of films, but there is no heroine like Audrey Hepburn. Those things are reasons why she is so popular and still be called "fashion icon" now, I think.Off course, the story of this film lets me feel painful, but very good. Performance of the eyes of Gregory Peck is masterly. Love romance between Princess Anne and Joe is very pure and beautiful. Various tourist attraction spots like "the mouth of Truth" supports this movie. I would like to visit Rome and trace the locus of them.</fullReview>

Adding to very charming Audrey Hepburn,I understand why the film has been loved in all over the world. Compared to recent complicating movies, this film is very simple, but profound enough.

		<shortDescription>If the shoe fits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elegant woman's shoe - abandoned, not at midnight to beckon a prince, but, mid ankle-stretch, by horrified royalty unable to stoop to retrieve it, for fear of losing decorum in front of her austere procession. It's one of the most understated, classic bits of physical comedy in cinema history. And it's the perfect start to Roman Holiday, director William Wyler and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's effervescent soufflé of a travelogue, which remains as irresistibly charming as it does deceptively clever, over half a century on. It helps, naturally, that six decades on, our obsessions with not only celebrity culture but Monarchy-mania have only intensified. This makes the film feel simultaneously timely, but also a delightful escape to the ages of pre-digital social media (imagine Princess Ann's antics on the town going unnoticed in the era of Twitter or Instagram ). Trumbo's script crackles with subtly acidic tongue-in-cheek humour and heart, sailing along with breezy abandon. What is a product of its time (in the best possible sense): Princess Ann's claustrophobic, nauseatingly regimented royal life doesn't just poke fun at the disempowering nature of life in the public eye. It serves as perfectly metaphoric for the stifling, ideologically rigid 1950s housewife lifestyle, stripped of all autonomy under the veneer of glamour and elegance. Still, Trumbo nudges this subtext rather than hammering it, keeping the mood delightful, if not frivolous. The Rome locations, shot in crisp black and white, are utterly gorgeous, and tie the entire film's joys up in a sophisticated bow. Audrey Hepburn is a luminous delight here, achingly convincing as both flawless princess, and the exuberant young woman cooped up inside her, ready to burst. She bubbles with infectious joy (and some A+ comedy-drunk acting) throughout, before snapping shut again with mirthless, icy composure, which is all the more heartbreakingly impressive, making her Oscar win here indisputably well-deserved. Bouncing off her, Gregory Peck struggles to overcome being a touch too stiff for a part unmistakably earmarked for Cary Grant, but lends it a clipped charm of his own all the same. Finally, Eddie Albert, in the long-suffering Donald O'Connor 'friend/foil' role, is an adorably acrobatic sensation, brimming with beleaguered pratfalls and beard-yanks galore. If there's a sole complaint to be made, it's that Wyler's luxurious, congenial feel lends the film a more laboured, drowsy, and overlong feel than its sparky plot of hi-jinx on the town deserves. Still, Roman Holiday is one for the ages: airtight, clever, and heartwarming, it's still arguably the romantic comedy to beat, decades down the line, and a cinematic treat worth indulging in for viewers familiar or new. If nothing else, for a film that puts so much stock (ha) in images, that closing shot - long, lingering hallway procession, keeping the audience agonizingly dangling from the bittersweet lure of potential - is a doozy. Ciao, bella. -9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a lot of comedy, a lot of love, a lot of warmth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1853 movie, filmed on location in Rome, was Audrey Hepburn's first, and she did so very well for a lady in her early twenties, especially when you consider the fact that she was paired with the veteran actor Gregory Peck, and Eddie Albert.It starts off with a fictitious country's young princess (Hepburn)resting in a palace in Rome after a tour of Europe, and in Rome she is very frustrated one night and has a temperamental fit, and thus is given a shot of very strong medicine, so much so that she appears to be inebriated, and just as well be. After sneaking out of the palace she hops a small paddy wagon and rides down a street in Rome, stops in front of a building where she sits on a bench when the American newspaper reporter Tom Bradley (played by Peck)sees her on the bench and later takes her to his apartment. (To indicate how ancient the movie is, nothing lewd takes place there.) He is late for work the next day, but quite by accident in his boss' office he sees a picture of the princess on the cover of a Rome newspaper. He then bets his boss that he will do a story on that "dame", and he in his own mind knows he will win. Naturally, the princess' entourage, a cold group, has no idea where she is, and is worried about her and the fact that she will hold a press conference the next day. In the meantime the princess does not know that Bradley is a newspaper reporter, nor does she know that at the same time he knows that she is the princess. He is, again, going to do a story on her, replete with pictures taken by his friend Irvin Radovich(Albert)who owns his own photo service. Bradley later tells her to take the whole day off and have a holiday, and so they do and it's filled with much fun; the fun ends at a pier where there is a big shindig where, in turn, she tells him that he has been so kind to her and so unselfish. At this point, though there is a fight at the pier which is comical in its own right, the story becomes serious and romantic.Though it is very amusing in so many places, it is, again, also serious in places as well. Whether or not the ending is amusing or serious is something the viewer(s)will have to personally decide. Though the movie is filmed in B&amp;W, the sights around the Eternal City-such as the Victor Emannuel Memorial, the Spanish Steps, the Fountain of Trevi, the Wall of Truth, and the Roman Forum-are still very captivating. And William Wyler does manifest the fact that he is a prolific producer. It is another movie I have watched so very many times, yet do not get jaded despite that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman Holiday (1953) is a delightful, captivating fairy-tale romance shot entirely on location in Rome, and produced and directed by one of Hollywood's most skillful, distinguished, professional and eminent directors - William Wyler.The film's bittersweet story is a charming romantic-comedy, a kind of Cinderella storybook tale in reverse (with an April-October romance). A runaway princess named Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn), during a goodwill tour of Europe, rebels against her sheltered life and royal obligations. She escapes the insulated confines of her royal prison to find a 'Prince Charming' commoner - an American journalist-reporter (Gregory Peck) covering the royal tour in Rome. The story was reportedly based on the real-life Italian adventures of British Princess Margaret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During a recent conversation about our visit to Rome we made few years ago, the movie came up. Some folks had never seen it so I tried to explain it, but realized that it was impossible. It's not an epic film. It doesn't have grit, intensity, realism or even a social message. Seemingly impossible, it delights and entertains in an almost childlike way without offense. You long to be part of it. You want to be there. You want to feel the same. This is Hollywood at its best. It is why Hollywood exists. Not to teach, preach or inform but to entertain, to make us feel good in such a way that we savor each moment of the actors on the screen. You wish the movie would never end. It is impossible to watch this film and not have a twinge of sadness knowing that Hollywood will never be able to make us feel this way again. In comfort we'll always have Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck as they were, forever remembered in those magical movie moments. And we'll plan to go to Rome or return hoping to catch a peek of Hepburn and Peck on their Vespa scooter in our dreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ode to Duty (with a possible minor spoiler toward the end)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the good graces of Turner Classic Movies and Fathom Events, my wife, my daughter and I had a huge theater all to ourselves yesterday for the 2:00 p. m. big-screen viewing of the 1953 miracle of a movie, "Roman Holiday". Well, that's not 100% accurate. A couple of minutes before the movie started, two other people walked in. I feel so sorry for all the people who could have occupied all those seats and seen this overwhelming movie as it was intended to be seen.Who remembers the supernatural charm of 23-year-old Audrey Hepburn? Who remembers the imperturbable, virile strength of Gregory Peck, just about to be perturbed to his limits? Who remembers how hapless Eddie Arnold could be as the sidekick? Who remembers the uncredited fourth brilliant member of this great cast: glorious Rome?Princess Anne (Hepburn), from an undetermined country, is concluding a European tour in Rome. She has been decorous and dutiful (the first sounding of the theme of the movie), but she is just about exhausted. How brilliantly the great director William Wyler shows us her state: during another stultifying reception, the young princess, under the cover of her long dress, has slipped her left foot out of her shoe, and is scratching her right shin with it! Her face is unchanged, but we keep going back to that errant foot. Immediately we all know how she feels, and that night, in bed, when she can't take anymore and begins screaming at her attendants who are trying to go over her packed schedule for the next day, why, we are right there with her. In fact, we're thinking, "I'd've cracked long ago!" But she is Royal, without the luxury for hysterics. So they summon a doctor, who gives her a sedative, telling her it will make her feel very good, and then it will make her sleep. The attendants leave, and, under the influence of that happy drug, she dresses, slips out of the mansion, finds a delivery truck about to leaves, stows away, and makes her escape into the Rome of Common People.Joe Bradley (Peck), an American journalist who is just barely getting by, is losing at poker to, among others, his photographer friend Irving Radovich (Albert). Bradley takes his last 5,000-lira note, puts it in his jacket pocket, and calls it a day. Walking home, he sees the princess asleep on a curbside. He tries to go past, but somehow can't, and he tries to put her in a cab. When she drunkenly insists she lives at The Coliseum, the cab driver will not take custody, and Mr. Bradley is stuck with her.Who remembers a day when an intoxicated woman could stumble into a single man's apartment, drunkenly ask for help out of her clothes, and he NOT take advantage of her? And here the movie sounds the theme of duty again. Bradley gives her pajamas, points her to the bathroom, and leaves the apartment for a few minutes to allow her to arrange herself. He comes back and finds her asleep, almost comatose, in his bed.At the office the next day, he picks up a newspaper and realizes he has the princess asleep in his apartment! He gets his editor to promise him $5,000 (not lira) for an exclusive interview with Her Royal Highness, calls Irving for help, and rushes home. There he finds her dressed, a little embarrassed, buy royally poised about what has happened. Gently, slowly, he tempts her to extend her hookey-playing for the rest of the day.The rest of the movie is a luscious travelogue of Rome. You will forget almost immediately that you are watching in black and white, I promise! And the burgeoning relationship of the principals, Mr. Bradley and Her Incognito Highness, is nothing short of a delight.(POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER) In the last few decades, when "If it feels good do it" has become almost a religious mantra, to the ruination of literally millions of people, a sweet and simple comedy where all the people ultimately do their duty, do the right thing, even when it is hard, even when it is painful, is like the first rain after a long drought. There is a fabulous moral here, one desperately needed today. This is a beautiful movie, romantic, a little screwball here and there, heart-breakingly beautiful, and, if you pay attention, an underlying ode to duty. You need to see this movie. Over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all-time classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: William Wyler Cast: Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck and Eddie Albert A holiday that needs to be celebrated every year. Audrey Hepburn with her debut performance in the movie sets the stage on fire. This movie actually made Audrey a superstar overnight. Whereas, the work of Gregory Peck as Joe an American reporter is ice on the cake. Roman Holiday is a nice blend of fantasy and reality. The whole movie set is located in beautiful locations of Europe. Wyler has shown all his professionalism and wide knowledge of romantic comedies in the movie. If Wyler has to make some movie and it does not get huge success, this can never be possible. This movie also won an Oscar for the Best story. The movie starts with the goodwill tour of a royal Princess Ann (Audrey) of an unknown European country. The tour begins with London and follows to the great Buckingham Palace and later on Rome, Italy. Ann finds this tour with full of obligations where she has to follow high class customs. It is more than a royal cage for her, which she later escapes and meets a journalist, Joe in Rome, who is covering her royal visit to Italy but has never seen her in reality. So, being unaware of Ann's identity he offers her a night to spend in his apartment as he sees her lying on a bench in cold. But when he gets to know Ann's reality, he plans to earn a lot of money by not revealing that he is a journalist. Eddie Albert also did a fabulous job in the movie. The way he takes Princess Ann's photographs for the secret interview proves him a perfect match for Joe's support, which also leads him an Oscar nomination. Even in black and white era, the beauty of the locations makes you mesmerize. The storyline of the movie never takes you out of track, not even for once. It holds you till the last and beautifully depicts Audrey's innocence and how she frees herself from the prison of royalty. The terrific performance of Hepburn gets her Academy Award for the best performance in the lead role. It is an amazing film that I'm sure no one could miss. Audrey and Greg have great chemistry. It is a masterpiece from true classic collection. It is a worth watching and one of the most charming classic fairy tale of all time. A must watch movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman Holiday (1953): Dir: William Wyler / Cast: Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Eddie Albert, Hartley Power, Harcourt Williams: Engaging romantic comedy about adventures beyond our usual psyche. Audrey Hepburn plays a Princess who is bored with the meaningless schedules and wishes to partake in normal activities. Seizing the opportunity she runs away one evening but is discovered by a reporter, played by Gregory Peck who mistakes her for a drunken teenager. When newspapers announce that the Princess is ill as a cover-up, Peck realizes who his guest is and participates sight seeing about Rome while his photographer sneaks snapshots. Beautiful film full of hilarious situations and an ending worth applauding. Director William Wyler previously made Mrs. Miniver. Here he highlights normality and showcases exquisite Rome. Hepburn is hilarious in her innocence while Peck is wonderful as the scheming reporter overcome by guilt. Eddie Albert makes a great foil as Peck's willing photographer. In limited supporting roles Hartley Power plays his editor who engages in a bet and never fully realizes how far ahead he truly was. Other roles are rather one dimensional but viewers will be likely focused on Hepburn's radiant energy. One of the greatest of romantic comedies. It celebrates normality while honesty makes this just about the best holiday ever filmed. Score: 9 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Princess Ann: Is this the elevator? Joe Bradley: This is my ROOM!Audrey Hepburn is probably most fondly remembered for 'That little black dress' by Givenchy in 'Breakfast at Tiffanys' but it is in her first breakthrough role where she is at her sublime best. Audrey looks like the vulnerable girl she is meant to be and yet continues to grow throughout the movie to transform into probably its strongest figure. Roman Holiday released on New Years Day, 1953 and at that time, it was unheard of for an actress, especially one on her large scale American celluloid debut, to hold equal economic footing as her male counterpart. Yet, the lovable Gregory Peck would have had it no other way. And there is good reason why.Audrey plays the role of a certain British Princess Ann, exasperated and exhausted with her mundane royal existence and finds herself at the tipping point. It threatens to break her until one night, she sneaks out while her coterie is on a royal tour to Italy, only to discover civilian pleasures. From sleeping on roadside benches, to observing a teeming 'bazar', she does it all. In the middle of all this, is Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), an American news reporter who misses an interview appointment with Princess Ann, only to discover that as a result of our heroine's little escapade, a massive opportunity has been plunked in his lap. Roman Holiday is as much a story of the city as it is of the characters in it. As audiences, we are drawn into the romantic, sunlit world of Rome. The effect keeps growing until you can almost feel the wind along the roadside café, the heat on the Spanish Steps and the aura of the Colosseum. Peck's turn as the shrewd Yellow Journalist is disarmingly charming (a 'ringer', as Anya would call it) who, over the course of the film consistently reflects the viewer's emotions towards Ann. Eddie Albert also received an Academy Award nomination for his brilliant portrayal as Irving, the Casanova photographer. However, make no mistake, this is Audrey Hepburn's movie. Hepburn lights up every frame she is in with her palpable sense of wonder and energy. It is an extremely authentic, believable and infectious experience. The Oscar which she received for this role is arguably one of the most deserving ever given.Roman Holiday was made during the 'Hollywood on Tiber' era, a time in the 1950s and 1960s when Italy and Europe featured extensively in all genres of American cinema. It may well be argued that this movie was the era's highest point. It starts with a simplistic screwball narrative which is predictable, comfortable and delicious to tuck into. Although just when you realize that you've figured it all out, it turns into a surprisingly deep coming-of-age tale which concludes in a sequence of one enduring scene after another and a trademark lingering long shot. William Wyler's finesse behind the camera paints an immensely satisfying image of romance which should be watched and re-watched, simply because it is deserving of it. For, in Joe Bradley's own words - May I say, speaking for my own....press service, Your Highness' faith will not be unjustifiedPS - A special mention to Dalton Trumbo, whose screenplay makes the cinematic journey wholesome and balances the screwball and the drama with panache. Dalton was blacklisted at the time of the movie's release for his suspected political beliefs and as a result, Ian McLellan Hunter accepted the Oscar. He was, however, reinstated as a posthumous recipient in 1993 (when his wife accepted the award).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been wanting to watch this movie for a long long while now. And recently after watching trip to Italy, I thought I must watch this movie. I have seen Gregory peck's Guns of Navarone, Mackennas gold, Mockingbird and Audrey's My fair lady. But watching both these actors in their sweet roles in this movie was fun. They take you to all the important places in Rome. I was shocked to know that Audrey was cast since they wanted a new comer. She looks at her delightful best in the movie. Apart from the Black and white tinge and the happy sense in the move, the movie is also backed by some heavy acting in the end. Especially the separation scene is so powerful that you just hope it goes the other way. I thought it would turn out like Notting Hill but the movie finishes in a different note. Anybody who loves classics should watch this movie. (Watch it before you go to Rome)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever it is that makes movies stars both Audrey Hepburn &amp; Gregory Peck had it in spades. Audrey Hepburn had such a beautiful face, obviously, but that alone is not what made her so appealing to moviegoers. She had qualities that you cannot really train in anyone. She had a radiant smile coupled with enormous warmth &amp; charm such that you really wouldn't know she was an actress playing a part in a movie. She also had such natural grace &amp; class that when playing a princess she was entirely believable. Gregory Peck was in many ways the opposite of Clark Gable. Both were extremely handsome but Gable usually played a rough, tough &amp; overtly sexy type of character. Peck, on the other hand, usually played a more thoughtful gentlemanly type as in this movie. Directed by William Wyler "Roman Holiday" is a timeless romantic comedy &amp;, to my mind, one of the finest movies ever made. Having as a backdrop the eternal city of Rome certainly helps but it is its two principal stars that make this such a fabulous film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pointless Sacrifice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Princess Ann alludes to the Cinderella story by saying, "And at midnight I'll turn into a pumpkin and drive away in my glass slipper," which, of course, mixes up the elements of the fairytale. In similar way, the movie itself is a Cinderella story with the elements mixed up.Cinderella was a lady by birth, but forced into servitude by her wicked stepmother. For one night, she is able to dress up like the lady she really is. Princess Ann is a commoner by nature, and for one day she is able to dress up like the ordinary person she really is. At the end of the fairytale, Cinderella comfortably slides her foot into a glass slipper; at the beginning of the movie, Ann slides her foot out of the shoe that is bothering her. Cinderella marries the Prince she has fallen in love with; Ann does not marry the commoner she has fallen in love with.We expect there to be a moment when she finds out that Joe is a reporter, causing her to feel hurt and betrayed, believing that he tricked her for the sake of a story; and that he will say that was true at first, but now he is in love with her; and then she will say she does not believe him, and so on. That is the formula for movies when there is deception about someone's identity. In "The Prisoner of Zenda" (1952), for example, when Princess Flavia finds out that the man she fell in love with is just an impostor, she jumps to the conclusion that his courting her was part of the act, and thus she feels betrayed. In "Roman Holiday," however, it is refreshing that Ann trusts Joe so much that one brief assurance from him is all she needs.As with Princess Flavia, Princess Ann gives up the man she loves for the sake of her royal duties, but we have to wonder why. "The Prisoner of Zenda" was written in 1894, back when monarchs still mattered. And in the movie, much is made of the danger of letting someone like Michael seize the throne. But by 1953, monarchs had pretty much become ceremonial, kept around as tourist attractions. After all, when King Edward VIII of England abdicated his throne to marry Wallis Simpson, civil war did not break out, so it is hard to believe that Princess Ann could not abdicate without precipitating some kind of political disaster.In fact, I have my suspicions about King Edward VIII. The story is that he loved Wallis Simpson so much that he made the great sacrifice of giving up his throne for her. But I think he was just using her as an excuse. The idea of being a titular monarch, with no power but lots of ceremonial duties, might have been maddeningly tedious to him, and he was glad to get out of it. Just to say, "I don't want to be King, because it's boring," would have been a great insult. But everyone understands that love conquers all, and with that as a cover story, he made his escape.And this brings us back to Princess Ann. She clearly hated her duties, and she loved Joe. How nice it would have been, when Joe indicates that he will not publish what happened between them in the newspaper, for her to immediately renounce her position, and say she intends to marry him, the two of them walking away together to live happily ever after. As it is, we sort of feel that the boring life she has resigned herself to is just what she deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Princess Anne (Audrey Hepburn) is on a world wind European tour. The tour wears on her and she's on the verge on a mental breakdown. Enchanted by a party outside her window, she sneaks out into the Roman night. Her sedative puts her to sleep on the street. American newspaper reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) finds her after leaving a poker game. He takes her back to his apartment. The next morning, he's covering her press conference. When he realizes that she's sleeping on his couch, he promises an exclusive interview to his editor Mr. Hennessy (Hartley Power) for $5000. Hennessy bets another $500 on him getting the story. She decides to go off into the city and he convinces her to take the whole day. He gets his friend Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) to take the photos.Audrey is utterly adorable and Gregory Peck is a real charmer. Together, they make a perfect movie couple. It's not all light and fluffy like the shoe incident. Her breakdown is quite shocking. Hepburn really delivers the comedy. Peck is so charming that we don't mind about his ulterior motive. They are great separately and even better together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romantic treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler's smart romantic comedy Roman Holiday is a movie that redefined that genre at the time this movie was released. The movie stars Audrey Hepburn in an Academy award winning film debut as Princess Ann of Italy who runs away from from her palace for one night while being dizzy at the same time, after she escapes and sleeps on the side of a bridge for a few minutes, and then she encounters an American journalist by the name of Joseph Bradley (played by Gregory Peck).Then the following morning they miss the Prince's interview and instead of the Princess exploring Rome on her own the princess and Bradley end up exploring Rome together along with another journalist named Irving Radovich (played by Eddie Albert). Then after the sunsets and they are at a dinner party all hell breaks loose and a huge fight breaks out because of a few secret service agents forcefully trying to take the princess back to her palace (in which this scene made me think back to the fight scene in John Ford's She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949). The one thing I love most about this movie is the chemistry between both Hepburn's and Peck's characters, as well as the music, photography, humor and among other things. Also while watching this movie it made me think back to that Woody Allen movie I saw a few days ago which was Midnight In Paris (2011). But in the end I would recommend this picture for people who like romantic comedies and as well as romance movies in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic feeling without a lot of contrivance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I own a copy of this film which I bought years ago, and I probably haven't viewed it since I first bought it...until tonight. And once while playing a home-made version of Scene It with some friends, I used the footage where she puts her hand in the wall. So that is the part of the movie I tend to remember most. But I did re-watch it in its entirely tonight on TCM. I have to be honest. It is wonderfully absorbing but it is a product of its time and definitely too slow for young modern audiences who may not have the patience to allow the story, or at least the relationship between the three main characters, to carefully unfold. It became very clear to me that ROMAN HOLIDAY's 119 minute running time could easily be whittled down to 95 or 100 minutes and it wouldn't hurt this picture at all. But then we might lose some of the deeper, meaningful pauses and the sightseeing tour of Rome that sort of exists within the movie. I suspect that if it had been made back in Hollywood on the Paramount back lot, there would have been less drawn-out sequences where the director is encouraging us to absorb and take in real Rome. And speaking of taking in the Roman sights, I think it was a mistake to have filmed it in black and white. They had young stars who did not need black-and-white photography to help conceal aging, and the beauty and splendor of the Roman culture would surely have looked much grander in Technicolor. I also think there should have been more local music and dialects in the background, like we see in BUONA SERA MRS. CAMPBELL or A ROOM WITH A VIEW. As it is, ROMAN HOLIDAY is too silent and quite frankly too un-Italian in some of its representations.Also, I think the picture seems unsure of itself in spots, trying to decide if it's a slapstick comedy or a romantic comedy. The repetitiveness of Eddie Albert getting splashed with beverages and falling down silly leaves one thinking that Wyler was absent on those days and the Marx Brothers had temporarily taken over directing.However, despite these slight gripes, the picture is still very effective in creating a mood. And it gives one reason to rejoice in the fact that a romantic feeling without a lot of contrivance or saccharine cuteness can be captured and sustained for much of a film's running time-- a rarity in most newer films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if Eddie Albert had played Joe?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gregory Peck seemed very stiff and un-romantic in the leading-man role here. I've really liked him in other things, but what if Albert's more lively, light-hearted character had been the object of the princess' affections? I can envision a more entertaining movie under those conditions, but maybe that's not the way things were done in the 1950's? maybe the tall, handsome leading man was a must-have. I've read that one of the reasons Peck wanted this film was because he felt he needed to 'lighten up' his image? I'll agree with him on that, and sincerely hope he did even more lightening up after it, because there was still room for improvement.Audrey Hepburn might have acted a bit childish and under her implied age at times (mostly in the embassy bedroom scenes, when she seemed to be channeling an eight-year-old), but she was sweet and lovable and filled the role of Princess Ann very well.To be totally honest, I didn't watch this out of any real interest in the film itself, but only for the on-location scenery since I'm going to Rome in six months. I share the sentiments of those who wish it had been in color, but even in black and white it's visually stunning. The best part of the movie was the scenery; the second best part was Eddie Albert. Worth a look for those who enjoy vintage romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more than usually thoughtful and serious rom-com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1952 the beautiful 25-year-old Princess Elizabeth became, quite literally overnight, the most famous woman in the world when she acceded to the British throne. The following year, also the year of Elizabeth's coronation, Hollywood made a film about a beautiful European princess in her mid-twenties. Coincidence? I think not. Scriptwriter Dalton Trumbo did not quite dare call his heroine "Princess Elizabeth", but naming her after the Queen's daughter was a pretty clear hint that he had the British monarchy in mind. The blacklisted Trumbo could not publicly take the credit for his story; his Academy Award officially went to his front-man Ian McLellan Hunter. (The Academy's records were later amended to show Trumbo as the rightful winner). I have, however, always thought it strange that an avowed Communist should have written a film which did so much to popularise the idea of monarchy. It just goes to show how misguided the blacklist was; Hollywood Communists (and Trumbo was far from being the only one) did not have much influence even on the films they worked on, and had very little opportunity to make propaganda for their cause. Princess Anne, heir to the throne of an unspecified European country, arrives in Rome during a "goodwill tour" of several European capitals. Although the tour consists of little more than carrying out official functions and giving bland, uncontroversial speeches, it has generated tremendous publicity and large numbers of international journalists have been assigned to cover it. Another inspiration for the film may have been the similar "rainbow tour" carried out by Queen Eva of Argentina in 1947. (OK, I know that Eva Peron was not officially royalty, but the press tended to treat her as though she were). Tired of her regimented schedule and of formal protocol, Anne escapes from her country's embassy and goes missing for twenty-four hours. During her absence she meets Joe Bradley, an American journalist, who at first does not recognise her, and the two enjoy a day of freedom together. Of course, they end up falling in love, seemingly setting us up for a classic romantic comedy ending. Most rom-coms show how a couple overcome some obstacle to their love, and in Hollywood's alternative reality the differences between Anne and Joe in nationality, social class and rank, would count as obstacles, but not insuperable ones. Any scriptwriter worth his salt could have contrived a plot involving Joe marrying into the Royal House of Ruritania (or wherever Anne is from) or Anne renouncing the throne to become Mrs Joseph Bradley of Boston (or wherever Joe is from).Trumbo, however, clearly realised that in the real world of the 1950s a marriage between Anne and Joe would have been most unlikely and wanted to produce something more realistic. So the film ends without a conventionally happy ending; the couple renounce their love for one another, and Joe also renounces something else. As one of only a handful of people who knows the truth about Anne's disappearance he could land a journalistic scoop which would bring him a lot of money and professional recognition. Out of loyalty to her, however, he passes up the opportunity, allowing the authorities to maintain the convenient fiction that Anne's absence was due to a sudden illness. Yet this double renunciation is not presented as a conventionally unhappy ending either. What matters for Anne is her duty to her family and her country, and the implication of the ending is that her glimpse of freedom and of real life, however brief, has given her greater strength to carry out that duty in future. Joe too will be able to take comfort from beautiful memories of his friendship with Anne and the knowledge that he too has done his duty in "doing the right thing". "Roman Holiday" was the film which made a star of Audrey Hepburn. She had already had starring roles in British films, but this was her first American film and the first to bring her to international attention. It also brought her first and only "Best Actress" Oscar (although in my view it should have been the first of several). Here Audrey shows the qualities which were to make her such an icon over the next fifteen years. Her secret lay not just in her luminous beauty, nor in the way she spoke her lines, nor in her gestures or facial expressions, although these were all important ingredients in her success. She seemed to act not just with her voice, her face or her body but with her whole being; she was not, in the technical sense, a Method actress, but few others had her skill in becoming, not merely representing, the character she was playing. In praising Audrey I should not neglect the others who contributed to the success of this movie. There is her co-star Gregory Peck showing that he could be as effective in comedy as in serious drama; there are some amusing exchanges between Joe and his boss Mr. Hennessy. There is Eddie Albert in an important supporting role as Joe's photographer friend Irving. And then there is the city of Rome itself; the film was shot on location and many of the city's most famous sites (the Coliseum, the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps. etc.) are featured. Budgetary considerations apparently precluded the use of Technicolor, but director William Wyler shows that black-and-white photography could be just as effective in creating a sense of place. The scene in which Peck and Hepburn ride through the streets on a motor-scooter must have done wonders for sales of that particular form of transport. "Roman Holiday" is essentially a romantic comedy, but it stands out as a more than usually thoughtful and serious one. It also deserves to be remembered for launching the career of one of the greatest stars of all time. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"She's fair game, Joe . . ."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" . . . it's always open season on princesses." So says photojournalist Irving (Eddie Albert) to homesick American reporter Joe (Gregory Peck) in reference to Princess Ann's (Audrey Hepburn's) 1953 ROMAN HOLIDAY. Ann's 24 hours of Wilding, comparable to an Amish youth's sowing their wild oats in "Rumspringa" season, has come to a bleak ending. Unlike the similarly-plotted "best picture" of 1934--Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert's IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT--there can be no "she lived happily ever after" close to ROMAN HOLIDAY. From the moment she was conceived, the possibility of casual "hook-ups" flew out the window, and now that Ann is newly hooked on cigarettes, the main question for her future is whether she will produce a properly-pedigreed heir before lung cancer claims her. Not that the world will suffer greatly from the loss of a few inbred Royals, or that such an excruciating demise would be preferable to sudden death by car crash, as was the case with Princess Diana of Wales and Princess Grace of Monaco. However, many historical cultures have had their "Royals" serve double duty as national scapegoats, validating Irving's "open season" remark. Not every film has the power to make an "ordinary Joe" give a hoot about a crowned head. This makes ROMAN HOLIDAY a rare triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vibrant breeze of air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's charm is a sense of summer after highschool when days are a bit lazier, nights a bit longer and everything a bit more possible, briefly the horizon is pushed back and new things pop up, become suddenly possible for someone who is no longer a kid and not yet an adult, so the charm hasn't worn off. For me it's all that exuberant youthfulness of Hepburn's wandering around Rome that matters here. Today we would do it quite a bit different, it does seem chaste. An icecream cone is enough, a glass of champagne in a café with two boys, smiles and roses - things that would be truly ratchet for someone with her royal background, innocent for us. But the moped ride still smells of that reckless spring break or summer and I urge you to try to experience it not as a carefully groomed classic but as a vibrant breeze of air now.She is a princess, but we only need to know the sheltered sweet girl who thirsts for dancing. He is a cynical journalist, but we only need to be able to see the storyteller who (along with his photographer friend who captures images of this) creates the cinematic framework that reveals inner life. It all begins with a film noir device, her falling asleep in the palace and tiptoeing out from a dream to find this man who will seduce the story of surprised discovery, bumping into him of all people.Godard several years later in his debut would move the whole thing to Paris, have her as the journalist with the crew cut, turn the man into a boyish actor who imagines himself in a film. It would be much more obvious about cinematic fantasy and the contrast to real time, here it's the same mannerism. Celine and Julie would have it at a much deeper distance from the viewer, unspooling a longer wandering and having us lose our own selves in the playful search, but the inner structure is similar, awakening a sense of purpose; there an inner child is rescued from a soap opera, here she returns a responsible adult.The denouement is a problem. Having it set up the way they did, they can't be together, her abandoning royalty would be too radical for the time, perhaps too sappy. We're stuck with predictable acknowledgments of how meaningful it all was. The rest is worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film from romance and taking the high road were still a thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film comes off oddly credible despite depicting a time when journalists weren't bereft of morals and romance consisted of more than getting drunk at a Jersey Shore club for a few hours together before having sex. Audrey Hepburn exudes girlish charm and doesn't reflexively show us her navel in every scene as she would have to if this were a modern film. Gregory Peck actually plays someone on the horns of a moral dilemma instead of someone who simply follows where the money takes him. You get the sense that in 1953 Italy an English princess could still just about disappear on the streets instead of being torn apart as today's huddled masses would. In short, this breezy, beautiful shot romantic comedy stands as testament to the decline of Western civilization and some of those things that were once good about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Introducing Audrey Hepburn"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Holiday (1953), directed by William Wyler, was the first starring movie role for Audrey Hepburn. (The credits say, Gregory Peck and "Introducing Audrey Hepburn.") Hepburn, at 24, wasn't exactly an unknown, but her success in Roman Holiday changed the course of her career. Hepburn won an Oscar for her portrayal of Cinderella-in-reverse. She is Princess Ann, heir to the throne of an unnamed European nation. Cinderella dreams of becoming a princess; Princess Ann dreams of leading a normal life.Hepburn, having been given an injection to "quiet her nerves," wanders the streets of Rome, where she encounters newspaper reporter Joe Bradley, played by Gregory Peck. The next day, with Bradley and with photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) she sets out to enjoy one perfect, normal day.In 1953, Hepburn was at the height of her ingenue charm. She is breathtakingly beautiful in this film. With her strong elegant features, her lithe dancer's body, and her tiny waist, she dominates the screen in every scene in which she appears. Both Peck and Albert do their customary excellent work, and Rome looks wonderful and romantic.IMDb reviewers have ranked this film within the top 250 films of all time, and I would agree with them. It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth seeking out and viewing. We saw Roman Holiday in the wonderful Dryden Theatre in George Eastman House, Rochester. It will work on a small screen, but seeing it in a theater is even better. Find it and enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Romp, as the Kids Say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bored and sheltered princess (Audrey Hepburn) escapes her guardians and falls in love with an American newsman (Gregory Peck) in Rome.This film is fun, has two very charismatic actors, and set an archetype for many similar films in the years to come. Some, such as "Chasing Liberty", almost blatantly ripping off the story without any credit given... and then there are nice subtle homages, such as seen in "The Little Mermaid".What confuses me about this film is how it got Audrey Hepburn her Oscar. My best guess, based on looking at the other contenders, is that she did not have much competition. I really found nothing outstanding about her performance -- she is much more remarkable in "My Fair Lady" or "Wait Until Dark".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The very definition of a classic, Roman Holiday is as irresistibly charming as it is fanciful and even naive. Partly thanks to the beautiful Roman backdrop, which gives every scene a gorgeous background in lively, warm black and white; partly thanks to the fantastic cinematography, way ahead of most films made in the 50's, a time in which a lot of cinema was still being filmed exclusively on set; partly thanks to young Audrey Hepburn and charismatic Gregory Peck, who dominate every scene with incredible stage presence and chemistry. It's easy to point out the film's flawed logic and the holes in the plot, but it's even easier to lose yourself in its beauty and warmth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Introducing Audrey Hepburn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Italy for a goodwill tour, pretty European princess Audrey Hepburn (as Ann) is bored meeting foreign dignitaries. Her royal highness doesn't like wearing old-fashioned underwear and retiring early with a glass of milk and crackers. She wants to go out and party. After Ms. Hepburn is given a sleep-inducing injection, she goes out and falls asleep on the streets of Rome. Down-on-his-luck New York newspaperman Gregory Peck (as Joe Bradley) finds Hepburn and, thinking she's a drunk, takes her home to sober up. When the morning papers feature Hepburn's picture, Mr. Peck smells a story...But love gets in the way...This flat soufflé is worth watching for the credits - especially Hepburn, in her first big role. She is thoroughly charming, and everyone could see a star was born. The story of a royal coming down to earth to mingle with mere mortals goes back to the silent days and will likely continue as long as there are "royals". Other than seeing Hepburn pass the star test, there are some artful moments. The scene where Hepburn and Peck put their hands in "the mouth of truth" statue is an instance where the locale and personnel come alive. Photographer Eddie Albert (as Irving Radovich) supports Peck well.******* Roman Holiday (8/27/53) William Wyler ~ Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Eddie Albert, Paolo Carlini</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Holiday from Royalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Holiday, the 1953 version, is a wonderful and nostalgic look at the conditions imposed on the Royal Family members that take up the responsibility of leadership, even at the young age that current England's Queen Elizabeth had to do. The movie tells us the story of the young and bored Princess Anne (Audrey Hepburn) who makes an ill-advised escape from her palatial environs to live as a commoner for a day. The reverse of "Queen for a Day" the ideal of most people's dreams.After an outburst of independence is treated with a tranquilizing injection from the royal family doctor, the heroine finds herself falling asleep on a bench, picked up by a news reporter, and taken to sleep off what he thinks is her alcoholic stupor at his modest apartment. After her adventures in Rome with the reporter and his photographer for the next 24 hours, the royal princess returns to a worried staff and resumes her monarchy.The role of the press in the "holiday" for the Princess is clear. After photographing compromising pictures of royalty, the situation unfolds, due to surfacing human compassion, that the reporters refrain from publishing the scenes, or telling the story.All in all, it's an enjoyable movie, from the past, applicable to the present. There is no holiday from royalty, it seems to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly romantic escape and a classic to boot. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of encountering this earlier today at a special tribute screening co-produced by Paramount Classics and the London Film Festival. It is also the first time I have seen this in any shape or form, so the double pleasure is seeing it in the correct B &amp; W 1.33:1 ratio print as originally released.Before the film began, a representative of Paramount read out a letter from Katherine Wyler, the daughter of the director, saying that she was so pleased that Paramount took painstaking efforts to remaster the print, which had been scratched and screened to death. The result on screen is a superb new print which should be given a look if you get the chance on the big screen. Wyler was also given a medal by the Italian Government for his use of Rome locations. Originally the film was to have starred Cary Grant and Liz Taylor and directed by Frank Capra.So to the film itself - a delightful combination of romance and comedy which seems to have inspired more recent offerings like PRETTY WOMAN, with which it shares a similar style.The late Audrey Hepburn, in her debut role, is simply sexy and delightful and the film is a testament to her enduring legend. Gregory Peck, for whom the screening was a special tribute to him after his recent death, is sneakily charming and provides good balance of performance to Hepburn's scene-stealing mannerisms. Eddie Albert also provides an excellent supporting performance as the photographer Peck assigns to take photos of Hepburn as the unknowing princess.What makes the film stand out is the fact that although the audience is well aware of the real identities of Peck and Hepburn, the two principal actors walk a masterful line of near-farce, culminating in a splendid fight on a dance barge with Secret Service agents assigned to protect her, when she is recognized later in the film.As a newcomer to this film, I have to say that had I been a young man at the time of it's release, I would have developed a tremendous crush on Hepburn in the same way I did with more recent alumni as Winona Ryder, Julia Roberts and Jessica Lange.A delightful discovery of old-time cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Royal Tour of the "Eternal City"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead!This was the film that introduced Audrey Hepburn to the world, and what an introduction it was! She ended up walking off with the Academy Award for Best Actress for this performance. Frankly, I think the only other performance in my opinion that was that memorable was Hilary Swank's 1999 turn as doomed teenager Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry.William Wyler struck gold with this story of a restless princess with her heart set on freedom, who ends up running from her duties and falling for a "commoner". I dare anyone reading this to try and NOT think of Diana, Princess of Wales and smile. Her adventures throughout Rome only take up about fifty or so minutes of this two hour film, so there's not much that she can do other than look at the sights and create mayhem with her two cohorts, Eddie Albert and the irrepressible Gregory Peck. My favorite scene is the one where Audrey is on a moped and she goes flying off down the street with Gregory Peck in hot pursuit.This film was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress. Of course, this is the film that shot Audrey Hepburn to stardom. Films like Breakfast at Tiffany's and Sabrina only cemented her legendary status.My rating: 3 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adorable Audrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years as I watched the innumerable photo-ops of the late Princess Diana waving dully and smiling stupidly as she accepted nosegays from schoolchildren, I couldn't help but think of Audrey Hepburn in an identical role in ROMAN HOLIDAY. What a natural! She played the part of a princess with such unforced grace and charm that it seemed she was born for the role. And how easily she changed from a regal monarch to a fun-loving girl cavorting about Rome with her new friend, Joe, perfectly played by Gregory Peck. No American director has been able to film love scenes as convincingly as William Wyler (see FUNNY GIRL and WUTHERING HEIGHTS, e. g.), and here, the developing love between Peck and Hepburn is flawless. If the ending is bittersweet, at least both characters matured from the experience. Maybe Princess Di should have cut loose and run around free for a while, but with this information age, she probably would have been instantly recognized and tailed by papparizzi with far less finesse than Peck and Hepburn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sweetness and decency" but not naivete.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS! BEWARE!"Roman Holiday" was a delightful little movie. It has a warmth and sweetness that still hold power 50 years after it's creation. At the same time, it's not exactly "Pollyana" either. Key moments are when the "naive little princess" smokes her first cigarette, drinks wine, sleeps (in the same room) with a complete stranger, passes out in the street, and gets in a brawl. This is truly the stuff of exploration and is still convincing today. Probably one of "Roman Holiday's" most significant aspects is its surprisingly narrow scope. Despite its grand, cosmopolitan locale, "Roman Holiday" encompasses about a day and a half and its plot is basically what would've constituted one chapter in Tom Sawyer. (Protagonist climbs out of room under the cover of darkness, sees the sights, meets some interesting people, and then goes back home). This myopic focus is an important part of "Roman Holiday's" charm but also probably keeps it from being a perfect film.Obviously, Audrey Hepburn, is a delight to watch. She manages to simultaneously be feminine and boyish, elegant and common, and flighty but grounded. Of course, these are characteristics that not only perfectly represented Princess Ann but remain a key element in Hepburn's acting whatever her role. Gregory Peck was good too. Some criticize the lack of chemistry between the two. I agree that things are a bit wooden romantically but their initial spark of interest coupled with fundamental incompatibility is a key part of the story (as it is in "Random Hearts" with Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas). Finally, I really admired the "walk away" ending. Sure, it stung a little but it made sense and it was beautifully done as Peck walked through that elegant, cavernous room. It was good to remember that serendipitous "love" doesn't need sex or even marriage to validate it. Like the fleeting friendships established in "The Breakfast Club" some things, however special, aren't meant to last. That's part of what makes them so special. (How easy this is to say, but how hard to remember!) Lucky for us though, Ann and Joe's little fling, can be revisited time and again in "Roman Holiday". </fullReview>

It is infinitely better than most of the schlock that Hollywood bills as "romantic comedies" today, although this is hardly great praise. The cast is completely effective, and the movie exudes a lingering sense of youth, longing, and romance that I felt for many an hour after I watched the film.

When Gregory Peck lifted Audrey Hepburn from the fountain -- I said, "Let the adventures begin." And the movie proved itself.

His directorial skills are superbly demonstrated in his excellent usage of an element that captures the audience, suspense. In many instances throughout the length of the film, suspense is used to capture our attention. More than once, I was on the edge of my seat praying that a scenario play out the way that I wanted, how everyone wanted, positively. The film is shot in BW, but it is a known fact that Wyler wanted to switch to color stock. It wasn't to be due to costs. The on-location shooting in Rome is beautiful, one can only dream of how it would have looked in "glorious technicolor"! The cinematography was exceptional, it captured the very heart of this timeless city called Rome. Hepburn, in her first American film caught the hearts of millions world-wide and created a legion of fans and worshippers that would influence social culture for the next twenty years. Her performance earned her an Oscar. Peck was superb in role. Eddie Albert was perfect as Peck's sidekick. The story is original and beautifully scripted. A must see for all movie-goers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A holiday for a Princess, a feast for the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn was magical, from her earliest film roles, until the day she left us. She shines brightly on the arm of Gregory Peck in this light-hearted but meaningful romantic comedy. There are several references to the papparazi, as Peck is a stringer (reporter for a Syndicated News Agency) out to get a scoop. He takes the hapless young Princess under his wing for his own purposes at first, but she soon wins his loyalty, and probably his heart, with her guileless charm.Since the death of Princess Diana of Wales in 1997, this movie has a particular bittersweetness to it. Once again, we are reminded that although being a Princess has its glories and glamour, sometimes the ordinary joys of a simpler life are longed for and cherished above all else. The recurring theme in the movie is the control that royal life had on the young girl, and the lengths that she went to in order to experience a brief respite.The "holiday" is light, funny and very enjoyable. Hepburn seems to be better matched with Peck in this film than with some of the older leading men that she was paired with during her early years. Peck is funny, Audrey is delightful, and the movie is a treat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a princess is a pretty hard lot. Princess Anne of the United Kingdom was born third in line for the throne, but, through no fault of her own, has dropped down to tenth place currently, and may pass away in the lower teens if she lives as long as her mother, Queen Elizabeth II, still going strong in her eighties. To add insult to injury, the fictitious Princess Ann from ROMAN HOLIDAY's unnamed fictitious realm may well be better known and more beloved then the House of Windsor (nee Hanover)'s Anne, thanks to a rookie actress named Audrey Hepburn. As a three-year-old, the real Princess Anne was probably oblivious to the shenanigans of her namesake Princess Ann. As an adult, with her divorce and all, she has shared the unruly instincts of Hepburn's Ann, but perhaps lacked the talent for self-sacrifice evidenced when that Ann limited her association with journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) to 24 hours of fun.</fullReview>

Luckily though, "Roman Holiday" never succumbs to this problem. Travelling around Rome, the film might include major areas of Rome's history, but never at the expense of the love story between Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. Working well together, the two leads make this story a beautiful tale of love and happiness.Audrey Hepburn plays Princess Ann. As a member of a royal house, she faces countless chore like duties. One night however, she sneaks away with the intention of truly experiencing life. Being found by journalist Joe Bradley (Peck), she is shown the sights of Rome as Bradley helps her to achieve all of the dreams she'd always wished for.Despite sounding like an unlikely partnership, the way Hepburn and Peck work together on this film is breathtaking. Winning an Oscar for her performance, Hepburn thrills as the innocent princess who learns about life and love all in a day. Peck by the same accord is equally superb with his eye on a story, and the money it'll bring. Showing the changes in the two characters as they spend time together, the two leads are wonderful. Unfortunately because the film was released in the same year as "From Here To Eternity" and "Julius Caesar", Peck never even received an Oscar nomination for his performance. This might seem unfair considering most other years he would be probably looking at actually winning the award itself.With some wonderful jokes, and some amazing moments, "Roman Holiday" never ceases to thrill. Hepburn deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar for this role, and it was this which made her a star. Teaming up with Gregory Peck, she thrives as the two produce one of the most beautiful romantic stories ever told. Two fine performances, amazing scenery and a great plot, make this one holiday to remember forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" There is too much pomp and ceremony to this position, I wish it would all go away "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many stories concerning the Royal families of Europe, and occasionally a sliver of truth concerning one of them is factual which lends much to this Hollywood offering. This story is a comedy and called " Roman Holiday. " It was originally written by Dalton Trumbo the Black Listed screen writer, but the movie credit was given to others. However with William Wilder as director little is lost from the original script. The story is of a down-on-his-luck American writer named Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) who happens upon a sleeping Princess (Audrey Hepburn) who has escaped from her strict, regimented and enclosed life behind the royal gates. Realizing his incredible luck, Joe takes full advantage of the situation, but pretending he knows nothing of her real Identity and hopes to acquire a Scoop for his newspaper. Enlisting the help of Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert), a close photographer friend, he takes the Princess out for a Holiday. Although it's a comedy, dull slap-stick adds little to the mostly slow, but poignant sympathetic situations. The main emphasis zero's in on Peck and Hepburn's increasing romantic tension. As a result, their Holiday is a fun escapade through the streets of the eternal city. One which becomes more memorable as the years accumulate for their fans. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman Holiday (1953)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the accolades this film has received I was certainly expecting more. Gregory Peck once commented that every romantic comedy script he received had the fingerprints of Cary Grant on it. This transcends into the film itself. Peck is a marvelous actor, no doubt, but he lacks the kind of quirky charm that oozes from Grant. Take for example the scene in which Peck tries to take a camera from a young girl. Sure, the characters intentions are pure, but Peck came off as rather suspect. The film as a whole was simply too involved in the romance, to the point that it was obvious the route it would travel along. Hepburn is fantastic in her innocence, and there are many great moments, but after watching some other classics recently, this failed to engross me for its entire duration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My second film with Hepburn (she wasn't playing to her strength in My Fair Lady where she lacked opportunity to demonstrate her grace!), but this role fits her like a glove, and she came across as a rare breath of fresh air.Hepburn's innocent charm and approachable royalness come out so naturally that one cannot imagine it being matched by any actress. So the question is: does she deserve the Oscar given she was playing herself, rather than playing a difficult role well?Only snag in this film are the sometimes over-zealous efforts on being comic, such as the spilling of drinks by Peck and the somewhat noisy music.Entertaining and highly recommended on Hepburn alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Small SpoilersWow...A great movie. This was, ironically, my first known encounter with Audrey Hepburn. I had seen My Fair Lady (who hasn't?) with my dad when I was a kid (I'm but 16 now), but I didn't know that it was her in it. This time, I was cognizant of whom the beauty was.Beauty--That's just part of Audrey's greatness. But one has to admit, no other actress combines cuteness, elegance, class, sophistication, sexiness, innocence...[the list goes on] into one persona that is just, "Audrey."Anyway, all that is superficial, right? Eh..sorta. You see, Audrey derives her characters (which in this movie is a princess) from her own versatile self. So her beauty is incidental.This is a great, but sad movie. A princess from some East European country visits with her family the city of Rome. She is bored and tired of a life of pomp and circumstance. Anya, the princess, runs away.She is found on the streets late one evening by Joe the journalist, played skillfully by Atticus Finch himself, Gregory Peck. He brings a smooth, tasteful touch to the character of Joe, who is a struggling newspaper writer.This movie is funny, loving, and utterly charming. It really is. I watched this movie on Valentine's Day, 2003. I was alone because I don't have a girlfriend or anything, I never have...but I am a romantic at heart. Anyway, this movie really made that day, though solitary, something to remember.Do yourself a favor: Watch this movie and fall in love again with the signifigant other in your life. If you don't have one, like me, then you will fall in love with Audrey, like I have. Hell. Even if you ARE married or something, you'll *still* love Audrey.Nader</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderfully romantic fantasy this is! Audrey Hepburn is so perfect in her role as a princess who would like to see what is beyond the walls of her gilded cage. Gregory Peck as the reporter who really needs a scoop, and stumbles upon the biggest story of his life.Rome is beautifully presented and is an uncredited co-star in this movie, it makes me want to see it, although I do realize that the Rome of 1953 is mostly long gone. Still, I can dream, and isn't that what movies are? Celluloid dreams.Emotionally engaging, you really feel with the characters although you realize it is a fantasy. But the best fairy tales are like that. Bette Davis once said in answering the charge that movie stories are not real " If you want real, just sit on a street corner and look at people and see how long that holds your attention." No, we go to movies to escape "real", for a little bit and this movie does just that.A top romance film, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ROMAN HOLIDAY Sparkles on New DVD Release!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All one has to do to get some idea of how well loved William Wyler's romantic 1953 comedy-drama ROMAN HOLIDAY is -- is to read several of the Reader's Comments recorded here! Having a Laser Disc copy of this title, I have eagarly awaited its arrival on the DVD format. Several times I have been tempted to order a Hong Kong release. (I'm glad I didn't!) The wait is over as Paramount has released ROMAN HOLIDAY and Billy Wilder's 1950 classic, SUNSET BOULEVARD on DVD, in beautifully restored Collector's Editions that are breathtaking! There is a short "Restoring ROMAN HOLIDAY" featurette that gives one an appreciation for the efforts involved in making this film look and sound like it did when originally released. At age 15, I saw and re-saw ROMAN HOLIDAY many, many times when it was first released. Like most of the movie-going world, I fell in love with Audrey Hepburn in this "star is born" performance. Last year (2001), my wife and I saw a revival of this film at a local theater. Most of the print was fine, but the film was projected in a ratio of 1.85:1, thus destroying the composition of the picture by cutting off the top and bottom of the frame. ROMAN HOLIDAY came out in the year Hollywood was moving from the standard screen format (1.33:1) to the wide-screen (anywhere from 1.66:1 to 2.60:1). This was the year that 20th Century Fox's THE ROBE introduced their CinemaScope process. 1953 was also the year for 3-Dimensional movies -- you wore special glasses and the screen image had depth and things jumped off the screen at the audience. But this was also a year with some outstanding classics still being released in regular format -- films like ROMAN HOLIDAY, STALAG 17, SHANE, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, MARTIN LUTHER, YOUNG BESS and THE STORY OF THREE LOVES. Now Paramount has released ROMAN HOLIDAY on DVD in a full-frame version that sparkles with its beautiful black and white tones. The sound is excellent -- Mono, yes -- not in 5.1 surround that suits films that were recorded that way -- but in a very nice rendition of the original track (both in English &amp; French). The Featurette, "Remembering ROMAN HOLIDAY" is choice. Included as "Extras" are 3 different Theatrical Trailers; a Photo Gallerie, a Featurette on costume designer, Edith Head (that is also included on the SUNSET BOULEVARD" DVD). Paramount, who is celebrating 90 years, is to been highly commended for this ourstanding restoration. (P.S.: Paramount's WAR AND PEACE is scheduled for a DVD release the first week of Dec. 2002 -- Here's hoping that they have done an equally fine job of restoring that film, which features Audrey Hepburn, Henry Fonda and Mel Ferrer in a epic telling of Leo Tolstoy's famous novel.) ROMAN HOLIDAY is a must own DVD, that should delight old and young alike! Thanks Paramount!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairy tale set in Rome...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We should all be so lucky as to experience a holiday as magical and satisfying as the one featured in this movie. Audrey Hepburn stars as Princess Ann, so frustrated with her royal schedule and commitments that she leaves the palace for one night... or so she thinks. Not knowing that she's been given sleeping pills, she ends up falling asleep all over Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), a hard-nosed reporter who soon realises that he's sitting on the story of the year. What follows is a charming tale set in one of the most beautiful cities of the world, Rome. As Ann/Anya wanders by the Trevi fountain, or visits the Mouth of Truth with Joe, you can't help feeling that there's something magical about the setting. (Obviously, this is helped by the obvious chemistry between the gamine Hepburn and the very handsome Peck.) Everyone should be so lucky as to fall in love in Rome, as Anya and Joe eventually do.Favourite part of the movie: It would probably have to be Joe dumping 'Anya' off his bed and onto the uncomfortable couch, and trying his best to shift her back onto the bed when he discovers that she is actually 'Ann'.Not to give away the ending, but there is one thing I must say about it: although the premise of the story is itself unbelievable, the ending rings true, incredibly so, and the entire film is the better for it. The last scenes are touching and heartbreaking and inspiring, all at the same time. Well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a film about growing up and learning to live. Everything in this movie is perfect to me, EXCEPT pairing Audrey Hepburn up with Gregory Peck. Don't get me wrong, I love Gregory Peck, but here he just doesn't fit into the part. I can see someone like William Holden doing this. Gregory Peck being a two bit reporter on the beat, no way! He's not believable to me. A country lawyer fighting for injustice, yes......This is just like when Audrey Hepburn played Eliza Doolittle, please! (read my review on My Fair Lady to explain this one) Other than the above comment, the film is heavenly. Beautiful scenery, great actors, cute dialogue, and perfect direction. This is Audrey Hepburns first movie and what a entrance. You can see that the camera loves her, as do we. This is one of her best films. If you haven't seen it because it's NOT on the AFI's 100 best films list, see it and then scratch it in!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A captive Princess gets a day off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing, I know, that in my almost 60 years of movie-watching I had never seen "Roman Holiday" until now. But it is on a recent list of "best" movies so I snagged my opportunity when I found it at my local public library. The DVD is very nicely done, with interesting extra features.Just in her early 20s, this is the film that got Audrey Hepburn noticed. Gregory Peck was approaching 40, and Eddie Albert was approaching 50. But the three of them are just wonderful together in this caper.Gregory Peck is Joe Bradley, in Rome with the American News Service. By all indications, including owing 2 months' back rent on his very modest apartment, the money was not flowing in.Audrey Hepburn is British Princess Ann, heir to the throne, forced by "duty" to make appearances all over but otherwise very tightly controlled. She longed to break out of her chains.One evening, feeling particularly moody, her handlers gave her a shot of something to help her sleep, but she managed to crawl out of a window at the British Embassy in Rome and escape by hiding in a laundry truck that shortly left. She found herself at night in a strange place and as luck would have it was discovered by Bradley as she slept on a bench. He tried to get a taxi to take her somewhere but practically incoherent she ended up sleeping at his place.At first Bradley has no idea who she is, but when he realizes she is the Princess sees an opportunity for a real story and some real cash, $5,000. He recruits his friend, Eddie Albert as photographer Irving Radovich, to help out (for 25%) by snapping exclusive photos of the Princess on her one-day "holiday" all around Rome. She thought he was just being nice to help her sight-see, he looked at it as strictly a business opportunity.Ann finds out how it is to live like a real person, but in the end she returns to her Princessly duties, and finds out who Bradley and Radovich really are, as she fields questions from them and a host of other newsmen. Their secret safe, as Bradley has too much respect for her to sell the story, and both their lives are changed for the better, as a result of this one magnificent day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first Audrey Hepburn film, and I'm in love already. She deservedly won an Oscar for her portrayal of the young Princess Ann, a girl who has spent her entire life living the proper life of royalty and finally escapes into the city to enjoy life as a civilian. Even if it's just for one day. Gregory Peck gives a charming and remarkably humorous performance as Joe Bradley, the reporter who stumbles upon Ann and brings her back to his place so he can get an exclusive story of the Princess on the town. The two of them take a trip through Rome for one day, seeing all of the beautiful sites and falling in love with one another. It's one of the most charming, adorable films I've ever seen with a beautiful romance in the center created expertly by Peck and Hepburn. She gives what is easily one of the best female performances I've seen. One of those films that makes you feel like you're falling in love, as you see these two people do the same, while seeing absolutely beautiful scenery. I hear it said all the time with the film, and I feel the same way; it makes me want to spend a day in Rome. The final scene is heartbreaking, but not in a devastating way that will leave you shaking on the floor. You know what's going to happen, but the chemistry between the two is so flawless that the film makes you beg for them to slip into unrealism just for a second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hepburn Still Magical A Half Century Later In Reverse Cinderella Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is still the quintessential Audrey Hepburn movie. If you think Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, and Kate Winslet are the essence of Hollywood beauty but have never seen Audrey Hepurn, you are missing out on one of the greatest of screen icons. Although there are wonderful actresses who have graced many-a Hollywood film, there is only one Audrey Hepburn. She may be the greatest Hollywood female icon of all time in terms of her combination of acting, demeanor, charm, intelligence and personality. There was always an innocently vulnerable, adolescent quality to Audrey Hepburn, even when she was much older. Simultaneously, she had this spunky mischievous side to her that shines through in "Roman Holiday"--innocent curiosity that has been immortalized in the two decades she graced the large screen. And of course she was one of the most enduringly beautiful women in the history of film. "Roman Holiday" is Hepburn doing what she does best.The premise of "Roman Holiday" is a bit of a Hollywood contrivance, but the dialog and the acting save it from becoming corny. It is Cinderella in reverse. The essential plot concerns Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess from a "nameless" European country. (Even one supporting character reaffirms that the country will remain nameless.) She is bored with her overly protected life which is so highly structured and ceremonial that even when she inadvertently loses her shoe during a high-class engagement, retrieving it becomes an act of refined etiquette. She is in Rome, one stop on a European tour with her entourage of dignitaries, and residing at her country's embassy. Anxious to leave, if only for a moment, the gilded cage of her life of royal obligation, she sneaks out of the embassy and enters the heart of Rome via a food truck.Later she ends up drunk and unconscious on a Roman sidewalk. And guess who should happen by but Gregory Peck as Joe Bradley, second-rate American reporter who would like nothing more than to get the scoop of the century and hop back to the New York press scene. But of course he doesn't know who she is. Being a relatively good Samaritan, he rescues her from the streets and brings her into his studio apartment. All the while it is unbeknown-st to him that she is the princess who is having a press conference the following morning in which he is scheduled to attend for his newspaper. Despite the fact that she is still the epitome of ultimate cuteness (young women like Hepburn always look the cutest when they're sleeping), he dumps her on his couch while she is still amidst her drunken stupor. The next morning, however, his feelings toward her do a 180 when he realizes who she really is. It would be a great story, worth $5000, for a reporter whose career has stagnated to get an exclusive interview with the princess. And he solicits friend and press photographer Irving (Eddie Albert) for pictures to prove the story. At first the movie is a kind of madcap scheme to get the story at all costs. Some of the funniest moments are when Albert meets Hepburn and Peck at a café and Peck has to figure out a way to tell his colleague about the circumstances without letting on to naive Hepburn. But then the story begins to develop into something else as the relationship between Hepburn and Peck evolves into something deeper. And the ending of the movie is bitter-sweet saving the story from becoming pure sap.There is no question that this movie is rather schmaltzy by 21st-century standards. The story is a fantasy-comedy, but the writing and the acting which never lapses into too much sentimentality save the film, which could have been much sillier and much more syrupy. The sobering ending makes the film much better than it could have been. And of course Audrey Hepburn who essentially made her major screen debut steals the show. Best to see this one with your significant other and some clean-ex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman Holiday-More Like Roman Boredom **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I know that I'm in the minority here, I found this 1953 film to be utterly boring.Audrey Hepburn won an undeserved Oscar here for her role as a bored princess who runs away to find love with a newspaper reporter, the always reliable Gregory Peck. Hepburn was far better the following year in "Sabrina," for which she was again nominated. Of course, she should have won easily for "The Nun's Story," in 1959 and gave another great performance as a blind woman victimized by thieves in 1967's "Wait Until Dark," her final Oscar bid. How the Academy ignored Barbara Stanwyck's phenomenal performance in 1953's "Titanic" was beyond me. To add insult to injury, Stanwyck wasn't even nominated along with the equally great Clifton Webb."Roman Holiday" had magnificent cinematography and that was about it. To me, Hepburn was often childish in the film and that scene in the cave was just a little too much for me.Eddie Albert received a best supporting Oscar bid here and I think only the Lord knows why. His chance for Oscar was foiled two years later when he failed to be nominated for his memorable turn as Burt McGuire in the magnificent "I'll Cry Tomorrow.""Roman Holiday" should have been in color. This really would have uplifted the great cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn: A true princess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Holiday will forever be considered a classic because it is one of the best movies for three superstar names in the industry: actor Gregory Peck, actress Audrey Hepburn, and director William Wyler. The story revolves around an English princess (Hepburn) who grows tired of the stuffy day-to-day life of royalty and sneaks out during a visit to Rome. An American reporter (Peck) stumbles across her and reluctantly decides to take care of her, not yet knowing who she is. When he finds out, he sees a golden opportunity for his newspaper for an exclusive interview. But then love gets in the way (as always). This movie is like many other light-hearted romantic comedies, but the last scene elevates it to the top tier (remember, no spoilers on this site). Audrey Hepburn plays the part perfectly, as if she is indeed a real princess and I can't imagine anyone else playing Gregory Peck's role as well as he does. Eddie Albert adds some good laughs and Rome is always a great setting. Good movie!</fullReview>

That is film, that ever was delightful. I tried to make my comments in about 6 lines, but the system only accept above 10 lines or is 12 lines ?!!!

		<shortDescription>Roman Holiday, Roman Heart and Roman Magic--Eternal City, Eternal Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin with this lovely, enduring film that is destined to live forever? -the pure magic of Audrey Hepburn? --the spectacular beauty of Rome?--the genuinely brilliant and surprising script?--the acting styles of each and every actor displaying such wonderful timing and precision, balancing realism, brilliant comic timing and heartfelt emotions?--the virtuosic direction of William Wyler who, at the drop of a hat, lets the audience laugh with glee at some of the more outrageous situations, behold in wonder the glories of the Eternal City and then feel tears welling up at the bittersweet moments when the day draws to a close and the inevitable march of time and reality intrudes on the fantasy? First of all the film is a miracle of timing--there is not one wasted moment. It is so perfect--that we want to see it again, and again--and each time it feels just as fresh, just as surprising and witty, just as heartbreaking as the first viewing. Most importantly, we the viewer, relate. We're not Royalty in a receiving line waiting to greet dukes and counts and foreign dignitaries....We're not ex-pats in some exotic locale scrounging for a living...and yet, the characters all feel so real to us. Who hasn't felt the pangs of unrequited love? Who hasn't experienced the laudable feelings of loyalty to a lover...to a friend? Who hasn't felt desperate, or lonely, or deliriously happy, or contentedly at peace...these emotions abound in the film, as real to us as they are to these wonderful characters on that silver screen. So many moments to cherish in this film: the genuinely funny opening reception line, Audrey Hepburn's smile and luminous beauty, the first view of sunny Rome from Joe Bradley's plebeian but wonderfully colorful terrace, the great comic persona of Eddie Albert's beatnik photographer, the ancient Roman ruins lit up in the dark of evening, Wyler's textbook perfect filming of the police station episode with just a few bars of the Wedding March heard as Joe Bradley gleefully lies his way out of an arrest of the Princess, the myriad characters--whether the cleaning lady, the landlord, the barber, each with brief but memorable and memorably adorable scenes, that moment of heartbreaking loneliness toward the end of the film, in Joe's apartment when the princess prepares to leave her "new life" and "new love" forever, and the final, amazing scene as the Princess greets the reporters--what a cascade of emotions the characters (and we, the audience!) feel! Its clever and funny one moment as Eddie Albert takes that last picture with his cigarette lighter and the princess gets a quick glimpse of her "photo". Its reassuring and so satisfying, how with a simple sentence across that palace room, Joe is able to convey to the princess that she needn't worry--their story is their story--no one else's to betray or to be regretful about! And in another heartbeat, the scene fills us with heartfelt emotion and tears, as Joe and the princess are as far apart as physical distance and life and their world could make them.....and yet with an eye glance, and a touching few words, and a final loving smile from our radiant princess--they are as close as two human beings have ever been. This is a film to treasure forever. For us film buffs, as someone else has commented upon in these user comments,..in our minds Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck are forever young, forever beautiful...and just about to begin their wonderful, enchanting, fun and love-filled day in their and our beloved Rome--a Rome of Heart and Magic and endless possibilities of life and love and happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is enjoyment ever innocent?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not a whole lot I can add to everyone's comments on this picture so far. Audrey Hepburn is a marvel--I could watch her in just about anything. Having recently seen "Twelve O'Clock High", I'm also growing fond of Gregory Peck; the worst you can say about him in this movie is that he's no Clark Gable or Cary Grant, but then who is? It's also a treat to see Eddie Albert in the pre-"Green Acres" days. The Roman scenery is absolutely lovely, and it's interesting to compare this film with the Italian "neo-realist" films which were all the rage in the previous few years; one wonders if William Wyler saw, say, "Open City", and wondered what a Hollywood film crew could do with scenery like that?As for the plot, well...to be charitable, there's not a whole lot to it. On the other hand, with Audrey Hepburn up there on the screen, who needs a plot? With her, incident would seem to be sufficient. Even though I personally prefer the more intricately worked storyline of "Sabrina", I understand why "Roman Holiday" could be considered the definitive Audrey Hepburn movie, why she won her only Oscar for it, and why it was the first of her films named to the National Film Registry.(SPOILER WARNING) Nevertheless, there is one feature of interest in the story itself, especially considering that it was written by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo, who'd been jailed as one of the "Hollywood Ten" who refused to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee. As Joe Bradley gets to know Princess Anne, she becomes more important to him as a person than as a story. Just before letting her go back, he almost tells her who he really is, but she doesn't want to know. (Does she already suspect that Joe might be too good to be true, and fears knowing for sure?) In that moment, Joe seems to realize that the best thing he can do for Anne is to keep silent about their "holiday", and this is confirmed by his subsequent actions. In those days of "naming names", was Trumbo trying to send a message about the importance of keeping confidences? (Compare the previous year's "High Noon", written by the soon-to-be-blacklisted Carl Foreman, on the importance of hanging together in the face of impending threat; contrast the following year's "On the Waterfront", written by Budd Schulberg and directed by Elia Kazan [both friendly witnesses before HUAC], a justification of squealing.)Perhaps I've read too much into a film that has been a source of innocent enjoyment for several generations of filmgoers, and I hope I haven't spoiled that aspect of "Roman Holiday" for anyone. Even so, I suspect the message about confidences may strike home below the conscious level for many viewers, which might explain why this film is an all-time favorite for so many. (Besides Audrey Hepburn and its other naturally appealing elements, of course.) It doesn't even have to have political significance, but only to reflect a wish for a world long gone. Alas, in these days of information explosion, media time to be filled, and far too many people willing to sink to the lowest level to fill it, it is impossible to believe that such a "holiday" as Anne and Joe's would remain secret for long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a refreshing romance/comedy movie, in all its tamed,skinless endeavor.With a bright-headlights for eyes,huge beautiful aura of Audrey H.Nudity never crossed this hetro. sex. males mind while watching this great movie.Air brush,nudity,and sex are the necessities of Hollywood movies nowadays.This film gained a win without going to battle for more skin.And lead actor Greggy Peck was superb also(why did he not get nominated),scenery was awesome,story was heart warming through out the movie.And ending was not typical.All this while still feeling the day before.Props go to public TV for this 11.30pm commercial free showing!! And those that are English majors,don't laugh,i know my writing skills deplorable. p.s.where are all the good movie writers?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So excited!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Audrey,I'm 'so excited' now! My son was just born on 5/11, and he's so...... good-looking! I love him so much!He has his mother's eyes and his father's nose and hair. I want to name him after my American mother 'Henrietta', and that's 'Henry'. I'm also thinking about 'Joe', after Joe Bradley. He must be very smart, since he successfully chose the strong points of both of us.And now, I kept saying 'so excited' to myself. And I think that's how you felt in your Roman holiday, so you must understand how I feel. Yours, Rong(code-named 'Roman')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Which actor was first considered for the lead male role ? Which actress was first considered for the lead female role ? Who was first considered to play Eddie Albert's role ? Who played the barber that cuts the princess' hair ? Does the "wishing wall" that they visit still exist today ? Does "the wall of truth" still exist today ? Did cigarette lighter photo camera technology really exist in 1953 ? The Princess was from what country ? Where was the screen play writer located when he wrote the story ? Isn't it odd that Peck's "cleaning lady" barges into his bathroom when she hears water swishing? Why weren't the two little girls in the scene where Peck tries to steal a camera not paid scale wages ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very rare aircraft in this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A minor point, but of interest to enthusiasts of old airliners-"propliners"-like myself, is the fact that the aircraft used in the airport scene, was a unique-only one produced-type, the Breda BZ308, an early post-war period, sadly unsuccessful Italian machine. I've not seen the film, but on the strength of this alone-I was recently made aware of it-I now intend to buy a DVD of it. It was built and first flew in 1948 and was scrapped not long after it appeared in Roman holiday. I believe the scene with it shows some "men in black" deplaning from the aircraft, presumably at Ciampino or Fiumcino-Rome's two airports.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the good stuff. (1) The shots of Rome are wonderful. One can hardly believe it's the same crowded metropolis that it is today. Let's hear it for 1953! The other recent film that shows Rome so beautifully is "The Talented Mr. Ripley". (2) As usual, Audrey Hepburn is just wonderful. She came from some beautiful planet. The scene when she wakes up in Gregory Peck's apartment is lovely: I just think of how she tries to cover herself with the blanket and misses covering her posterior. Just great. The scene at the "Mouth of Truth" is fantastic.Second, the bad stuff. (1) Gregory Peck just does not fit Audrey Hepburn. He lacks her light touch. He is a bit wooden --- just like Humphrey Bogart in Sabrina. I thought that Gary Cooper was a better romantic lead in "Love in the Afternoon". (2) I am always uncomfortable when Italian characters are portrayed as a type of buffoon. (3) A princess on the lam is a great idea, but monarchy as a real institution, as portrayed in this movie, has very little meaning anymore. I realize that Queen Elizabeth was crowned a couple of years before this movie was made, and the pomp, mystique, and the royal ethic of self-subordination were probably still very much alive. But now all that is quite tarnished for whatever reason. Princess Ann's transformation and maturation therefore seem artificial and dated.What can I say? As a Hepburn film, it's a 10. As a movie, it's a 5 or 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pleasant enough diversion for an evening's entertainment.HEPBURN and ALBERT(his car was great!!) were good in their roles.She won an Oscar for this??.Albert should have got one as well !!.Gregory Peck's performance was the main thing that spoiled it for me.He seemed a bit reserved or "stiff" to a "seedy" reporter-compare him in any scene with Eddie Albert.William Holden would have been more natural in the role.Also the "ITALIAN" actor's parts all seemed to comedy relief(cab driver,hairdresser,landlord,cleaning lady).The non-"Hollywood" ending was a nice touch.Where can i buy one of those minivans they featured in the escape from the palace scene?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as original as everybody assumes...no glass slipper for this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing that you can read through all these reviews of ROMAN HOLIDAY and get the idea that this is an original story. Actually, a lesser-known film from 1943 starring OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND, ROBERT CUMMINGS, JANE WYMAN and JACK Carson dealt with the same theme--a princess steals out for some time on her own and falls in love with an airline pilot in Washington, D.C. (not Rome). But that film had a happy ending in keeping with its Oscar-winning screenplay's designation as a romantic comedy. Furthermore, Norman Krasna's script was just as witty as Dalton Trumbo's for ROMAN HOLIDAY and won a well deserved Oscar.And yet here, among the many reviews, a few have compared the story to IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT instead of PRINCESS O'ROURKE.Anyway, I'm a fan of both stars (Peck and Hepburn), but I've seen both of them appear to better advantage than they do here. Hepburn is vivacious and attractive as Princess Ann and Peck makes a believable enough newspaper man, but I don't believe either one of them gets to do anything memorable enough to support all these glowing reviews. And certainly William Wyler has had more notable achievements in his long career than this fluffy romantic comedy with an unhappy ending. The only conclusion I can come to is that Hepburn's interesting personality on film is an endearing one--and magical enough so that can do no wrong as far as her fans are concerned.It must be the overwhelming star presence of AUDREY HEPBURN that makes this one such a popular treat because there's nothing especially novel about the predictable screenplay--and EDDIE ALBERT's nomination is somewhat puzzling as he's done even better work in all of his comedies during his years under contract to Warner Bros. He's a fine comedian and actor who always deserved better treatment than he received.To put it mildly, I find this film terribly overrated--unspectacular in its photography and after telling what is basically a slow moving and much-told fairytale about a princess and a commoner, it gives us an unhappy and terribly sentimental and sappy ending.Sorry, this one's not my cup of tea. Not a glass slipper in sight no matter how much Audrey sparkles.Summing up: Basically, just another variation on the princess and the commoner theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too dated to be enjoyed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only scene that appears real is the final one; the great hall appears magnificent -- on location and not created. All other settings are cardboard, especially the view outside Gregory Peck's apartment. What are those buildings anyway? And how high up is he? Audrey Hepburn is way too much to take for an entire film. Her speaking is so slow and phony. I think I saw just about all her films. I liked her in The Nun's Story; her role in Breakfast at Tiffany's is way over the top. Peck appears as stiff as the scenery and as old as the hills. And what's with the attention paid to a princess: ooh -- aah -- let us watch her as she walks toward us, let us ask her about world events, let us not breathe in her presence, let us listen to every syllable uttered and let us memorize her singular answers that will be parroted by future Miss America contestants. After all, she IS a princess! And is she speaking English/American to all those men from many nations while in Rome? Did I miss that explanation? I know this film is 50 years old so, perhaps, I am a wee bit too harsh. In the spirit of this holiday season, I offer these few compliments about this film I viewed yesterday. Peck's eyebrows are not as luxuriant as in his recent appearances and Hepburn does not use a cigarette holder. At the end when the noble and blessed by birth -- better than anyone else -- princess returns to her fine digs, she is really nasty to the countess and to those two men who cower before her. I'm wondering who removes her glass slippers and unmakes her 22-mattress bed and brushes 100 times her tresses and sets out her flowing nightie. Surely "her royal highness" does not. The premise of this film is amusing, but never will a remake be attempted. We do not bow before those who think they are royal. Thanks, John Hancock!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but highly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both Audrey Hepburn and especially Gregory Peck have done so many films that are better than this above average romance that I am shocked at the reputation of this film. A good film--absolutely. But IMDb TOP 250?! No way! For Peck, he must have done a dozen films are are superior (such as THE BIG COUNTRY, THE GUNFIGHTER, GUNS OF NAVARONE, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, 12 O'CLOCK HIGH, and several others). And for Hepburn, THE NUN'S STORY, LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON and even the flawed MY FAIR LADY are better films.The movie is a cute fantasy about a princess (Ms. Hepburn) who longs to live among the normal folk and experience life (not a new or unique theme--this has been seen in THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER and THERE GOES MY HEART, among others). She meets nice-guy reporter Peck and has a bunch of sweet experienced seeing the city---all the while he has no idea she is a princess. That's really about all there is to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not even a whiff of communism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is supposed to be based on a story by Dalton Trumbo, who was put in jail because he would not snitch on communist pals. It was during the days of McCarthyism, in which supposedly communist had infiltrated the film industry and......what, really? Were they supposed to smuggle in some hidden communist propaganda in their films? How would that be possible? Take this film, for instance. According to that theory, this is a communist story. How come then, that the only feeling I'm left with is pity for the rich and powerful, who have to live such dreadful lives of duties and no fun at all. Poor, poor princess, jau, jau. Having written this story, Dalton Trumbo deserved to be kicked out from the communist party for being a capitalist spy and not the other way around! We now know, or should know, that Sovietism was not communism. Fidel Castro's Cuba was much closer to communism. The iron curtain was not communism, it was protectionism of power. Nothing hurt the idea of communism more than the Soviet Union claiming to be communist and at the same time establishing the iron curtain. They did it in order to protect their party in which they had invested their lives, not in order to protect communism. It can be argued that communism is at least partly to be blamed. It says: From all according to ability and to all according to need. Who decides that one man needs a castle to live in and another man only a shed? Only power would decide such a thing and that's not the idea of communism. "Prosperity to all" is a better slogan, but that is anarchism, which is maybe the better ism. Communism or anarchism - one thing is for sure - none of them profits from films, that make us feel sorry for the rich and powerful! If I were a communist and had to choose between writing stories like the one for this film and go to jail, I'm not sure what I would choose, provided that the jail was decent with good food and no chance of being raped. In America, such provisions are not given and maybe therefore this film exist???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't get it how such movies get so many good reviews and even win Oscars! Now again, what's so good about this movie?! Don't bother answering, I know: Nothing! Boring story with no memorable lines and nothing about it is entertaining. I like Gregory Peck and Hepburn though but the movie just fails to do it for me.I think people just like fairy tales put for them in a realistic mold. I don't mind stories of the like but if were entertaining and can make me bear to the end.I have to say though that I can totally understand those movies were good in their own times being new ideas and when there was like one actor every 20 years but not nowadays, oh nah!</fullReview>
