		<shortDescription>More style than substance but good fun as a modern spin on the spaghetti genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Western town of Redemption John Herrod runs everything, they say he gets half of every dollar spent or earned. In order to face his enemies face on he runs an annual quick draw contest where fights battle each other until only one remains. The winner takes home a small fortune ? the losers leave wounded if they are lucky. Into this contest comes a group of hopefuls including a woman who has personal reasons for signing up.Looking at the list of names it is evident that the casting director is very good at his/her job as they managed to catch several big names, get several stars who were a few years away from hitting big and also get veteran faces as well. The ensemble of well known faces suits this film as the focus is very much on style and appearance than it is on substance. As a plot it takes the well known genre of the revenge western and makes a sort of pastiche of it. Thus we have the OTT and hyper direction of Rami and gun fights that are delivered with energy and shots that have no bearing to reality.When I think about the actual plot, it really should bother me more than it does. The plot is pretty thin and contains nothing that you can't see coming from about the first 20 minutes of the film ? certainly the woman's `secret' will be no mystery to anyone who has seen `Once Upon A Time In The West' which it clearly apes in this regard. What exists in the place of a wider plot is characters and style. The style is fun and energetic and will appeal to fans of Evil Dead etc.The characters themselves are also pretty good, each has a little back story which helps to fill out the running time without getting too serious. Stone does surprisingly well in the lead, she's no Clint Eastwood but she leads the cast well ? which is no mean feat when you look at the credits. Hackman is a gleefully good villain ? even more mean and unrepentant that his character in Unforgiven. Crowe and DiCaprio were both a few years from the levels of stardom they now hold, but both are engaging and enjoyable. The support cast is also full of names and faces you'll recognise ? either as solid support actors of recent films or older faces. For example ? Henriksen, David, Sinise, Hingle, Bell and Blossom.Overall this film might infuriate you if you are looking for a film that has more substance than style, as this is the other way round. However fans of Rami's style and/or revenge westerns will find much to enjoy here. Every time I see it I always find it hard not to get caught up in the atmosphere it creates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun modern western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie uses lot's of ingredients used in classic westerns. It does it in a fun way but it doesn't spoof the classic westerns in any way and it never becomes humorous or a parody that makes fun of the genre.Who would have known, Sharon Stone is a believable cowgirl. I think it's fair for me to say that she's the best I have seen in a western. The movie also features both Russell Crow and Leonardo DiCaprio before their days of fame and big Dollars. It's always fun and great to have Gene Hackman in a villain role and he makes this movie an even more pleasant watch. The movie features lot's of other fun and stereotype western characters.The settings and costumes are great and real western like and help to create the right atmosphere for the movie. The great western score is by Alan Silvestri and fits the movie well, even though the score goes a bit too much "Back to the Future" like at times.The movie is filled with some unusual but great Sam Raimi like cinematography and tricks.Just enjoy and don't pay attention to the story. It is just simple entertainment!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like all of Sam Raimi's movies, this flick was a cartoon. That's not an insult- his works with the Coen brothers on movies like The Hudsucker Proxy are some of my favorites, with their insanely "zoomed-in" quality. This movie was a spaghetti western, it was ABOUT spaghetti westerns, and it was also a weird, wonderful nightmare where your options are limited, you're a superhero, and your enemy is all-powerful. That's adolescent, silly, and totally compelling.Raimi has always done brilliant visuals; I don't know his history, but I suspect he read a lot of pulp comics as a kid. The early scene where Stone gets up (after playing dead) and you see her shadow putting her hat back on, with the obvious bullet hole in the brim, is sheer visual brilliance.Gene Hackman is, of course, great (MST3K line: "He's good in everything!"). Sharon Stone has gotten a lot of static for doing what Clint Eastwood built a legend on: bad acting, done intensely. (And in Stone's case in this flick, I think, purposefully.) Leonardo D. is well-cast as a cocky, yet needy, "bad-a** in his own mind" type. Russell Crowe (who nobody knew at the time, especially me) is great in his role as a survivor of a 12-step program to help fight a dependence on violence, complete with backsliding moments.Do not look to this movie expecting anything like realism, believability, or moderation. This is pulp fiction, eye candy, nightmare surrealism, wanton entertainment. It's trash culture saluting trash culture, and if you can appreciate that, it's a hell of a great ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sharon Stone is another gun in the old West town? It seems that she is here to pay off an old score that has haunted her since she was a child? She becomes swept up in a deadly quick-draw contest where anybody can challenge anybody in the windy dusty streets? The fighters must not draw until the clock makes the first chime of the hour? Whoever is standing after the draw is the winner? The prize is $123,000? The lawless town of Redemption is ruled by a despicable ironfisted gunman called John Herod who takes a lot to scare him? Hackman plays pretty well the kind people hate? He is, here, a fearless, sadistic, cold-blooded killer in charge of everything, who decides who lives or who dies? Herod wants a preacher in the tournament ? even if he has to beat, kick, and knock him to the ground to force him back into it? Cort? humiliated and chained out by the fountain?used to be pretty fast, faster than Herod? But now he wouldn't hurt a fly? He is a man of peace who has renounced violence? Years ago he was an outlaw? In fact, he was only a kid when he hitched up with Herod? He singled him out because he was a little smarter, a little faster than most? Now, he must revert to his former believes to survive? As Cort, Russell Crowe is saintly when compared to the movie's real villain? Cort tries to redeem himself, but gets enticed into the killing by Herod who is trying to prove that he's a fraud...Several other men were just running a little errand for Herod? But Herod made an example of them all: the buffoon card shark (Lance Henriksen); the hired gun moseying into town to kill (Keith David); the teenager gunslinger who thinks he is on a different level (Leonardo DiCaprio).Raimi succeeds through his shots of each gunfighter to show the worried and scared faces of each gunfighter, the clock counting away the time, and Herod's magnified evil smile?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raimi goes West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With The Quick and the Dead, Sam Raimi approaches the old west with a very new/contemporary style. With its brisk energy and competitive characters, the story often feels like a sports movie with lots of photography tricks. If you want a top western, this might not be your film, but if what you seek you is good old pistol-whippin' American fun, this might do the trick.Thanks to James Cameron, since T2, there has been nothing sexier than a woman with a gun. Sharon Stone actually brings a fairly macho 'Sarah Conner' quality to her character. She plays Ellen, a young cowgirl who rides into a mysterious town for a very special event, a gunslinging competition. The mayor of the town is a dangerous fella and one of the most feared gunslingers around. It is this man who Ellen is after. The question is, why? In order to fight him, she must beat everyone else in the competition. There will be blood, for sure.In order to make up for his superficial plot, Sam Raimi has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. One of his most recognizable through his career is going over the top in an amusing way, which he does here too, mostly at the climax. He doesn't make great movies, but he makes clever and entertaining ones, which this is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to say about this film is that the cast is an all-star one: Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Gary Sinise in a bit part. Each of the characters, even Hackman's villain Herod, is so likeable and charismatic that you can't help but feeling sad that a good portion of them will be killed. There is some spectacular cinematography and creatively conceived shots from director Sam Raimi and his team. A particularly memorable shot is the one of the sunlight shining through the bullet hole of the victim's head. In my opinion the two drawbacks of The Quick and the Dead are the thin plot and the relative scarcity of dialogue. With a cast like this it's a bit of a shame that it is underutilized. Still this film provides a solid hour and a half or so of entertainment, 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling Western in Spaghetti style in which a mysterious stranger female arrives in a township where takes place a quick-draw competition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peculiar Western with spectacular gun battle between Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman . The title "The Quick and the Dead" comes from the King James translation of the Bible, I Peter 4:5, which admonishes the believer from behaving like pagans, "who shall give account to Christ that is ready to judge the quick and the dead" . This violent Western is set on a township called Redemption , the star is a mysterious female revenger , ¨a woman without name¨ (Sharon Stone as Clint Eastwood-alike interloper) who has a secret agenda of her own . It deals about a gunfighter arriving a little town , it has the usual shops and buildings, as General merchandise, Livery stable, boarding house , Hardware , Barber shop, Saloon , Hotel and Church . The western town owned by a ruthless gunslinger (Gene Hackman) hosting an elimination tournament to find the fastest gun in the West , as Lady avenger comes to the aid of embattled citizens as well as searching vendetta . The excitement starts at the duel when the hands point straight up .This offbeat Western contains thrills , parody , black comedy , hilarious set-pieces , and breathtaking duels . This special Western picture concerns upon a deadly gun-battle pits two individualist characters and it results to be an enjoyable as well as hyperbolic homage to the style and vengeance fantasy of Sergio Leone Spaghettis ; as it takes parts from ¨Dollars trilogy¨ : ¨For a fistful of dollars¨, ¨For a fistful of dollars more¨ and ¨The good , the bad and the ugly¨, along with ¨Once upon a time in the West¨. But it has nothing to do with the Spaghetti maestro , the great Sergio Leone . There is also an impressive roaring climax with an amazing final showdown . All of the actors on the set in the gunfight scenes were instructed in the art of the quick draw by a stunt coordinator . The violent gun-play is heightened by a slick , often amazing use of F.X. , plenty of blood and gore . However , the film is pretty well but it doesn't work at all and packs endless close-ups, sluggish scenes , flaws , gaps and many scenes reveal nothing . So many good actors , such excellent actors as Kevin Conway , Keith David , Lance Henriksen , Pat Hingle ,Gary Sinise , Mark Boone Junior , Robert Blossom's last role in a theatrical feature and final film by Woody Strode who appears briefly as a coffin maker in the opening scene . And Russell Crowe's first American feature, he has a hot sex scene with Sharon , but director Sam Raimi decided that it wasn't a necessary part of the story , the scene was not included in the American release of the film, but international versions do include it. The lion's share of the acting meat deservedly goes to Gene Hackman as an unrepentantly nasty . And a very young Leonard DiCaprio is surprisingly effective as a rookie gunslinger .Exciting and fitted to action musical score by Alan Silvestri . Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Dante Spinotti .The motion picture was well produced by Sharon Stone . Sharon was given a lengthy list of directors that had been approved to direct this film, so that she could choose the directors she thought would work , Sharon sent back a list with a single name , Sam Raimi ; she said it was because she liked Evil Dead and Army of Darkness , among Raimi's other works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splatter Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Quick and the Dead" is a "splatter Western," directed by horror vet Sam Raimi (whose latest, as of this writing, is "Spider-Man," but who cut his teeth on the "Evil Dead" trilogy). It's set in the oh-so-ironically named lawless town of Redemption, a haven of grotesques that gives us an idea what the wild West would've looked like if had been painted, not by Frederic Remington, but by Heironymus Bosch. In a surfeit of Biblical nomenclature, the town's mayor/owner/capo is named Herod (Gene Hackman at his oiliest, complete with bad hair). Into town there rides a mysterious stranger, not Clint Eastwood this time but Sharon Stone. I'm not the world's biggest Stone fan, but this movie and "Total Recall" indicate that she has her uses in kick-butt action roles that make no demands on her limited thespianic skills. As gunslinger Ellen, she's doubly armed--with a six-shooter, and with an axe to grind; even her "inner child" packs a gun. She enters Herod's to-the-death fast-draw tournament, a no-win, no-exit, potentially no-survivors affair, with an agenda on her mind other than just winning the prize money. This is an overripe, over-wrought movie, but it mostly works. Raimi all but erases the slim wall between the horror and Western genres: Redemption is another Transylvanian village of simple peasants lorded over by by an evil baron, and the atmosphere--palpably oppressive and claustrophobic--could be cut with a knife. Leonardo di Caprio and veteran character actors Lance Henriksen and Roberts Blossom effectively round out the cast, and the action scenes--exaggerated, mythic, often darkly humorous--deliver. If you're more of a horror fan than a Western fan, this may be the Western for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate post-modern western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is hilarious. If you found it unintentionally funny, you probably haven't seen enough westerns. Spaghetti westerns were all about modern parallels. They were "post-modern". Raimi has gone one better and made a satirical pastiche of every western there ever was. Sharon Stone as the 90's feminist gunslinger was an hysterical joke that seemed to go over everyone's head. All of the performances in the film are highly referential and brilliantly pulled off, especially Gene Hackman. Leonardo DiCaprio sticks out as undisciplined. If the film has a fault it's that it's too smart. It's a testament to miss Stone's legendary I.Q. I guess, as she is one of the producers as well. Even if it's too "wierd" for some commercial-minded viewers, there's no denying that the film is beautifully shot and fun to watch. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I know the critics at the time panned it. But if that was the baseline for greatness, films like Wonderful Life and Citizen Kane would be lost to obscurity. Bottom line, this is a "high concept" film that is much more entertaining than you would guess. The timeline is fascinating. In the 1960s, after a half-century run, and massive exposure on the new medium called Television, the classic western started to disappear. But, as they say, nature abhors a vacuum; and at the same time the sun started to set on the traditional western, it started to rise on something called the "italian westerns" or re-imaginings of the genre from Europe. This is for example how Clint Eastwood went from forgotten TV actor (Rawhide) to #1 box office attraction. This new genre lasted barely 15 years or so and soon disappeared as well. Yet out of nowhere, 20 years later someone in Tinseltown gets the idea to re-imagine the ALREADY RE-IMAGINED western, this time starring a female. Sharon Stone was past the apex of her career by this point, making the project more of a challenge. The other talent was awesome. A pre-Oscar Russell Crowe, a pre-Titanic diCaprio, and all backstopped by Hackman, I mean, wow. The big question, did it actually work? Answer yes. It was uneven in parts and an argument could be made that Hackman overdid the "bad guy" role or, alternatively, the part was over-written. Stone was awesome, proving she had the chops to take on a bizarre role and make it hers. Actually gets better with each successive viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>... and they said westerns were dead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a typical western motif and mix it with a huge cast of recognizable faces and you have this genre throwback. Including Sharon Stone doing her take on 'the lady with no name'. With a dark past, she comes into a town gone straight to hell that's run by a nasty outlaw played by Hackman who usurps his power over the townsfolk that equally hate and fear him. It's here where these characters meet for the town's last man standing duel. Where the prize is to die for and of course many will before it's all over. I really gotta talk about the cast compliment. It's the meal ticket. Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman I've already mentioned, but also Russell Crowe and Leonard Dicaprio (both before stardom), Lance Henriksen, Pat Hingle, Gary Sinise, Keith David and a bunch of other bit players you'll probably recognize too. Stone's got her role down pat. Gene Hackman does justice to his mean embittered role almost relishing it. Russell Crowe shows a glimmer of what's to come from him although his character isn't that deep. Lance Henriksen as the slick gunfighter Ace Hanlon is a treat while Dicaprio is given a pretty straight laced role while not restricting doesn't allow him much place to go.I don't think its unfair to say the story is rather predictable, but it's still worth tuning in for. For no other reason - let's be honest - the gun battles. The showdowns. Yes characters and a story go along way, but you want to see people get kablamed too. On that angle this movie performs nicely with fine camera work and direction by Sam Raimi of all people. Using a large town clock with a big 'ol wooden pair of hands that creak when they move was a masterful touch.It's first and foremost action that wins out, but contains enough goings on in the thinking department to be satisfactory. With subplots ranging from hidden agendas, broken pasts and character morality. Some are there to win the trunk load of money, others are there cause they've got nothing to lose. Some are there to prove themselves. May it be to others or to themselves. Gritty, yet slick, satisfying to a classic western fan, 'The Quick and the Dead' is a modern slice of spaghetti bravado.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; Bad Of 'The Quick And The Dead'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the western "Wild Bill" that also came out around this time, this is a pretty wild, almost cartoon-like western. It has many pluses and minuses.GOOD - Great sound, interesting camera angles and very stylishly shot. The visuals and audio make it interesting alone. Add a simple but interesting story filled with wild cartoon-like characters and you have a fun, fast-moving film. Western purists will hate the movie because it's filled with over-the-top characters. The most interesting, I thought, was Gene Hackman as the villain and Russell Crowe as the good-guy "preacher" named "Cort." Sharon Stone's character, "Ellen," is very reminiscent of the one she played in "The Specialist," a movie which came out the previous year in which - as in this movie - revenge is her main motive.BAD - This is only bad if you are religiously-inclined. The "preacher" in here is questionable as such. No real preacher uses the Lord's name in vain which Crowe did twice here. His theology also is not Biblically, more like clueless Hollywood stereotypes. Also, there was a bit too much of the feminist slant in here. Then again, since Stone co-produced the film, it's not surprising. Actually, her character - especially when she begins to soften a bit - is interesting, too. OVERALL - Despite the usual bias, the movie is fun to watch and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Western is my favorite movie genre and I've seen hundreds of them. After a while it's difficult to find anything unique about them because it's usually the good guys versus the bad guys and when you get to the end justice is generally served. "The Quick and The Dead" combines elements of your typical Western themes, the evil town boss who rules with an iron will, gunslingers out to prove who's the fastest draw, and the no-name stranger who hits town seeking revenge for a past wrong. There's even a former outlaw who's turned to the Bible in an effort to seek redemption, adding some resonance to the name of the town where the story takes place.What I think is cool about this picture is the stylized approach director Sam Raimi brings to the project - not quite parody, but definitely not a straight on revenge Western. Many of the characters are brought to life with their own over the top characterizations, my favorite being the card sharp liar Ace Hanlon (Lance Henricksen). You know he's good as a quick draw artist, you just don't know how fast he really is until villain Herod (Gene Hackman) chews him up and spits him out. Other outrageous characters include Scars (Mark Boone Junior) and Dog Kelly (Tobin Bell) who add some zest to the picture.The twist to the story if there is one is that the main protagonist is a woman, Sharon Stone as the unnamed Lady (until she's named by preacher Cort in their showdown). The Lady's history is told in flashback throughout the picture to prepare the viewer for the eventual finale. So when you see Cort (Russell Crowe) gun down The Lady, it's an instinctive 'Oh no' moment that seems to undercut the basis for the story. Yet it's just another clever ruse thrown in by Raimi to divert our attention and set us up for the final showdown.What Western movie purists will object to are some of the cartoonish elements used to overemphasize a point, such as Ace Hanlon's back flip over his horse to shoot the ace card, or the bullet hole through Herod's head when Ellen gets her revenge. I have to admit I was put off by some of those antics upon my first viewing, but now take them in stride as the kind of excess that bring an element of fun to the movie. That, and the great assemblage of players who appear here, many of whom were yet to hit the big time. Instinctively, I get the impression that this was a blast to make for all the principals involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly do not understand the polarized reviews here; with many films I can see why people would be divided in their opinions, and I usually comment on that. However, this movie is pretty clear in it's intent and style and would appear to me to be a straight forward entertaining Western with the added modern touch of Sam Raimi's clever eye and talent. Some here have REALLY slammed him specifically as the director, and I haven't a clue as to why the hell they hate him so much.Like I almost ALWAYS say, if you are going to bother to write a review about a film, PLEASE choose Genres and movies that you LIKE in general so that you can give a fair and informative review to other people who ALSO LIKE the same type of films. I know I've said this before, but for example, I personally have absolutely NO interest in Torture Porn and it's like, BUT I won't come here and p*ss all over films like that just because I don't like them. It would be totally pointless for me to write a review in a Genre that I despise; how the hell would that be helpful to others who DO like those kinds of films and come here to read reviews to give them some idea as to whether they would like a movie or not...???Sorry, I guess I'll just never really understand the people who write reviews here. If you hate Raimi, then don't come here and $h!t all over his films. If you DO happen to like fun, stylish Action / Western films with excellent performances and in my lowly and wretched opinion, AWESOME direction that weaves the entire style of the film together beautifully and effectively, then YES, please by all means come here and write about THAT kind of film and simply tell us whether it is done well or not. Geez...Also, someone else entitled their review 'Splatter Western', which couldn't possibly be farther from the truth. If you want that kind of Western, just watch some of Sam Peckinpah's extremely violent and graphic films. I feel that Raimi was quite restrained considering that he is the author of 'THE EVIL DEAD'; and quite honestly I think that if he HAD gone that route, it would have been a completely different film and in my unworthy estimation, would have greatly diminished the awesome movie that we have here now.So, now that I have gotten that off my substantial and manly chest, please allow me to say that if you like your Westerns VERY old fashioned and not at all messed with or modernized or stylized in any way, then you should give this a pass. BUT... IF you do indeed enjoy your Westerns with a tasteful, stylish, and creative touch that are classy, extremely well put together with all the classic Western motifs firmly in place and executed with TOP quality actors, then you will DEFINITELY have a blast watching this movie. Just check out the comments of people who DO like the film; they REALLY love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raimi's western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi's first director for hire job is a hell of a lot of fun, even if the film doesn't always work. Raimi directs with boundless energy, with his trademark berserk cinematography, but the film never quite finds its footing. What starts off as a goofy homage or send up of westerns, constantly shifts tones, being broad and silly one minute, then taking its story and violence serious the next. The stunningly beautiful Sharon Stone rides into this small town with an aire of mystery and a vendetta against the corrupt king of the town played by Gene Hackman. Her character and performance work best when she rarely says a word and projects the ability to kick the crap out of any man and the performance and the film suffers when it makes the mistake of trying to add a human element into this thin archetypal character - watching her emote feels forced and phony, as the film seems designed for simple visceral thrills. Hackman seems to relish playing a horrible human and the notoriously difficult actor wisely never hams it up. Raimi has expressed dissatisfaction with the film and while it's not the most ambitious project, there's nothing to be ashamed of here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth watching for the performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman rides into town and finds herself caught-up in shooting duel competition, which fits her agenda for revenge.Simon Moore's basic story and director Sam Raimi's staging is a homage of sorts to the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, particularly the Dollars Trilogy. What makes Raimi's Quick and the Dead appealing is the star studded cast and an array of supporting actors including Lance Henriksen, Keith David, Gary Sinise and Pat Hingle... There's really too many to mention.Moore's revenge/redemption script has a moral core, some heartfelt moments and surprise deaths but essentially it is a series of showdowns. Raimi's offering is not as gritty looking as it could be but it has some nice setups, special effects, explosions and shootouts. Each of the actors have clearly put a lot of effort into handling their weapons, particularly notable is Russell Crowe. The great (now retired) Gene Hackman, a fresh Crowe, a young Leonardo DiCaprio and of course Sharon Stone (who is also one of the producers) to name a few in the lead roles are a joy to watch.With a fitting score from Alan Silvestri complimenting Raimi's trade mark and snappy camera work, holes in heads, rain storms and the burning sun it adds up to an entertaining enough Western. It's just too glossy and stylized to feel like the classic material it's trying to emulate. Nevertheless, it's still worth viewing for the performances alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> This was one of the only westerns that I thoroughly enjoyed. I'm no fan of this genre but I was given a chance to change my mind. I also became a HUGE fan of Russell Crowe after seeing this film. Hackman was the perfect villan and Stone is one of the few woman in Hollywood that could have pulled off the role. I was expecting the whole superwoman performance but what I found was a wonderful mix of a woman who was just trying to stay alive in a male-dominated world, with that good-old 'revenge' theme that works so well with almost every western ever. I recommend to anyone whose looking for a GOOD movie - this is the way to go (for guys and girls).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A surprising amount of great actors in this flick. LeonardoDiCaprio, Russel Crowe, Keith David, Sharon Stone but the mainman is ? without a doubt ? Gene Hackman.When the film was first released, all the critics complained that hewas doing the same thing as in Unforgiven. Well, a maindifference is with Unforgiven and Quick and the Dead is that whereUnforgiven strives for realism and social drama, Quick is waaayover the top.And the brilliance of Hackman's performance is that in this worldthat couldn't possibly be, with characters that have as much depthas a pizza, he makes it all real and shine.Add to that Sam Raimi's dazzling visuals, his best since Evil DeadII, and you got a GREAT flick, even if it does go on too long.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think there's no way that a movie with Sharon Stone playing cowgirl can be good? Yep, that was my first impression, too. But Raimi actually pulls it off. The acting (Hackman, Crowe, and even Dicrapio) is top notch and fits the story well. And there are plenty of other great actors with small parts. And it's really cool how you get to know just enough about each character to make them interesting before... well, they get dead. See this movie, if not for the cool characters, for the amazing camera shots that Raimi comes up with.8.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's like a comic book western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I enjoy western movies and although this doesn't have that traditional western vibe going for it, it's still pretty darn entertaining. This movie is like watching a comic book western movie come to life and although the plot is a bit absurd it's creative and has substance to it. Despite the it going in a narrow direction but it goes in a narrow direction with at least some substance. The plot is about a woman named Ellen aka Lady(Sharon Stone) who is a badass cowgirl that comes to a western town with a motive and ends up in a quick draw tournament with bunch of contestants. Anyone can challenge anyone in this tournament. The reward for winning the tournament is 120,000 dollars and the last man standing takes it all. What I liked about this movie besides it being a movie about a quick draw tournament in the west is how fun, intriguing and creative the action scenes are. A bit wacky at times but still pretty cool to watch, even the dialogue is a bit comic book like. Sharon Stone is charismatic and very attractive in this, especially with the cowgirl attire. Leo is pretty good as the Kid even if he can be a little annoying at times. Gene Hackman stands out as the villain without overdoing it and actually backs up what he says for the most part unless when he is unsure. So it isn't a shock why he owns the whole western town but this isn't the first western Gene has been in. Russell Crowe is in this and although he plays decent part in the story his character ain't nothing special and sort of comes off mundane but he was in good shape. Despite his mysterious past. Overall I enjoyed this movie, not one of the best western I seen but it's a pretty cool one.7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:Ambivalence describes my feelings for Quick and The dead. I both liked and didn't like the movie at times, it was a sort of constant back and forth with me. Ultimately though I gave it a 7 for good. It would be a low 7 Though, because there really were times I wanted to turn this off.The good things: Number one is, of coarse, the cinematography. I don't think anyone, even while they may really dislike the movie, could argue with the stunning beauty of the movie in general.I also admired the way the movie was able to build tension. It may have been predictable but that doesn't mean I wasn't on the edge of my seat by the end. That's kind of what a good movie should do and it did that. The movie always smoldered with tension. While I may have wanted to turn it off, I couldn't. I had to know how it ended.Lastly, is the acting. Contrary to many opinions on here, I liked Stone in this role. I thought not only was she good but excellent. She gave her character a toughness and lent her a spirited touch another actress may not have been able to do. I think that Stone is better playing a role like this then the femme fetale, she shows more range as the don't mess with me cowgirl. I throughly and completely enjoyed the performances by Stone and everyone in this movie.Now-the negatives. Or main negative. The lack of ANYTHING. Nothing much happens through the movie-nothing- except daily shootouts.Oh and of coarse, constant close ups of the REAL star of this movie and unsung hero-the clock. Now I know this is a western, I've seen westerns before, but most have more going on then this. I don't think the plot lacked depth but the way it was carried out sure did. Would it have hurt to include a little more dialog? A little more SOMETHING? I actually thought Stone was a bit underused. Such a great cast, great scenery, so little lack of anything except guns and clocks....I think Quick and the Dead was a good movie that could have been a classic. As it is however, it's a moderately interesting performance driven western with stunning visuals and a whale of an ending. Had it's pluses but wouldn't go down as one of my favorites. Thi is however, the best I've ever seen Stone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>few ways a Sam Raimi western could go wrong, and it only does in one big way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Quick and the Dead is director Sam Raimi having a good time in his first non-horror/action movie up to that time in his relatively young career (he was 34 or 35 when he directed this film). He looks at the Western and thinks, 'OK, let's throw in some Sergio Leone Spaghetti fun in here, from the opening ala Fistful of Dollars, and the main crux of the vengeance plot can have something to do with Once Upon a Time in the West- flashback included, of course.' While he thinks this, he's also still making the film his own in a lot of ways, notably in the gunfights. It's mostly a serious film though, not a dark comedy like Evil Dead or silly like Army of Darkness, even if there is a sense of subtle self-parody among some of the actors cast.Oh, a note about the cast: this is one of the strangest but, on the whole, most effective ensembles of the 1990's. You've got everyone here you'd want to see in a "guy" movie from the time, with a few surprises: Keith David, Lance Henrikson, Woody Strode (also from 'Once Upon a Time'), Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio (yes, back when he was, to the girls, 'Leo', here aka "The Kid"), Tobin Bell (yes, again, Jigsaw from Saw). But to top it off are two stars at the top of the bill (shared with Crowe and DiCaprio) that is a truly mixed bag. Both of the stars contribute, and take away, from the merits of the story, about a gunslinger competition that is more akin, to anything, of a Gladiatorial competition as it's to the death and run by a ruthless quasi-emperor (you can even see Crowe in a pre-Maximus role here as the Preacher).It's stars Gene Hackman and Sharon Stone that makes this compelling and curiously uninteresting at the same time. Hackman is one thing: he's taking on a role that is far more actually evil (if not quite as scary in his humane way in Unforgiven), as the head of the town who strikes fear into everyone so much that you can feel the chill in the room in blazing hot weather. Hackman's delivery of the dialog is better than any other conceivable actor in the role, and he also is there in one of the movie's best scenes- maybe the one truly genius one all-around- where we see the first time that someone is shot rather gruesomely, and there's a slight pause from the onlookers, and then the most forced-polite applause ever seen. Watching Hackman alone is perhaps reason enough, even if you're not a Sam Raimi fan, to see Quick and the Dead.Sharon Stone, on the other hand, is another story. For all of her glaring looks and her quiet would-be Clint Eastwood vocals, I just never bought her as a gunslinger-bad-ass like she is here. It's not that the part is poorly written (some of the lines of dialog could have been reworked, but such as a Western happens sometimes), but that she can't really carry the role well enough - not compared to everyone else around her, who fill in their roles (even DiCaprio) like it's nothing at all. It's forced work that soon becomes kind of boring, with the only slight saving grace being the final showdown gun battle between the hero and villain. The film might not have been truly great without her anyway, but she's really the one thing, for me, keeping it from being a true must-see rather than just a very fine curiosity.By a 'very fine curiosity' I mean that if you're hanging out on a Sunday night with your Dad (and you know the one, who loves Westerns so much he'll even forgive the crappy ones by John Wayne), possibly with a few brews, and Quick &amp; Dead comes on TV, you should watch it. It's that kind of movie, and a interesting, if flawed, genre departure for Raimi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now after a title like that why would I give it even an average rating? The plot was pretty horrible and everything but original. The dialog was pretty corny at times and even the set looked a bit stupid. Still the performances were interesting to watch.Anytime u get see Gene Hackman act like a real mother****** its fun to watch. Hes famous for that and is always enjoyable to watch. Seeing Dicaprio and Crowe in one of their earliest films was the most fun to watch. These are arguably the actors of the decade and seeing them perform at such a young age is very absorbing. Who I found annoying was Sharon Stone. The idea of her role was stupid, the way it was performed was ridiculous and its just not a role to be taken seriously.As I was watching the movie I wasn't quite sure what kind of movie this was or even attempting to be. At times it seemed like a drama or an action flick. At other times it seemed like a parody and sometimes it even looked like it was heading towards the direction of a romance. The bottom line is that this film is confused within itself. In film different either means great or downright horrible and this was lucky enough to not reach the state of being considered horrible.</fullReview>

But who -- even among the professionals here -- can give anything resembling a performance in this clumsy Kabuki Theater?The director seems to have aimed for an even more highly stylized spaghetti Western than the originals, but the target has been riddled with holes and the intent has finally lodged somewhere in the center mass of a first-person video game for ten-year-olds.A shame to do this to such a competent cast but they're all DOA.

		<fullReview>Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio and Gary Sinise star in Sam Raimi's 1995 western. This takes place in small town, Redemption and Stone (Basic Instinct) plays Ellen, a female gunslinger who is seeking revenge for her father's murder when she was a child. Hackman (Superman) plays Herod, the town's former outlaw turned mayor who was responsible. She enters in a gunfighting contest held by him and tries to face him. Crowe (Gladiator) plays Cort, a preacher who was once part of Herod's gang who helps Ellen, DiCaprio (Titanic) plays Kid, a young man who was raised by Herod who also befriends her and Sinise (Forrest Gump) plays Ellen's father who was a marshal. This is a good western with a good cast, Hackman is a great bad guy as usual and Alan Silvestri's score is also great. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling black comedy western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A passion project for the lead actress and producer Sharon Stone, The Quick and the Dead is something of an oddity. A film of the 90s, where everything was all about masculinity, explosions and cigar-chomping heroes, it nevertheless features a female gunslinger as its main character and is honestly speaking more of a parody of westerns than an actual real deal. Certainly having Sam Raimi as director helped the latter point come into being.Still, it is a very fun movie to watch. Imagine Army of Darkness, only in western setting. Every single character is massively over the top, as is all the violence, making it into a source of comedy. The plot is rather simplistic, featuring the main character riding into town revenge in mind just as a gun duel contest is about to begin, but it is just deep enough to carry from start to finish. And really, the main points of this film are the characters and the parodying of older westerns, so the plot is just complex enough.What really saddens me and keeps this movie from being any better, is that they didn't go far enough, in my opinion. For example, Stone's character is certainly given a proper buildup to be a strong character in her own right, but then she simply fades into the background near the end of the movie and it comes down to two males dueling. Likewise most of the characters are introduced very interestingly, but few of their initial story lines ever go anywhere. I won't say that this ruins the film, because it's still entertaining enough, but it could have been better if the film makers had only taken proper advantage of what they had.Still, the film is definitely worth a watch if you've liked Raimi's other films and/or if you like strong female action heroes. Not the best example of either of those, but definitely above average in its own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're not a fan of westerns, you might like this one. If you are a fan of westerns, you'll probably like this one. I felt compelled to write a review of a film like this as I was curious to see its' IMDb rating since I learned a lot of critics picked on it, and I always find it very entertaining whenever I watch it. I also just watched Django Unchained and that reminded me of this in some ways.Any time you get Gene Hackman, Leonardo DiCaprio, Sharon Stone, Russell Crowe, Gary Sinise, and several other lesser known but very good familiar faces in a cast, it is always going to be worth the watch as far as entertainment. That alone makes this a good film, but what makes it even better is they are all really giving their all and deliver good performances in this.This is before Crowe became as popular as he did and it's intriguing to see him in one of his first roles. Still, watching this when it came out, I remember thinking that this actor was good even though I never heard of him. Gene Hackman is awesome in this. He really carries the movie. I'm a huge Gene Hackman fan, and if you are too, you'll see he's all in on top of his game here.I thought Sharon Stone was good in this, and the whole plot I found satisfyingly original in that it centered around her character. Most westerns are the usual, but this put a female in the lead role and that was new and different in a good way. Some people criticize her acting/character from what I've read in some reviews, but it didn't bother me at all. I thought she was bad-a-- when she came back at the end.I was too busy having fun watching the shootouts. I found this whole "setup" incredibly fun, original, and entertaining. Most westerns are good guys versus bad guys or outlaws versus bad guys, but this is based on a tournament with all of these colorful characters with crazy names and identities. It's just really entertaining and fun to watch.The one thing about this movie is that it's one of those that is supposed to be so serious that it makes you laugh. You have to have a sense of humor for it to enjoy. It's a sick sense of humor thing. For example, Gene Hackman's character is crazy, but it's funny at the same time. There are some aspects (one in particular) that are unrealistic, but they're pretty funny in a similar way.I would mention I liked DiCaprio in this and thought it was one of his best roles. He really played the cocky kid to perfection and the whole thing with him and Hackman's character was good and showed how cruel Hackman was. It's crazy. This is just pure fun entertainment, and it's very underrated. I just saw Django Unchained and I like the Q &amp; D better as far as westerns go. It didn't have as much depth and substance of Django, but that's what makes it great. It is a bang, bang, shoot em up action western with over the top performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like odd, kinda weird movies, and this is an odd, kinda weird movie, but it was only decent, not exceptional. The characters were unusual and definitely ahistorical, but it wasn't supposed to be anything other than an offbeat fantasy western, so that was just fine; unfortunately the characters were not only eccentric, but also pretty much flat as a board in terms of character development. It was nearly impossible to really care about anybody in this movie, and it just highlighted the fact that Sharon Stone, while beautiful, is nothing special as an actress. The plot is also, on the whole, very predictable. I really, really do wish though that after DiCaprio went down in this movie it had been just a touch more real and he had never gotten up again--then I wouldn't still be suffering with the rest of his career both on and off the screen. Overall, you might want to watch it because it's different, done well enough, and not too long, but you're not really missing much either if you don't bother with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"How many ways can you draw a gun" or "Preparation for the 2006 World Cup"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the term "paper thin" has become rather cliché, it is perfect for describing the plot(s) of "The quick and the dead". Converging on villain John Herod (Gene Hackman) are 3 separate links ? lady vengeance Ellen "The lady" (Sharon Stone), dubious "son" dead set on coming out of the shadow of dominating father, i.e. "the Kid" (Leonardo DiCaprio) and former partner in crime now turn preacher Cort (Russell Crowe) ? all painfully one dimensional. Fortunately, that's the only bad news."Artistic" achievements aside (cinematography, for one), this movie is vastly entertaining, as well as competently acted. With the 2006 World Cup Football opening in Berlin next week, I can't help seeing the similarity in the format of the rounds of elimination contest, down to the last 4 main characters mentioned above. In a football game, however, anything can happen. But how many ways can you shoot (no pun intended) drawing a gun, and in the same movie? That is where TQATD did quite well, particularly when you know pretty well that these four will win.Consider how each of the four "semi-finalists" get into their positions. Herod's two contests are most elaborately filmed. First it's the loud mouthed, long haired fraud who claims to have put an ace in his deck of cards for every gunfighter he has killed. Herod has a lot of fun with him, demonstrating both left and right draw, and carries on merrily putting holes in various part of the opponent before finally killing him (which is not required). The next one, however, is a duel to death (he makes the rules as he goes along). This is a formidable opponent, a black professional gunfighter to whom killing is just business. Herod shoots him down by being just faster, and goes on to finish the job while chiding the townsfolk for having the gore (and money) to secretly hire a professional gunfighter against him.Ellen may be a skillful quick-draw but is obviously not terribly experienced in shooting down, let alone killing, people. Her first challenger is a goon she encountered earlier, en route to town. She is quite tentative, and helped a little by Cort's tip to listen for the small sound made by the clock before actually striking, the signal for the draw. Her second round is problematic for the script writers because it has to be a duel to death. Problem solved by making the next opponent a hateful child molester. The duel is actually out-of-schedule, with the two fired up contesters running madly towards each other at night in pouring rain, yelling and shooting madly ? an interesting variation.The Kid, out there to prove that he is better than his father, takes his fights with exaggerated, cocky youthful flamboyance. The first is a standard quick draw against the long-bearded "Swedish champion". The second round, against the strong, solid opponent "Scars" is shot at an interesting angle. After hearing the shots fired, we see The Kid going down on his knees at the far end, before the body of Scars drops with a heavy thud right in front of us. Only then do we get to see the cocky expression on The Kid's face.Cort's problem is actually quite similar to Ellen's ? he has turned anti-violence. Given a five-dollar used gun with ONE bullet by Herod, he is sent to face a challenger. What makes him change his mind in the last minute and fire that shot is never made quite clear, but it's just as well. Elaborated probe into the mental state of a killer-turned-preacher-turned-killer-again has no place in a movie like this one. By the time it gets to the second round, there is no need to convince the audience Cort means business. Facing an Indian gunfighter who claims that he cannot be killed by bullets (and he has an enviable collection of bullet wound scars all over his body to prove his point), Cort is provided with the same meager arsenal. He scores. But when the apparently dead chief rises again, not unlike our lovable hero Jason in the hockey mask, Cort has in his hand a gun that has no bullet. That gives rise to an interesting variation in ending these repetitive duels.I wouldn't go into the spoilers (although the movie was made over 10 years ago) of the two semi-finals, one between Cort and Ellen, and the other between father and son, nor the grand final between the two survivors. The only other point to make is that this obviously low-budget (consider the set) movie would have cost considerably more because it was made at the time when Crowe and DiCaprio were barely starting their respective journeys towards "Cinderrella Man" and "The aviator".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worth seeing for the 15 first minutes and the general idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As most Raimi's movies, this one has for main characteristics: it's fun, it's visually exciting, it has a very good start, and it's finally disappointing.There is a lot of visual invention in "Quick and the Dead", even considering previous works with the Evil Dead trilogy. Some shots are stunning.The first five minutes, I was very amused at the way the Western stereotypes were perversely played with, with an even more perverse casting. Sharon Stone trying to play Clint Eastwood is real fun.Sadly, as the movie goes on, it becomes pretty obvious that behind the glossy and clever parody, "QatD" is actually an attempt to produce a blockbuster, as it turns into a more pedestrian, average storytelling, and eventually comes to a rather uninteresting development. Collision between two visions: the filmmaker's one, who has a vision and wants to have fun by putting it on screen, and the producer's one, who wants the cash (because that's the way he has fun I guess...).Add to this that the editing is rather inconsistent in places (such a shame as some other parts shows brilliant editing), plus the sloppy post-sync for Crowe's voice, and finally what do you get? Another Raimi movie: partly brilliant, partly awkward, partly independant, partly commercial, and finally as a whole, none of these.What a shame. Raimi, with his visual invention and his crazy ideas, is IMO able to create a really great movie sometime. I'm waiting for it since the time I almost died of laughing when seeing "Evil Dead 2". But as time goes on, I'm starting to wonder if I'll live long enough to see one. "A simple plan" was a very nice premise, yet I'm sure it's NOT the best this guy could do. Or maybe I'm wrong, and he'll simply forever keep on making half-genious half-crap flicks like this one or "Spider-man"... Time will tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******** MINOR SPOILERS ********The similarities between this movie and another Sharon Stone film, "the Specialist, are a little irritating. A woman has haunting memories of the demise of her father, and avenging her father's death is her life's mission. To "get to" the bad guy who was responsible, she'll need help from perhaps the only person with the skills to contend with the bad guy, who himself has a connection with the bad guy, but is reluctant due to skeletons in his own closet.Anyway, as a western, The Quick and the Dead has some good points and bad points. We've come a long way from the spaghetti westerns of the 50s. There is a new sense of authenticity in today's depictions, showing another side to the veneer of the western town. Focus is no longer on the sweeping vistas and panoramic camera work glorifying the rugged west as a prize worth winning, to be won; they tend these days to zoom in on the internal social conflicts in a west that has been won, and external enemies (natives, Mexicans) have basically been vanquished, and the new enemies are from within, the corrupt white man himself.We get a good look at how "easy" life seems to have been back then, a time when becoming the local sherriff is simply a matter of being the last one standing whom the people might trust to be fair and level; no years in a law enforcement program at the local community college back then! Or, physically building your own saloon, and taking a fee off each gambling table - permit? What's a permit? Zoning by-laws? Never heard of them! Or, if you have a beef with a neighbour, you don't bother hiring an expensive lawyer, or hoping small claims court might see your side of things, you just squared off at high noon, and in a fair fight, be the quickest gun. No speeding tickets, no traffic on the way to work...On the other hand, the gun play in this film is a tad unrealistic - sorry, but six-irons back in those days just weren't that accurate, not by a long shot. In terms of the shoot-outs, the tension of knowing when to draw was poorly replaced by an agreed-upon draw time of exactly the stroke of 12 on the town clock. Yes, this highlighted the necessity of being the quickest to get a shot off, but...Tombstone was a much better western, in terms of the gun play and general gun culture of these times. And, the shoot-out tension was very high, with the focus on who can react to the other's move quicker; so many times in Tombstone the tension is so thick you could hardly see through it, the itchy trigger fingers, the eye-to-eye stare-downs...The issue of women in the old west...well, I suppose it's expected that feminism must spin such yarns, but I don't know how realistic it could have been for a woman to end up a feared gunslinger back then. I suppose if there were such a remarkable woman or two, some legend would have survived to this day. All in all, if you want to see Sharon Stone exact her revenge with the help of a reluctant hero, see The Specialist! If you want to enjoy another chapter in the book of Gene Hackman's career, go ahead and watch this, as he dominates the screen as the bad guy who runs the town.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sam raimi, the creator of evil dead, makes a fantastic modern western, where the duels and the action puts the story in second. it's like a video game placed in the old west, where we see our heroes fighting eachother in many rounds, and in each growing round the fighting gets more exciting, with the main heroes fighting for the prize. this is the kind of movie where we can place a bet on which of the fighter is gonna win the duel. this movie is also a tribute to the western spaghetti's movies. the music, the emotion, the desertic scenario, the different camera plans making the emotion more thrilling, this is all spaghetti western elements that exist in this movie, making this movie a modern spaghetti western. the players are great, specially sharon stone, doing a fantastic job as the leading role. i never thought she had it in it... gene hackman is a great villain as always. russell crowe does a nice supporting job, as also does lance henriksen and gary sinise. and finally we have a leonardo DiCaprio, in the role "the kid", doing a nice performance. the quick and the dead has a great cast, with many rising stars that became a certain as did leonardo dicaprio and russell crowe. it also has a great director, sam raimi, best known as a horror director makes here a great western debut. in short, this is a great western movie. not in the classic way, but in the modern spaghetti way. if u like westerns, watch it. if u don't like westerns but u like video game action, give it a chance. if u like old action, still go and give it a chance. if you are a john wayne fan, don't watch this movie, coz this is certainly not a john wayne movie, this is more a clint eastwood movie, with more action and fun, and... clint eastwood here is a woman, try that for a size and see if u like it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst Westerns ever made with some lousy action and acting. A bright spot in the film's favor is the performance of Russell Crowe in his pre L.A. Confidential role. He prevents the film from being a complete waste of time with his broodish performance as the mysterious stranger. Funny thing about this film is it seems like Gladiator transposed to the Wild West before there was a Gladiator(2000). The Quick &amp; the Dead(1995) wastes a intriguing idea by dumbing it down. Sharon Stone is not good in her role as the avenging gunfighter. In my opinion The Quick and the Dead(1995) has to be the worst film Sam Raimi ever has done. Thankfully he followed up this stinker of a film with the taut thriller A Simple Plan(1998). An attempt at replicating the style of the Italian Western fails because of the lack of any eccentiric treatment of the material. Gene Hackman goes over the top in a role that replays the antics of his character, Little Bill from Unforgiven(1992). Although I think that Unforgiven was a good film, its still much better than Quick and the Dead. Won't make anyone reminiscent of the Westerns of Leone, Ford, Hawks, Peckinpah, Eastwood, Corbucci, or Walsh.</fullReview>

It's a satire of the stylish fashion that was popular with spaghetti westerns. If you were looking for something innovative or serious, I suggest abandoning all hope of enjoying the movie. If you want a movie where everything from the graveyards to the camera angles and lighting are classic, and you can revel in its tradition with light spirit and reflection, then The Quick and the Dead is awesome!!! Sam Raimi must have been one hyper active kid back in the day. The craziness is evident in many of his films. This one being no exception.</fullReview>

A local draw contest kicks off and almost everyone in town participates.A condemned preacher(Pre Gladiator Russell Crowe) who doesn't condone violence but the powerful, mean spirited mayor (Gene Hackman) forces him too. Also a young, over confident shootist(Leonardo DiCaprio)enters and takes an interest in the lady. Stone of course is in the contest but is really out to kill the mayor for reasons I won't spoil. For the rest I suggest you see the film."Quick And The Dead" is an interesting,involving and enjoyable westernwith staple Sam Raimi touches.

		<shortDescription>a Gothic fairy-tale Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case no one already mentioned it, this film stands out for its mood and images which are not simply "stylized" cliches of the Western genre, but also Gothic at its very core. It's almost like a Brothers Grimm fairy-tale--small town out in the middle of nowhere; ruling over the people of the town is an evil man, whose house (a large, foreboding Gothic structure itself) sits at the end of the main street in town; individuals from the outside come into town to contest the old, dark tyrant. All the picture needs are the gargoyles...but look fast, men in black, Herod's men, are often perched up on buildings like the threatening statues that decorate old cathedrals. These elements of the classic fairy-tale mixed into the Western backdrop set this film aside from any Western ever made. This is not surprising from the man who made The Evil Dead and produced the (sadly short lived) television series American Gothic. Sam Raimi is a visual genius. The film's DP captured amazingly beautiful images, and the cast is superb. Definitely worth watching! Don't miss The Quick and the Dead!!!</fullReview>

The plot is a women (Sharon Stone) joins an elimination shoot out contest hosted by Herod (Hackman) to seek revenge. Russell Crowe was a former apprentice of Hackmans and is forced into the tournament. One of Russell Crowes earlier performances, hes one of my favorite actors today not that i can say the same for Leo who i think is terrible in this film as the kid. I was surprised to see Raimi directed this movie but he has become a good director since the evil dead series. Some great shots of the old west.I never found a boring part in this movie, its all action with all the showdowns. I'm not going to spoil it anymore the last showdown is excellent.

The man she seeks is a relentless gunman(Gene Hackman) that now owns a small town and sponsors a quick draw tournament. Leonardo DiCaprio, known as "Kid", wants to prove he is as bad as his father(Hackman). The gun fight scenes are very good, dusty and dramatic. Without them all we would have left is Miss Stone and that is no disappointment. She proves that she doesn't need a leg up. But your imagination does start working when you realize that she sleeps with her pants off and her boots on.Also in the cast are Russell Crowe, Keith David and Gary Sinise.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it came out and thoroughly enjoyed it then and still enjoy it now. (And contrary to what critics may say, the audience I saw it with were also totally into it.) This film is a hoot; it spoofs so cleverly every movie/ western cliche ever perpetrated by Hollywood. But director Raimi goes it one better by filming every shoot-out in endless variations.I must mention the cast! Sharon Stone, as usual, gives her usual decent performance, but it's Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe &amp; Leonardo DiCaprio who steal the film. First, I should mention I'm not a big Leo fan, but I've always thought this was the role that suited him the best. (Except for his shaky accent, he's perfect as the arrogant kid who just wants to get his father's approval.) Then there's Gene Hackman. Is there any actor who can literally slither into every scene and yet manage to make this monster a real human being? Who else could make you see the insecurities under this "invincible" bad guy? It is also interesting now, to look back at Russell Crowe. This was the first movie I saw him in and I remember thinking, "Who IS this guy? Where the Hell did he come from?" I can usually spot a fake American accent by a Brit or an Aussie, but he fooled me! It's hard to believe that the studio didn't want him for this role. He brings so much intensity to it; you can literally see the struggle not to fight played out on his face!Anyway, people don't take this film too seriously! It's only meant to be an homage to old movie/ spaghetti westerns. But it's one of the few post-modern/ clever reverential films that manages to work in it's own right. Sam Raimi must be some kind of secret genius!</fullReview>

Greatest of all is the title, however, which is (in my humble opinion) a bit too outstanding and eloquent a choice for the rather modest movie: I like the pun on the word "quick" and even the ambiguity of the word "dead" (you'll know what I mean when you watch it).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although directed by Sam Raimi, this film has the casual violence, carefully-composed shots, and glacial pacing of a Sergio Leone western. Gene Hackman is a smug, dapper gunman who virtually owns a small prairie town (one might call it "the Lee Van Cleef role"). Into town rides a lanky stranger bent on vengeance, but wait a minute...that don't look like Clint! My gawd...it's a woomin; in fact, it's Sharon Stone, looking terrific among the generally scruffy cast, most of whom seem to have religious objections to bathing. She can handle a gun, too; at one point she shoots a drooling rapist right in the penis at two-hundred paces. Now, that thar's what I call shootin'! In fact, most of these guys spend their remaining time on earth acting like loud-mouthed sociopaths, so we'll want them to be killed. They eventually are because Hackman decides to hold a fast-draw contest and it isn't long before he has sixteen quick-on-the trigger types signed up with the grand prize of $123,000 going to the winner (who figures to be Hackman, anyway...he's just doing it for kicks). We already know that the Final Four will turn out to be Sharon Stone, whose presence is explained as the film progresses, Hackman, Leonardo DiCaprio, playing Hackman's son ("The Kid"), a baby-faced, good-natured gunslinger who apparently isn't mean enough to earn his father's respect, and Russell Crowe ("Cort"), a reformed criminal who has renounced violence but has been forced into the contest to amuse Hackman. If you can't guess who's left standing at the end, you haven't seen enough westerns. Some might see "The Quick and the Dead" as a parody of spaghetti westerns, but how can one do a parody of a parody?</fullReview>

Sam Raimi ("The Evil Dead Series", "For Love of the Game," "A Simple Plan") pays his tribute to the legendary drama about a woman named Ellen (nicely played by Sharon Stone) who wants to make a slimeball named Herod (Gene Hackman) eat lead. Along the way, Ellen makes friends with several townsfolk such as a burn-our named Cort (Russel Crowe) and a quick-draw pretty boy named the Kid (Leo Dicaprio). "The Quick and the Dead", along with "Posse", stand out as the best western flicks made in the 90's. It's got the old-fashioned look of the Wild West added with violence courtesy of the previous decade. One thing's for sure, I liked this movie more than the dreadfully dull "Tombstone"!</fullReview>

The acting of the principal stars was excellent. Plausibility is not the films strongest point, but then it never was in spaghetti Westerns. The story clunks along occasionally, sometimes seeming to be no more than a string of set-piece gunfights. This weakness is partially redeemed by the fact that Sharon Stone is able to display the weaknesses of her character reasonably convincingly, while retaining the mystique of the Woman with No Name, and the climax is spectacular.

		<fullReview>Every review I read about this film dissed it and every review I read was written by men! This was a film about a woman protagonist and hero. Of course men don't like it! I just read another review on IMDb by a GUY who said the plot wasn't original. I've never seen or heard anything similar to a story about a little girl who was given a chance to save her Marshall father, who was about to be lynched by Hackman and his crew, by shooting the rope to free him and instead killed him because she didn't know how to handle a gun!! Could any person imagine the guilt a person would carry around if that happened to them? Leonardo DiCaprio had just finished filming Titanic and Russell Crowe was hardly new to feature films. One of my favorite westerns of his was 3:10 to Yuma, but that's another story.Basically, I'm sorry you guys hate it when testosterone isn't what wins the day in a good western, but real history tells the story of many women gunfighters who were as good or better than any man: Cattle Annie, Calamity Jane and many more.I admire Sharon Stone for a good story told with realism of the period. I happen to be a hobby historian about the old west and in real life, the good guys weren't always men and even when they were, they didn't always win, and those popular history paints as heroes weren't as good as people think they were, such as the Earp's and Doc Holiday.Yes, there are thousands of western movies with plots that are similar but The Quick and the Dead has a plot unlike any other I've ever seen and while I haven't seen all of them, I have seen most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK,,,,so it isn't "Stagecoach", High Noon, or Shane,,,,,but,,,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This mildly atmospheric western does have some redeeming features. For a start there is the stunningly beautiful Sharon Stone. A heartless, snarling villain that you want shot dead from the moment the movie begins. A host of OTT characters who are foolish enough to go up against the said villain in a gun fight. The flawed "hero" who is a preacher with a shameful past. The usual grimy faced close ups and spaghetti Western music. No,,,,,,,,,,it's not a classic (it does not pretend to be) but there are far worse movies out there. Yes the plot is stolen from OUATITW. Yes the premise of a fight to the death competition is a little far fetched. However, I loved it. Ms Stone is pure eye candy and if this film were on this evening I'd watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action, mystery, comedy, honorable gunmen and spiteful villains! This Sam Raimi western really packs a punch. It has something unheard in the genre - a gunslinging lady protagonist! (By the way, if you enjoyed that, check out True Grit by the Coen brothers.) It has a young, handsome Russell Crowe as a pacifist priest with a troubled past! It has an even younger Leonardo DiCaprio as a smug revolver-wielding kid with a million dollar smile! It has a cool Native American character! It has Gene Hackman at his most evil! It has a camera angle shooting through a hole blasted into a dude's head! It's got absolutely everything you ever wanted from an over-the-top action western. So enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the West!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Quick and the Dead is a good, if not a bit derivative western. It seems like this was one of the few westerns to come out in the 1990's due to the lack of popularity. This is a good shoot-em-up that has fun gun battles, great acting, impressive visual shots of the landscape, and smooth direction from Sam Raimi.Raimi's film is about a lone female rider who rides into the town of Redemption looking for some revenge. She takes part of a contest held by the sadistic man named Herod in order to make Herod pay for ruining her life.This film features some great acting. I believe it's been proved that Gene Hackman can do anything. This role reminds me of his famous role he had in Unforgiven. Sharon Stone is decent and pretty-looking. Russell Crowe is great as usual as the preacher and young Leo proves he has acting chops in his pre-Titanic days.Overall, this is a fine western even though it offers nothing new. The action is pretty good and there were even a few jokes that produced mild chuckles from me. This is a worthy addition to any Western collection out there. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sloppy direction and a terrible lead performance ruin a straightforward Western yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On paper, The Quick and the Dead sounds like just my kinda thing as I am a pretty big fan of both the Western genre and Raimi. He is a stylish director, using kinetic, frantic camera movements to both advance plot and visually please the audience. Unfortunately, here he completely drops the ball and is unable to string together the narrative of what is one of the most basic and re-told stories in American movies.Sharon Stone is the lone gunslinger who wanders into town with an apparent grudge against its' head gangster, Gene Hackman. Hackman chews the scenery like he is back on the set of Superman and is clearly having a blast, Stone on the other hand is so woefully miscast that it is just embarrassing. She never for a moment convinces us that she is anything more than a Hollywood princess playing dress up and when she has to square up to Hackman it is like watching a teenager throw a temper tantrum. Stone doesn't realise the director thinks he is making a comedy, which is something she probably should have cleared up with him as she, in her role as producer, hired him. Russell Crowe is underwhelming as the bad guy turned good and he can't hide that Ozzie accent. Leonardo DiCaprio rounds out the key players and he is fine as the young brash wannabe legend, showing that movie star charisma and handsome smile that would define him for a generation of teenage girls a few years later. He is also responsible for the films only real moment of humanity. Lance Henriksen, Woody Strode and Mark Boone Junior are among the supporting players who fail to make any kind of impact due to the lousy script and direction so flimsy the film seems to lunge from one scene to the next with no sense of purpose or vision.The plot revolves around a shooting competition in which the contestants 'draw' on each other upon the strike of the clock tower bell. This gives Raimi plenty of opportunity to showcase some unusual and potentially exciting visuals but he is unable to inject any tension into the proceedings. Leone can make us feel the tension even when we know the outcome, whereas when watching The Quick and the Dead I found myself with one eye on the clock like one of the characters in the movie.Lastly, I'll mention Alan Silvestri's score, which is routine and dull. That comment could review the whole film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual Western Satire Works As Action Film; Great Well-Crafted Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven signals a sort of closure to the idea of violence as a solution in the Old West, this straight-faced parody of the spaghetti western revels in the myth and sends it up with great verve; where most films move inexorably to the final shoot-out down the main street, this film features one "final" shoot-out after another; Gene Hackman is not just the bad guy--he plays evil to the hilt, just as Di Caprio sends up the Billy The Kid image with cocky bravado; the star, Sharon Stone, has a fine time being the gutsy woman in a town jammed with testosterone, shooting it out with the best of them. Raimi's film is an utter delight for those who appreciate a heavy injection of satire with the traditional action film; it's never dull, but impressive with action set pieces, impressive staging and brilliant color.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rare guilty pleasure from the 90s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of my "guilty pleasure" movies reside solely in the 80s, the decade in which I grew up. There are so many movies from that era that are simply enjoyable and entertain me to this day. In the 90s, movies started to get "serious" again, so it tends to get tagged as one of the best decades of film. I would debate that argument, as I don't think that "serious" always equates to "great". While the 90s boasts many quality films, I find several of the highly touted ones somewhat overrated. Plus, there are not nearly as many "entertaining" films in the 90s as there were in the 80s! But this film, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD (1995) is a rarity, a slip-in-the-crack, rip-roaring entertaining, re-watchable flick from the 90s! While this movie is totally cliché and a rip-off of just about any classic Western one can think of, it is a tale told with 100% flair and has a style and attitude that is sadly lacking in movies nowadays. Interestingly, the main actors playing their roles in a straight, serious manner that effectively counters the over-the-top stylistic atmosphere and tone of the movie, giving the film a so-bad-it's-good quality.Sharon Stone stars (looking absolutely stunning!) is the antihero of this Western. In a role reversal, this movie is an early example of using a female as the hero in a genre that was traditionally reserved only for male heroes. As previously stated, Stone plays it straight, in a similar solemn, somber manner that prior male actors essayed such roles. Stone's character, the mysterious Ellen, is a stranger that arrives in a small town run by the totally corrupt Herod (played deliciously by the great Gene Hackman). Although the cliché, over-the-top bad guy, I actually enjoyed Hackman's villainous Western character here more so than I did in Unforgiven. In particular, Hackman delivers 2 memorable speeches, the first speech delivered to the entire town after they hired a gunslinger to come to town to try to beat him in the tournament (this situation was a total mimic of Unforgiven where the vengeful prostitutes hired Richard Harris' character to come to town to kill the cowboys who slashed their friend's face), but Hackman's speech here is delivered with so much more flair, matching the stylistic approach of the film. The second speech is one he gives to the preacher-gunslinger character Cort late in the movie where he literally foams at the mouth at the idea of taking on the best gunslinger in the territory.The gunslinger-turned-preacher Cort is played by none other than Russell Crowe and another key character gunsmith-wannabe-gunslinger The Kid is played by Leonardo DiCaprio (before they both became Hollywood superstars!). Both actors, while playing 2nd fiddle to Stone and Hackman, who are the stars of this proceeding, still have some really good moments of their own. Crowe's strong, silent-type character was a prototype for future roles that he would excel at and DiCaprio seemed to be having fun playing a young, Billy-the-Kid type character in a flick, a welcome side trip from the more serious movies he was doing at the time.The movie also benefits from being supported by a group of veteran actors who stylishly play a collection of nefarious figures (Lance Henriksen as the braggart gunslinger Ace, Keith David as the snobby gunfighter Cantrell, Tobin Bell as the sleazy grifter Dog Kelly, and Kevin Conway as the scuzzy Dred). The great, reliable Pat Hingle is also fine as the good-natured, but timid barkeep Horace, who, like the rest of the good townsfolk, sadly turns the other cheek when it comes to the antics of Herrod and the sleazy denizens.Sam Raimi (Evil Dead and Spiderman series) directed this movie with a panache and flair that is very infectious. Lots of camera angles, zoom-in-and-out shots, close-ups, and tension-filled music really gives the movie a claustrophobic feel and make the characters seem larger-than-life. The movie itself will remind the viewer of classic Westerns such as Eastwood's High Plains Drifter, and Leone's spaghetti Westerns Once Upon a Time in the West, For a Few Dollars More, and A Fistful of Dollars. There is a lot of dialogue that is in the background, seeming to pay homage to Leone's Westerns where actors were dubbed and Stone's character is very reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's Man-With-No-Name in Leone's spaghetti Westerns.Overall, I actually enjoyed The Quick and the Dead more than the more well-received, acclaimed Tombstone, which came out a couple of years earlier. Tombstone took itself seriously and failed in certain parts. The Quick and the Dead knows what it is, an homage to classic Westerns, with a modern sensibility and self-deprecating sense of humor. I think I'll take The Quick and the Dead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply One Dimensional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sam Raimi brings his trademark comic book-influenced visual panache to this post-modern Western movie entitled The Quick And The Dead. Sharon Stone stars as Ellen, a mysterious female gunslinger who arrives in the frontier hamlet of Redemption for a contest pitting quick-draw artists against each other together with Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio.The story focuses on "The Lady",played by Stone, a gunfighter who rides into the 1878 Wild West town of Redemption, controlled by the ruthless John Herod.The Lady joins a deadly dueling competition in an attempt to exact revenge for her father's death.Writer Simon Moore wrote the screenplay.It is dedicated to veteran Western actor Woody Strode, who appears in a cameo as Redemption's coffin maker, his final performance.The event is the brainchild of Redemption's evil,corrupt mayor,Herod, a criminal who has taken over the town and charges a 50% tax on local businesses. The pot for Herod's deadly game has swollen, attracting numerous colorful gunfighters from around the territory. As each battle thins the ranks of players, the pasts of several participants are revealed. Ellen is seeking revenge on Herod for a heinous past injustice. The fast-talking braggart known as "The Kid" may in fact be Herod's son. The pacifist Reverend Cort, who refuses to participate in the bloodshed, is the fastest draw in the West and a former colleague of Herod's. After several spectacular slaying, Ellen and Herod stage a final showdown, but not before he has made her an unexpected proposal.The film was simply too one-dimensional.Although it is rarely dull, it is not noticeably compelling either.The derivative offshoot of a derivative genre, it inevitably runs out of energy well before any of its hotshots runs out of bullets as a Western movie.Despite of the talented cast it had,they simply looked bored as there was never a line of Gene Hackman dialogue that didn't sound as if he believed it.Also,the plot was preposterous that one may probably feel disinterested in it except to the actors/actresses involved in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ellen, an unknown female gunslinger rides into a small, dingy and depressing prairie town with a secret as to her reason for showing up. Shortly after her arrival, a local preacher, Cort, is thrown through the saloon doors while town folk are signing up for a gun competition. The pot is a huge sum of money and the only rule: that you follow the rules of the man that set up the contest, Herod. Herod is also the owner, leader, and "ruler" of the town. Seems he's arranged this little gun-show-off so that the preacher (who use to be an outlaw and rode with Herod) will have to fight again. Cort refuses to ever use a gun to kill again and Herod, acknowledging Cort as one of the best, is determined to alter this line of thinking ... even if it gets someone killed.This Film Is Pretty Much The Classic Standoff Scene In Westerns Being Played Over. The Movie Is Just A Small Little Piece Of The "Fun Movie" Legacy(I Can't Name How Many I Have Seen) &amp; This Is A Great Fun Movie. Out Of All The Films In This "Perfect Week" Thing This One Is The Prize Winner For The Calibur Of Actors. If You Like Westerns Or Even Fun Movies Then I Really Suggest You Buy This. I Personally Think That This Is One Of Sam Raimi's Best Movies &amp; That Says A lot Particularly When You Consider "Spiderman 2"(&amp; Yes I Am A Fan Of Comic Books) But Overall Yes This Is His Overall Best Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Date With Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The blonde stranger has an idea that a killer is in this nameless town where a gun contest is about to go on. A very handsome purse goes to the winner of the contest. On the way she encounters a crazy man in a broken down wagon and later she sees the guy come hauling a big wheel on a chain. It's her first challenge.Cort is a preacher, reformed, who knows the owner of the town. Whose name is Herod. Not knowing my Bible that well(figures), I see that Herod was a dictatorial ruler of a long line and is mentioned in the book of Matthew. John Herod fits the nomenclature very well. When the blonde stranger played by Sharon Stone sees John Herod, she knows him. By his boots and spurs.First off, the contest is rather gruesome. Each shoot-off is a showdown, and the loser is brought to his(or her) knees and declares the opponent winner. Cort is in the contest, and doesn't want to be. Because he is now a minister and renounces violence. But Cort does not seem to have a choice, except to die. So it's left up to Cort(Russell Crowe) to die or go to contest with his five dollar pistol.Among the low-life and desperate men in the contest is the Ace. What happens to this smooth savant is what may well be the finest act of the cold gunman Herod. Later a jack of diamonds is found in the group of contestants. Herod soon finds out why Cantrell is at the contest. It isn't really for the $123,000.The cocky youth played by Leonardo Di Caprio is also a marksman, and takes a liking to the blonde stranger. He tells her he likes her. What a guy.Throughout the movie is the famous flashbacks that are so much a part of modern movies. Stone recalls the death of a man dear to her. Her last visit to the graveyard proves to be a re-awakening for her.A movie tagged as "pulp fiction", The Quick and The Dead is a pretty grisly flick, but hey man, it's a western. There are some good pyrotechnics in the movie. All in all a well-made movie and directed by Sam Raimi.</fullReview>

I think he has the mind of a twelve year old and makes immature, tasteless, garbage movies. BUT, I did enjoy The Quick and the Dead. This is by no means a real western film but rather a modern twist on one with a full cast of well-known Hollywood actors. The story is simple, but Gene Hackman is such a bad Badguy that the film is enjoyable to watch simply to see what happens. It's no Sergio Leonne, but still a good try.Rating = C+- VideoGameHollywood.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is refreshing to see Sharon Stone in a character that does not lean towards a femme fatale, like in Basic Instincts or Les Diabolique. This movie is great to watch when you've viewed all of your Clint Eastwood westerns and want something modern and fun. Russel Crowe is very good as the guilt ridden outlaw turned preacher who has an affair with Sharon Stones character Ellen or The Lady. Gene Hackman is the perfect villain, with his satire and vague lunacy and charm. Leonardo Di Carprio gives a good upcoming performance and shows his future potential as the teenage gunslinger who wants Gene Hackman to recognize him as his son. The end of the movie is very fitting, and leaves you with satisfaction and hope for Ellen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paper thin, completely clichéd, but still much better than it should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TQATD shamelessly assembles every cliché of the 'Revenge' Spaghetti Western genre and milks them until their udders are chapped. But there is so much energy here, and so many good-to-great actors doing great work, that the movie turns out to be quite a lot of irresponsible fun.My only initial qualm was in the choice of Sharon Stone as the central protagonist for the story, but I need not have worried. The script and the dialog plays to her strengths as an actress - Stone's one-note combination of Barbie Doll good looks and muted, bitter anger fits the character perfectly, and she looks just right under the Stetson. I haven't cared for her in a lot of movies, but she's perfectly fine here.And geez, you've hardly ever seen such a great cast. Gene Hackman, Lance Henricksen, Keith David, Russell Crowe, Leonard Dicaprio, and seemingly dozens of great minor character actors, all give damned near perfect performances that suit the material. And Raimi uses almost all of his now-famous camera tricks and signature zooms to punch up the scenes and keep the visual interest high. Hackman, especially, lifts the movie up a couple of notches, as a villain so gleefully bad and charismatic that it's a pleasure to see him work.So: don't go to this movie looking for original writing, or depth, or anything more that the standard gunfight clichés. But you can expect to get a lot of enjoyment from the vigor and panache that informs all the clichés.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An eminently watchable Western, something that cannot be said of most films in this genre, especially anything post-1980 or thereabouts. Sharon Stone does Clint Eastwood in drag as a mysterious, vengeance-minded gunfighter come to join an annual shootout contest in a small town. The town is run in heavy-handed fashion by clownish tyrant Gene Hackman, whose character's name is Herod, no less. A then-unknown Russell Crowe (today lovingly known in the industry as Fathead) plays the Jesus character, a gunfighter-turned-minister who doesn't want to fight, and a quite-young Leo DiCaprio is Hackman's smart-assed kid. Little plot, but lots of colorful supporting players including Lance Henrickson, Keith David and Gary Sinise. Hackman was more menacing in UNFORGIVEN, but makes for a larger-than-life villain here. Stone is just OK. Great ending makes up for a boring middle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At times unintentionally funny, with underwritten, over=the=top characters, and all but one of its best scenes stolen from better westerns (most notably "Fistfull of Dollars" and "Once Upon a Time in the West"), "The Quick and the Dead" is still worthwhile, thanks most to colorful performances by Lance Henriksen and Gene Hackman, and a really fine performance by Russell Crowe. Sharon Stone holds her own with some genuinely superior talent, giving credence in her scenes of fear and doubt, while gently parodying Clint Eastwood in her more confident scenes. While Stone's identity is known by the town doctor (fine character turn by Robers Blossom), she is the "woman with no name" to the rest. The one original action scene in "TQATD" is a real corker, standing along side the opening of "Silverado" and some of James Coburn's bits of business in "The Magnificent Seven" for sheer exhilaration. While the story is not particularly strong or always well directed, Sam Raimi has made a worthwhile, watchable homage to Leone. I give "The Quick and the Dead" a strong "6" and recommend a letterbox copy to any serious collector of "spaghetti western" films.</fullReview>

I can only imagine the cost of this movie if it would have been filmed today (as only a couple of years later some major star power developed from this *now* all-star cast).Sharon Stone does a terrible job at convincing us that she is a gunfighter but the rest of the cast makes up for her ineptitude.

		<shortDescription>The good, the bad and the pretty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I've never been a fan of Westerns, I can name you a few titles in the genre that I really like. All these movies have something in common: They aren't exactly typical Westerns. I mean, it isn't about the poor settlers and cowboys being surrounded by the Indians, shooting those wild and ferocious primitives down like dogs and teaching them some good moral values (The typical John Wayne stuff if you don't exactly know what I mean). No, I like movies that have a story to tell and that don't have to follow that typical "Cowboys vs.Indians"-rule. Once Upon A Time in the West is my absolute favorite in the genre, followed by The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but I sure can appreciate movies like The Quick and the Dead as well.I have to admit that I was a bit sceptical about it at first. I mean, Sharon Stone has never been my favorite actress, but knowing that you'll see her play a gunfighter in a Western can certainly be called a challenge. So I decided to give it a try and I was pleasantly surprised by it. OK, it may never become a real classic, but it certainly kept my attention. The story focuses on 'The Lady' or Ellen as we will find out later. She's an unknown female gunslinger visiting a dusty town in the middle of the desert. She has a good, but secret reason for showing up, one day before a gunfighting competition will take place in the little town. They will fight for a huge amount of money. One by one the men will fight and die until only one survives and takes it all. But not everybody has come for the money, some seek revenge for a crime that has been done to them a long time ago...This movie is really full of stars, people who you don't exactly expect to see in this kind of movies. Leonardo DiCaprio, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe... They all have found a suiting part in this movie. Even though it isn't always very realistic and although not all performances are always as convincing (I expected more from DiCaprio, but really loved Gene Hackman as the ultimate bad guy), this movie certainly isn't as bad as I expected it to be. I reward it with a 7/10. It's one of the better Westerns I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Gene Hackman's Oscar winning performance as ?Little Bill Daggett' in Unforgiven, it seemed his love for the genre had been rekindled and he proved it by following it up with three more Westerns in as many years. After the drama of The Firm, he dusted off the ol' Cowboy hat for Geronimo, Wyatt Earp and Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead. This explosive movie boasts an impressive cast, with support from a pre-Academy Award winning Russell Crowe and a young Leonardo Di Caprio. John Herod (Gene Hackman) is mayor of a small remote town called Redemption. The residents are mostly drunkards, vagrants or killers and anyone that isn't, has to make way for those that are! The perks of Herod's position include 50 cents of every dollar that's earned in the town, plus he can charge whatever taxes he feels fit too. Every year a shooting contest is held in the town centre and competitors come from miles around to see who's the fastest gun in the West. First Prize is a large sum of cash and the chance to leave the place without any more holes than they came with! This year however, a new face has arrived for the contest. Ellen (Sharon Stone) is as mysterious as she is beautiful and seems to be hiding the true reasons behind her motivation to win the tournament and face-off with the evil mayor. Before long the contest is under way and only the quickest will be able to prevent their death?From lift off it's clearly obvious that we're watching a Sam Raimi flick, his energetic style of direction is as easy to recognise as a drunk in a convent? and is just as exciting! I believe that he is one of the most audacious genre directors working today, with a distinctive style that stands alone amongst such competitive and accomplished company. Here he pays blatant homage to the ?spaghetti' westerns of Sergio Leone, so cue plenty of close ups on squinting eyes, tense gunfights and a revenge fuelled plot to rival those that grace our memory so lovingly. Adding Raimi's flair for bizarre cinematography to the Western is a match made in heaven. He also throws in a welcome amount of gory demises, one guy getting a hole the size of a tennis ball blown out of his head! There's some great work from the stunt men too, as Cowboys are shot from rooftops and come crashing to the floor. The movie doesn't only look good; it also sounds terrific with Pietro Scalia and Alan Silvestri's feature music setting the mood perfectly.Obviously no one could complain about Gene Hackman virtually reprising his popular Unforgiven role and Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio are as dependable as ever. Sharon Stone clearly looks as if she feels far more relaxed in a fun role than her poorly approved attempts to become a serious actress. Playing a female alternative to Clint Eastwood is as intentionally alluring as it sounds and she does indeed look sexy in a cowboy hat! Aside from starring, Stone was also co-producer and rumour has it, she played DiCaprio's wages! But it's not only the star players that make this movie. Back up from genre character actors like Lance Henriksen and Keith David, also give that cult slant on the obvious blockbuster sheen.The structure of the movie is based upon the battles, which involve two contestants drawing their guns and shooting on the strike of the town clock. The person left alive is obviously the winner. The first battle is incredibly tense and the director does well to keep the fights as interesting as they are, because it could have grown very boring very rapidly if they were all just filmed in the same way. Unfortunately, the competition-based plot is a little too thin and although it's generally a tongue in cheek flick, the twist could be seen coming from a hundred miles away and you knew more or less what was going to happen and to whom from the start. The Quick and the Dead suffers terribly from predictability and to make matters worse, the DVD names the battle scenes with who's fighting each other in handy order on the leaflet inside the case. Although this doesn't sound like much of a problem, if you're looking at what's coming next and the scene is called Kid vs. Ace and then later another part is Kid vs. Herod then you know who survived the previous encounter. So why did I look, I hear you ask? Well unluckily for me I had to watch the film in two parts so I had to check the leaflet to get back to the place where I left it.The Quick and the Dead is yet another ?popcorn western' that offers fun and entertainment without taxing your brain cells. If you don't mind leaving your intelligence at the door, then there's plenty to recommend about the movie. From an incredibly sexy Sharon Stone to some superbly directed gunfights, you'll find that it manages never to out stay it's welcome; and I even enjoyed watching it the second time around for this write-up! Just like Tombstone before it and any typical Raimi offering, you'll get nothing more than fun, violence and decent performances. Although this certainly wasn't breaking new ground or ever going to be showered with awards, its entertaining fluff all the same. Imagine a Robert Rodriguez western set in the 1890s, only without the guitar cases or, err? Robert Rodriguez and you've pretty much got it pinned! Put it this way, there is worse ways to spend 103 minutes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE QUICK AND THE DEAD ***Many Westerns that are made nowadays are ridiculous affairs, they are poorly acted and pay little attention to plot or character development. American Outlaws being one. The Quick and the Dead is an exception to that rule and proves that if the movie is handled with care, there is still room for the Western. Sharon Stone glides into a town owned by the dictatorial Gene Hackman. He owns the town, he owns the people and he is the order. What we have in the early stages are glimpses of why Stone is in town and what she hopes to gain from being there. We know she can handle herself from the opening shots of her dealing with a degenerate cowboy. As a side point Stone is good in the movie because she looks to have the steely grit and determination that not many actresses could have pulled off. What ensues next is an intermediate section, whereby we learn that a great deal of sharp shooters are in town for a massive cash prize. It's Hackman's prize to give out, and he enters the tournament. His son named ?The Kid' enters to prove to his father that he is a man and has what it takes to be the best. Crowe is a preacher who's clouded past comes home to roost and is made to enter. And along with Stone, numerous others enter including a professional killer, a man named Ace and a Swedish champion. The game is simple, in tournament fashion 16 people will be whittled down to just one. Two gunfighters will draw when the clock hits the hour, and the one who defeats his opponent wins and progresses. In typical dictatorial style Hackman later changes the rules to a shoot out to the death rather than to just incapacitate their opponent. Involved is the plot with Stone, who is bent on revenge for reasons that you will find out. The movie is great with some really strong performances from Hackman, Crowe, DiCaprio and especially Stone who convinces us that she can fire fight. Directed intelligently, the movie is allowed to progress at an engrossing pace, and every now and again the film allows itself to go off on a tangent to pursue issues that stem from the wild west way of life. Stone becomes a martyr to women and especially a little girl who believes in her. The man called the 'Ace' is rumbled by Hackman who reveals to 'Ace' that he couldn't possibly have killed the people he says he's killed because Hackman had beaten him to it. Hackman's character is central to the film. He and Crowe's character, Cort, played outlaws a long time ago. They were the best; they still are. But Cort's path altered when Hackman went power crazy and enjoyed the killing too much. Becoming a preacher, this was Cort's way of redemption. But Hackman found him, and through his foot soldiers dragged Cort to the championship wanting to meet him in the final. Stone is wonderful, aggressive, witty and determined. But the film cleverly shows a vulnerable side, as she knows that some of these fighters are the genuine article. She has a plan, and she is there out of her own personal needs apart from anything else. And DiCaprio plays 'The Kid'. He is fast, really fast. The Kid's overconfidence comes from his father's neglect. Hackman at every opportunity refuses to believe that his son is anything like as good, and in one scene completely cuts his son down to size and tells him not to stare him down, as he is twice the man that his son is. Fate will bring them together, and between the Kid's eagerness to impress and his father's killing instinct there will be a downfall. Engrossing and captivating throughout, the movie is intelligent and surprising and has a great cast. Without giving too much away, the latter stages of the movie were a little trite, but in every other sense the movie was a success and really treated the viewer with some respect. This ensured that the movie was given its full attention by the viewer, so that they could appreciate its story line and thoroughly enjoy the movie convinced that it was money well spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was full of references to other films, notably the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood, and it seemed to lack it's own identity. An example is the multiple eye shots during the gun battles - reminiscent of 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. The plot was completely implausible - where did such a large sum of money come from in such a small town - and how many people are prepared to almost certainly die to win it. The only saving grace was watching the top ranked stars have a little fun with a western. There are too many better examples of westerns for this to get a recommendation to watch...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great western but better than most that came out in the last 10 years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a era where our movie westerns consist of American Outlaws and Bad Girls, is a film about more than just the violence of the old west. Not to say this movie doesn't have it's fair share of gunplay. However the gun fights are secondary to the characters in this movie. Filled to the brim with capable actors playing characters with depth and dimension the only place the film comes up short is in the main plot. This is a sort of re-working of High plains drifter with a returning hero (or in this case heroin) to face down the men who wronged her long ago. However this part of the film is the part that doesn't work as instead of coming guns blazing and taking back the town the plan here is a sort of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat win the competition to get to the main bad guy film. The other sub plots are more interesting. The kid trying to win his fathers approval, the gun fighter turned priest trying to stick by his convictions. The rest of the town trying to rid themselves of the tyrant who runs the town. This film was really bashed by critics cause of the female lead in a western and the lack of originality in the script. I don't feel that every movie has to be completely original. Many great films have followed the lead of earlier films. The female lead is a bit of a downer in this one I thought only cause it was obvious the character lacked confidence in herself.I own this film and enjoy it a lot. Hackman is great as the tyrant and the gun fights are good by today's standards. Crowe gives a great "before he was a superstar performance" that shows he had it back then as well. A good western in a time of few good westerns. I still like "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly" the best but am glad they still make a effort like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Raimi should stick to westerns!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi's first western, "The Quick &amp; The Dead", is stylish, clever and cool. Raimi should ditch movies like "Spider-Man" and stick to this!The story focuses on 'The Lady' (Sharon Stone), a gunfighter visiting the town of her father's killer, John Herod (Gene Hackman). At the time of her visit, a contest is being held. A contest of dueling. She joins, thinking it will help her get vengeance, and meets Cort (Russel Crowe) and Herod's son, 'The Kid' (Leonardo DiCaprio).The coolest character of this movie, by far, is Cort. Cort is a priest, but also a former rider for Herod. Cort is known as 'the quickest one in town' and pulls many cool stunts, including shooting about five people in under ten seconds near the climax.Crowe is reason alone to see this movie, 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I think the IMDB rating is way too low. This movie shines with the golden touch of Sam Raimi; in the almost comic-book visuals, an under-current of comedy, and in the clean, direct (and not overly complicated) story.Paring the Western back to one of its key elements - the mano y mano duel - he's created an exciting tale which doesn't get bogged down in period detail. The main characters are all larger-than-life (you could imagine a video-game spin-off), and it's easy to guess the ending right from the start - but it's such a fun ride getting there.We get to see a precociously-talented Leonardo Di Caprio (before Titanic turned a lot of people off) and a great performance by Russell Crowe (ditto with Gladiator). Hackman is pure genius. If anything, Sharon Stone is the weakest of the characters, but with the ensemble cast it doesn't cause any problem.I have yet to see a Sam Raimi film I haven't enjoyed, but if he's not to your taste you probably won't get so much out of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some over-used devices (a B-Horror vet director) cant entirely trample some good drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No comments that I have read give kudos to Leo for what really is a very memorably if not in-all demanding performance. Its an image that slides right into familiarity; a lean, blond, good looking kid mouthing off and drawing down on guys many times his age, think James Dean, River Phoenix etc. 'The Kid' is far removed however from Jack Dawson or Romeo.(he could almost be Stones son to look at the two of them!)'Spider-man', predictably, was the first Sam Raimi movie I caught. 'Evil Dead II' came second, a conscious decision, and I did not even realise until opening credits that this was to be No. 3. The gags, occasionally gross or simply used to excess get in the way of some undeniably effective drama. Raimi was still in his experimentation phase, as can be easily seen. With B horror classics saturating his career he obviously lost it a bit when the budget and calibre, and consequently expectation was raised. Hackman is as believable in this 'Unforgiven'-ish performance as in comedy roles, 'Get Shorty' his best that I know of.Much like Van Damme's 'The Quest' this cuts it back to exactly what the audience wants to see, fights, fights and, well...fights. There is no definable plot and the location hardly varies. Beneath that we have a schmorgasboard of western stereotypes. Its a club-project for vets, formerly unknowns and one-offees. Remember Bishop from 'Aliens' the droid that ends up half what he should be? Well he has a rather unpleasant piece of this action as well. The old Snow-Shoveler from Home Alone drops by too. As you will know, Rusty Cheerful with no Oscar to Crowe about, post-'Romper Stomper' and pre-'L.A. Confidential' (his breakout) contributes, as none other than a Preacher in this, well probably the only calibre of preacher Russel could ever be. Stone peaked with 'Fatal Attraction', this movie is one of the proverbial 'others'. She is hardly astounding, and basically the performance is a recap of hers in "The Professional". Her looks also dont sit with the character.It also feels like an experimentation with unpleasantness in the genre. It actually works better for that than Silverado and despite 'Unforgiven' having some mood to it, even it doesn't have as much impact (Best Picture?!?!) A few key moments will turn your gut with no excess of gore. Leo steals the show. He'll tear your heart out with just a few minutes of his screen time. There is something inherently dynamic between him and Hackman. Not much comes across from the relationship between Russel and Hackman, but something nevertheless. The draw-downs are thrilling, and the characters (and performances) are what keep us interested. One of those movies that doesn't blow you away but does prove memorable.Effective and entertaining? Very definitely. Unforgetable high art? now be fair!Watch it if you enjoyed 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It infuriates me to think of how damn underrated Sam Raimi's terrific "The Quick and the Dead" is. Of course 90's wasn't the greatest western decade considering the whole genre was practically dead at the time. There's still couple of marvelous exceptions. "The Quick and the Dead" is one of the finest and after a moment Geoff Murphy's stylish "The Last Outlaw" starring Mickey Rourke comes to mind too. I loved it, critics didn't. Both of these films are mostly a hidden parodies of old (spaghetti) westerns but when it works, it works. Some of the best camera-angles of "The Quick and the Dead" are just excellent. Script is witty, acting is enjoyable.Sharon Stone is incredibly good in her leading role of a "female Eastwood" Ellen. Leo DiCaprio offers pretty nice performance as Kid and other actors hardly disappoint either. It's obvious we wouldn't have this movie without Clint Eastwood's awarded masterpiece, spectacular "Unforgiven" - classic that resurrected westerns for a while. When I look at "The Quick and the Dead" I can't help of thinking that even legendary Gene Hackman is back in the role that's actually very similar to what he had in "Unforgiven". If you're a diehard-western fan who also understands something about parody I'm sure you'll find "The Quick and the Dead" an excellent movie. It basically circles around one good idea and I enjoyed every minute of it. Highly entertaining stuff.</fullReview>

It's a compelling and unusual film with a host of despicable characters, and no one is quite what they seem. Crowe's character has that brooding quality that he does so well and I was immediately interested in what happened to him (it was the first time I saw him in a movie, years before the famous ones). It has an element of parody that keeps you guessing - maybe it won't turn out the way you expect? Gene Hackman is excellent , Sharon Stone seems to fit the role of a soft-centred gunslinger better than you would expect and Leonardo DiCaprio is watchable too.

		<fullReview>TQ&amp;TD sits right at Sam Raimi's balance point, both in technique and tone - the quick cuts, fast zooms, and hoky effects of his Evil Dead/shock schlock era, which are juxtaposed with the quiet watchfulness of films such as A Simple Plan and For Love of the Game.Early 21st century viewers like myself will see a host of familiar faces - not only the top-billed Stone and Hackman, but Aliens stalwart Lance Henriksen (as a caricature here), a post-Grape, pre-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio, and the relatively unknown Russell Crowe.Crowe's only exposure to America had been to those who had searched out the limited release of the Oz cult favorite Romper Stomper. Executive Producer Stone fought hard for his inclusion as Cort, to no ill effect. The twist to this take on the Old West duel genre is that it's a woman seeking justice for old wrongs, and as a result the film is charged with emotional fragility. The hard man is gripped by uncertainty when challenged late in the game. The good guys vacillate between wrong and right when put on the spot.Stone is a fairly easy read - in turns vulnerable and glib almost to the point of impetuousness - but proves a squirmy center to the film. The hinge of her performance is provided by the town doctor, who tells her that she's afraid of living. Indeed, as hell-bent on killing Herod as she is, she could run away just as easily, and ultimately I wondered why not. While I found the last third of the film less than mesmorising (there are novel elements, such as the full explanation behind the revenge motive) you know more or less what to expect, and Raimi doesn't disappoint. What he doesn't do, beside turn the gender tables, is improve on the formula.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad movie. And not bad in a quirky way, bad in a bad way. The ones who raved this as being "fun" and "quirky" are only saying that because it was directed by the person responsible for quirky horror movies, Sam Raimi (Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness.) Frankly, this could of been a made-for-tv movie credited by a different filmmaker, and it wouldn't get the same cult status. Luckily, it's still being panned tremendously. There's a difference between "quirky" and "stupid," and "The Quick and the Dead" is stupid. A bunch of primates with pitch could write a better script. And the plot holes are huge. When herod was shot through the head, a.) A bullet shot from that distance would not make that big of impact, and b.) if anyone is shot anywhere, they don't stand up for a few seconds and collapse, they just *collapse*. The whole plot of the villain killing the "protagonist's" father is corrupted by a flashback, decreasing sympathy and credibility on the main character. And Leonardo DiCaprio's role was so cardboardedly acted that it was nonexistent. Bruce Campbell had a few scenes in this movie, but they were deleted. Campbell and the Raimi brothers are friends, and he starred in all of their movies before this one, no matter how they turned out. Does that tell you something? Avoid this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of Sam Raimi, the innovator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1995, Sam Raimi had become known as the director of a rather quirky and original horror film that, in spite of being shot full frame with terrible actors, displayed a talent for composition not seen in some time. However, he had also given himself a rather large black mark in the form of an attempt to be "cool" with a horror-comedy where violence has no visible consequences, and everyone speaks like a reject from a teen soap opera. Individuals singing Raimi's praises will have you believe such was the best thing Raimi had done at the time. Unfortunately, what it really was was Raimi demonstrating that he had run out of ideas that he could call his own, and was now getting his repertoire fed to him by the most disingenuous money-men of the industry. In spite of a heroic attempt a few years later to return to the style of creating characters with The Gift, The Quick And The Dead can be labelled the moment where Sam Raimi, the innovative new voice behind The Evil Dead or Darkman, was gone forever.While it is all but taken as read that a Sam Raimi film will be a hamfest with more clichés than a film-making class nowadays, nobody was quite prepared for how he displayed the fact in The Quick And The Dead. They say that when you put together a film in which the characters are the story, you best have good actors behind them. Unfortunately, with the exceptions of Russell Crowe, Lance Henriksen, and Gene Hackman, every actor in this film comes off as being utterly terrible. Even Lance, who by this time had the making of great characters out of terrible scripts down to an art, comes off as a complete non-entity here. Hence, I have no hesitation at all in placing a share of the blame upon writer Simon Moore. For all of his faults, Raimi at least knows how to salvage a character in the editing process. And when your cast includes the men who played Bishop or Lex Luthor, it is hard to blame the problem on the actors. Henriksen's performance, however, will get the more ignorant placing the blame on the cast.Sharon Stone makes that an easy mistake to make, unfortunately. From the second she enters the town set, she makes it abundantly clear that she has seen one too many Sergio Leone films and thought "I can do that". And to be fair, for those who have not seen The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly or Once Upon A Time In The West, Stone appears to be doing a good job. Compounding the problem, however, is that neither writer nor director seem to have any idea which scenes they should not be stealing from. The final moment when Harmonica's flashback is completed in Once Upon A Time In The West is such a gob-smacker in its original form that smart directors know not to try and ape because it was more than just a means to an end. It was literally the final word. Unfortunately, Raimi tries to one-up Leone's signature scene in a flashback where Hackman forces Stacy Linn Ramsower as the young Ellen to shoot her father dead. Not only is the tone of the scene entirely off, the total absence of any proper lead-up completely undercuts the drama of the sequence.Equally terrible is Leonardo DiCaprio as Fee, or The Kid as he is called during the film. DiCaprio has finally proved in such pieces as Blood Diamond or The Departed that he can act, but after The Quick And The Dead, anyone could be forgiven for thinking DiCaprio came straight from a high school drama. During the entire film, The Kid is only a whiny brat who starts to bawl when things do not entirely go his way. When he meets his end, the scene is so perfunctory, so devoid of weight, that while Hackman lends some much-needed credibility with his totally unmoved reactions, Stone destroys the whole thing with some incredible overacting. It is not entirely DiCaprio's or even Stone's fault, as the script gives them absolutely no development or buildup for this moment. DiCaprio is clearly in over his head playing a character that the writer and director apparently could not give two figs about. The sad thing is that with all the weight Stone was throwing around on the set, it would have done wonders if she had recognised this problem and addressed it.This partly leads me to believe others may be right when they say that The Quick And The Dead needed another hour of footage (or script) in order to accomplish its goals. With more time and development in the early stages, the constant parade of characters both minor and major could have had some impact. Unfortunately, with very few exceptions, and minor ones at that, the deaths in The Quick And The Dead are merely a parade of images. Perhaps The Quick And The Uninteresting would have been a more appropriate title. And when one remembers that this film was put together by the same man who gave us such a haunting, creepy atmosphere in The Evil Dead, or such a horrifyingly real tragic hero in Darkman, it makes The Quick And The Dead such a bitter pill to swallow. Not that we honestly could have expected much more. The Western as a genre has been thoroughly tapped out, and it would take a truly incredible film to give it new life. The kind of film that The Quick And The Dead is not.The Quick And The Dead is a four out of ten film. I have seen plenty of films that are worse, but in light of what its director used to be capable of, I have seen very few that are so incredibly frustrating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was atrocious. The only reason "The Quick and the Dead" gets a "3" instead of a "1" is because of its A-list cast. The script and cinematography were D-list at best.Had I not known that the actors were taking their lines seriously, or that it was filmed as a serious western, I would have mistaken it for a comedy. Or worse, a spoof. The camera angles were uninspiring and overused, the music was bawdy and clichéd, and the filming tricks belonged in a western-themed commercial for picante salsa. Leonardo DiCaprio alone had me bursting out laughing at the canned dialogue. When Sharon Stone asks him why he's fighting, the long pause and lack of music (both intended for tension and effect) had me shout "RESPECT!" at the television. DiCaprio then says, "I'm doing it for respect." I might have been a bit sad at the scenes where characters cried, but I was too busy rolling my eyes at Russell Crowe's frequent drop into his Australian accent. Hackman and Stone seemed to stroll through the film as if they were going through rehearsals. Or it's possible they were trying to save their artistic energy for "Casino" (Stone) and "Crimson Tide" (Hackman), both of which held my attention far longer than "Quick". I smiled at seeing Lance Henriksen, Keith David, and Gary Sinise on my television, but then frowned at the horribly small and nearly unimportant roles each were thrown.The flashbacks to the death of the Marshall reminded me of Harmonica's flashbacks to his brother's death in "Once Upon a Time in the West"; except that the Lady's memories were neither haunting nor mysterious. Rather, they were more an intrusion into an already dry storyline. Removing them might not have improved the film, but it would have at least reduced the amount of time needed to finish watching it.None of the final 20 minutes were a surprise. Though I won't give the specifics of the ending away, it wouldn't be a stretch to call it a "happily ever after". So much for a gripping and taut film. I'd call this movie a "popcorn flick", but it's not quirky enough to enjoy as an oddity or cult classic. It's just too boring. Utterly, and completely boring.I'll end my criticism here, as continuing would just lead to pointless griping. But before I go, I will say this: "The Quick and the Dead" showed that a title can describe exactly how a film can pass through my conscious. The time spent thinking of this movie was "Quick", and my interest in it is now "Dead".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly cast, fantastic direction and a simple but effective storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic western which I thoroughly enjoyed, partly thanks to a wonderful cast and great direction by Sam Raimi, partly thanks to the film's simple charm and it's overly dramatic but entertaining effects.The film is set in a town called Redemption, run by villain John Herod (Gene Hackman), where guns rule, and opinions and freedom are stifled. That is until Ellen "The Lady" (Sharon Stone) rides into town, heart set on revenge on Herod- the reason kept secret from us until the climax - and enters into the annual Quickdraw Contest. In a place where women are women and men are men, this surprises our characters, not least Herod's illegitimate son, Fee "The Kid" (Leo Dicaprio). In his ill-fated attempts to woo Ellen (along with every other woman in town), we learn that he also has a deep-seated reason to enter the contest. During the opening of the contest, Cort (Russel Crowe) is brought in, an outlaw turned preacher, who vows never to kill, but is entered into the contest by Herod in an attempt to convert him back to his old ways.The twists and turns of this film keep it interesting and superb performances- particularly from Dicaprio, making it definitely one of his best films, and Crowe, a little well-known star when this film was made. Stone plays a convincing heroine with the power to change things and the direction of the film is good- if slightly over-the-top with some special effects- and keeps you in your seat until the credits roll. A beautifully directed western, and fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I vaguely remember this movie when it came out and I wasn't very impressed, but the years change things. When I watched this the other night on DVD I enjoyed it and had fun watching how young Leonardo DiCaprio was, along with all the other big stars who were probably not that big back then. The story is unique and it's played well, with the flashbacks which remind me of the current TV show "Lost." In fact, this movie has that kind of surreal feel, even though it's kind of corny, and it doesn't take itself "too" seriously. The acting is great, the scenery is cool, there's not a lot of bloodshed. I am not sure why the movie industry rated this thing with an "R" rating. I think it would be OK for teenagers under 17 to watch it, even without supervision ;). I gave it an 8 this time around....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great concept western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you decide you will like to watch this movie or not, you have to understand what a concept western is. There was the Wild West of reality, there was the myth, and then there are certain ideologies and concepts with the Western Mythology.Rather than worry about creating a real situation this movie focuses on the central concept, the gun fight. Each gun fight says something about different aspects of Western mythology.There is the person who creates a legend of himself and can't live up to it. Russel Crowe plays the reformed criminal, now a priest. Sharon Stone is the person seeking vengeance. Then there is Leonardo Di Caprio, looking like an innocent boy as usual. He is the person who tries his best to live up to the ideal of the west.It is exciting as an action movie, but also says other things if you want to look at them.For myself, I have always loved westerns that are high on concept and The Quick on the Dead is mostly concept. With Sharon Stone picking many of the actors and the director for this movie we see her understanding and appreciation of great actors. Especially Russel Crowe who was a complete unknown at the time in America. I hope she becomes a Hollywood producer one day soon.Free your mind and you will enjoy this. One of the few movies that happily combine action and metaphor while ignoring the story. It tends to annoy those who love action or art because neither side can accept both.However it still remains a fun movie, so watch it as a B-movie choose and you will feel OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aaaah, this is great fun. At first I didn't know what to expect (not a western fan in any shape or form), then saw the names and thought - let's give this a try.Every detail has obviously been thought through three times, and due attention has been given to pretty much everything in this film, from just about every aspect of production design to smooth, cool, sometimes flashy direction.The sets are as live as you might want them to be, the costumes imaginative and good looking, OTT thought they are. The skillful use of late afternoon or early morning light while shooting (bordering on kitch, but hey, it looks so much nicer) combined with post production, give this film a lovely warm orangey glow throughout, which remains the first thing that comes to mind when I think of it.Because the dialogue is written so competently, with precisely the right balance of cartoon cheese and semi-seriousness, not much effort is needed in the acting department, so the whole ensemble does really well, including Crowe, but most notably Hackman, as the genuinely terrifying wild west small-town bully-baddie (I have a sneaky feeling that he enjoyed himself tremendously during filming). DiCaprio, too, is very good - his death scene made to look genuinely quite moving, to teary teenage girls as well as older folks. The narrative is derivative (obviously), but logical, sensible and clear, and works perfectly within the confines of the chosen genre.Again, it's all in the details, good measure and the beauty of the whole packaging. Delightful entertainment, excellent fun. Don't miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't get, or care about, the criticism this movie receives. I found it to be infinitely cool. I love the characters. The direction is confident and unique. The cinematography (by the always superb Dante Spinotti) and art direction are wonderful. Sam Raimi caught a lot of heat for this one. I guess it was too stylish for the bland, vanilla, popcorn crowd. And, in ways, it gave him a sense of timidness in his following few pictures. But, with Spiderman, people finally wised up to the fact that this guy is fantastic.I highly recommend this film, and other Raimi classics, such as: Darkman and Army of Darkness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not uncommon to see a western flick that's boring... it might even be more common among the newer ones(I wouldn't know, haven't seen most of them... thankfully). But when you see a western flick with Sam Raimi's name on the director credit... I mean, this man brought us A Simple Plan and Darkman! Sure, he did Spiderman as well, but I can look past that, since most of the other films he's done are great(from what I hear, at least... have only seen the three aforementioned and, of course, this one). But this film is really a dud. I tried to watch the first ten-fifteen minutes with an open mind, I really did. The film just didn't grab my attention at all, despite the fact that I was serving it on a silver platter. The plot is boring and horribly poorly paced. I almost fell asleep during the finale... only to be awakened by a couple of explosions... apparently thrown in there for fun(much like they were in Spiderman). Maybe Raimi regressed into childhood, and just settled for blowing stuff up for the entertainment of those who are easily entertained; I don't know. The acting isn't particularly good. The characters are all poorly written western flick clichés. The action is derivative of spaghetti westerns, but, unlike aforementioned genre, not even the least entertaining. The humor is lame. The film is clichéd, and seems to have trouble determining if it wants to salute westerns or make fun of them. Only one positive comment comes to mind; some of it is actually nicely filmed. The cinematography doesn't suck exactly as much as the rest of the film does. It's somewhat close, though, as those interesting pans and angles are few and far between. I really didn't enjoy this film, and I'm not going to claim that I wasted time paying attention to the whole thing. I watched with(at most) half an eye open ten-fifteen minutes scattered somewhat indiscriminately over the whole film. I recommend it only to western flick junkies and huge fans of Raimi. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the past few decades, there have only been a few good Westerns. "Young Guns I &amp; II" were the best, hands down, but this one did a good job of trying to reinstall the genre as a staple in American cinema. It failed. But it was a good shot.Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Gene Hackman are at the top of their game. I personally believe this is Crowe's best film. Sharon Stone does some classic overacting, staying with the whole "p*ssed off" vibe throughout the entire movie. Gary Sinise has a cameo as the barely-reckognizable father of Stone (in flashbacks).Good story, pretty good acting, classic avenging-the-death-of-a-parent-against-the-evil-town-leader plot.

		<shortDescription>A Fast Draw Superbowl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although The Quick and the Dead is primarily remembered among film fans starring Sharon Stone as a revenge seeking frontier woman, for me the film stands out because of Gene Hackman. As John Herod, outlaw kingpin and ruler of the outlaw town of Redemption, Hackman is one of the most evil people ever created in any film genre.Sharon Stone has excellent reasons for wanting this man dead, although the truth is the key to the whole film and I won't say. Suffice to say, she's learned the gunman's trade and more than holds her own with any of the male competitors.In westerns about outlaw towns the usual is for the outlaws to respect each other as they are all men on the dodge. That's not what you get in The Quick and the Dead. Hackman for his sadistic amusement decides to conduct a fast draw contest, a kind of fast draw Superbowl. He's even kidnapped a former member of his band, Russell Crowe, who has renounced violence and become a preacher. And his unacknowledged offspring Leonardo DiCaprio is in the contest as well.There is of course a big similarity to the Kirk Douglas/Johnny Cash western, A Gunfight. But in that it was just the two of them staging a contest for both pride and money. That's expanded on quite a bit in The Quick and the Dead.I thought Gene Hackman was brilliant in the Clint Eastwood classic, The Unforgiven. Brilliant and evil also. But Hackman's character of a town marshal in The Unforgiven is a boy scout next to the outlaw kingpin of The Quick and the Dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pistol Packin' Sharon?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of "The Quick and the Dead" is a gunfighter's tournament where 16 gunfighters face off against each other in individual showdowns until only one is left. How could this happen you ask?Well it seems that Gene Hackman has taken over the town and can do pretty much as he pleases. He fancies himself as the fastest gun this side of somewhere and sets out to prove it. The Hackman character is very much like the one he played in "Unforgiven" (1992) but not very convincing as a "fast as blazes" gunfighter being well into his 60s when this film was made. Still, he was the best thing about this film.The most ludicrous piece of casting is Sharon Stone as a pistol packin' gunfighter out to avenge the murder of her father (Gary Sinese) by Hackman years earlier. So, you guessed it, she enters the contest. You don't have to be too sharp to figure out who will be in the final showdown. Even more unbelievable is that being in a town full of low lifes and looking the way that she does, no one so much as makes a pass at Ms. Stone. Maybe they saw "If These Walls Could Talk II".Also in the cast in early roles, are Russell Crowe as a preacher with a past and Leonardo Di Caprio as fuzzy cheeked gunfighter named "Kid" (how original) who harbors his own secret. Crowe's mind seems to be elsewhere throughout the film and DiCaprio is laughable as a gunfighter.Sharon Stone executive produced this film. What was she thinking? Maybe she should have checked her "Basic Instincts" before attempting this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if viewed as a cartoonish interpretation of Westerns this picture splats to the lowest level of the genre. Preposterous plot and sluggish development of same (you can't make chicken salad out of chicken feed...), the direction seems mesmerized by Stone's undeniable good looks and Hackman's villainous mugging. Absent a convincing story line the plot resorts to endless shoot 'em-up sequences and a blown-to-smithereens ending that masquerades as a an inferno finale --notwhithstanding the fact that the explosion sequences alternate with shots that show little damage to the town's buildings and no casualties among the predictable melange of denizens. The sound track is absurd, climaxing at the end with Stone's steps along the dirt street resonating as if she were stomping on a granite floor, and the music, to put it kindly, mimics Ennio Morricone's early (and better) efforts. In sum: an eminently avoidable fiasco unless viewed as a tongue-in-cheek compendium of some of the worst clichés of non- spaghetti Westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doesn't cut it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The post-modern Western, as a kind of parasitic sub-genre of the Western, began as self-conscious parody of the Western. The precursors were films like The Marx Brothers Go West and Bob Hope's Paleface - films set in the 19th century but including references to events of the 194os. But the post-modern really began to come out on its own as afterthought to the Spaghetti Western, the formula for which included larger-than-life caricatures of the traditional Hollywood Western. The best known of these early Post-Mod Westerns were the Trinity films, but there was actually a more successful American variant from about the same time (early 1970s), Support Your Local Sheriff.Notice that all the films mentioned so far have been comedies. For some reason, the makers of Post-Mod Westerns soon began taking themselves seriously, as heavily ironic commentary on the politics of the day - think El Topo, Dirty Little Billy, Doc. Most of these were failures - El Topo once considered a cult film, is virtually unwatchable now.But the serious Post-Mods did leave a legacy. Since the mid-1980s, a number of films have deployed the same heavy irony, although politics is no longer a major concern. Among the first noticeable of these revised Post-Mods was the 'Brat Pack'version of the Billy the Kid story, Young Guns. This film sold very well, but largely due to the all-star cast involved; most critics did recognize a deeper problem with it, that it was difficult to determine what of it was serious, what comedic, and what just pure self-indulgence, as in the infamous peyote sequence (which, already bad, nonetheless left such an impression it got redone in Tony Scott's abysmal Domino).This problem now really defines the Post-Mod Western. Watching these films, are we indulging in a fantasy, the plot and themes to be taken seriously despite the irony? Or is the irony simply a cheap and easy form of over-intellectualized comedy? The lack of any clear answer is the real lasting impression any of these films leave with us.Sam Raimi is one of the more interesting of our truly independent directors, all the more so because he has remained largely with the B-movie genres and knows them all pretty well. So, especially given such a remarkable cast to work with, has he given us a Post Mod Western that avoids the unsatisfying lack of resolution we find in most of these? Although there are interesting moments in The Quick and the Dead, I'm afraid the answer is a solid negative.It is notable - even annoyingly so - that the best moments of this film are precisely those that easily fit the traditional Western, or even Spaghetti Western, grooves, without pandering to anything Post-Mod - the real pain Stone's character evidences, the beautiful exterior photography of a desolated cemetery, the dramatic confrontations between Hackman and Crowe and between Hackman and Stone.Why didn't Raime realize what he had with these actors? But he doesn't; he is so intent on turning in a stylistic tour-de-force that the great cast here is largely wasted. Ultimately he asks less of them than they have to offer. The drama is drowned out by visual excess, and the absurdities of the plot are pushed to the envelope rather than carefully restrained.It's an okay action film, worth a view. But this has proved not to be the next big thing people touted it as 13 years ago, and for a very real reason - it is pure Post-Mod Western, and frankly, I think we've all grown tired of it.I don't know that the Western genre can ever get resurrected; but it's now clear that it never passed the torch to the Post-Mod western genre as its 'logical inheritor.' Frankly I think we will see Western themes continue to appear in gangster films - The Road to Perdition, Four Brothers, American Gangsters - these have been the real cowboy movies of the past decade or so.The Quick and the Dead doesn't cut it, sorry.(Thanks to johnno for salvaging these mutterings from the wastebasket at work. And I agree about Brothers in Arms, same problem.)</fullReview>

There is the young and wild Leonardo DiCaprio who has been reared by Hackman, but knows Hackman's reign of terror must be stopped. Former gunfighter and current preacher Russell Crowe is also pushed to fight in the contest. There is the highly dark Lance Henriksen and hired gun Keith David who are also present. But it might be mysterious drifter Sharon Stone who can defeat Hackman and get her revenge. A really silly story works due to top-notch performances from the key players.

		<fullReview>"The Quick And The Dead" is actually better than anyone thought. A tribute to Westerns (Especially the Eastwood/Leone collaborations), about a young woman known as "The Lady" (A better than expected Sharon Stone)that arrives at a town where the people are bullied and ruled over by Herod (A slimy Gene Hackman). She arrives at the beginning of an extreme gun competition with VERY high stakes. There can be only one winner, and a lot of losers. 2 of the competitors include Cort (Russell Crowe), who is held prisoner by Herod, and The Kid (Young Leonardo DiCaprio)who enjoys his position in the contest. Sam Raimi, breaking out of the shadow of the "Evil Dead" series, does a good job with the film (Using a lot of his trademark shots). As in his "Spiderman" films, Raimi centralizes on the feelings of guilt in his characters (The Lady was forced to kill her father, played by Gary Sinise, when she was a child, Cort's guilt about the sins of his past).Worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quick, Dead and Finished-Quick &amp; the Dead **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sharon Stone rides into town as a really tough lady, cigar-smoking and eager to prove that she is adept with the gun.The town is run by villain Gene Hackman. He controls practically everything, and he is currently have a contest to see who can shoot each other in the fastest way possible.All sorts of characters enter the contest, Leonardo De Caprio, one of them. He claims that Hackman is his father. Russell Crowe plays a former outlaw, who got religion and is now forced by Hackman and his group to participate in the shooting.To me, the picture is a typical shoot them up western. The bodies begin to pile up as we finally learn that Stone is there for vengeance.Stone is adept at the part, but I can imagine Jane Russell in her youth doing this role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Woody Strode makes no epic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think someone tried to write the next "Once upon a time in the west" according to some references "The quick and the dead" obviously take to the story: A heroine that is driven by her past what comes clear in some flashbacks, a villain that is ruthless and doesn't count on anybodies lives, subplots from the past for different characters, close-ups from gunslingers and so on. But one Woody Strode - he has a short appearance at the beginning making some coffins and is one of the gunfighters in the famous opening scene of "Once upon a time in the west" - does not make an epic movie. The plot, the score, the dialog, it is all some kind of exerted and does not make up "The quick and the dead" for a movie you will remember or you want to see again. I like the actors, the camera and the setting and "The quick and the dead" is quite nice entertainment. If you are not too experienced in western, go and watch "The quick and the dead", you may like it. If you have seen Leone, Eastwood and others, there is a good comparison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ellen, an unknown female gunslinger rides into a small, dingy and depressing prairie town with a secret as to her reason for showing up.Shortly after her arrival, a local preacher, Cort, is thrown through the saloon doors while townsfolk are signing up for a gun competition. The pot is a huge sum of money and the only rule: that you follow the rules of the man that set up the contest, Herod.Herod is also the owner, leader, and "ruler" of the town. Seems he's arranged this little gun-show-off so that the preacher (who use to be an outlaw and rode with Herod) will have to fight again.Cort refuses to ever use a gun to kill again and Herod, acknowledging Cort as one of the best, is determined to alter this line of thinking ... even if it gets someone killed ...This little cult classic was unfairly overlooked when released, probably because Stones name was over the title. If you remember, this was a time when she released stinker after stinker, so it's understandable people stayed away. I was interested to see how Raimi would handle the then flagging western genre, and he injects new life into it, thanks to some amazing lighting and camera-work.The story and narrative is simple, but the characters that we have are delicious, and all have their own traits. Stone is okay, as is Crowe and Dicaprio. But Hackman owns this film in a big way. It's as if he's taken his little Bill character and added a pantomime twist to him.He's ridiculously over the top and commands every scene he's in.It's a fantastical flight of a movie, with some fine scenarios and a great final fifteen minutes. If you haven't seen tis Gem, catch it. it's well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Noon it isn't!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The image of somebody standing in the center of the town with the saloon on one side and the barbershop on the other, with hands ready to pull was made a classic by Gary Cooper in High Noon. In this film the gun tricks are quick, the acting very good, even Sharon Stone pulls her weight....yet the film is not memorable. Yes Gene Hackman does everything superbly, and Leonardo Di Caprio is a charming youngster. But in this production, Russell Crowe gets the thumbs up for me. It seems that this is a re-make of another film that was made in 1987 I wonder why. Is it because lately there have been too many horrible stories based on true stories, and this one is so preposterous that it is senseless? Perhaps the previous version was not gory enough? What is particular in this production is the collection of absolutely disgusting characters that makes one think that with all the advances in film making, it is good that they did not add actual of smell to this one.</fullReview>

I will say that this movie is worth seeing for the cast alone. I found most of it to be reasonable enough to enjoy. It's not as good as Tombstone or Unforgiven but if you like any of these actors then have a look at it. I found the most annoying part to be the first 20 minutes or so. Sharon Stones stupid roll in the early part almost completely ruined the movie.I still have trouble trying to watch this first section of the show. get your self past that and its more fun from then on in.

		<shortDescription>Nice try from Raimi, but ultimately it creeps just above average.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Western is a tough genre to tackle in the modern age, more so when it's post 1992 Unforgiven's masterclass 101. But tackling both these challenges is nothing to the one which director Sam Raimi asks of the audience in his stab at the genre. A female gunslinger is here played by a Hollywood beauty, Sharon Stone, but she isn't right for the lead role. She obviously looks gorgeous and she broods and pouts better than most of her modern day peers, but she lacks a menacing streak, a bit of believable nastiness that just might have lifted the film to better heights? We understand and expect the vulnerability she shows, but to succeed here in the testosterone fueled town of Redemption, she's going to have to convince as a tough gal. And Stone just isn't up to the task.The film does have good points to enjoy though, very much so. The story, although gimmicky, works well as an entertaining popcorn munching tale, while the cast list reads like a whose who of solid and quality thespers. (Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DeCaprio, Keith David, Pat Hingle &amp; Lance Henriksen). Also into the plus column is the always impressive cinematography from Dante Spinotti, and there is no denying Sam Raimi's keen eye for detail, with his zooming shots a real treat during the shoot out sequences. But in spite of this, and acknowledging that the makers have tried something different, The Quick &amp; The Dead isn't quick enough on the draw to outlive it's leading lady misstep. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingenious modern western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have an undying fondness for westerns, even despite the fact that they are always roughly the same thing. Hell, maybe even because they're always the same thing. Is there a more beautiful shot than the obligatory angel of vengeance standing in a pool of sun and giving us a dreamy look that's filled with regret and melancholia? Sharon Stone may not have been the ideal lead for this movie, but the close-up shots of her eyes are still as effective as can be. Besides, her tough attitude isn't as fake as some have stated, it just isn't on par with the true greats. What I like most about this movie is the incredibly simplistic plot though. I love how the movie actually centers around a gun-fighting competition, talk about no nonsense. No need for excuses to have people shoot at each other, they just make that the central plot and call it a day. The storyline about Herod's past with Cort is very interesting as well, because it makes the few occasions on which good things happen to Cort so worthwhile. The ending is standard fare for the genre, but frankly I wouldn't want it any other way. Raimi pretty much made the prototype of a western for the 21st century, a wonderful homage to the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal high-stakes tournament</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of westerns have supported their plot on the legendary test of wills, a duel-to-the-death gunfight. However, few have made multiple gunfights as much of a backbone for the story as this one does.Every character is well developed, and represents a clear metaphor. Look for a battalion of excellent actors: Gene Hackman, Leo Dicaprio, and Russell Crowe are the marquee standouts, although their dominance of the film makes gunfight outcomes easily predictable. It's a bit of a Roman gladiator death match, except with guns replacing swords. It's (literally) a single elimination tournament, where losers (after the first round) pay a rather high price. Winners are not declared winners until they make sure the opponent is no longer breathing. It's puzzling what some of the contestants were thinking when they signed up.Hackman is effective as the satanic character (his name is Herod, of all things), who savagely and brutally intimidates a desert nowhere town. He even has two specially attired murderous guards, a reference to Hitler. Crowe is a fallen angel; a preacher who has compromised his faith, and Dicaprio is Herod's cocky and arrogant son. Sharon Stone as a vengeful wraith gives the only weak performance among the major roles. Even worse than her acting is her woefully poor and unconvincing shooting ability. A person with two broken arms could draw faster and shoot straighter.The final four gunfighters left standing in the competition are extremely predictable, but the film gets away with it. This is due to the strength of the characters, and their interacting relationships. It's also pretty obvious who will face off with whom, and the red herring that is employed is not concealed well at all. It's about as obvious as guessing who is buried in Grant's tomb.Except for a few plot holes already noted, it's written well. It's skillfully directed, and usually well acted. The themes and structure are well managed, and the resolution is satisfying. Mostly good entertainment for western fans or mainstream movie viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, Bad, and Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Western is a fascinating cinematic effort that both intrigues and repulses. It combines stereotypical close in and move out shots, varying color schemes and photography along with the usual assortment of characters. The director plays it both straight and fancy, resorting to photographic and directorial Western gimmicks from other Westerns while at the same time inserting a more edgy, substantive screen presence. The effort both excels and fails. There is some restraint of the graphic violence while at the same time depicting further in a few scenes. There is both stereotypes as well as lingering, qualitatively increased depth of characterization through performances and small added dialogue or expressions. There is finally the climatic scene that has drama and emotional gumption. The inclusion of a familiar cast of stars many early in their career also heightens the entertainment value. This movie is both good, bad, and notoriously ugly for its mean characters. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Plot: Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo Dicaprio, and Director Sam Raimi (Spiderman) reinvents the American western in this wild, sexy shoot-out studded with action, suspense, and offbeat humor.My Spiel: The Quick and the Dead seems to always be on the TNT network, but I can never sit threw it with all those commercials. So when I saw this movie for sale I picked it up to finally be able to watch it with out commercial interruptions. This is a entertaining western that it has the style and build of the standard tale of ultimate revenge. Granted I find it crazy that Sam Raimi directed this but he managed to get a heck of a cast. But this movie delivers in the style that its just your basic draw to draw shoot 'em up film. For those of you who haven't heard of seen this it's set around a competition of 1 on 1 fastest draw elimination. This has its crazy cast of random and off beat characters that enter and you know they are toast. But it has it's moments of thrills. But surprisingly has a end that wont disappoint. I recommend this movie to any fans of the new style western scene.The Quick and the Dead (1995) Review: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting, Dusty, Supercool-Looking Avenging Cowgirl Western With Outstanding Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mysterious female gunslinger appears in the lawless western town of Redemption, run by a sharpshooting killer named John Herod. Entering the no-holds-barred quick-draw competition, she has a score to settle with Herod dating back to her childhood ...I'm not generally a fan of movies where the star is also the producer, but Stone does a pretty good job on both fronts here, selecting the right people to get the most out of this stylish, latter-day spaghetti western. Although Raimi was a gun for hire (ahem), he fills the film with his uniquely stylish visuals - wild point-of-view shots, crazy angles, wacky whiplash moves, visual puns (at one point Stone has dynamite between her legs) and an extraordinary moment during the duel between Hackman and DiCaprio of eight - count them, eight - dizzying triple-zoom reverse shots in a row. And rarely have I seen a movie so well cast - all the support players are wonderful (especially David as a pipe-smoking gentleman killer and Henriksen as a stylish joker) and the four leads are terrific. Stone is a little uneven - she's better when she's playing up her heroine's vulnerability - but is an iconic and almost unique female western lead (Johnny Guitar is the only rival). Crowe and DiCaprio, both of whom were relatively unknown at the time, are excellent as the reformed outlaw and cocky kid; the latter's tragic and pathetic death-scene is particularly well played. The backbone of the movie though is Hackman, who dominates everything as Herod, one of the most horrible but convincing heavies in any movie; he's thoroughly rotten (at one point he screams at the townsfolk, "This is my town ! If you live to see the dawn, it's because I allow it !!") but multi-faceted - he's cultured and intelligent but has a complete disdain for morality, and his attraction to Cort (Crowe) is almost undisguised homosexuality. It's a fabulous cast. There is marvellous photography by Dante Spinotti and a brilliant score by the talented Alan Silvestri, which is a part-Morricone, part-Hollywood mix of lush orchestral tone and jarring percussion. For my money this is one of the very best modern westerns - a traditional tale with a cool gender twist and a story that nicely balances the obligatory set-pieces with interesting, explosive characters. Not to be missed. Shot at Old Tuscon Studios in Arizona, and dedicated to veteran tough-guy Strode (Spartacus, Once Upon A Time In The West), who plays the coffin-maker measuring Stone for size at the start. The title of this movie is a quote from The Bible (1 Peter, chapter 4) and has been used as the title of several other unrelated films, songs and books (notably a 1973 novel by Louis L'Amour).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A potentially great movie dragged down by Sharon Stones terrible acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>!!!Warning. This comment contains extreme spoilers!!! This movie contains some of the absolute worst acting I've ever seen, and some of the absolute best.On one end of the spectrum, we have Sharon Stone portraying a daddy's girl out for revenge against an outlaw gunman who murdered her father when she was a child. Now, that story, perhaps tweaked a bit, could have been good, but Stone absolutely butchered it with her pathetic attempt at playing the role. She plays a young woman with a bad attitude who doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything. A typical "mysterious stranger" type character. The problem is, the role was played so horribly, it's comparable to a high school play performed by a bad drama club full of pseudo-emo kids trying to sound deep.This role could have worked so well, or at least the basic story of "good guy vs bad guy," but thanks to Stone, not only was the role completely destroyed, but the shockwaves of where her performance crash landed very nearly destroyed the entire movie.Now we come to the middle men. Those in the center of the spectrum.First, we have Russell Crowe. He plays Cort, an ex-outlaw turned preacher. Presumanly, Cort is the best gunman in the movie, though we never see a showdown with a worthy opponent. Not a bad piece of acting, but not particularly good, either. Not much to say.Next, we have Leo cast as Fee "The Kid." A big-mouthed youth with a fast gun hand, and an even faster mouth. Again, not particularly great acting, but not bad. Not as good as Crowes, though. I feel this role would have benefited more from another actor.Then we have a bunch of other people that don't matter a whole lot.This brings us to the opposite end of the spectrum, as far as possible from Sharon Stones crap-job. Gene Hackman is cast as John Herod. An ex-outlaw that used to ride with Cort (Russell Crowe). Herod is now the mayor of a small town where his word is absolute. The townspeople live in fear, because Herod is pure evil. Gene Hackman doesn't "play" the role. He IS the role. This is possibly the best piece of acting I've ever seen in my entire life, and the only thing keeping this movie from sinking into the sludge pit that Sharon Stone set forth. Herod hosts a gunslinger tournament with a cash prize. He is the central pillar tieing together the other 3 main characters.Ellen (Stone) is out to get her revenge on Herod for what he did when she was a kid. She enters the tournament, and ultimately ends up somehow winning, killing Herod in a final showdown at the end.Cort is Herods ex-partner, and has been captured and dragged against his will to the town to take part in the tournament. His fight with Herod is interrupted before it begins, but Herod had one of his toadies beat him up and smash his gun hand before the fight because he knew Cort was too fast for him.Fee is Herods son, who enters to try and win his fathers respect and approval, only to be fatally wounded in the tournament by Herod. He cries and squirms around like a little worm before he dies.These four form the foundation of the movie, but Hackman outclasses them by light years.All in all, this is a decent western dragged down by Stones bad acting, and saved by Hackmans. If you want a deep plot that will suck you in and have you biting your nails, seek elsewhere. If you want a shoot em up and don't care about historical accuracy (which you should be watching documentaries for anyway), go for it.At least, that's my take on the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite movie stars are Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman, so I knew this was probably going to be a good film to watch and it sure was a great different kind of Western. This story revolved around a small town which had been taken over by John Herod, (Gene Hackman) "Superman" who was an evil outlaw and was ruthless and cruel and controlled all the people in the town. Sharon Stone, (Ellen/The Lady), "Bobby" played the role of a gal who could handle herself very well with men and was fast with the pistols, a Pistol Pack'n Mama who had her targets on John Herod for something he did to her while she was a child. Russell Crowe, (Cort) "A Good Year", becomes friends with Ellen and they decided to team up against John Herod. Leonardo DiCaprio, (Fee Herod/The Kid) plays the role of John Herod's only son who is always trying to please his dad as a gunfighter, but is always being put down by his dad. There is plenty of action and the ending will take you by complete surprise. Don't miss this gem of a film back in 1995 when everyone looked young and great. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>all the makings of a cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time you watch this movie, you realize it has all the makings of a cult classic, and was obviously meant to fit in that genre. The plot is a basic super powered bad guy ("Gene Hackman) owns the Western town and controls it. As he says "I decide who lives and who dies!". He organizes a shooting contest, mostly to show his expertise, but also to indulge in his sadistic fantasies, one of which is to make a former gang member, turned atoning priest, into a sadistic killer like himself. Sharon Stone plays the woman looking for revenge upon Hackman. What makes this so unique and such a cult classic sort of movie are basically two ingredients. One is the theatre of the absurd atmosphere, and the filming techniques. In one scene a character seems to be a super marksman until Hackman makes a revealing testimony, then the camera suddenly cuts and zooms to a gunfight between the two. In another scene, a bullet is seen going through a man's body, and the viewer sees a cardboard cutout of the man with a hole in his chest. There are other well timed bits of absurdity, because this is not meant to be a believable story, but an enjoyable one, as if a pack of liars are trying to outdo each other in telling the events. The second ingredient is the multitude of interesting characters. Many of them at least partly sympathetic. There's the dandy Wild Bill character who loves attention, the kid, the Swede whom the kid wants to have him remember and tell of his exploits to others, the emotionless bounty hunting shootist, and Pat Hingle as a frightened townsman. This makes for exciting movie making. Certainly not to be taken seriously. A lot of people will resent the way it pokes fun at the super powered super sadistic bad guy character. I recommend it.</fullReview>

Russell Crowe also delivers, along with all the other gunmen.The movie delivers great entertainment as we follow a gun contest with a big prize of money. We get to know several characters who wants to win, and it don't take long before we have found out who to support. Guy Ritchie may found inspiration for his character 'Boris the blade' in this movie as we meet a bullet-dodging Indian. A funny one! I think this movie is great because of the superb acting and the different plot with the gun contest. Be ready to be surprised!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly stylized western with visual panache. Sadly, it descends into plagiarism at the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Quick And The Dead is a highly stylized western made at a time when westerns were few and far between. The entire film exists in a kind of prefabricated non-reality, where the characters are over-the-top, the action totally implausible and the colours deliberately garish and over-emphasised. Only when you accept these stylistic touches can you truly enjoy the film. Those who claim that the film is an insult to "real" westerns seem to be missing the point ? this film is intentionally spoofing the whole spaghetti western sub-genre, and consequently is MEANT to be stylized and far-fetched (even spaghetti classics like A Fistful Of Dollars and Once Upon A Time In The West were stylized and far-fetched, for goodness sake!!!)In the desert town of Redemption, various sharpshooters gather to compete in a quick draw championship. The winner will be showered with glory and great riches. But there doesn't seem to be much doubt about who the winner will be, since the reigning champion Herod (Gene Hackman) is one fast son-of-a-bitch when it comes to the quick draw. One of the competitors is a mysterious woman named Ellen (Sharon Stone), whose motives remain hidden even though she makes it clear that she has some sort of score to settle with Herod. Others include a preacher named Cort (Russell Crowe) who used to be an outlaw, and a fresh-faced young Kid (Leonardo Di Caprio) who is angry because he believes Herod may be his father. In a series of violent shootouts the contestants are whittled down until only two remain ? Ellen and Herod. Only at the point of winning or losing will she reveal her reasons for entering the competition?..The film is directed by Sam Raimi, the man who brought us the outrageous Evil Dead. Here, Raimi lets his fondness for quirky humour, disorientating camera angles and choreographed violence run free. His film is intentionally and enjoyably overblown, with some fantastic visual flourishes. Having said that, there are a few negative elements that mar his film. The climactic revelation in The Quick And The Dead virtually plagiarises the closing denouement from Once Upon A Time In The West ? it's one thing to spoof a film, but to practically STEAL its ending is a different matter altogether, and totally unacceptable. Also, the actors in this one don't really convince in their roles. Stone looks sexy in tight leathers, but it's awfully hard to swallow the concept that she's a sharp-shooting wiz with a vendetta to settle. Di Caprio has a one-dimensional role and is in the film purely because of his looks. Hackman and Crowe manage to fare slightly better (mainly because there's a fraction more depth to their roles). However, The Quick And The Dead is intended as an exercise in style and visual panache, so in many ways the shallowness of the characters is both inevitable and deliberate. It's an amusing and entertaining film to watch, and if you come to it in the right frame of mind there's no reason why you won't enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1995's "The Quick and the Dead", with the Lady (Sharon Stone), Cort (Russell Crowe) and Harod (Gene Hackman), was terrible. Although the veteran actors were good.Harod had hurt and killed many, including the town lawman, in order to become owner of the town. A cruel man, he had sat up a contest for gunslingers to convince a former fellow shootist, Preacher Cort, to return to gunfighting. Cort no longer desired to live by the gun, but that wasn't a problem to some since the prize was a pot of gold.Then Lady came to town, with a secret, looking for revenge. Her target was the hated Harod but she'd have to go through Preacher Cort to get to her real opponent. Then, to ensure Cort losing, Herod had the odds set against him through deception. That act, unwittingly, set the stage for the Lady's revenge.The only good part was the final shootout. It brings some fascinating results that will surprise anyone who hasn't seen it before. See "The Quick and the Dead" and try to enjoy it.This is a movie done director Sam Raimi's way. I'd like to see him stick to "Xena, Warrior Princess". It's more his style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quick draw rocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi's The Quick And The Dead marks his first foray into big budget film-making and while it didn't make any waves upon initial release, it isn't a bad film by any means. One can actually take the film as a time vessel since it features early, prestardom roles by Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. There's a lot to like about the film. Like its title characters, it moves along at a quick tempo never letting its momentum lag. The quick draws are exciting and Raimi instills many of his trademark camera moves into the proceedings. A shot at a rival gunslinger through an open cavity in a man's chest is pure Raimi all the way. Sharon Stone turns in a fine performance in a somewhat underwritten role as a gunslinger with a grudge to play out. Gene Hackman is his usual likable slimeball and fans of Aliens can check out Lance Henriksen as a gunslinger who is more talk than actual action. Overall, Quick And The Dead delivers the goods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak on the story, but it's safe to say that "The Quick and the Dead" is always quick, and never dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi, the director of the "Spider-man" and "Evil Dead" series has created a fun, if flawed, modern western."The Quick and the Dead" is about a woman ("The Lady") who visits and old town, and enters a gun-fighting contest. Many people do that for the money, but she has more personal reasons. She wants to get back at John Henrod, the man who killed her father.The main flaw in "The Quick and the Dead" is the storyline. It's a simple and predictable revenge story. You can predict the ending in a couple of minutes. The characters bear similarities to characters in other Westerns. For example, "The Lady" is the main character, but she is never "The Good Guy" because she insults the bartender and little girl that takes care of her room.(After winning quick-draw Battle) Girl: "You did great out there!" The Lady: "Grow up." Don't forget about "The Kid." He bears similarities to the kid in "Unforgiven": self-centered, rude, young, restless, energetic, etc.But, it's safe to say that "The Quick and the Dead" is always quick, and never dead. The quick-draw scenes are fun and exciting, and the film is brought to life by several music scores, including "Mars" from "The Planets." The camera zooms in and out during the quick-draw scenes, but it's annoying how it switches back and forth between two people when they're talking before a quick-draw battle.One of the things I found interesting about "The Quick and the Dead" was how they cast Hackman as the villain. This was odd because he also starred in other westerns such as "Unforgiven," and "Bite the Bullet." So, maybe "The Quick and the Dead" doesn't succeed in storyline, but it does pack some good quick-draw scenes and entertainment. I wouldn't call it "extraordinary" or "a masterpiece," but its fun to watch.Good: Quick action, good camera, good music, entertaining Bad: Simple story Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting modern Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sharon Stone plays a lone female cowboy named Ellen "The Lady" who comes to a Western town in hopes of revenging her murdered father by masquerading as a contestant in a gunfighting competition. The person who murdered her father is none other than the ruler of this town and competition (John Herod who is played by John Herod). While this film isn't really that good, there are some great moments that shows the future greatness of Sam Raimi when he does Spiderman and Spiderman 2. Other than that, you get to see a pre-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio who does his best in the role that was given him. This film ultimately is style over substance, with this modern rendition of a Western trying to be an Unforgiven (though it doesn't quite succeed as that film did). 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A watched this simply because it's from the same director as the Spiderman movies, but unfortunately it ends up being so far from the kind of greatness of the Spiderman films. The acting is fine, Russell Crowe gives a very good performance, and Leonardo Dicaprio, and Sharon Stone are workable, while Gene Hackman is anything but convincing. The story is only barley their, it's almost completely gun fights, and nothing else. The direction is really, really, bad, with no ambition, at all, no nothing at all.If you enjoyed this film, you might also like, Dances with Wolves, and Open Range.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who like westerns this is a good choice. Especially if you liked the "Spagetti Westerns" that Clint Eastwood did in the 1960's and 1970's.For those of you who like the style and spirit of the recent Spiderman movies, then this is a good choice as well (same director Sam Raimi). It was also produced by Sharon Stone who also stars in it.I don't like to tell others too much about a movie that I have seen. My usual comments are if I liked it or not and a basic intro plot line. So I will do just that: 1. I liked the movie.2. It is a story about a woman gunfighter that has come to a town owned by an outlaw. Every year he has a gunfighting contest that offers a huge prize.So in short, if you like the 60's westerns, then you should enjoy this movie. If you don't like westerns perhaps your time is better spent reflecting on why you don't like westerns. :-D P.S. Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert (producer) also did a TV series or two on called Hercules and the other Xena: Warrior Princess. KirbyEF</fullReview>

That captive Russell Crowe, when handed a gun and bullet, would not shoot either a.)Gene Hackman, or b.)himself and put an end to his misery.Escapes from reality?

And all her people are going "oh yeah, that'd be great, just wonderful!"It's hard to buy a really hot blonde woman who looks like she stepped out of a nightclub as Clint Eastwood, which is bad because everyone else in the cast is great. But here it is, Sharon Stone, as a cigar smoking, whiskey drinking, monotone talking Clint Eastwood wannabe, who is the fastest gun in the west. Not for one moment do you believe she is what she's supposed to be. There's only one Eastwood. Mario Van Peebles couldn't pull it off in Posse. A plethora of other actors couldn't do it in any number of straight to video films. And Stone definitely can't do it here.Sad too, because if this had been cast with a more believable lead, this could have been a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Raimi/Stone had played this one for laughs, or at least irony, it would have been a better picture. Or maybe if Stone's character hadn't been an obvious Distaff Man With No Name. I dunno. As a woman, I love "Girls Kickin A" movies as much as the next one. But as I (who love those spaghetti westerns) watched "The Quick and the Dead," I found the disingenuous similarities to (for example) "High Plains Drifter," "Fist Full of Dollars" and "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" more and more hilarious with each recognition. I mean, the girl wore the hat and the long rider, smoked the cheroot, and used dynamite! If she'd painted the town red, it wouldn't have been more derivative. (Wait.

		<shortDescription>The Movie Goes Quick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is best classified as a western/action movie. Its got a lot of cool over the top gun play and the best of the best duke it out in a winner take all scenario (the losers go home in a 6x3 pine box). Sharon Stone is a good-looking heroine. I think the character was a little flat and predictable. Gene Hackman does a nice job as the bad guy running "his" town, as he's the fastest gun around. You see Russell Crowe in a kind of odd role versus what you see him in today; still a somewhat serious character but just not what you would expect in my opinion. Leonardo is just being Leo - not a lot of depth to his character - and I do wonder how much of a stretch it is for him to play someone young, cocky, and confident. Keith David and Lance Henriksen round out a good supporting cast.Basically, if you're into high-noon time gun fights, or just have a thing for the old western style revolvers the movies worth a watch on DVD or cable (its on every now and then), but there's not rush and if you miss it you won't be hearing about it from all your friends. At the same time, they won't look at you like you've got four heads if you go out and watch it. So, enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Sam Raimi had taken himself and this movie seriously, it would have been just awful. But the tongue-in-cheek Nineties spin on Sergio Leone-ish spaghetti Westerns is really well done and is occasionally amusing. It's not a great movie by any means, but Raimi knows what he's spoofing and does so con brio. The operatic music, the extreme closeups, the vengeance theme conveyed by overwrought flashbacks, all conspire to achieve the goal of honoring, yet chuckling over, the overblown, fly-blown epics like Duck, You Sucker and Once Upon a Time in the West. If Randolph Scott is your favorite Western star, this probably won't fit your pistol. But it is amusing, especially if your tastes run to Klaus Kinski and Bud Spencer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that can be enjoyed on several levels. If you're just looking for a good oater, it is that. However, you can also look at it as a psychological thriller, because it certainly is that. Those wishing a deeper meaning can easily find a satanic - angelic confrontation because it certainly has those features as well. One reviewer even calls it a comedy-western, but I don't see that at all. This is one of the best-acted films I've seen in a long time. It should be - with stars like Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone, Russell Crowe and Leonardo di Caprio in it. Stone is gorgeous and, of course, on the "good" side (the fore-mentioned angel?). Hackman is so good at playing a bad guy and this is no exception (the satanic side?). I enjoy this film and have watched it on all the levels that I've mentioned. In each level, you can find something else to love about it. I think this film is one of the most underrated ones that I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spaghetti Western, American Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a mix of typical Hollywood Western (heroes vs bad guys) and Spaghetti Western (artsy/dramatic shots). As such it is similar to the spaghetti westerns but lacking Clint Eastwood and all the action.The story is about a supposed gun-fighters contest for prize money. But in my opinion it is more about the ideals of (so-called) "good" vs evil. The "good" is the preacher (Crowe) and the "Lady" (Stone) vs the evil (Hackman, et. al.).The town is beset by an evil outlaw (Hackman) turned overlord who has even captured a preacher in chains (Crowe) and claimed the power to decide who lives and dies - is Raimi saying this is Satan, and the town is hell? The artsy scenes lend a surrealistic effect to the movie which makes me think "possibly."The townspeople are beyond just plain cowards, they have been demoralized and lost all sense of right. Tormenting the preacher as he tries to resist temptation to revert to his old ways and even picking at the clothes of the dead "contestants."This is definitely not your standard American Western, so if that's all you want then avoid this movie. However, if your taste is broader than that, then I think you will enjoy this as much as I do (I've seen it 3 times on cable.)Hackman is so brilliant that he has always managed to loose his "baggage" from his previous films, thus drawing you anew into his latest flick. I loved watching Hackman control this whole movie - his charcater is pivotal as is his acting.Crowe is good and I enjoyed his performance.Stone only looks the part, but looks the part well.DiCaprio is "adorable" as a fast shooter of both his mouth and pistol. In the end he delivers a really good performance.The editting of the gunfights is extremely well down and timed. All the actors appear convincing in their roles as gun slingers simply because of the editting.8/10.- ZafoidPS: the word "good" is put into quotes since killing another human is in fact evil. The preacher's giving in to his old ways makes the story weak. But this is only a movie, and not a declaration of faith in the Lord.- Z</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to laugh reading some of these other user's comments. It's obvious that today, just as in 1995, people don't get this movie. They expect it to be a 'good western', or 'art', or a 'Sam Raimi film'. They are looking for things that simply aren't there. It's understandable, since this movie was promoted as a straight-forward western upon its release. But that's the studio suits' fault; not Sam Raimi's. I'm sure he would say 'Just enjoy!' This movie is not so-easily pigeonholed as some would have you believe. This movie is an homage to spaghetti westerns. It's a revenge flick. It's good vs. evil. It's a live-action cartoon. There is talent at work here, and it's obvious to me that everyone involved in this movie had fun filming it. This is a true guilty pleasure. Did you pay to see 'Charlie's Angels' or 'The Mummy' on the big screen expecting 'Citizen Kane'? Westerns these days don't do as well as they used to in today's MTV generation. This movie is 'Silverado' meets 'Unforgiven' (an overrated western, certainly not deserving of Best-Picture Oscar status that year) in the Twilight Zone! Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone and Russell Crowe all give enjoyable performances. I didn't know Stone paid DiCaprio's salary; I learned that on imdb.com just now. But he and the other supporting actors are just as invaluable here as Batman's archvillains. They fill out this live-action cartoon perfectly. Watch this more than once, and it will become a guilty pleasure for you, too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hidden treasure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A quirky and fun Western directed by the master of "quirky and fun", Sam Raimi. Before hitting it big with "Spiderman", Raimi enchanted fans with films like this one and his "Evil Dead" trilogy.It's a fairly typical Western story -- a stranger rides into town with an unknown vendetta against the boss of the town (played with delightful evil glee by Gene Hackman). In this film, there is a yearly gunfight tournament to determine the "Fastest Gun," a tournament that the Evil Boss, of course, always wins. The stranger enters the tournament in order to kill the Evil Boss. And, of course, there are other colorful characters in the town and in the tournament.The "twist" is that the stranger is a woman, played by Sharon Stone. Stone's performance is a revelation -- in addition to doing an amazing impersonation of Clint Eastwood as "The Man with No Name" in the early Sergie Leone westerns (although you'd have to be a fan of those old films to really appreciate the subtlety of her performance), she perfectly portrays a person -- not just a woman -- torn by the desire for vengeance and the ugliness of it. Too many actresses would go the simplistic route of making the character a "kick-ass babe." Stone's portrayal is far more complex than that. It is easily the best performance of her career.The other "twist" is that in Raimi's master hands, the film gallops along at a marvelous pace, moving from gritty realism to fantasy and then back again. The entire cast -- which, along with Stone and Hackman, includes Leonardo di Caprio, Russell Crowe, Gary Sinese -- is obviously having the time of their lives, and it shows in fantastic performances. And then the movie ends, all the questions have been answered, all the secrets have been revealed, and you end up with what we watch movies for -- a satisfied feeling of having been truly entertained.This film is an absolute gem, and it's a shame that more people don't know about it. Check it out!10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a nice surprise I run into by chance. A crew of guns slingers come into town competing for money, one of them has a bigger reason than money alone, and there are a few secrets that get uncover along the way. This is probably the last movie that L. DeCaprio made before his work turned stale. You get to see Russel Crow before he became a big star, and Lars Henriksen as usual in a nice supporting role. Gene Hackman is quite effective as the man to beat, unfortunately Sharon Stone is the weakest link, she is not bad, just miscasted. The duels are great fun, and two are quite memorable in their ending. The camera work is quite cool, sometimes rushing toward their subject at blazing speed an providing odd angles. The story moves at a good clip, and the unusual crew of gunslingers keep you interested.I would not go out of my way to find this movie but if for some rare reason you happen to catch it on cable, watch it, if you like an unusual western, this is the one. 7.0/10</fullReview>

The town is under the control of an iniquitous tyrant (Hackman), who creates a tournament in which the best gunmen can compete for top honors by shooting each other dead. The setup may be predictable but it is interesting, unfortunately it's wasted as the film is slow and stilted, with action scenes that add absolutely no life whatsoever to the proceedings.

		<fullReview>Fans of the great westerns of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone won't find much depth to 'The Quick and the Dead', but this after all is a SAM RAIMI movie. I like Raimi's movies as much as the next guy, and will even passionately defend his much maligned 'Crimewave', but even I will concede that his movies are not Great Art. Raimi is an entertainment guy pure and simple. Three Stooges homages in his 'Evil Dead' trilogy are more is style than brooding symbolism, and this movie may be be in a different genre than he usually deals with but even so it's business as usual. Turn off your brain and you will enjoy this above average action flick, which always has its tongue firmly in its cheek. I rate it on par with 'Barb Wire', a similar slice of empty, campy entertainment.In fact 'The Quick and the Dead' and 'Barb Wire' share more in common than you would first think. Both feature strong female (blonde) characters fighting for family against a background where human life is close to worthless. Both blondes must ultimately defeat a heartless male character while debating whether to pursue a potential love interest. And both movies are boosted by a supporting cast of character actors and cult figures. In this case that includes Lance Henriksen ('Aliens', 'Near Dark'), Keith David ('The Thing', 'There's Something About Mary'), Mark Boone Jr ('Trees Lounge', 'Memento'), Pat Hingle ('Bloody Mama', the Batman series), and the little seen Roberts Blossom ( serial killer classic 'Deranged').Add to that the ever dependable Gene Hackman, strong turns from future superstars Crowe and DiCaprio, and even a cameo from the legendary Woody Strode (his last film), and the flaws in this b-grade shoot-em-up can be easily ignored. Ms. Stone, 'Casino' or no 'Casino', is much better suited to this kinda undemanding material. She should forget her aspirations to be a "serious artiste" and take a leaf out of Ms. Anderson's book. Trash is where it's at for her. Hey somebody call up Roger Corman and make him an offer he can't refuse! 'Big Bad Blonde Mamas' or something! It's a winner I tell ya!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb parody of old west gunslinger movies, I rate "8" of 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Quick and The Dead", local outlaw gunslinger Herod (Gene Hackman) has set up a "contest", a series of one-on-one gunslinger face-offs at the first strike of the town clock at the appointed hour. Set up in the saloon like a tennis tournament elimination bracket. You're either "quick", or you're dead!SPOILERS - The parody tone is set up early, when an escaped prisoner rides into town and confronting Ellen (Sharon Stone), the conversation going like this -- He, "You sure are purty." She, "you're not." He, "I need a woman." She, "You need a bath," then sends him off.Other key characters are Cort (Russell Crowe), a preacher who once was a member of Herod's gang, and still a very quick draw. The Kid (Leo DiCaprio) who is the son of Herod, and who operates the gun shop in town. All are in the contest, plus 12 others, and with the rule "one muct die", they all get a bit nervous as the final four plan their face-offs.The back story is Ellen's, she is there to avenge the death of her father when she was a little girl of about 10. Herod had her dad, the Marshal (Gary Sinise), on a stool and a noose around his neck. He gave the girl (Ellen) his gun and said, "You can save your dad if you can shoot the rope." Her dad says, "I'll love you honey, no matter what happens. You can do it." Then she shot, and killed her own dad.In the final two showdowns, Herod shoots and kills his son, the Kid, "I tried to give him an 'out'", but also getting wounded. In the other, it appears that the preacher kills Ellen, but it is a trick. Hidden explosives go off during the Herod/Cort face-off, the town buildings are blown up, Herod's riflemen are shot, as well as herod, and Ellen gets her revenge. In the end, she throws her dad's Marshal badge to Cort, "There's a new law in town", and rides off.This film is very well done. It is very obviusly a parody, but a very intelligent one. The acting, sound, photography are all excellent. Gene Hackman is at his evil best, almost a western "Lex Luthor." Sharon Stone is great as the stoic lady gunslinger. Russel Crowe does his usual fine acting job. As does DiCaprio as the child-man who wants his father's respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so it's not the great movie ever made...or even a great western. What is is, however, is lots of fun, with lots of showy filmmaking. Sam Raimi shows off his craft very well here...and the actors get to really have fun playing archetypes...or maybe spoofs or archetypes. Sharon Stone doesn't have to do anything but look cool (and sexy when she's under all those furs). Gene Hackman is virtually the same character he played in UNFORGIVEN, but more one-dimensional...on purpose. DiCaprio is a hoot (try to remember him before you saw TITANIC and he got overexposed...he was really a fun actor). An unknown Russell Crowe is moody and handsome, and one gets just a tiny glimpse of the full-fledged "quiet, tortured hero" he would become with GLADIATOR. Lance Henrickson is funny, and all the other characters are totally over the top. The plot is so simple and straightforward, yet the movie is a lot of fun. Don't see this movie as an example of a great western...see it if you want to enjoy some great actors having fun with a bit of good-looking fluff. I've seen the movie three times now over the past 6 years...and I enjoy my 95 minutes every time.</fullReview>

Gene Hackman is deliciously evil as the town's boss, John Herod. Russell Crowe is fantastic as the outlaw-turned-preacher-turned-gunfighter,and Leo's very good as the "kid" who just wants his father's respect.All in all, a movie certainly worth seeing, but only if you're looking for some not-so-serious, tongue-in-cheek, fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mind a female gunfighter. I don't even necessarily mind Sharon Stone in this movie. The problem is they don't seem to have a clue as to what her character is supposed to be, and Sharon doesn't have a clue as to how to play it.Is Ellen a tough skilled gunfighter? Well, maybe. It takes her six shots or so to shoot Cort's noose. But she doesn't seem to have ever _shot_ anyone. She doesn't want to kill anyone, and even takes her own sweet time shooting Herod (fingering her gun suggestively a couple of time before being interrupted). How did she become a gunfighter without killing anyone? And if she did, why is she so reluctant now? Particularly when it comes to Herod. Revolvers _ain't_ that precise - are we supposed to believe she never killed anyone (even accidentally) in all the gunfights she has (presumably) had to reach her current skill and reputation?Okay, so she's the sensitive, caring would-be gunfighter that hasn't actually been in a fight before. But then...ummm, how did she become as skilled as we're supposed to believe she is (and as she demonstrates later when taking out Herod in the final showdown).So half the time Stone is playing a female Clint Eastwood, and the other half a 80's kinda sensitive woman. It's confusing as all get-out, as you can imagine (or have seen for yourself).Since Stone's character lies at the heart of the movie, we're totally confused. She is surrounded by some competent, likeable performances and interesting characters (De Caprio, Henriksen, Ketih David), and she even manages to hold her own against Hackman (who has a few character moments despite being the blackest bad guy ever).And yes, Raimi does lots of clever things with the camera. But it's Stone's character that really bothers me. The writers just couldn't seem to make up their mind about her, and it shows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mysterious gunfighter (Sharon Stone) comes to a western town with no law. It has full corruption and killers in this place. But this lady is there for a reason but she's unwillingly joins an elimination tournament to win the big prize money. But the town's people are afraid of one man it's John Herod (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Gene Hackman) is a ruthless, rich, fearless, cold-hearted and a killer as well. Many various townspeople and mysterious guests are there for various reasons to win the tournament but this lady is there to settle a revenge that Herod isn't ready for.Directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead Trilogy, Spider Man Trilogy, A Simple Plan) made an entertaining, if sightly underrated western movie that Raimi lovingly tribute of the Spaghetti Westerns and even his film-making style. Like some of Raimi's better works, this more of a exercise of style over substance. Although Raimi's technique gets to be a bit much at times. But Raimi has a strong cast here including Oscar-Winner:Russell Crowe, Leonardi DiCaprio, Tobin Bell, Robert Blossoms, Lance Herkinsen and more. This picture might plays better on TV and on Video than it did on theaters. The performances are good here, which some of the cast members seems to be having a great time and the production values are first-rate. Despite it's flaws, it's certainly worth a look. Die Hard fans of Raimi's work and Western fans will enjoy this more than others. The late Woody Strode appears in a cameo in the opening sequence, which it is his final movie. Cult actor:Bruce Campbell is credited, although his scenes got deleted in the last minute for the final cut. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun and entertaining Western by Sam Raimi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar nominee Sharon Stone and Oscar winners Gene Hackman and Russell Crowe star in this Sam Raimi Western flick, which I can only describe as "fun". It isn't what I would call a "serious" Western, but it doesn't get dull or boring. And it has this unique, gunslinger style where all of the characters are smart-mouthed and excellent aims, able to score direct hits while firing at the most impossible positions. Of course, nobody in the real West could fire a six-gun across their shoulder and strike a target over a hundred yards away, but it was cool with Russell Crowe did that with TWO six-guns.The film is about a gunslinger, who turns out to be a woman seeking the man who was indirectly responsible for her father's death. She finds him as the dictator of a town in the Old West. And he is hosting an elimination tournament for anybody willing to enter. He brings a former gunslinger, now turned preacher, and forces him into the contest as well. And overtime, the contest rules begin to unfairly change....Overall, it was a fairly good film. I do admit that maybe the last few minutes were a little bit over-emphasized in certain points and maybe seemed a little bit too eerie. Still, it's compelling and a good watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this film showed how flexible Sharon stone can be, obviously she is known for basic instinct to which she got excellent credit but a nudity-based reputation which I felt was unfair. But this film clearly presents her fantastic acting ability. There are moments in the film where you can genuinely empathise with her and only few actors can project there emotions on to the audience. Also gene hackman delivers an amazing sinister performance that evoke a hateful response from the audience to his character. The acting between the two of them (I feel) makes the film. There are some very tense scenes between him and Sharon which have the audience thinking 'will she, wont she'. Im very surprised that not many people have heard of this film, having asked many people. The editing is fantastic alongside with the music and cinematography. Although the film sticks to the traditional western/ cowboy story lines and it sticks to the stereotypical western genre camera shot I feel it delivers them in a unique fashion that had me enthralled, even though I do not like cow-boyish films. The casting is also great; Russell Crowe, Leonardo Dicaprio, Gene Hackman and of course Sharon Stone. I recommend this film to everyone even those who do not like the western genre it will change your mind. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was very well-done. The characters were fun and the story had enough twists to keep you interested. Without giving the last bits away, I'll just say that it is fresh. Basically, this movie's story is based around a gun drawing competition. The winner gets glory and lots of money. Ellen (Sharon Stone) comes to the town to get even with gene Hackman's character, who she claims "stole her life." The other players in the competition are a lot of fun, especially Leonardo DiCaprio, Gene Hackman's son. Russel Crowe is a de-famed priest who once was an outlaw. Most of the characters are "bad-a**es." Overall, the acting is excellent.Yes, this movie is a little cheesy and some of the situations are far-fetched. That's why it's so lovable, though. I think Sam Raimi did an excellent job with this movie, and it reminded me of a lot of his other work. Sharon Stone's character in particular reminded me of "Xena: Warrior Princess." If you like Raimi's work or movies that don't take themselves seriously and want you to have a good time, then you'll probably enjoy this flick. Being a Xena fan, I really liked this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Quick and the dead is my favourite Western Movie. It is just Fun all the way, lots of entertainment. Great violence, with a fairly good plot and a few laughs. I like the idea of a shoot out game of death, deadly but exciting. Among the competitors are Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russel Crowe, Learnado Di Caprio and many more known actors. They all have their reasons of participating. Sharon looks sexy as usual and gives a fine performance as the main lead of the film. Russel is the scruffy hero in a fairly good performance, and the fastest gun swinger of them all. Gene Hackman is great as the violent villain and feared man of the town. Learnado delivers all the laughs and does a good job of it. The supporting cast were efficient, especially Lance Henrikson as the man that claims to be the Best, not before Hackman blanks him.

Midway through you can predict the ending and five minutes through you know why The Lady is entering the contest.The story has some fun twists,and the performances are great.An early Leonardo DiCario plays Hackman's son who is determined to beat him,and Russel Crowe plays Hackman's former protégé who gives up his evil ways to pursue God's word.Raimi out does himself with fun camera work,and the story pulls you in,an entertaining B movie.</fullReview>

In some ways, this role was related to his "Little Bill" character in "Unforgiven". Someone with a strangle-hold on power in the town, and murderous in his methods to keep it. He seems to relish the role, and that pretty much makes the movie work.Sharon Stone is occasionally hilarious as a gorgeous, blond, female gunslinger, whose eyes get a workout checking everybody and everything out. But everything in this movie seems to work. That's a testament to the terrific cast. They, obviously, seem to be having a good time making this film, and that shows in the finished product.Not exactly an award winner, but not a bad modern western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spaghetti Pastiche, Served Raimi Style........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the early 90's, the western genre saw something of a revival. DANCES WITH WOLVES won best picture in 1990, two years later the prize was claimed by the film UNFORGIVEN. Two versions of the Tombstone legend were produced at about the same time, TOMBSTONE (1993) and Wyatt Earp (1994), which varied greatly in tone and success. The trend was towards a revised, and, for the most part, more honest form of storytelling. UNFORGIVEN, Clint Eastwood's bleak masterpiece, attempted to dispel the stereotypes of the "old west" and bring to the screen a gritty and realistic portrait of violent people during hard times. This was not a new idea by any means (see Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH), but it was especially pointed coming from Eastwood who, thirty some odd years earlier, became an icon as the ambiguous central character in Sergio Leone's DOLLARS trilogy. It is the style of Leone's "spaghetti western" that Sam Raimi seems to take as inspiration for his 1995 film THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. Raimi, at this point, had developed his own style of film making (THE EVIL DEAD films, DARKMAN) and the resulting integration of Leone's ideals results in some of the most satisfying moments in THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. It is also a film that embraces the western clichés, becoming more of a homage to previous cinematic renderings of the time period, which it relies on heavily. This is evident during the opening credits sequence where we see images of the prototypical western (buried gold, dusty landscapes, a graveyard) which sets the tone. Into the town of Redemption rides The Lady (Sharon Stone), who, drawn by revenge, enters the quick-draw competition that is held by the resident warlord named John Herod (Gene Hackman). The contest (and the prize money attached) draws a colorful array of supporting characters: Ace Hanlon (Lance Henriksen), Scars (Mark Boone Junior), Spotted Horse (Jonothan Gill); a hired gun named Clay Cantrell (Keith David); Dog Kelly (Tobin Bell), who has his own score to settle, and The Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is a local with strong ties to the town. Herod has also brought Cort (Russell Crowe), a former member of Herod's gang turned preacher, to the event as an unwilling participant. What follows is a protracted series of gunfights, most timed to the strike of a giant clock which serves as a passing bell for the fallen contestants. Theses scenes represent the more entertaining elements of THE QUICK AND THE DEAD: swirling extreme camera angles, fast wide-angle pullbacks, bullet P.O.V. setups; at one point the camera looks straight through a hole in a character's head. The best and, oddly, the earliest major showdown, which occurs between Herod and Ace Hanlon, is the high point of the film. After the final revelation, and ensuing (illogical) climax, the viewer is, however, left with a slick package but very little content.There are moments of development: Observe the scene where, after his daughter has been raped by one of the duelists (Kevin Conway), the barkeep (Pat Hingle) reaches for the man's gun, hesitates, then goes about his business; or the way Herod's hand shakes before one of the gunfights. But in a word, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD is about style. Raimi's vision for the film is helped considerably by several contributors: The cinematography, by Dante Spinotti, captures the dust, rain and the setting sun perfectly. Spinotti also remains flexible, adding his own mark to many of Raimi's outrageous techniques. Alan Silvestri, taking his cue from Ennio Morricone, fashions a score replete with whip cracks, trumpets and flamenco guitar. His work during the gunfight montage is particularly noteworthy. Pietro Scalia's editing (which must have been laborious considering the amount of cuts) and Patrizia von Brandenstein's production design add another level of depth to the story.Gene Hackman can play a character like Herod in his sleep by now, and the film relies on Hackman's persona to backstop a character with limited screen time. He is one of the few actors that can handle a line like "...you better scuttle your butt out of town..." and retain a level of humor and menace. As Cort, Russell Crowe (in a very early American film role) also goes a long way with his conflicted preacher in a short period of time. The weakest link is Sharon Stone. Her character is wildly uneven; tough as nails one second, the next, weeping like a child. In all fairness the writing does not help the situation, placing, as it does, almost all of the film's emotional conflict on Stone's shoulders. It would be a hard part to play for anyone, but her performance is disjointed and she delivers many of her scenes far to straight (gender lines aside, an actor like Hackman would have internalized some of the melodrama). The supporting cast, filled in by many wonderful character actors, end up being nothing more than colorful cardboard targets. On a whole, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD does not live up to its lofty influences, but if the you chose to gloss over the film's weaker points, it is an mildly entertaining production in the mold of the western matinée. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 5 Westerns of Moderm Time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Unforgiven, Tombstone, Young Guns and Young Guns II, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD is one of the top 5 modern Westerns, in my opinion.It stars Sharon Stone as Lady, the mysterious woman who rides into town to avenge her father's (Gary Sinise, in flashbacks) death at the hands of the ruthless John Herrod (a perfectly cast Gene Hackman), the man who runs the town and ruins it at the same time. Add into the mix a pre-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio (Stone reportedly gave a portion of her salary up so he could be in it) and a pre-Oscars-winning Russell Crowe in his breakout American role, as Herrod's son and the outlaw-turned-preacher who is forced to fight to the death in a gunslinger tournament.Lots of people don't understand the movie. Some say "Oh, man, he got shot and DAYLIGHT IS GOING THROUGH HIS BODY!" It's a convention Sam Raimi uses. The movie wasn't going for an Oscar. What it was going for was a cool modern Western, and what describes Westerns better than gunslingers, booze, fights at a poker game, and vengeance?Check this movie out one day. Very cool movie, and is worth renting just to see Crowe's performance.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flashy but flimsy western tries for fantasy-mythic feel but never quite achieves its ambitions. Sharon Stone plays mysterious lady gunslinger who signs up for dueling contest in a tumbleweed town once she discovers her mortal nemesis is involved, the mangy varmint who was instrumental in killing her sheriff father. Spirited, but shallow, artistically-wayward western with tongue-in-cheek. It has some silly flash and sass, but it isn't involving, nor do any of the players (a jaw-dropper of a cast which includes Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Gary Sinise) come off looking especially good. Director Sam Raimi sets up some visually amazing shots--but without honest, gritty characters, it's not much more than a live-action cartoon. Stone is flippant and sexy, but she's just relying on her proved shtick and it quickly wears thin. ** from ****</fullReview>

The director's efforts to generate dramatic tension fail entirely. As you would expect, all of the main characters are still there until the final showdown. On the positive side, there is some clever camera work, and I was pleasantly surprised by Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of the cocky illegitimate son of Herod, trying to earn the respect his father would never give him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-crafted, mildly campy Western adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead is one of those films that me and my girlfriends set out to watch one night in 1997, when we were all hopelessly smitten with heartthrob Leonardo Dicaprio from having seen Titanic earlier that year. We watched it only for him which was both a foolish and smart thing to do. For one, Leonardo is not in this film for very long but on the other hand, it was a very entertaining Western even without his presence. In fact, looking back at it, I'm thankful that annoying overemoting brat didn't have a bigger part.The biggest part in the film is actually given to Sharon Stone, who plays something of a female Clint Eastwood -- a rough gunslinger who seeks revenge on her father's killer in dirty depressing little Western town where he runs everything. This place, its inhabitants and above all its gunfighting competition are so corrupt that it demands reform, and this is where the, for ONCE, superbly sexy Russel Crowe comes in as Cort, the preacher who is forced to turn back to his violent ways. Sound clichéd enough for a Western plot? This film will surprise you with a little more depth, a few extra story lines and a lot more fun.The Quick and the Dead is well-crafted campy Western fun, but it is cleverly disguised as an action-drama so the dialogue is kept reasonable, the violence realistic and the worst of clichés to a minimum. This means you probably won't be able to laugh at it for sheer camp -- only smile and enjoy its Western clichés and awesome gunfighting duels. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film; it delivers on every level for what it sets out to do and it does so with edge and style.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Upon a Time in the Ripped-off West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good: Interesting visuals and a great western town set. Plus Russell Crowe gives a capable early performance in a two dimensional role.The Bad: Gene Hackman is still stuck in Big Whiskey playing Little Bill Daggett. The story, an antithesis of Unforgiven's thoughtful study of the consequences of gunplay and the blowhard 'legends' born of it, doesn't amount to much more than a circle jerk for pro gun enthusiasts. I guess in the wake of Unforgiven it was inevitable Hollywood would restore the bullcrap mythology of the the old west and make guns and killing cool again. But the narrative here is weak and the presentation exceptionally cartoonish, and the less than subtle derivations from High Noon to Sergio Leone transcend homage, landing squarely in uninspired rip-off territory. The flashback revelation especially is so derivative of Once Upon a Time in the West you expect the camera to pull back from Stone's and Hackman's eyes to reveal Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson squaring off. It's all only fitting somehow though seeing how Once Upon a Time in the West was itself a rip-off of a dozen or so Hollywood westerns of the 40's and 50's.The Ugly: Sharon Stone and Leonardo DiCaprio make this film nearly unwatchable. If either can act there is no evidence of it here. Stone is pathetic in her tight leather pants and over-the-top duster, trying too hard to ape Clint Eastwood's cool while she swaggers about and snarls some appallingly dull one-liners. DiCaprio is the most annoying and unbelievable element of the piece though, his babyish voice and overdone cockiness just have you cheering for him to bite the dust long before he actually does. This guy is one terrible actor and I'm unanimous in that.Barely worth a look for its good points, this flick is mostly junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Western with good idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is about a quick-draw contest in a small western town run by a gunslinger named John Herod(Gene Hackman). The Lady(Sharon Stone), The Kid(Leonardo DiCaprio), and a retired gunslinger by the name of Cort(Russel Crowe) are all contestants against each other, greedy idiots, and John Herod who has surprisingly signed himself up for the tournament.The movie is very entertaining and fast paced. The acting is above-average, the writing is decent, but the idea of this quick-contest in a small town was just a great idea. Its very fresh and original. I enjoyed the movie although it wasn't done amazingly well. Overall, its an exciting movie and is just a fun movie.I recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring Western that is all style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to watch Sam Raimi masturbating with cameras, lenses, cranes and dollies for ninety plus minutes, you'll love "The Quick and the Dead". If the film was ten minutes long, it'd be fun, but because it's feature length, it's boring. Hackman doesn't disappoint or surprise and Sharon Stone, coming off "Basic Instinct", looks sexy with a gun and behaves like furniture thanks to her criminally underwritten role. Raimi has fun shooting holes in people that, via special effects magic, we can then see through, and he uses every trick in the book to pretty up what is a terrible, been-there-done-that plot that he knew would totally die if presented conservatively. He finally got story and style working together in "Spiderman" and consolidated his more educated vision in "Spiderman 2", so "The Quick and The Dead" is the tombstone that marked the end of the second chapter of his ascension to A-list status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Every couple years, somebody takes another whack at bettering the post postmodern western, or whatever they think the champion is. A common and to my mindsimpleminded strategy is to simplify and exaggerate around one component of the genre, here the quickdraw showdown. This is in fact an element of the myth of the west that is wholly fictitious.Gene Hackman had already done an excessive bit for Eastman's more nuanced entry into this contest. He reprises it here. Raimi is one of the more superficial "artsy" directors. He and "I'm really a genius" Sharon Stone are well matched for this.I have no complaint with cinematic excess. I think "Last Man Standing" is something of a masterpiece in this subgenre. What I hate is sheer stupidity. This is blunt and stupid. It should be shot.Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- you can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, Sam Raimi is a very original director. "Army of Darkness" and "Darkman" are personal favorites of mine. But this is simply a depressing movie experience. Stone seems as if she's having no fun whatsoever, and Hackman is basically a carbon copy of his masterful work in "Unforgiven", clearly a much better western. Definitely one of the worst, if not the worst movie of 1995.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing this movie has caused me to review Sam Raimi's work, the style of the director, the personality that is left on the celluloid.. this is what I came up with Sam is a prankster. If it wasn't evident on the Spidey pics later on it's obvious here. Let's look at the evidence:Gene Hackman is The bad guy.Sharon Stone is a gun-slinger. The film actually revolves around Sharon's character - a hardened (well, kind of) vigilante bent on revenge. But I say "a" because the central characters all are.Laughing yet?Leo de Caprio is a smart-mouthed son-of-a-gun.. well that is basically Leo in all his movies but it is still funny here. I can see Sam's eyes twinkle just in the casting.Russell Crowe.. former gun-slinger turned priest who just can't help himself.The plot is about as believable as the Evil Dead. Invitations are sent out to the four winds to round-up all the gun-slingers for a winner takes all contest which allows for a contained experiment in craziness at least equal to any of Sam's other flicks. No attempt at authenticity. This is not really a western. Don't be fooled.The sequences give Sam away: - man gets shot in the head, the back of his head's blown off. - another man gets shot in the eye and does a back-flip with his head as the pivot point. That same man, incidentally, has a clean bullet hole put through his chest and stands there debating whether to fire back with day-light showing through the hole before he takes the head shot. - one man boasts that bullets can not kill him and does an Evil Dead before expiring.I'll give it to Sam though. This film Is entertaining and great eye-candy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet Western gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Gary Sinise, David Kieth, Leonardo DiCapio, Rusell Crowe head up a great western, one that has to be one of the best made made in the 1990's, right along side Tombstone.While the plot is very familiar to those fans of western fair, it does spin on a clever premise. This time, it's a woman out to avenge the death of her father at the hands of a ruthless gang, headed by Gene Hackman.Flash forward some 30 years or so, and Lady, as Sharon Stone's character is called, has returned to her home town, now living in fear of Hackman's crew, with Hackman now installed as the town's sheriff.Enter a one of a kind elimination tourney to find the fastest gunslinger. Quickly written out is Lance Henrikson's Ace, a quick shooter who eagerly claims other men's exploits as his own. Thinking that Ace is the hired gun that the town has hired to take him out. Instead of being afraid, Hackman's Harrod because even more ruthless, vowing to raise taxes, and even making threats to kill the entire population of the town.The late Roberts Blossom, the veteran actor, is the only one in town who really knows the identiy of Lady, and the reason she has returned to town.Leonardo DiCapio's character is one of the most complicated in the story, next to Crowe's Born again gunslinger. Harrod's son, he is the exact opposite of his ruthless evil father. While much the playboy, Kid is generally a likable character set to prove himself against his father, no matter what the cost.The climax is perfect for the setting, and it really shows what someone will goto, the lengths they will go to to get revenge in the name of family.Now this does contain some rather bloodless, but never the less graphic death scenes in any western in recent memory. The ending does not seem as clichéd as one would think, and you actually feel a sense of justice, old west style has been served. This movie is a definite must have for western fans in their movie collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't argue that "Quick and the Dead" should be considered one of the greats of the genre, but then it doesn't try to be; it's a tribute with it's own approach. It is also, perhaps, the most stylish western ever made! And there are a lot of stylish westerns out there. It was also made with respect and affection towards the genre. It's a fresh take that by all rights should've been more successful than it was and continues to be.Consider that it has a female protagonist. Already the film crosses new ground; suddenly the archetype character of the lone gunman is effectively turned on it's head. Also it's shot in a way that pays homage to westerns of the past, but gives the film a fresh, kinetic energy. Also, despite the number of gunfights, it never gets dull.If you're a fan of spaghetti Westerns, keep an eye out for it; you'll never see a better tribute to Leonne-style westerns than right here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stone may be a sharp-shooter. But this is Hackman's show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not much of a fan of Westerns, but I am a fan of Sam Raimi. The Quick and the Dead came at a time in Raimi's career when he started gravitating to slightly more mainstream fare. Before that, he was known more for fantasy and horror like the bizarre but entertaining Evil Dead films, and the quite extraordinary dark avenger film Darkman.But the Hollywood mainstream genre is not always something Raimi feels at home in. And his output in the mid to late 90s has been a little disappointing. First off was TQATD which was a box-office flop. Then he rebounded with the superb crime thriller A Simple Plan, his best film of the 90s. But then floundered with two hideously dull films For Love of the Game, and the surprisingly boring clairvoyant thriller The Gift, a film that had none of the pizazz of Raimi's earliest efforts. He then regained strength with the increasingly brilliant Spider-Man trilogy.And although TQATD was one of Raimi's less successful endeavours, its actually quite enjoyable. Raimi may have created one of the quirkiest Westerns ever made. Its filled with his trademark dizzying whip-pans and close-ups. And he infuses it with an appealing kinetic energy that helps the film gallop along at a cracking pace.Starring and co-producing, Sharon Stone is Ellen, the mysterious gunslinger who rides into the town of Redemption on a personal vendetta. She has an old score to settle with Herod (Gene Hackman on fine vindictive form), the villainous mayor of Redemption. He holds sway over the townspeople with an iron fist, and he has quite an ingenious method of rooting out his enemies.Every year, the town holds a tournament where the best gunfighters square off against one another for an enormous cash prize. But no one ever wins. Because Herod is the fastest gun in Redemption. And he can out-draw anyone. Ellen intends to change that. So the gunfighters sign up. Including Herod's son, the Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio), and a former outlaw turned preacher, Cort (a pre-stardom Russell Crowe).Although TQATD is quite slim plot-wise, its a bit hard not to get carried away by the film. The eclectic cast goes some way towards making the film more enjoyable than it should be. Its nice to see Sharon Stone trying to shake typecasting as a sex symbol. In fact I never thought it possible that someone as beautiful as Sharon Stone could look so weatherbeaten, but it seems it is. Even so, she is an actress with a limited range, and her stolid performance is a fundamental flaw that works against the film.Everyone else in the cast looks like they're having a grand old time. But Stone walks around the set trying to sap the fun out of every scene. And as such, its difficult to root for her as a heroine. Even a burned out wreck like Sigourney Weaver's Ripley had a wry sense of humour.Its in the supporting cast where we get some vitality. Gene Hackman steals the film right out from under everyone else as the monstrous Herod. He's clearly having a ball as the lord and master of Redemption. He shoots people with nary a glance. And he loves antagonising Cort.Cort used to ride with Herod's gang of outlaws, but changed his ways and became a preacher. Herod loves making an example of him, putting him on public display, trying to get him to embrace his dark side. Those scenes are reminiscent of Darkman, about another inherently decent man who found himself giving in to his destructive urges.Russell Crowe spends most of the film chained up and dragged along saloon floors and dirt, but its a quietly intense performance on his part. And he knows his way around a shooting iron.And then there's Leonardo DiCaprio as the Kid. DiCaprio is an actor who tends to do best when his enthusiasm and cocky charisma is really allowed to shine. And the slick, trigger-happy Kid is a character perfectly suited to his acting style. He's a real sharp-shooter, who fires off wisecracks just as hard and fast. Although I think his character arc could have done without the subplot about wanting to prove himself to his old man. It makes his death a little odd, and even unintentionally mawkish.But there are other pleasures to be found in the wonderful variations Raimi gets out of the different gunfights. There's some amazing camera angles, like a POV shot through a bullet wound. There are too many to recall, but its a constant source of interest what Raimi will cook up next. And the musical score from Alan Silvestri recalls many a Spaghetti Western.Good ending too with the exploding clock tower, the haunting flashback into Ellen's past, and Herod's last stand. The Quick and the Dead will never be a classic like some other Westerns, but I found it a lot of fun, a nice change of pace for Sam Raimi, and a reaffirmation of why Gene Hackman is one of the finest actors in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it possible to improve on perfection?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, not really, but this is a great Saturday afternoon escape and the film that actually made me enjoy Leo DiCaprio as an actor and give some of his other films a shot after the whole Romeo &amp; Juliet/Titanic "heartthrob" garbage I had to endure in high school. Really, Leo's character is the most likable in the film and Sharon Stone gives a solid performance along with an early gem from Russell Crowe. Really, I see some of the criticisms of the actors (Sharon Stone is "Going through the motions" bluh blah bluh) and it's like, you've obviously never studied character development. If you'd gone through what her character, Ellen, does, as a small child, you'd be a bit wooden and kind of going through the motions. They didn't exactly have psychologists, Prozac, and the assortment of other goodies people today use to get by in the Old West. All in all, I say spot on, and I love this film. If you've seen the way I rate films, you'll know it takes a lot to squeeze anything over a 5 out of me. I'd much rather write an amusing review of a film's points toward "steaming pile of excrement" But sadly, only great things to say. Anything Raimi touches is pretty much gold, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a western film from director Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead, Spider-Man), this is quite good. Sharon Stone plays Ellen "The Lady", a female cowboy visiting the town called Redemption for a particular reason. Later on, you find out she accidentally killed her father, and she can think of only one person to blame for making her do it, the horrible John Herod (Gene Hackman). Herod is a cowboy who is best known as never losing any showdowns when one is set, and this is the main theme of the film besides her revenge, a shooting competition. Also in the competition are prisoner Cort (Russell Crowe), who originally said he won't fight, and Herrod's son, Fee "The Kid" (Leonardo DiCaprio), who has some of the fastest hands in the west. Also starring Saw's Tobin Bell as Dog Kelly, Roberts Blossom as Doc Wallace, Kevin Conway as Eugene Dred, Volcano's Keith David as Sgt. Clay Cantrell, Lance Henriksen as Ace Hanlon, Batman's Pat Hingle as Horace and Gary Sinise as The Marshal. The cast is good, the action is cool, and the western genre seems to still create watchable films like this. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Raimi Review, how droll...I guess you could call this 'A Bridge Too Far' for the Western. Stone plays Eastwood from "Outlaw Josey Wales" and Wallach from "Good, Bad, and Ugly" rolled into one, Hackman plays himself, Crowe is an obscure Leone character, and Henriksen is the grand old Western scoundrel. This isn't Unforgiven, it is much thinner.Perhaps this is the zenith of Raimi's career. Here he repeatedly tries to top himself with one visual piece or montage after another. Of course, it's all to mask the silly script.This is like Raiders of the Lost Ark in that it is a technical film and nothing more. No talent is showcased on the acting list, only those in the sound, effects, property, editing, and cinematography departments. It is a half-step better than Tombstone though and certainly superior to Kevin Costner's abominations to the genre.There are three kinds of directors. There are those who start with a concise vision of their work and lose it over time (e.g. John Singleton). There are those who retain their vision over their lifetime and only marginally improve as they go (e.g. Steven Spielberg). Then there are those who start clueless and eventually find their calling (e.g. John Woo). Raimi falls into the first category for me since after this movie he has lost a lot of his innovative power in exchange for bigger paychecks like Spider-Man. Will this mean we'll get to see an "all-out" Evil Dead 4?Overall, dumb movie with interesting visual qualities. Typical Raimi but with some better acting this time and no need to balance two genres like in his earlier work. 3 out of 5.</fullReview>

The worst performance gives DiCaprio who is so F***ING ANNOYING , that you wish him dead . Stone is kinda unconvincing in the main role . She's too delicate , not too tough as the role requires. The movie suffers from the fact that it is too serious for it's own good and not too much fun as it wants to be. I think that the story they got here deserved a serious movie . Serious western . Unfortunately , Raimi decided to do a pastiche . It was a wrong move , because there isn't too much fun moments here . The movie lacks heart , despite some real potential . Raimi never allows the viewer to take his moment seriously , so all the serious moments are emotionally flat and wasted . In the end what we've got here is a unconvincing pastiche that isn't too much interesting . It's not a bad movie , but in other hands it could be a classic western movie.I give it 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure if this is a "spoiler." If so, I apologize, but you have been put on guard.It's bad enough that Hollywood perpetuates the myth of the wild west gunfight with two characters, one in a white hat, the other in a black, meeting at high noon for a quick draw contest to the death. In fact this sort of thing rarely happened. If two men with a "reputation" happened into the same town at the same time they generally went out of their way to avoid each other. Now we are to believe that a large sum of money (much of it contributed by a corporation) is offered for a "single elimination" gunfight contest. I realize that this is fiction, but c'mon! The dialog is ludicrous, the gunfights ridiculously staged, the ending beyond belief, and the characters are cartoonish cardboard cutouts. A marvelous cast is wasted. With offerings like this it's small wonder that the public no longer flocks to westerns.</fullReview>

If this movie had been even vaguely successful satire or even self-satire, I probably would have loved it. But no, it just rambled on pointlessly, as though it was SUPPOSED to be satirical.We saw it on the plane on the way home from Istanbul. My non-English-speaking Georgian friend, a major film buff, seemed absolutely entranced by it. I tried to get some sleep, but it was just too naggingly insistent visually (which is, of course, exactly what made The Evil Dead so compelling)--even through the blindfold! I tried plugging in the earphones for a while, but that just made it worse. Turns out Zaza was not so much entranced as stupefied. At the end he turned to me and, before I could say a word, told me it was the absolute stupidest film he'd seen in his whole life. I could only agree.

		<shortDescription>Funny, but not in the way Sam Raimi would've hoped.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sharon Stone does the Clint Eastwood Stranger-with-no-name thing, and is even worse than he is. At least "The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly" had intentional laughs. No one here seems in on the joke, except maybe Leonardo Di Caprio as The Kid, and in a brief cameo, Raimi regular Bruce Campbell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An idiotic and clichéd western; Boring and stupid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie during the first week when it was released into the theaters in the USA. I honestly did not know what to except from it because I have never seen a Western with Sharon Stone. I believed that it may had been an interesting movie, but I was sorely disappointed. This was also the first time that I saw Russel Crow in a supporting role that I think was his first appearance in a United State's movie production in 1995. To continue, I believe that even the concept for this movie was absurd and idiotic! I had seen many Western shoot outs, but nothing like the ones depicted in this movie. In the end came the ultimate Western cliché as Sharon Stone conquers the best draw in town to avenge the death of her brother by the ruthless gangster whom she came to face off and kill in the ultimate showdown. I had watched and agonized over this idiotic and stupid movie over and hour and a half, only to walk out of the theater with disgust and having wasted my money and time on it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Quick and the DeadDisappointingly mediocre story about a gunfighting legend (Sharon Stone) who ventures back to her home town to face the corrupt sheriff (Gene Hackman) who murdered her daddy (Gary Sinise in a brief cameo). The movie is directed by Sam Raimi ("Spider-Man"), but it fails to come across as anything more than a modern-day cowboy story, complete with fast camera cuts and stylistic shootout tricks. Not really anything special, despite the fact that it could have been amazing. This was Russell Crowe's first mainstream motion picture, and Stone wanted Leonardo DiCaprio in the film so much that she decided to put some of her own paycheck towards his to get him aboard for the project. He must have felt like the king of the world.** 1/2 out of *****</fullReview>
