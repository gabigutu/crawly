		<shortDescription>Consider its budget!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a small budget production, this script was way over the number of pages you usually see. It had a plot, characters, ideas, good execution, good actors.One of my favorites is Lance Henriksen, I simply adore the man. From his sci fi early work to the horror side he adopted lately, he is just great to see on the screen. One of the most underrated actors in my honest opinion. And about the movie: you'll pretty much see full on action. A lot of gun power, some small hand to hand combats, and plenty of blood. Not gore, but blood. You'll see humanity, monsters, light and dark. It is a movie that will keep you going for sure. If you're into horror, or zombies and you wanna pass some time, this is a better way to do so. Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really enjoyed William Kaufman's and Johnny Strong's last outing together in Sinners and Saints back in 2010. That's also the last time Johnny Strong had been on screen except a small short in-between. I wish I could see Johnny Strong do more movies as he normally does quite well Sinners and Saints was a great action flick and I enjoyed Daylight's End just as much.This movie had a lot of what I like, post apocalyptic setting, lot's of action, some Sci-fi mixed in. This was a good movie for what it was. I see many people saying it's good for a low budget flick while that's true, I have also seen many big budget movies that were really bad. If you have a pretty good script like this and some OK actors and actresses, even on a small budget it can be very enjoyable. That's just what this movie is a good way to spend a few hours. Sure it's not earth shattering but we did enjoy it for the few hours we watched it.So go in with an open mind and don't expect the world and you might just come out having enjoyed this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Zombie Apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A zombie apocalypse is never a good thing. A movie with that as a theme in it though, can be a really nice thrill ride. So while this may not be the best movie about this ever, it is more than a decent effort. We get the same guy who played the main character in another Kaufmann movie (Saints&amp;Sinners) and gets to shine here again.Though he is not getting as much attention here, because of the role itself, the action is very well shot. There are clichés abound of course that may weigh down the impact of the movie or the characters fate for some watching. But you should be aware of that. Overall it's nicely done for a small budget movie and one that still manages to have some style ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like full throttle action sequences set in a Richard Matheson world, then "Daylight's End" is the film for you. Lucked into seeing this film at the Dallas International Film Festival last night and was highly impressed. I don't normally jump at horror films...but I did last night...10 times. Thanks to Will Kaufman and company my wife will now be mercilessly mocking me for months.The gun battles are epic and blow away most studio films. I would liken the gun play to being as cool as John Wick. You can tell their combat coordinator knows his stuff. All in all, this is a very fun movie and definitely worth the watch. One of Henriksen's coolest films in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action and horror flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an indie movie but it doesn't feel like an indie movie. It felt like the original Mad Max or 28 Days Later! Great action scenes and lots of quick scare shots.Johnny Strong (Fast and the Furious, Black Hawk Down) delivers a great performance along with Lance Henriksen (Aliens, Aliens 3, Terminator). The movie was directed by William Kauffman. He is a killer indie director that makes some great action films with limited budgets. Don't know how he pulls it off. Can't wait till he gets a real Hollywood budget. Chad Law wrote the script. They both did Sinners and Saints, which was another good movie.Johnny Strong did the soundtrack to the film and it is really good!The movie was filmed entirely in Texas. If you live in Dallas, you may recognize a few areas. I was surprised to find out that the movie was shot in Dallas at the old Police Station. It is in the same building the Lee Harvey Oswald was shot in. The sets and environments were awesome and made you feel like you were in the post apocalyptic world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imo this movie certainly deserve more than 5.Yes, it looks cheap in many places but it also has redeeming qualities. Basically, everything that comes out of this movie is never very good and in some instances it is really lacking, but overall it is enjoyable.The characters are very numerous and we don't get to know them very well. They will mostly stay complete strangers to the audience until the end. Even the main protagonist is that way. But on the other hand, they aren't ''flat'',''idiotic'',''generic'' characters (minus the ''BADASS'' hero), they still have decent lines and interactions among each others.The camera quality though suffers from the low-budget thingy and gives that cheap impression to the movie. While the set is decent&gt;good, the costumes are very authentic, same for the makeup, and the casting (when it comes to visual). Just to explain my thoughts on that, there is a pattern in recent movie where every character is a teenager, with a stupid makeup and a stupid face (I am sure its about makeup and light), a good case is the recent Warcraft.I do think that the plot is sometimes inconsistent, and that they chose to film some scenes just for the sake of having those scenes in the final cut. Worst, the same is true for some characters: there is clearly one character that is just there to make one scene happens and that afterward becomes completely useless; that can probably be true in other movies, but here it is quite shocking in the sense that everything might indicates that this characters is important or will become important later on. Which never happens, it's just a filler.My review might look ''weak'' because it doesn't manage to underline the inner qualities or deficiencies of the movie, but it is only because the movie is that way. There is nothing really shiny about it, and although it has deficiencies in certain areas, I still think that it provides for an overall agreeable watch. Despite its faults there is a sense of authenticity that helps build intensity. I have to say, the final-final scene also made me sweat, which doesn't happen so much to me in other movies.I wish they had a better writer for the characters and plot development, otherwise they still have a decent man capable of taking care of the ambiances&amp;atmosphere; the general ideas are there, it's just that tiny bit of execution and cleverness that is lacking.To summarize + Costumes/guns/(visual)casting + Intensity + Gunfights ain't bad - Gunfights sometimes feel a bit repetitive and sometimes idiotic - this cheap ''look'' of the camera - some inconsistencies in the plot or some scenes (but that would require spoilers to elaborate) - characters development really lacking</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chelsea Edmundson, who plays Sam, does an undeniable job portraying the persistent leading lady, eager to fight for all. Her affectionate concern, along with that tough need to survive, makes this attractive leading lady even more interesting. Thomas Rourke (Johnny Strong) is that quietly bold soul that effectively makes the audience want more of his story. Even though I adore a hidden and somewhat romantic side of any story, I appreciate even more, the action leading to a short and surprising reveal. Mr. Strong does just this! All characters exemplified the training and knowledge of how to operate a weapon, as if this was indeed a way of life for them now. The frenzied storm of energy and firearms stayed constant, and the dramatic feud between the devising characters only added to the crisis. As with many films, there sometimes is that surprising unfortunate loss; sadly, it usually would be those characters that could reprise a most beneficial role. I almost want to hate Chad Law for including those downfalls! I believe Mr. Strong made the movie even more appreciable, with his effective score arrangement. This was not a James Horner Celtic, or a John Williams Jurassic Park composition, however I would say that the adaptation, although sometimes toting the line of loud, was certainly apocalyptically fitting. Well done Mr. Strong. I can't leave off the shameless comic relief Drew (Gary Cairns) brings to the film, as well as the sincerity of, and agreeably looking, Ethan (Louis Mandylor). All of this, along with iconic Lance Henriksen, makes for a well-shaped action flick. I feel that William Kaufman did a fine job making these words become human. This is surely a fun movie night for any zombie/vampire/apocalypse enthusiast!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess I came to Daylights End with very limited expectations. I was then surprised at how easily and seamlessly, it exceeded all of them. This is a very good film. Its intelligently written, with a implausibility plausible premise and down to earth, honest characterizations, that lend this film a certain maturity. It reminiscent of films like 28 Days Later and whilst it has a B budget, still manages to hand in an A grade performance. The action scenes, in particular, are "polished". Clearly a lot of work went into the run and gun scenes and I suspect, a military expert was used to lend the whole thing an air of realism. Just as surprising is the quality of acting. Pretty much everyone from Lance Henrikson, Johnny Strong and the rest of the cast hand in decent performances. Its remarkable how much can be done with so little, whilst deep pockets Hollywood often achieves so little, with so much. Well shot, acted and directed, with a convincing story, that's very entertaining. Eight out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch a ton of independent horror/action films and this is one of my favorite for sure. I've been a huge fan of William Kaufman since I saw his first movie The Prodigy and his film Sinners and Saints is another favorite that I've added to my collection. Daylight's End has now moved to the top of that list and is another must own for me. It's action packed from the opening scene all the way until the end and I never got bored once while watching it. It's got some great jumps in it along with some cool shoot out sequences. If you like guns there are plenty here to enjoy. The production value, editing, acting, sound design, and music are all top notch. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes this genre. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very rarely does an action movie get the gun play right, but this one nails it! Great script, tactics and story! Johnny Strong knows what he's doing and William Kaufman brings it all together! This and Deadpool are definitely the best movies of the year! With pros like James Yeager and Sonny Puzikas this movie was destined to have amazing action. Veteran actor Lance gives another great performance as the police chief and Louis Mandylor also gives a great performance. Chad Law is quickly becoming my favorite writer in Hollywood and this scrips shows why. We have all seen zombie movies before, but with the vampiric twist they added to these creatures, it brings the fear back to the vampire that has been lost in recent moves. I have to give this movie a 10 for it has everything an Infantry veteran and horror fan could ask for!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to Atlanta showing and was amazed by the production. The plot line was awesome and I loved the take on the infected.The apocalyptic scenerio they presented was plausible, yet some parts they left a little vauge. I would of liked a little more clarifcation as to the cause of imfection, but that is not really important. I was of course the technical aspects of the fighting, gun play, and action scenes were outstanding. The run and gun was done with proper form and realistic effect. Problem many such movies is this is always messed up, not so James Yeager did a great job there, as did the other combatants. With budget this movie had i am very impressed they pulled off what they did. I would say this will be an instant cult classic.This is one video I can't wait to come out on DVD...IT will be added to my home library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've all seen zombie movies, but this is done differently. The character development is done with spot on acting and reactions. Lance Henriksen is excellent as the police captain trying to keep order in a decaying world. Johnny Strong's 'take no prisoners' approach to the role shows how hard it is to keep your humanity in war. He also produced a score that keeps you revved up and compliments the story without taking you out of it. If you enjoy graphic novels of this gene, I highly suggest watching this film. William Kauffman's direction of Chad Law's script will keep you watching from start to finish. There is no relaxation in this film. Will characters you like, or hate, survive?</fullReview>

The melding of different types of "monsters" to create a whole new creature was really interesting. I haven't enjoyed a post apocalypse movie this much in a long time. The action and suspense were really organic. The thrills were achieved through excellent directing, timing and editing. The acting was spot on. I'd like to see a sequel please!! I will definitively be looking for more from the writer and director. Of course everything is better with Lance Henrikson!! I highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fast paced zombie movie. Too bad the action is monotonous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I feel sorry for those zombies. Their life really is meaningless. A numb existence without any excitement or pleasure. No pleasant dinners at a favorite restaurant. No well-deserved vacation on a sunny beach. No sports or interesting hobbies. Their sole purpose is hunting uninfected fellow men. And when there's nobody left to hunt, the only thing they can do is standing idly somewhere, probably wondering what to do next. Dead boring in other words. The undead in "Daylight's End" have an additional problem. They hate sunlight. Much like the creatures in "I'm Legend". The only difference with the latter film is that you knew how the misery began. In this movie the filmmakers keep you dangling.Nowadays it's pretty hard to come up with an original zombie movie, since the market is flooded with this genre. Here they tried to give a different twist to this sub-genre by giving the bloodthirsty creatures characteristics of a vampire. That's immediately demonstrated in the opening scene when Rourke (Johnny Strong) finds an undead hiding in a freezer. In no time it's being reduced by Rourke into a smoldering barbecue sausage.Rourke is a loner who travels across the U.S. as a kind of Mad Max in his armored Plymouth, equipped with a complete arsenal of firearms. His only goal in life is to eliminate as much murderous mutated persons as possible. As gunmen did in the Wild West, he keeps track of the score by carving notches in the butt of his rifle with his immense dagger. The not so talkative Rourke looks ultra-cool and mega-efficiently. The controlled way of attacking, the calm look, always a well thought out answer and always using a targeted plan to take revenge on the creatures responsible for the death of his wife. All this makes him the ultimate anti-hero.Although this is a low-budget film, at times the images used aren't inferior to those of some blockbusters. By contrast, the acting level of some equals that of an actor in an ordinary television program. Luckily Lance Henriksen's contribution was significantly better than that in "Harbinger Down". And what a surprise. You'll also be witnessing some stupid decisions. Obviously this is necessary in this genre of films. Otherwise nothing significantly would happen. Is there a positive side to this film? Yep of course. It's generously filled with action and swift, fierce confrontations. When Rourke joins a group of survivors, ex-policemen who barricaded themselves in a police station in downtown Dallas, and tries to fend off the daily attacks by zombies, a seemingly infinite number of battle scenes are presented. And it's also hard to keep track of the number of head shots.And that was the biggest let down for me. After 15 minutes, the course of a confrontation was quite predictable and a bit trite. Over and over again a significant number of zombies are gunned down by a hail of bullets but they still managed to grab a poor soul every time. Oddly enough Rourke failed to hit the big leader despite his skills as a shooter. And skills he has! His precision is masterly and time after time again it's breathtaking to see how an opponent ends up with a gaping bullet wound right in the middle of the forehead. After seeing the head size off the end boss, it's hard to believe he could miss that. "Daylight's end" won't show anything new. It's an action-packed horror and the frantic pace makes sure you won't get bored eventually.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of this genre. There's not much new ground broken here, but the movie is fun and very professionally done. A lot of new apocalyptic movies look cheap and this one does not. The action is very well done and the scenes are very intense. The scenes with guns are all very exceptionally done. The character development is weak however, except for the antagonist, who is very interesting. There is very little reason to connect to, or to care about, the good guys though. I see a lot of inflated reviews here, so I registered to say that the movie is actually pretty good, but not as great as early reviews here led me to believe. I think this is worth the "price of admission," but only on a slow night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good enough home action movie, but falls apart at the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decent enough a action movie to be entertaining for an hour or two. A lone wolf whom the filmmakers want us to believe a badass makes his way through a zombie apocalypse city. He is taken in by a group of survivors holed up in a police station prison. They have security cameras, alarms, steel door, and cells to lock themselves in if things go to hell. The plan is to assault the hotel where the zombies vampires and their alpha master are hiding (sound familiar, I am legend). The action scenes are OK as a run n gun but stupid characters.For instance, a guy has to put a bomb on the other side of a sleeping horde and walks through the middle instead of around, then gets to the other end virtually waves to the others "hallo!!" And fails to see the monster obviously not hiding well at all right behind him. OK fine whatever we'll just pretend the Munster was invisible.The movie has some parts it tries to be emotional or sentimental, right before the final action scene. This scene is like the downtime of any movie but could have been longer for adequate toilet break.Now **possible spoilers** the movie falls apart during the final fight scene happens to be the last stand when the plan fails, which happens inside the survivors stronghold, which remember is a cop shop with lock up prison. They use tactics for 30seconds then just run for it. Not once did any of them close a prison gate to lock in/out zombies for shooting gallery. Apart from that one broom closet door. So lock all the kids in one cell when bringing in the main character at the start but don't use any locking gates for protecting at the final fight wen they know the zombies are coming, but use a phone to lure them to the leader. It just ruined the an already half-crap movie. I say half-crap because it's only half crap. As stereotypical - the black guy gets overrun by zombies first in a stupidly predictable way, but not before the stupid guy.Not much in the way of bad movie laughs. I would've better enjoyed my time watching the last parts of twister on TV with ads. Worth a look on 1$ DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another low budget production with an atrocious script. The whole thing is just a collection of boring action scenes with very little in-between. Forget about a good story, forget about characters that you care about, forget about nice scenery. You'll be staring at a brick wall, a prison cell or a dirty street. That's it. The "horde" of zombies consists of 15 people. They don't even bother to change their clothes, so you'll be seeing a lot of the same people playing as various different zombies. It's not obvious at first but it becomes pretty evident by the end of the movie. This could have been much better with a good script. The first ten minutes are the best part of the whole thing but don't get fooled, the rest of the movie is complete and utter trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of fake reviews which is plain to see and an all too common event here on IMDb. Lol about time they realized that opening an account, reviewing one movie and giving it a massive big up only makes them look desperate.However one poster on the message board was shot down for mentioning I am Legend, but he was correct to mention it as it was the name of the book plus someone else said that I Am Legend was a copy of Omega Man making you think that was the original movie of the story from the book. but failed to mention Omega Man could be described as a copy of Last Man On Earth which was before Omega Man and also based on the I Am Legend Book.Some people need to move on and stop clinging to the past, when a movie gets old it doesn't always mean it is a classic. Some movies do stand the test of time granted but not all. Some just do not age well. The 1st/original isn't always the best as mentioned before Omega Man seems to be the one people mention rather than Last Man on Earth.IMHO Omega Man wasn't that special, just above average, as was this and the Asylum version I Am Omega which I thought was better than its IMDb rating by a long way, but when people see the name Asylum attached to a movie that automatically rate it down. Asylum do have a eye for making good zombie though;). The Z Nation series is a good and successful example. Season 1 of Z Nation I found more entertaining than season 5 of The Walking Dead.Anyway, I gave most of the movies mentioned above a similar rating of 6 with Last Man an average 5 and Legend was slightly better than the rest with a 7. Last Man on Earth seemed to drag like a 2 hour movie even though it was lest than 90 minutes.Yeah I know this isn't much of a review of the movie but it seems if anyone likes this movie they will always get shot down as being someone involved with it due to the dumb people involved with movies making blatantly biased reviews.I found the lead male actor was good when being bad ass, otherwise wasn't a very interesting character. The woman with the doll I think would of made a better lead female role. There was plenty of action, some nice infected people make-up but story could of been expanded and less based around one area. Had a promising start, a decent mid story which wasn't really followed to it's maximum and a bit of a lame ending.Would of been nice to see a flash back or a mention of how it all started too but over all I have seen a lot worse with a lot higher budget and this is one of the better ones in this genre. But yeah still just above average overall.Last Man on Earth 5/10 (IMDb 7/10). The Omega Man 6/10 (IMDb 6.6/10). I Am Legend 7/10 (IMDb 7.2/10). I Am Omega 6/10 (IMDb 3.3/10). Daylight's End 6/10 (IMDb 5.5/10). I Am Legend 2 (Now known as Untitled I Am Legend Reboot ?/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny is a bada**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start out by saying Johnny Strong is so HOT!!! I saw this film at late night showing at the Dallas International film festival. A lot of jumps, kept me at the edge of my seat. Being a southern girl that loves my guns, I appreciated the way that these actors handled them. I have seen so many films where the actors don't know sh*t about them. Clearly, they knew what they were doing. I am a huge fan of the show we love "The Walking Dead." There are so many zombie- ish movies and most don't even come close. This one did it for me!! I gave it 8 stars because I wished I knew more about Johnny's history before the plaque hit. They showed snippets but I wish there had been more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a low budget film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually movies like this and budget like this I would typically rate them at around 3-5. Yes the movie had some flaws like the guy that drove on an alley and getting himself trapped, that's a big LOL.For for the most part the movie was non stop action from beginning to end and acting wasn't bad at all.For some who might question why build a colony in the middle of Dallas during a plague/apocalyptic times, while I supposed you've never been in situation where when trouble starts (I was born in some of the most troublesome part of the world), majority of times, you' be stuck near your home/work/etc ...and have no time to travel far, but I know one thing, when you've built up a defense of some sort, you'll probably end up staying there, like the survivors on this film and what better place to be holed up in than a prison?!I just watch it as it is, and it surprised me as a better than expected movie, it doesn't have a high budget like I am Legend, but it's worth the watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About the level of a average mad for TV movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was at the level of an average made for TV movie. The fact it had only one very known actor should have flagged this for me but i persisted on because of the average rating and the good review that i saw on IMDb however i failed to notice that the reviewer had scored it a 10. The movie was nicely shot but the story line was slow and their was not much character building. The movie is basically a rehash of every other similar plague movie i have seen but not in a good way. The film is instantly forgettable The ratings make you think its worth a watch but don't waste your time because you will want it back. If you want a better end of world movie there are tons to pick from</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and Suspenseful Sci-fi, action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daylight's End had good suspenseful action scenes that makes the viewer anticipate the next move. You almost can feel the suspense and intensity throughout most of the action scenes. The story line and plot were good and how they tied the main character and the main antagonist together. The struggle and conflict among the group with the main character brought out a certain tension throughout the film, that gives it different feeling from other zombie apocalyptic movies. But the action scenes and how they were focused and placed gave the movie a feeling of energy that complimented the scenes during the story. A good group of cast members worked together very well and showed good chemistry throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Kaufman Thrill ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope many get to see Will Kaufman's latest action thriller Daylight's End. It premiered recently at the Dallas International Film Festival to a sold out crowd.Set in a post apocalyptic world with Dallas as it's location, this thrill ride is not just "another zombie genre" flick. It is an edge of the seat kind of movie with suspense at every turn. The gun play, like most of Kaufman's other films, is nothing short of intense and extremely well researched and accurate. Not too often is such accuracy maintained with regard to weapons and usage.It was also great to see key Dallas landmarks used as backdrops and also the Baker Hotel as well. As both of these structures is currently undergoing restoration, this is nice to capture the conditions of both before the re-do.The imagery is stunning and in combination with the perfect cast picks, this indie flick should get all the attention and accolades it deserves.I just hope it can be seen by the masses...and SOON!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will honestly say that I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would at first. The action is there in spades. Chad Law took a great combo of influences and paid homage to them in this script. The cast was great! Will Kaufmann got some great performances out of this group. The look of the world was great and I liked how it was shot from every point, good job to Kelly. I didn't know the lead had done the score until after the film, but I thought it was great for the movie. The reviews talking about how it sounds the same through the movie is unfair. This isn't Gone With The Wind with sweeping tone shifts to adjust your emotion, this is a horror shooter. I can think of 5 different high budget action movies that have a similar tone to the music for the whole film. I think Johnny did a great job with it. Here's the breakdown for if you'll like it. You want explosions and guns going off? Covered. You want fight scenes and running for your life? Got you. You want people you'll care about in the film? Got it also. You want scary monsters that will have you jumping? Yup. You want an overall solid action/monster flick that will make you spill popcorn and cheer people on? Then watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent horror action thriller delivers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the world premiere of Daylight's End at the Dallas International Film Festival this past Friday night. This is a horror action thriller, sort of a mix of the best elements of influences from other fun to watch films such as Aliens, 28 Days Later and World War Z. It's a fun and exciting romp through the zombie/vampire genre.The script is well written and performances are superb. While it plays second to the well made action scenes, the character development in the movie is really strong in the short time given to it. This is really an ensemble cast that plays well off of each other, it's obvious every actor, even with the smallest role knows exactly who his or her character is. Lance Henriksen is absolutely believable as Frank, the ex-cop leader of this group of survivors, and Louis Mandylor puts in one of the best performances of his career as Frank's son Ethan. Standouts in smaller roles: Dugan (Chris Kerson) is the guy you love to hate, Annabelle (Farah White) is crazy (can't describe it... you just have to see it), Drew (Gary Cairns) is a slacker with a heart (and a "Just Do Me" t-shirt which was a nice touch), and Burton (Mark Hanson) is a sort of survivalist that delivered some great one liners. As I said, a great ensemble cast.Also a word about Johnny Strong's performance in the lead role as Rourke, the hardened stranger that is new to the group. Strong is good enough that it makes one wonder why he hasn't been given the opportunity to play more lead roles in larger budget action oriented films, especially in a decade or more of Hollywood films that have been bereft of such talent. Combine that with Strong's excellent score which creates a vibe that feels very influenced by John Carpenter at his best, and I'm wondering where has Johnny Strong been for the last several years?I can't complete this review without mentioning the director of the film, William Kaufman. Kaufman has developed a reputation as a top notch action director, and this film is the culmination of all his experience and talent in that area - this is his best effort to date, no question. Kaufman's cinematic sensibility in this film is a purposeful recreation of how films looked and felt in the early 1980's, except of course with modern technology - and it works oh so well to serve this genre. Also, director Kaufman obviously had his hands full with a large ensemble cast of very talented actors, any of whom could have caused problems for the audience's belief in the story if they turned in weak or out-of-sync performances compared to the rest of the cast. So in addition to excellent action sequences, Kaufman navigated these difficult waters with the ease of a veteran director capable of inspiring his actors to come together and deliver across the board, from the lead to the smallest roles - and it really shows on screen.As I mentioned, from a creative standpoint this film was excellent on every level including direction, score, cast performances (and casting), sound design, editing and script. Plus it scared the crap out of me several times, which doesn't happen to me in movies, ever. So for me this film achieved exactly what it set out to do. This is one of the best movies I have seen so far this year - check it out, you won't be disappointed.As for the previous 2 negative reviews here on IMDb, I really have to say these sound like they were written by someone who personally has a problem with someone associated with the film because they absolutely don't reflect the quality of the actual movie. This kind of trashing of the film by someone associated with the filmmakers is also strange to me because I could not help but notice on Friday night at the screening how many cast and crew members were there, and they appeared to be a very closely knit group that is excited to present this latest excellent offering to moviegoers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First: either I like a movie or I don't, so I gave this film 10 stars.Daylight's End is a mix of 28 Days later, Omega Man and The Road Warrior. Though it is not on the same level as the before mentioned, it is still a good action movie. I recognize some of the actors and actresses and I think they were good choices, especially Johnny Strong. It appears that the producer hired a professional to instruct the actors on combat tactics...which in the film was well executed.In my opinion this is not really a B movie, more like a B+ or A-. I think this a must see for fans of the genre, so if you like apocalyptic/zombie movies then I recommend Daylight's End.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daylight's End: Highlight of the Portland Horror Film Festival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife, brother, and I are extreme horror fans so the first annual Portland Horror Film Festival was a must for us all to attend. Many of the shorts were very well made and entertaining. Some were weighted down by formulas and gimmicks presently popular in horror cinema (if I see another hand-held and/or creepy little kid ghost picture I'm gonna barf). The festival also hosted two feature films, but it was the feature that closed the Portland Horror Film Festival that blew all of us away. That film was Daylight's End, and it had it all: scares, action, perfect pacing of the three act structure, and quality efforts behind and in front of the camera. The film is directed by William Kaufman who made another great independent genre film, the action-packed Sinners and Saints. For both independent passion projects (S&amp;S and DE) Kaufman has surrounded himself with many of the same cast and crew from both efforts. Screenwriter Chad Law writes believable characters and story situations that somehow break the mold, but pay homage to the greats. Law wrote DE as a phrenetic hybrid (taking the best elements) of The Road Warrior, Rio Bravo/Assault on Precinct 13, Omaga Man/I am Legend, and Aliens. Many cast members are in both films, but two in particular stand-out and steal DE, Johnny Strong as the lead and Louis Mandylor as the team's negotiator between Strong's lone wolf character Rourke, and the police captain and survivor group leader, Frank Hill played by the always intense and charismatic Lance Henriksen. DE's plot has hints of familiarity, but stands on it's own: in a post-apocalyptic world ravished by a bloodborne pathogen that turns people into crazed zompires, one man relentlessly searches for the zompire alpha male that turned the love of his life into another mad creature. His tour of vengeance leads him to a group of survivors fortified in what was once a Dallas police station attacked nightly by the alpha male's newest army of creepers. Rourke volunteers to attack the alpha's newest lair of undead suckers while the majority of survivors can escape to a supposed sanctuary, and chaos ensues throughout. Strong gives immense effort in his acting and somehow makes Rourke volatile while loyal, strong (no pun intended) while vulnerable, and uses his physical and facial features to deliver pages of dialogue without saying a word. Strong also gave tremendous efforts behind the camera as well by creating all of the film's music and directing his effective flashback sequences. Another unique bonus was having DE crew available for a Q &amp; A after the film. Thanks to producer Sheri L. Deterling and assistant costume designer Rachel Haynes, we were able to get in depth answers to audience questions and praise regarding locations, set design, realistic weapons training, music, acting, etc. It was a perfect evening for this film nerd, but my favorite moments were witnessing the simultaneous jumping in fear and sucking-in-already-held breath shared by my wife, brother, friends, and I at several different fright scenes in DE. So far Kaufman and company have made two great independent genre films to date, and I look forward to future collaborations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great! Non stop action from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daylight's End is a great movie. It's scary, intense, funny, and heartfelt. I was exhausted by the end from the action. Johnny Strong makes the perfect anti-hero. Lance Henriksen was at his best as the leader of the group, and Louis Mandylor as the voice of reason caught in the middle really stands out. I can't think of a movie of this genre that I have enjoyed this much in years. The director William Kaufman needs to make more movies like this. I knew it would be filled with action from seeing the trailer, but I was really surprised at how much I laughed at the one liners. There were people in the theater cheering when I saw it. I would say this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rated this 10 because I loved it. I don't care about what the others are saying. I loved the visuals, the acting, the actresses, everything! I personally like this evil film. The other actors and actresses are fine too. I really loved the story. I guess critics are really hard to please. But myself, I really enjoyed this film. The acting is pretty good to. I watching this in the cinema hall. I will definitely suggested to see this film. Evey moment is horror and action also. I don't get it why people late to see this movie. I'm pretty sure I will watch the next film after this. I'll keep supporting the Daylight's End film sure. Director and Writer are making awesome creation. I suggested everyone to see this movie and enjoy with friend and Family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Strong is Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that my friend dragged me to this movie when it was screened at The Dallas International Film Festival. I typically only like dramas and comedies, plus it was a midnight showing, I was already tired and I just didn't think I was going to be able to stay awake through it. To my surprise this movie starts with a bang and it never lets up! I was drawn to the lead actor Johnny Strong, I didn't even know who he was, but he did a great job, and I won't forget him going forward! Daylight's End was a fun ride and I jumped out of my seat many times! They say it was a low budget movie, but it didn't look or feel that way to me. I will definitely see this again...I absolutely loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fun ride! I caught the world premiere at the Dallas International Film Festival. The movie screened to a packed house. The audience absolutely LOVED it! Cinema with a capital C. What can I tell you that other reviews haven't already said? It's pure adrenaline entertainment from start to finish. Great cast! No matter how small of a supporting role one has, they bring it! They deliver! No weak links in this flick! Kudos to the director, as it is a rare thing to achieve with such a big cast. The "creatures" are pretty scary -- got me jumping in my seat more than once, Ha! The action sequences are a lot of fun, cut seamlessly they take you on a hell of a fast ride. A wonderful sound design and a powerful soundtrack complement the visuals perfectly. I loved it. It was great fun!</fullReview>
