		<shortDescription>A Miracle Of A Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a genius Joseph L Manckiewicz was. A literary script that is totally accessible. A melodrama for the thinking man. A film that is as engrossing and entertaining every time you see it. Bette Davis touches all the raw nerves of her mythological career. Anne Baxter never went this far. Thelma Ritter became a sort of icon. Marilyn Monroe gives us a preview of forthcoming attractions as a graduated from the "Copacabana" academy of dramatic arts. Celeste Holm represents us, all of us and George Sanders creates a prototype for a cultured monster that is immediately recognizable. I don't recall another film in which the nature of selfishness is so wittily dissected. A total triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read comments about the quality of the writing in this film but I really had no idea to what extent this would elevate the experience. The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to "act" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying."All About Eve" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films "A Face in the Crowd". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years.And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so "liberated" today. So what more can I say? If you love movies and you haven't yet seen it, you've suffered long enough; don't wait another day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the Perfect Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve is simply the perfect film. Fact follows fiction in the casting of Bette Davis, a star who was an incredible actress but fighting the inevitable - the passage of time. First off, Better Davis was always an incredible actress, no matter what part she took and this was the perfect part for her. Anne Baxter is tremendous in the part of Eve - she plays the part well. It's multi-faceted and challenging and she definitely rose to the challenge. Celeste Holm is great, too. She's got a smaller part but does a great job with it. Celeste Holm is an actress who has incredible stature, even in the later years of her career, like when she was in that television show "Promised Land." But Addison DeWitt - takes the cake. I can see why he won the Oscar. I don't want to say much about the story. The film is one that has to be taken in as a whole to be truly appreciated. Enjoy it - it's as tasty as honey! One thing - please never let them make a re-make of this film - it's perfect. It's off limits. It would be painting a new version of the Mona Lisa. This one is perfect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of old-style theatre back-stabbing with a cherished, hand-picked cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE definitive saga of backstage brouhaha ever dished out by Hollywood. A triumph of screen-writing, never will one see such ripe, acrid dialogue spewed out like this again -- every indelible scene gloriously stained with classic one-liners. An actress wanna-be looking for her big break carefully worms her way into the glamorous life of a legendary Broadway star, then tries to supplant her privately and professionally.A sterling, incandescent cast provides the fire and music to this concerto of theatre attitude. Bette Davis knew she was handed a dream role when she was cast as Margo Channing, the indomitable diva caught up in the throes of mid-life crisis both on- and off-stage. Not willing at all to deal with it tactfully, she makes life a living hell for anyone within knife-throwing distance. This juicy, once-in-a-lifetime part turned Davis' own flagging middle-aged career back on its feet, especially coming on the heels of one of her biggest "dumps" ever, "Beyond the Forest." Remarkable as it may seem, Bette was not the first choice here, replacing an injured Claudette Colbert. With all due respect to Colbert, Bette Davis was BORN to play Margo Channing. A mauling lioness one minute, a coy, declawed pussycat the next, Davis relishes every wickedly bitchy scene she gets to tear into. Yet in her more introspective moments, she evokes real sympathy for Margo (as only a true star can) especially when her character missteps. It's a resounding victory for the Queen Bee in every way, shape and form.Her "supporting cast" also manage to create a buzz of excitement. Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe, known for their relative blandness, are splendid here in their respective roles as queen bee's lover and playwright. While Merrill's Bill Sampson tames Margo the woman with gutsy directness and virile passion, Marlowe's Lloyd Richards appeases Margo the star with flattery, great dialogue and a calm resolve. Worth watching, then, are their fireworks scenes with Margo when intelligence and restraint no longer work. Debonair George Sanders gives customary snob appeal and dry cynicism to his waspish, ultimately loathsome columnist Addison DeWitt, who swarms around Broadway's elite knowledgeable in the fact his lack of heart and poison pen yield exclusive rights and power. The most sensitive and sensible one in the collective bunch, the one lacking a true stinger, is Karen Richards (played wonderfully by Celeste Holm), Margo's best friend and confidante, who finds herself caught between the queen and a hard place when she accidentally makes a pact with the devil. Thelma Ritter couldn't be overlooked if she tried. An inveterate scene-stealer, she weathers strong competition this time in a movie crammed with clever conversation and pungent zingers. As coarse but well-meaning Birdie Coonan, a brash ex-vaudevillian now the queen's ever-loyal "drone", Ritter's character properly handles her boss's antics with amusing grit and backbone. On the periphery of this Broadway beehive is mop-faced Gregory Ratoff as an edgy, gullible, thick-accented producer, Marilyn Monroe as a hopelessly vacuous starlet, and Barbara Bates, as a novice schemer with a very bright future, all making their few scenes count -- especially Bates, who is forever enshrined in the film's stunning final shot.The chief thorn in Margo's (and everybody's) side, and the other real star of this picture, is the queen's titular lady-in-waiting, Eve Harrington. As played by Anne Baxter, this role is probably the most delicate and difficult of all for the weight and believability of this drama falls squarely on her shoulders. Unfairly overlooked all these years by the flashier posturings of Davis, Baxter does a beautiful job of drawing initial pathos then panic as she slowly unveils her own lethal stinger. By film's end, Baxter is directly on par with her scenery-chewing co-star. Killer to killer. Champion to champion.Six Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director (Joseph L. Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (also Mankiewicz) and Supporting Actor (George Sanders) went to this cinematic bon mot. Had Bette Davis and Anne Baxter not competed as Best Actress (Baxter refused to place herself in the Supporting Actress category), it would have drummed up two more awards to be sure.Developing a faithful cult following over the years, this film deserves to be on everybody's "top ten" list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent Timeless Tale of Ambition, Manipulation and Betrayal - Certainly One of the Best Classics Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ambitious Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) gets close to the great and temperamental stage artist Margo Channing (Bette Davis) and her friends Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) and her husband, the play-writer Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe); her boyfriend and director Bill Sampson (Gary Marrow); and the producer Max Fabian (Gregory Ratoff). Everybody, except the cynical critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders), believe that Eve is only a naive, humble and simple obsessed fan of Margo and they try to help her. However, Eve is indeed a cynical and manipulative snake that uses the lives of Margo and her friends to reach her objectives in the theater business."All About Eve" is a magnificent timeless tale of ambition, manipulation and betrayal, and certainly one of the best classics ever. Everything perfectly works in this movie: the direction is very precise and tight; dialogs are very acid and intelligent; Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders and Celeste Holm have awesome performances in very powerful characters; the dramatic story is amazingly good, showing what an evil person can plot to reach fame and success. I believe this movie will always be among my ten favorite movies ever. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "A Malvada" ("The Wicked")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Great Writing and Great Acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In show business, there is probably an Eve Harrington born every day. Someone who butters up to a performer of note, acting innocently, revealing none of the coldhearted ambition they really have. Anne Baxter plays this type of person to a tee. She looks like a baby-faced fan, but little do we know, there is a fame machine at work in her mind. Bette Davis, as Margo Channing, star of the stage, is a veteran who has seen it all. She is quite the egotist. Margo is a brilliant actress and she knows it. Eve discovers her blind spot and moves in on her like a quiet storm. This is the premise of ALL ABOUT EVE, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's masterpiece of sly wit and subtle manipulation. Mankiewicz also wrote the picture (winner of the Best Picture Oscar of 1950) with such skill, the talented cast need only to memorize the lines and deliver them with the proper technique.The performances are great, regardless, especially by Bette Davis and the always detested George Sanders, one of my favorite actors of the Golden Age of Hollywood. The film is narrated initially by Sanders, who plays a ruthless swine of a theatre critic, then by Celeste Holm, the wife of Eve and Margo's playwrighter, then Bette Davis in the performance of a lifetime. The movie is about 90% dialogue, much like a play. The words are so crisp and sharp, you never sway or lose interest. These characters are just too interesting. Bette Davis has a cavalcade of unforgettable dialogue. "Fasten your seatbelts. Its going to be a bumpy night!" This is the one everyone remembers, but I would be remiss to get into any others.The picture runs well over 2 hours, but it doesn't seem like enough. Mankiewicz could've held a seminar of screenwriting by showing this. George Sanders is the only actor of the roster to bring home an Academy Award, and rumor has it Davis and Baxter, who was just 27 at the time, were feuding during much of the shoot and lusted the Oscar. Time has been very good to the film as well. 1950 was a wonderful year for movies and ALL ABOUT EVE's artistic equal that year was the equally well-written SUNSET BOULEVARD, which took us behind the scenes of a tainted Hollywood. EVE takes on theatre and treats Hollywood like an afterthought. There are many references to the film industry, usually involving the scenes with Margo Channing's boyfriend, who is attempting to make a career on the silver screen.The movie is highly unpredictable, especially the last scenes which tie the ideas of the story up. There is an Eve everywhere and each character gets what he or she deserves. Fasten the belts and listen up. This is screenwriting at its finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will see yourself in every character in this very intelligent, entrancing movie. Though set in "the theatre," the story could just as easily have been told in a small town, a corporation ? even a religious organization. Being set in the "glamorous" world of entertainment ? its seems all the more timely in these days of fame, fortune and the insufficiency (almost shame) of being ordinary. The theatre setting also underscores the reality that the world is a stage, and all its people, players.So much to study in this movie: the genuine, trusting (and romantic) human; the streetwise, good, hardworking human, who's seen it all and doesn't embrace it; the jaded, heart-hardened, deceitful loser with power, who admires the same and disdains human goodness; the ambitious sociopath who fools so many; the unsuspecting onlookers who see only the façade of success; the inescapable fact that supreme achievement has been had by very low characters; the painful passage of an aging woman into the light of knowing she's loved for being beautiful beyond her appearance, for being HER; the touching portrayal of her lover who remembers his love for her as he passes on a much younger, beautiful, talented actress; the sorrow of a (betraying) friend who discovers the frightened and lonely heart of her successful friend ? The dialogue is sharp and clever, barked and growled, smarmy and tender? A truly human movie about being human. Go ? find yourself in everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's going to be a BETTE night....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve is an excellent film in every aspect. The 14 Oscar nominations, and six wins, testify to this. For 47 years EVE held the record for most nominations -- in 1997 Titanic matched the 14 nominations. Bette Davis was awarded the New York Critics Award once in her 58 year career -- and it was for this film. Marilyn Monroe, Thelma Ritter and Celeste Holms gave terrific supporting performances while Anne Baxter kept up with the great Bette every frame of the way. It was Bette's eighth nomination, and sixth loss; Judy Holiday won for Born Yesterday, beating two legends -- Gloria Swanson was also nominated that year for Sunset Blvd. All About Eve was the first film to be released after Bette ended her 18 years with Warner Brothers. For a moment she was back on top of the world, only to find disappointment throughout the 50's with choices and offerings in Hollywood. The writing by Mankiewicz and supporting performance by George Saunders would alone make the film worth viewing -- A NEAR PEFECT FILM!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>***** Perfect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's perfect writing if ever a movie ever had it-where did Joseph L. Mankiewicz come up with these people? Who would have thought he could not only revive Bette Davis' career with her greatest-ever role, but actually make her even more fascinating than she ever was before? Davis plays famous and established actress Margo Channing, a self-centred and tough but vulnerable woman who is purused relentlessly by Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), a seemingly innocent woman who worships Channing-she even becomes her personal assistant. However, her devotion soon becomes sinister, and Margo lets her friends know, though they just think she's being selfish and unfair. Celeste Holm is excellent as Margo's best friend, who at first is on Eve's side but eventually sees how conniving Eve can be and how ruthless she is in climbing to the top. The party scene early on in the film features some of the film's best lines (`Fasten your seat belts?it's going to be a bumpy night!'), though my personal favourite is when Davis tells Baxter to put her award `where you heart should be'; Margo Channing is just about the best female character of the fifties. Features Marilyn Monroe in an early role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Acting And Dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie! It's the cinematic ideal, the standard by which subsequent films are judged, at least in terms of acting and dialogue. Maybe the camera, which does nothing but sit there as the actors act, could have been made a little less static. But the story screams stage play, which implies lots of talk and not much "action". The film doesn't pretend to do all things. But what it does do, it does extremely well.As Margo, Bette Davis gives what I would consider one of the best performances, if not the best performance, in any film I have ever seen. She truly becomes Margo, that "fixture of the theater", so beloved yet so insecure. And as Eve, "the mousy one, with the trench coat and the funny hat", breathy Anne Baxter proves adept at subtleties that allow her character to change gradually over time.Then there's George Sanders who effortlessly slips into the role of witty, urbane, pompous Addison DeWitt, columnist magnifico, a man whose high opinion of himself allows him to declare to us, as viewers, that he is "essential to the theater". Celeste Holm and reliable Thelma Ritter give topnotch performances as well.And the Mankiewicz script, which tells the story of a group of theater people, is heavy on dialogue, but it's totally believable, as characters talk shop and interrelate, by means of suitable verbal conflict and subtle subtext. Even more than that, the dialogue is witty and clever, with tons of theatrical metaphors, like when Bill (Gary Merrill) angrily tells Margo: "And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me, it spells a paranoid insecurity that you should be ashamed of." To which Margo just as angrily spits out: "Cut, print it, what happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pits?"One of my favorite scenes has several people sitting on a stairway at a party. A curvaceous but bird-brained Miss Casswell (Marilyn Monroe), "from the Copacabana school of acting", desires another drink. "Oh waiter!", she yells out. Addison schools her: "That isn't a waiter, my dear; that's a butler." To which she fires back: "Well I can't yell 'Oh butler', can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler". Addison then concedes: "You have a point, an idiotic one, but a point."I'm not sure I really like the characters in this film. Generally, they're self-absorbed, vain, haughty, and backbiting. They're not all that likable. And that would be my only serious complaint.Otherwise, "All About Eve" is a film that excels at great language and great acting. If ever there was a film that deserves the status of "classic", this is surely it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eve: Medusa The 20th Century Edition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Another great movie about ambition and its attendant costs. Like the more modern Barry Lyndon, the film focuses on Eve with Margo being quite peripheral. The affectation, back stabbing, and manipulation that would have made Antonio Machiavelli blush is worth the long viewing. Anne Baxter won my respect for daring to take a role that will enshrine her with Ann Blyth's Vida in Mildred Pierce as the most loathsome, evil swine ever depicted in a film. It takes great courage to play Eve. Watch her when she first meet her, waiting out in the rain for a glimpse of the actress she worships: Margo. The biography she vomits to everyone, which later is revealed to be a pack of lies by Addison, is carefully crafted to milk every drop of sympathy from her audience. This is the correct way to view Eve she is always acting, every second of every day. It is a study, in the abyss of ambition, of what lengths one human being will stoop to in order to be rich and famous. Watch how she uses a favor, that was Karen's way of helping Eve, to blackmail her later in the movie by this evil monster. My favorite line is not the oft quoted bumpy ride remark, while memorable, is typical self serving Bette Davis; no, I like Margo to Eve,"Do not feel bad dear, you can put that trophy where your heart should be." Much better, also it captures the essence of Eve. First, stalking Margo, then dressing like her, imitating her on an empty stage what follows is ruthlessness the like of which you have never seen. When Eve meets Addison she meets the male version but even worse. Watch when she thinks she is going to shed him like she does everyone else on her climbing over bodies to the top. He teaches her she is not even remotely in his league of using and destroying others. You will not whistle a happy tune; it will teach you a lot about the glorified toilet bowl that Hollywood has always been. Marilyn fans will get to see their Icon in one of her first speaking parts. Bette gives a great performance; she oozes contempt for Eve: Who can blame her? She was so powerful an actress that even the looks on her face say what we would love to hear: Eve, you disgusting monster!I love the ending. Eve now has a new friend; just as she was a friend to Margo. Watch how at first she puts up a big fight being cruel and vicious to herself the younger version. By the end of the scene, Eve cannot help herself as Margo could not; their vanity is the weakness predators use to step over them. Both women want a sycophant toady that waits upon them hand and foot. The constant verbal stroking they could never live without. A Great Movie Worthy Of All The Praise</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**************this might contain spoilers**********************The movie Perfect Stranger opened today and as many critic noted the script was not up to standard. But then again one is always reading how today's script's just don't cut it. And one wonders why? Surly today's directors can draw upon previous movie scripts if no more than to see how well they are constructed. And no script was more in it's craft that Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve. I could also point out Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity and a few others but All About Eve is one one Mankiewicz's best, along with A Letter to Three Wives and the charming People Will Talk. But, as many a poster knows All About Eve garnered 14 academy award nominations, winning 6. Bette Davis was robbed! Sure, Gloria Swanson was dazzling in Sunset Boulevard but she didn't have the competition Miss Davis had in All About Eve. There was Anne Baxter reprising a similar role she played in the 1944 film Guest in the House. And George Sanders playing a variation of his role in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I think the academy members gave him his award for his magnificent body of work. His award was well deserved. But miss Baxter couldn't hold a candle to Miss Davis who essayed her role in 14 days. And out of sequence. The first scene filmed for the movie was Miss Davis encountering Addison De Witt in the lobby of the theatre. The producers could only get the theatre for a certain time not on it's schedule so did what it had to do. Film that scene. The interior of the theatre scene was filmed at a later date. Many people don't know that Hollywood is a very small town. And the academy award members is not a large body at all, maybe a little over two thousand. But at that time the members had long memories and since Miss Davis was no longer Queen of Hollywood let alone under a contract to a major studio they knew they had no allegiance to her. She had stepped on too many academy members toes, and some still felt the sting. Gloria Swanson, well, she just came out of retirement for this one film and so they felt no allegiance to her, either. Neither studio backed the two stars. And the award went to Judy Holliday for a very boring movie called Born Yesterday. A role that Miss Holliday had performed on Broadway many many time. It's hard to watch Born Yesterday today and you really wonder why the members didn't give the academy award to Miss Davis. All About Eve is a timeless movie, a classic and a gem and the towering performance in the entire film is by Bette Davis. To go further in the case of vendetta, the members did give Katherine Hepburn an award for her unforgettable performance in The Lion in Winter but to make sure Davis couldn't catch Hepburn she got another award for the insipid Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, a role not worthy of an academy award. Still, Miss Davis somehow comes out a true winner when all one has to do is to watch All About Eve. We are her academy award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They say that talk is cheap but you wouldn't believe it listening to the pearls that drip from the mouths of the characters in this, the greatest of all the dialogue-driven comedies to have come out of Hollywood, (at the time it was nominated for a then record 14 Oscar nominations and won 6). It opens with a monologue that introduces all the leading players that is at once literate and cinematic at the same time and you know instantly that his is, above all, a movie to listen to. (What film-buff doesn't quote its screenplay ad-nauseum; gay men, at least according to "The Boys in the Band", are said to know the script by heart). And while drag queens the world over have always based their Bette Davis imitations on the character of Margo Channing, (Davis' greatest role and her greatest performance), the film is never merely camp. The acerbic wit that runs through the film always has a ring of truth to it; the characters, overblown as they are, are always recognizably human.The acting alone is to die for. Can you believe that other actresses were once considered for the role of Margo? (Claudette Colbert?). Davis makes it her own not by acting Margo but by being Margo. I can't think of another role more indelibly suited to an actress than this. In a lesser film she might have swamped her co-stars but Mankiewicz, who wrote and directed, gives everyone equal credence.Anne Baxter was never better than as the poisonous Eve; Celeste Holm, wonderful as the clipped, sophisticated Karen; George Sanders oozing epigrams as if from every pore as the screen's most famous critic, Addison DeWitt, (what a name!). These were career-best performances and in smaller parts, Thelma Ritter's cynical, wise-cracking Dresser, Birdie, and Marilyn Monroe's vacuous Miss Caswell, ('a graduate of the Copocobana school of dramatic art'), are just as unforgettable. In the seventies someone had the, not very bright, idea of turning it into a Broadway musical called 'Applause'. While not half-bad you still came away feeling you had seen a karaoke version of "All About Eve".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When art imitates life, where does reality end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe, stretching a point, this movie could have been called 'All About Actors'? There've been a number of films that explore the passion for success on the stage: Stage Door (1937) and A Star Is Born (first made in 1937 and made several times thereafter) being two of the most notable. And, other films have also taken an introspective look at the machinations of the acting profession ? The Player (1992) and even the goofy, but entertaining, Get Shorty (1995).This one, however, is the definitive voyeuristic analysis of why actors will do anything to get to the top, for three reasons. First, it has a script that is flawless in its construction, logic and plot development; to use a hackneyed phrase ? it all hangs together seamlessly, showing ? and telling, with three different voice-overs ? the depths to which some go to reach the heights of narcissistic glory. Second, such a film required a strong hand to keep the actors in check, to prevent it from descending into farce, and that's why Joe Mankiewicz was needed; well, it was his script, anyway ? so who better to direct, with his fine record of films? And, third, the main protagonists: never before, I think, has a script followed so closely the juxtaposition of a true star (Bette Davis) in her waning years, playing an actress in her waning years, and being challenged by a relative newcomer (Anne Baxter), playing a newcomer challenging the aging star. Such delicious irony, I think, is rare to see on screen. Add to that, a collection of actors (George Sanders, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, Celeste Holm, the irrepressible Thelma Ritter) of the time who ably and professionally flesh out a drama about the reality of life in fiction.Perhaps even more interesting than the actual film would have been a documentary filming the action on the sets, as the film was made... One can only dream, I guess, to have been a fly on the wall.A word about the dialog: checking the above link for Quotes, I see that all of the lines I rate as some of the best I've heard, all show up in the list ? which is, also, one of the longest list of quotable film quotes I've seen. If you're hesitating about seeing this film, just scan through those quotes to get a sense of what is in store.As implied, the direction from Mankiewicz and the acting ? particularly Davis, Baxter and Sanders ? are riveting. Bette Davis is the personification of diminishing self-confidence as the onset of age dominates and depresses; Baxter is almost sociopathic in her portrayal of naked ambition disguised as sycophantic concern for one and all, but particularly for those who will advance her ambitions; and George Sanders does give the performance of his career and deservedly received the award for Best Supporting Actor. Other actors (Dick Powell or Claude Rains, for example) could have played that role, for sure; Sanders, however, does such a good job, it's a though the character of Addison DeWitt (what a play on word sound ? Addison, the wit and critic, given a name that sounds like a New Yorker's disparaging put-down. Was Mankiewicz having a bit of fun at New York's expense?) morphs into George Sanders completely. And, vice-versa...So, treat yourself to a filmic experience that you'll never see repeated ? for obvious and sad reasons. But also, this type of narrative is long gone from the Hollywood scene: talky movies are box-office death these days, as we all know ? unless you're in a Phone Booth (2002) or on a Cellular (2004).One can only hope that nobody attempts a remake of this masterpiece.

		<shortDescription>All about Adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie geared for those who would stand in line for the latest cinemeplexific car chase head banging rock music special effect buster of blocks. This movie is all about adults. And the main focus is (SHOCK!) and adult woman!! Who is hitting 40!!Bette Davis' Margo Channing is successful and self-involved and loving and generous and jealous and human. Ann Bancroft's Eve has such a sincere and melifluous voice. Thelma Ritter's character is a fast talking dame, Celeste Holm's is a more contemplative one and Marilyn is a hoot. Watch Margo get applause, get drunk, get duped, get a clue, get her man. "Glory Hallelujah!"The men in the film, nameless here but wonderful on screen, are not spineless tools for the women. Okay, maybe Celeste's husband is easily manipulated as is the producer - but Margo's man "When I want something, I go after it, I don't want it to come after me" and Sanders' critic "who do you think you are fooling?" are manly men right off the rugged individualist rack (okay, it's a long rack . . .)Great story, well told, great cast, well done!If anyone thinks that any of these people are not *perfect* in this movie - George Sanders? Thelma Ritter? Marilyn Monroe? Celeste Holm? Bette Davis? Ann Bancroft? - I would like to take issue with you - behind the cineplex at high noon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What really killed me the most about what went on in All About Eve's story (which revolved around back-stage treachery and sneering cynicism) was that it was (of all people) Birdie (Margo Channing's personal dresser) who (before anyone else) became wise to what Eve Harrington (the conniving bitch) was all about.But, of course, if it were Margo who had wised up to Eve as quickly as Birdie had, then, you can bet, that this movie would've been over in about 30 minutes, instead of its rather over-long 140 minutes.What I found to be one of the real highlights of this picture was seeing a very young Marilyn Monroe (24 at the time) strutting her stuff in a bit-part as the alluring Miss Casswell. Even at this early point in her career, Monroe was already showing that "certain something" which (in just a few years time) would catapult her into mega-stardom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Movie quote) - "Let's not get over-dramatic!" To me, if there was one thing that actress, Bette Davis, definitely could not project, believably, on screen.... That one thing would have to be honest-to-goodness "sex appeal".Like, I don't know about you other guys - But, for me, Davis (bulldog jowls, and all) projected about as much sexual allure as that of week-old roadkill. I ain't kidding. That woman was a real dog.And if "All About Eve" was really supposed to be a realistic, behind-the-scenes look at the NYC Theatre Set (of the early-1950s), then working in that environment truly must've been one of the most horrible places in the entire world to be employed.I thought that all of the hate, the jealousy, the treachery, the back-stabbing, and the sneering cynicism that certainly prevailed throughout "All About Eve" to certainly be enough to cure anyone (in their right mind) of ever wanting to pursue a career in this line of work - Ever. But, with that said - Are actors really considered to be in their "right mind" in the first place? Anyway - Even though this 65-year-old, b&amp;w movie had its fair share of good points, as well as its not-so-good points, I still say that it was well-worth a view in spite of its flukes and flaws.*Trivia Note* - I think it's kinda interesting to note that actress Anne Baxter was the grand-daughter of famed architect, Frank Lloyd Wright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"All About Eve" is the kind of movie that blows your mind, not because of special effect or something like that, but because of what movies are all about, a great direction, a great screenplay, and great acting.Stage star Margo Channing(Davis) is friend to playwright Lloyd Richards(Marlowe) and his wife Karen(Holm), in love with director Bill Samson(Merill), and the idol of Eve Harrington(Baxter) who becomes her secretary-aide. Eve begins to dominate: she sends Bill Margo's birthday wishes and arranges a party for him, at which point Margo explodes. Eve becomes Margo's understudy and, when Margo misses a performance, critic Addison DeWitt gives her rave reviews while making acerbic remarks about aging actresses like Margo.In it's first scenes, you can see an unusual style in this kind of movie, and it doesn't look old, even nowadays. The plot is not very entertaining, but the dialogues and the acting grabs your attention, and some quotes leave you speechless to describe how good they are, and it's memorable scenes, like the dialogues between Eve and Bill about the theater, and the last scene, which is probably the best one, are awesome.The acting is almost perfect by all it's cast, except for Marilyn Monroe's short appearance, that with three or four lines, can show that she is not in the same acting level of the rest of the cast. Bette Davis is what really stands out (Although George Sanders as DeWitt is almost as good as her), she's funny, and know where to show her emotions, and when to hide it.Verdict: Almost everything works, and it's a classic that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A part in a play. You'd do all that just for a part in a play?"All About Eve is a sneaky tale about deceit and pure ambition, set within the world of the New York theater scene.Eve (Anne Baxter) seems to be a sympathetic, helpful young woman, who find herself unexpectedly meeting her idol, the great stage actress Margo Chandler (Bette Midler). She begins to work for the star, seemingly completely content to help her in any way she can. But Eve is much more ambitious than her sweet, helpful demeanor suggests, and she brings all kinds of trouble to Margo and others in her bids for her own personal fame and stardom.&nbsp;I can't really find any flaws with the premise of All About Eve, or the acting. It's a well- made movie with a great cast. For some reason, though, my interest in it stayed fairly subdued. I did get more into the story during the second half, but I'm forced to concede that for some reason, I wasn't the primary audience for this one. I did love the ending, though.&nbsp;Solid movie, but I believe others will probably have a more enthusiastic reaction to All About Eve than I did.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acclaimed, but I found it hard to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am now on about my fourth attempt to watch All About Eve. I find it a very hard slog. Each time I manage about 20 minutes, and then I have to find something else to do. The acting is mechanical and stagey. There is no reacting here, only people waiting to give their next witty riposte. An occasional witty remark is fine. It gets tiring when everyone is witty. This has nothing to do with the period. The wisecracking in 1940's His Girl Friday or 1941's Ball of Fire, for example, is much more natural and believable. There is no doubt that a lot of the script is great, and the premise is groundbreaking for its time. But a lot of the lines are clunkers or non sequiturs, and these are delivered with the same smugness as the good ones, which adds to the impression that the characters are not thinking about what they're saying, but just reading the text and the stage directions. Celeste Holm gives the closest to what I would say is a believable performance.Bette Davis is the biggest disappointment. Whether she's playing happy, sad, or angry, it's always reined in, without any real emotions getting through. My 7 is for the script alone. If I had to score the acting and direction separately they would be less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All about eve is an American drama about an actress named Eve Harrington. I wasn't crazy about this movie, it had some cool parts with the lighting and camera-work but nothing that really stuck out to me that much. The title, All About Eve, is very fitting because the main character Eve Harrington is very selfish and only cares about herself most of the time. Eve begins to get close and befriend a famous Broadway actor named Margo Channing and her famous friends. Most of the friends believed that Margo was just an innocent fan of Margo who didn't want any trouble and wasn't trying to pull anything. However, that was not the case. Eve was only using Margo and her friends in the business to help get her known and to help get her connections in the industry. She was only hanging out with them to benefit herself which was her plan all along. I didn't think this movie was that interesting and I couldn't really get into it but I can see how some people would enjoy it. All About Eve had some interesting parts and effects in it at parts it just wasn't my favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a whole, this film was pretty good. Fine performances from Anne Baxter as Eve, the brilliantly phony schemer, George Sanders as the caustic critic Addison de Witt, (His opening voiceover monologue is hilarious), Thelma Ritter as the cynical maid, Hugh Marlowe and Celeste Holm as the playwright and his wife, and, in an early small role, Marilyn Monroe as a wannabe starlet. The script has great moments of biting humor and all that, yes, and Joseph Mancewicz's direction is pretty good, too. But there are plenty of moments when the film simply dissolves into talkiness, and it gets a little slow and boring. The film is at its best when Bette Davis, giving no doubt her best performance as fading star Margo Channing, really lets loose and lets her costars have it, as in the scene where she fights with Marlowe in the theater. She is also good when being vulnerable and revealing in some of the quieter scenes, but the talkiness factor does override her a little bit. Not quite as scathing and cynical as "Sunset Boulevard," but close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm afraid I'm not going to join the gush parade for this movie.The performances are good, Eve and Margo are well-done characters, and the ending is like something out of the Twilight Zone, but the movie also has a number of shortcomings.It's very talky -- nothing but talk, hardly a moment of silence. The dialogue seems more stagey than natural. The characters don't converse so much as declaim or emote. The dialogue doesn't seem witty as some have claimed, just bitter and cynical (for the most part).The visuals aren't very visual. The shots are mostly ordinary shots of whoever's talking at the moment. There's little character movement. This could easily have been a radio play.The relationship between Margo and boyfriend seems contrived. There's no apparent reason why they should be so attached to each other. It doesn't come across. In fact, they seem quite unattached to each other initially, but the movie changes its mind abruptly in midcourse.I'll confess a bias against actors acting about acting. It's the kind of self-referential, self-reverential stuff that bugs me, like news reporters reporting on each other instead of the news, or playwrights writing plays about plays. It smacks of taking oneself far too seriously. (Okay, it's a pet peeve, but there you go.)But despite these shortcomings, it's still worth watching to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film, but fell short in my expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine film, but fell short in my expectations.I read considerably well about this film, before watching it. Also, this film had some similarities to another film "Sunset Boulevard" which was released in the same year. While the latter was terrific in writing and wonderful in acting. This film, All About Eve is different in terms of writing and involves 4 principal women who have their friendships, their careers at stake.Eve Harrington played by Anne Baxter seems to be an extremely determined woman who goes to any length to get what she wants. From creating a false story to coldly intimidating her friend for a role in play, she is cold blooded and yet adorable. Anna Baxter played the role superbly and credit goes to the writing and her lines, more than half her job was done by the good writing itself.The next most important character, I saw was of Margo Channing played superbly by Bette Davis. She is generous and yet very possessive and has a humane nature under the embellishments of fame. She is indeed the true gem of the film and takes the script and writing to a high by her portrayal of the character. "Tonight I forgive all, I forgive Eve" can't be said in much more cold way than how Bette said. Great acting by a superb actress. Even the other women, like Celeste Holm who played Karen Richards or the final character that is "Phoebe" played by Barabara Bates or even Birdie played by Thelma Ritter are well written and played well. This is essentially a film about women more than men.The production design is superb and the music adds to the drama. I wish, the editing could have been better and the dialogs were crisp. Especially the long climax between Karen and Eve could have been cut short. Also, many moments would have been done away with reducing the time and also easing out the pace. Perhaps, the director Joseph Mankiewicz had been persistent to give detailing to every scene and thus made it the way it stand today. It's fine though but I wish it could have been greater than being just good, as per me.A 3/5 for this, I liked it nevertheless, yet did not fall in love with it. I loved "Sunset Boulevard" though. I expected this film to be better and maybe that is the flaw, it's just good by all means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"So many rare qualities"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 50s, as the old studio system fell into decline, the producer-directors and writer-directors began to muscle in. All About Eve, written and shot by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, was one of the first major triumphs of this new breed of filmmaker. Although it is about actresses, in it writers and directors are cynically lauded as those who "construct a tower so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on top of it", while stars are dismissed as "pianos" who ought to realise "they did not write the concerto". But upon seeing the performances in All About Eve, all one can say is what lights... what pianos! Let's begin with the skillful turns of Bette Davis and Anne Baxter. The styles of these two players, like their characters, are mirror images of each other. Davis, true to type, projects a callous and world-weary exterior, and yet I am struck by the depth and sincerity of her emoting, for example as she listens to Eve's sob story in the dressing room scene, or the tenderness she clearly feels for Gary Merrill. It's a depth that it is essential for her character, and yet sensibly she doesn't allow it to dominate, just letting it shine through at key moments. Baxter by contrast is a model of girlish innocence and boundless altruism, yet beneath the surface shows herself to be a treacherous, cold-hearted lizard of a woman. And like Davis's inner warmth, Baxter only reveals that in brief flashes. Hidden depths are something of a running theme in the acting here. Celeste Holm is ostensibly a naive and trusting figure, yet she expertly lays bare the strength of her character in later scenes. Even George Sanders's trademark suave veneer cracks once or twice, giving way to that sharp end of his cynicism which he normally masked.And yet, these supreme talents of the acting profession have been carefully orchestrated by one who has certainly styled himself a builder of cinematic towers. Mankiewicz was a brilliant arranger of motion pictures, and this was far and away his best effort to date. His direction is subtle on the surface - clear, direct shot compositions with no fancy tricks, an "invisble" camera which only moves to follow the actors - but Mankiewicz himself has hidden depths, and the shooting of All About Eve is in truth a work of considerable complexity. Although his aim was to draw attention the players in the foreground, his work is all about backgrounds. Take the opening scene at the awards ceremony. When we are introduced to the central figures, look at how unnaturally still the extras in the background are. It is the equivalent of shooting these principle players against a blank wall. When Eve goes to accept her award the tactic is reversed. The crowd claps excitedly while Davis et al remain eerily motionless. At other times Mankiewicz's use of backgrounds becomes a direct commentary on events, such as the shot of Davis next to a sign saying "Handle with Care".And so Mankiewicz is a true "tower constructor" of the type described in All About Eve. He is not a show off, and his work though elaborate is all about highlighting the performances and the characters. But it would be doing a major disservice to this wonderful cast to deride them as mere flashing lights, for to quote another picture concerning performance and production, even the most skilled conjurer cannot pull a rabbit out of a hat if there is not already a rabbit in the hat (That's from The Red Shoes, by the way). All About Eve may be shot through with pessimism about the dramatic arts, yet it is the very smoothness of its collaboration - the skill of the tower builders and the brightness of the lights, if you will, both of which are equally important - that make it an engaging and enthralling piece of movie-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If ever there was (is or will be) a film destined to have critics grovel over it, it's a film where a critic is the smartest man in the room and who gets the hot chicks. It's also appealing to all reporters/journalists in that sense. Another artistic technicality well played for an otherwise dull soap opera.It's apropos that the film itself is cynical and paranoid and promotes such a view of the world.It does manage to be an inside, self promotional, look at both Hollywood and theater and its vicious recursive circle of stardom. An early look at the transition from plays/theater to Hollywood and the desire even in the late 1940s to be a movie star. Not much else. It doesn't age well. It's more like a look at what life turned out to be during the 1950s.Like The Third Man (1949), it's composed of artistic/intellectual clever tricks (including ways around censorship) to hide a tedious story of self referential self importance. If anything, this post-war soap opera of seriousness where none is deserved is a reflection of one of the main failings of a film industry at the time that missed the full potential of a real life Betty Boop in Marilyn Monroe. Painfully uninventive like a typical critic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of an actress in decline, past her prime, offered at the last moment to an actress who herself was in decline and past her prime. The parallels between fiction and reality could not have been more blurred as they were during the creation of what has been considered to be one of the greatest movies about the theater and one of Bette Davis' most indelible performances. Starting from the link between Davis and Elisabeth Bergner via a remake Davis acted in 1946 called A STOLEN LIFE -- itself a version previously performed by Bergner, and snowballing into the anecdote that Bergner herself had been the apparent victim of an unusual admiration by a young female actress of whose identity and life little is known (unless you read Sam Stagg's book "All About All About Eve"), ALL ABOUT EVE is as interesting -- and at times, even more so -- as to its backstory to what was presented on screen as the final result.By 1949 Bette Davis was strictly on the way out. She had been in a 4-year slump with movies that were failing commercially even when they still got fair to good reviews, with the notable exception of BEYOND THE FOREST in which Davis played a woman much too young for her age and donned a black wig that made her look even older. Many of the roles Davis (later) admitted as to wanting to have played while she was still at Warner Bros. were going to her professional rival Joan Crawford; indeed, Crawford, relegated to second fiddle at MGM with hand-me-down roles Norma Shearer rejected, and coming out of her strong debut at Warner's with MILDRED PIERCE, a role Davis herself rejected and one that gave Crawford her only Oscar win, was now getting the better pictures at Warner's. From MILDRED PIERCE to FLAMINGO ROAD, Crawford was back on top, if at least temporarily so.Such a thing must have made Davis mad. Seeing that the camel's back had been broken with the failure of BEYOND THE FOREST, she was now a free agent, but needed work. PAYMENT ON DEMAND was a mostly forgotten film she'd made which did not receive a release until the 1951, and was so far the only job offer she was getting. The notorious story as to how she got the role of Margo Channing -- where Claudette Colbert sprained her back -- is the stuff of Hollywood legend, but it ensured Davis one more chance to assume a major role in a major movie. What she possibly didn't know was that this would be the one that would define her as a screen icon -- forever she'd be quipped with her most quoted line from this film: "Fasten your seatbelts -- it's gonna be a bumpy night." And she couldn't have foreseen that on set of ALL ABOUT EVE she'd also meet and marry the man who played her lover on screen: Gary Merrill.There is so much that can be spoken about this timeless classic. It's such an iconic movie, a thing of elegant beauty that hasn't been repeated since and one of the most quotable movies of all time. Again, highly recommended and a must-read is Sam Stagg's book which tells everything, down from the casting list for each role (at one point Gertrude Lawrence and Joan Crawford were up for Margo Channing), wardrobe, stories as told by the actors themselves, Celeste Holm's resentment of Davis on the set -- a thing that was probably Davis' fault, since she wasn't known for being social and Holm from then on took great offense and to this day remains offended. And on and on. Snippets of dialog that never made it into the film is presented in the book, and it's understandable: it would have bogged down the story a bit much. (Would it that Mankiewicz had done the same thing with his dialog in CLEOPATRA!) A fascinating book.And a fascinating movie that over a half a century later can still be seen for what it is: a scathing portrayal of backstabbing, backstage, and a complex study of a professional and social climber and what she will do to ensure success. Full of in-jokes that have to be heard to be believed, and one of the oddest pairings of a male-female dynamic in Anne Baxter and George Sanders who play a game of cat and mouse throughout with a terrific, sadistic denouement, it's one of the essentials, a movie that has to be studied in order to admire movies, not because of its visuals -- if anything, ALL ABOUT EVE fails in presenting ground-breaking visuals and opts for a play-like feel -- but for its entirety. Razor-sharp performances from everyone -- ranging from the film's major parts, played by Davis herself, Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, Thelma Ritter, George Sanders, Gary Merrill, Gregory Ratoff, Hugh Marlowe, to the minor players -- Marilyn Monroe, Barbara Bates, and Randy Stuart (or THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN fame).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After so many years of denying the fact that I would ever rent any of these, as I put it then, 'old chick flicks', I finally swallowed my pride and got myself "All About Eve" among others, and I have to say, I'm extremely glad I did.I was transfixed throughout this whole movie; it's listed as a drama but I found myself laughing all the way through it, not because all the lines were amusing but simply because it was just so enjoyable. I described it after I had watched it as like "a Walt Disney version of a Patricia Highsmith novel". The characters are just as enjoyable and the plot, almost a farce, really, is just as beautifully set up and makes you want to clap your hands at every twist.Bette Davis is stunning as the melodramatic Margo Channing, I loved every moment of her performance, I have to say. Anne Baxter was also brilliant as Eve, and George Sanders in his Oscar-winning role actually really surprised me, considering I'd never heard of him until I saw this (obviously more my fault than his).And the dialogue is to die for. Every scene is almost like an Abbott and Costello routine, with snappy remarks followed immediately afterwards by equally snappy comebacks, just thrown from one character to another as quickly as you please, and the result is brilliant. You really begin to love all of the characters and writer/director Mankiewicz especially. It's an ingenious film, thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. Five stars out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve was the award winning metafiction of 1950, a psychological study of someone who's willing to fake victimhood in order to get what she wants: the limelight.The film is about an ageing theatre star and the theatrical milieu of her day - someone younger, prettier and seemingly hungrier has come along as a slightly naive, star-struck admirer who ends up employed as an understudy, but her motives are not what they seem.The combination of real emotion, nuance, brilliant writing and acting make this film a standout. It is, by some peoples accounts however, a fairly modest production; there isn't any grandiose staging or 'cast of thousands' spectacle like in some old well-regarded classics. The film is about observation and intelligence though, not sentiment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Eve Is All About Women In Show Business &amp; Their Men!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nominated for a staggering 14 Academy Awards, out of which it won 6 including Best Picture, All About Eve is a classic amalgamation of brilliant direction, excellent screenplay, sophisticated production, outstanding performances &amp; sparkling use of humour and covers the themes of ambition, betrayal, self-interest, fame &amp; fate in the world of show business.All About Eve tells the story of Eve Harrington; an ambitious young woman who maneuvers her way into the life of Margo Channing, a prominent but ageing stage actress &amp; her circle of theatre friends, to pursue her very own interests on Broadway. Hiding her true nature with a well-worn mask of modesty, Eve's well-planned schemes ultimately lead to the downfall of Margo's career.Written &amp; directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, All About Eve opens on an interesting note by cleverly introducing all the relevant characters to the viewers before flashing back a year to portray Eve's meteoric rise from an outsider to the newest &amp; brightest star on stage, which in turn also adds a sinister tone to the devious means she used to get on top. And the script is just as good as Mankiewicz's direction.The screenplay brims with sharp dialogues, terrific use of humour, fleshed out characters &amp; wonderfully layered storyline and the entire plot is smartly narrated from start to finish. The greyscale photography &amp; fluid movements of the camera keeps a safe distance but patiently observes every character's actions. Editing is skilfully carried out but the last act feels a bit stretched as its runtime is slowly realised in those final moments.Coming to the performances, All About Eve features a marvellous cast in Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm &amp; others plus we also have Marilyn Monroe in one of her earliest roles here. Davis plays Margo with remarkable finesse and her performance only gets better as the story progresses. Baxter is equally fitting too as the manipulative Eve and this film is mainly her story, while the supporting cast chips in with strong contributions.On an overall scale, All About Eve packs in all the ingredients that one can find in any great feature, is a rivetingly told drama that's about women in entertainment industry &amp; their men, and from its opening moments till the final shot, maintains a firm grip on viewers' attention. Living up to its legacy, exhibiting an irresistible charm throughout its runtime, and powered by captivating performances from Davis &amp; Baxter, All About Eve is an absolute delight that comes thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Eve Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I think this movie was good. I think the plot kind of dragged on. Ten minutes felt like one hour and on top of it all, the film was very long?about two hours and twenty minutes long. This was a very bright film; black and white.One editing glitch I did notice was when the two ladies were sitting in the car waiting for the man to get help after the car after it stopped working. In one shot Margo is sitting up playing with the radio, then the next shot is of Karen, then it goes back to Margo. This time the camera angle was completely different than the original one. This was a very obvious mistake. I love the end of the film when Eve gets called out on all her wrong doings. It completes the film. I love how Margo grows up, gets married, and realizes that she doesn't need the younger kid, which she and Eve were fighting over, parts anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what superb filmmaking is all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1950 was quite the year for movies and it was All About Eve that came out on top at the Oscars. Personally, I would have to agree... strongly. This movie is phenomenal. Not only is it a solidly great film for its time, it's just a purely good film out of any sort of time context. It's witty, intelligent, charming, funny, and exciting. It's the story of the acting world and the colorful and competitive people who inhabit it. Eve, played by Anne Baxter, is a young girl who has huge aspirations for herself on the stage. Aging stage star Margo Channing takes Eve under her wing, only to discover that Eve is a conniving little girl who tries to steal Margo's job as well as her husband. The film is loaded with laughs, all perpetuated through rapier wit dialouge. The film is an excellent dramady with plenty of style and poise, rich and vibrant, gleaming with life and excitement.The best scripts are those that keep at a consistent cadence that never falters and never loses your interest. All About Eve has one of those scripts. There is a very gracious flow to the dialouge in this film, and it is also at a level of intelligence much greater than the average script. It is loaded with double entendres, parallelism, and witty metaphors. It's the kind of dialouge that works so smoothly and every transition and every exchange between characters is so seamless and perfect. Every scene provides some new element of excellence to the poignant dialouge. Sometimes it's sincere and dramatic, full of sophistication. Other times its very light hearted and airy, bringing about a lot of laughs that come from the heart instead of being just mindless entertainment. Then other times it combines the two. There are those scenes in the film where the characters go on rants and tangents, insulting each others intelligence and social ability, and it is all done so eloquently and is delivered without missing a single beat that you can't help but laugh in esteemed approval of the masterful wordplay unfolding before your eyes and ears.Of course where would a near perfect script be without excellent actors to deliver it? Nowhere. So its a good thing All About Eve has some of the finest actors of the era performing their most sincere and dedicated roles ever. It all starts with Bette Davis as Margo. Her performance is nothing short of stellar. The sharp wit of the dialouge flows so naturally from her mouth its as if she wrote it herself. You believe that she believes every last word she says and at no moment do you believe this woman on the screen is anyone but Margo Channing.The male roles of the film also shine, each in their own unique way. George Sanders plays Addison DeWitt, a prominent figure in the performance world who speaks with a sort of slow, well thought out sophistication to his voice. He adds a lot of the sarcastic wit to the film, but delivers his best effort in one of the most important scenes of the film, and it is astounding. Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe play the husbands of Margo and her friend Karen, and their performances are hilarious. They continue to further the profound development of the story and its statement on the acting world. Anne Baxter is the weakest link of the films cast as she doesn't have all of the presence necessary for the character of Eve. She's an undoubtedly interesting and is obviously an important character because if not for her we would be nowhere. In her final scenes of the film she is fantastic, but the build up to it makes it seem odd. Regardless, the film does not falter because of her.Films with this amount of fast paced brilliance to them just don't come around as often as you would hope. This film is a staple of the golden age of American filmmaking and rightfully so. It's got everything you need to make a truly great film and it not only satisfies but excels in all aspects. It is a truly remarkable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Films of the Fifties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"All About Eve" was the Big Film of 1950. It was a critical and commercial success and was nominated for a record 14 Academy Awards, a feat which has since been matched (by "Titanic" in 1997) but never bettered. Of those fourteen nominations it won six categories, including Best Picture. And yet it is a film completely different in style to anything likely to win Best Picture today. It perhaps illustrates the changes in film-making which took place during the second half of the 20th century better than any other Big Film of its era. Indeed, it is very different to most other Best Picture winners of the 1950s. It is not a light-hearted musical like "An American in Paris" or "Gigi" or an action film like "The Greatest Show on Earth", "Bridge on the River Kwai" or "Ben-Hur". It is made in the "filmed theatre" style of cinema, the sort of film which was shot in the studio and concentrated on dialogue and character development rather than physical action. (Such films were usually, although not always, made in black-and-white rather than colour). This was the sort of film which had dominated during the thirties and forties but which began to lose favour in the fifties as the studios demanded more in the way of spectacle. The film is set in the world of the theatre and reflects the mutual antipathy between Hollywood and Broadway at this period, something also referred to in "Singin' in the Rain" from two years later. Both leading characters are female. Bette Davis plays Margo Channing, a leading Broadway star- hugely popular, but beginning to show her age as she approaches forty. (Rather pointedly, her current play is titled "Aged in Wood"). Anne Baxter plays Eve Harrington, an obsessive young fan with theatrical ambitions herself. After Eve is introduced to the older woman, Margo befriends her, and offers her a job as her assistant. Eve initially seems well-intentioned and helpful, but it soon becomes clear that she is using Margo to further her own ambitions. "All About Eve" remains the only film ever to receive four female acting Oscar nominations. (Besides Davis and Baxter for Best Actress, the others went to Celeste Holm, who plays Margo's close friend Karen Richards, and Thelma Ritter as her maid Birdie for Best Supporting Actress). Despite this galaxy of female talent, however, the only acting award it actually won went to George Sanders as Best Supporting Actor. Sanders plays the gossipy, spiteful and sarcastic theatre critic Addison DeWitt, who both acts as the film's narrator and also plays an important role in the action. "Addison DeWitt", actually, sounds a much more plausible name for an American than for an Englishman- Sanders makes no attempt to hide his British accent- but the name seems to have been chosen symbolically, "Addison" being a reference to the eighteenth-century critic and "DeWitt" presumably a pun on "the wit". The role of Margo has become so closely associated with Bette Davis that it seems strange to think that she was not the first choice for it. Claudette Colbert was cast in the role, but had to withdraw with a back injury, and several other actresses were considered. Davis, however, was precisely the right choice to play the ageing Margo. (Coincidentally, "Sunset Boulevard", probably "All About Eve" 's closest rival for "Best Picture", is also about an ageing actress). In her youth in the 1930s, Davis was considered a beauty, known for her large, limpid eyes, but by 1950 her looks had faded although she was only in her early forties. (Colbert was five years older but looked much younger). She delivers what has become a legendary performance- arrogant and bitchy, yet also vulnerable to Eve's scheming in the battle of youth versus age. The film did much to re-establish Davis's career after something of a slump in the late forties. This film changed the way in which I regarded Anne Baxter. I had previously seen her as primarily a supporting actress, someone who only achieved leading lady status in films like "I Confess" or "The Ten Commandments" where the emphasis is much more on the male characters. Here, however, she emerges as a real star in her own right and gives a great performance as the cunning, manipulative Eve. (She also look stunning with that short, boyish haircut, something not all actresses could have pulled off). I can well understand why she insisted on being Oscar-nominated for "Best Actress", even though she might well have won for "Best Supporting Actress". In the event she and Davis both lost out to Judy Holliday in "Born Yesterday"; as I have never seen that film I will not comment on the wisdom of the Academy's decision. Holm and Ritter are also very good, and there is a brief but vital contribution at the end from Barbara Bates, an actress I had not previously come across. I will not enter into the controversy about whether both Eve and Addison are supposedly gay, except to say that this was not an interpretation that occurred to me, and that Eve's predatory designs on Margo's boyfriend Bill argue against it. There are films from this era, such as "Caught" and "Strangers on a Train", which strike me as having a possible homosexual subtext, but this is not one of them. "All About Eve" is not, officially, a comedy, but it has a brilliantly witty script, written by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, with far more wit and humour than many so-called comedies, and manages to combine that wit with a gripping psychological drama and some first-class acting. It is a long time since I last saw "Sunset Boulevard", so will not attempt to compare the two directly, but both must count among the finest films not just of the year but also of the decade. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All About Eve (1950)Droll, hilarious, edgy drama with an ensemble cast to die forThe sophisticated, witty, jaded, champagne-dripping world of All About Eve is implied even in the first words, drolly intoned by that deep voice of George Saunders, who plays a very lofty theater critic. As you might hope from such smart people, the repartee is sharp and fast, and the delivery is sharp and fast. Those are two different things--the writing, which is brilliant throughout, and which can afford to be overly flashy because we expect these sorts of actors and writers to be flashy, and the acting, led by Bette Davis.Director and writer Joseph L. Mankiewicz is at the top of his game, and you have a feeling he is dealing with the types of people he knows very well. The plot is actually fairly simple, made complicated by all this great dialog, and a series of small turns of event that never upends the single-mindedness of the young woman played by Celeste Holm. But there is a nuance to it all that you feel in the restraint of Holm's devious character, and in the acknowledgement in others of what they really want in their lives (love), and in the final moments, where bitterness never quite unfolds, and where we see that all the seeming backstabbing is normal somehow, and that if you are being stabbed it is probably because you stabbed someone else. All if fair in the world of theater, as in life at large.If this whole affair sounds like a play, it is played out as one, in a limited number of sets, and often with a handful of actors bouncing retorts and observations around like a volleyball. The one scene out of New York that I remember is actually shot with clumsy backprojection, the single technical flaw of the film, which is otherwise a typical product of the finely oiled Hollywood system of the time. Mankiewicz of course is one of those expert, underrated directors who was less interested in becoming an auteur and more interested in making films in the conventional way, but very very well. All About Eve is a perfect introduction to him, and to Bette Davis, for that matter, in a smaller lead role than many of her films where she looms larger than life. And he often gathers top talent around him, like cinematographer Milton Krasner and music director Alfred Newman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Eve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Joseph L. Mankiewicz (Guys and Dolls, Cleopatra), I didn't know much about this classic drama, but with a good cast list, I was willing to try it. Basically ambitious Eve Harrington (Oscar nominated Anne Baxter) is very fond of actress Margo Channing (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Bette Davis), and manages to get close to her boyfriend, and her friends Karen Richards (Oscar nominated Celeste Holm) and her play writer husband Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe), director Bill Simpson (Gary Merrill) and producer Max Fabian (Gregory Ratoff). All the big shots, except for cynical critic Addison DeWitt (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated George Sanders), believing she is only a naive and obsessive fan of Margo's, but Eve is much more cynical, manipulative and conniving than that. Using the lives of Margo and her friends, all along she planned to become an actress, and she achieves her goal of Broadway stardom, leaving a trail of unhappiness for everyone behind her. The end sees her accepting the highest award for any stage performer, and another fan wanting to see the now famous Eve, and it seems, this naive girl may have the same sneaky plans. Also starring Barbara Bates as Phoebe, then rising star Marilyn Monroe as Miss Casswell and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Thelma Ritter as Birdie. Baxter may not be the conventional wicked witch/bunny boiler/psychopathic bitch villain, in fact, she may not even by the right person for the role, yet even with a few appearances, she is a good light villain. Davis is very good as the emotionally wrecked actress, then little known Monroe makes the most of her few minutes, same goes for Ritter. I can see why critics complained about it being too chatty, and yet it is this, being witty and cynical, that makes the film very watchable. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay for Mankiewicz, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Alfred Newman, it won the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Eve Harrington was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, Bette Davis was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 17 on The World's Greatest Actor, she was also number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Womem, "Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night." was number 9 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 30 on Film 4's 50 Films You Must See Before You Die, and it was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie again and there are some things that bother me about it. Without giving away the ending it's hard to make my point, but I'll try. Eve and Margo reveal their true selves slowly to viewers and to the other characters, but they become less believable to me as the movie draws to its end. I don't blame the actors: they are consistently excellent. The writing is good and enjoyable to follow. It's the character development that is weak. Eve, Margo, and the others are sharply defined at the beginning of the film even though as viewers we have to wait for motivations to become apparent. Unfortunately, the basic dynamics of the characters don't remain true through the film.So even though I admire the acting, this film is not one that I will want to return to again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Other Movies Go For Broke With Wit Like This One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve is written with a consistent attention to stylization and lyrical perfection given to its dialogue. Whether it is truly realistic or blatantly theatrical is not a decision between a flaw and a pro, but between the nature of dialogue that is normally striven for by a logical writer and what could be beyond that nature and perhaps some new, inventive little flare, something to keep the audience determinedly on their toes. The film is loaded, and neatly limited modestly at the brim, with powerhouse scenes of dialogue, be they fiery arguments between infamous flamethrower Bette Davis and a co-star who dares to match her or dangerous, hardly predictable scenes tossed with threats and lies between others. To me, beyond the cast, beyond the direction, beyond the atmosphere of the scenery and cinematography, director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's script is what makes this movie the powerful light-refracting gem that it is.I will admit that this is my first Bette Davis film. I had never seen a performance by her before this film. I believe she has a mixture that always turns me on to an actor actress, a mesh of an extroverted, active, dynamic quality that allows them to act upon people and surroundings extremely quickly and with no inhibition and an intuitive, deeply emotional characteristic that may even negate the shallow emotional characteristic of the aforementioned quality, revealing a penetrating insight into people. Davis conveys this in the least challenging and most entertaining way, which is by playing herself, which is perfectly fine by those who judge that sort of thing because that is truly what was required of the role. She is not the light-refracting beauty one expected from a star actress in the silver screen era, but I believe she was still an untouchable star not only because of pure confidence but confidence so solid that one like Joan Crawford who would attempt to tamper with it would be thrown back as if it were a forcefield. What presence she has.Anne Baxter plays the title character, a character who is supposed to be Bette's match. As an actress, Baxter could never match Bette. Where Bette is completely natural in every way on screen, Baxter is not at all. Baxter looks and feels staged to us, because she endlessly stares off into nothing whenever she is speaking, and no matter how interesting she makes her monologue, she still unrealistically stares, and sometimes leans, into space. However, her saving grace is how beautifully she executed the very difficult and tricky role she played. Eve is a person who can never appear to be doing what other characters suspect that she's doing, and even more, she can never appear to be the sort of person that would ever feel inclined to do what they suspect that she is doing. She is the most secretive sort of mysterious personality, quite insightfully captured by the screenplay, which I once again complement, and also fleshed out very effectively by Anne Baxter, who despite her hopeless overtheatrical habits completely becomes Eve.The cast is consistently great. Celeste Holm as a playwright's housewife, a very honestly written character, is very effective in her fleshing it out. Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, and Gregory Ratoff are all very entertaining and likable. The doosie is Marilyn Monroe, who even with her few minutes on screen is very wooden. The outstanding man in the film is George Sanders, who plays theater critic Addison De Witt, one of the most intelligent and refreshingly practical and analytical characters I've seen in a movie. He is introduced as simply another one of the many people we will be seeing in the social circle of the film's main characters, even through the story he is partially narrating. Yet he slowly grows to be something more, and we are surprised to see the full extent of what his character is significant for. Sanders has a scene where he is disturbing and vindicating to us at the same time.All About Eve is full of what so many people don't seem to realize can be the most satisfying and fascinating quality a movie can have, in its writing, in its actors, in its direction, in its detail, and that is a razor wit to wield. It has all different brands of smarts, and we need more films like it today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambition &amp; Deceit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing cast and script work together to achieve magic in 'All About Eve'. This is one of the film legends that show what Hollywood film-making is truly all about.Davis gives one of her best performances ever as the ageing stage actress Margo Channing. Margot is pretty cosy in her nest with her circle of friends until an ambitious young woman, Eve, comes along. One might say that as Margo, Davis was simply playing herself. There is a lot of truth in that, as Margo's barbed sense of humour, neuroticism, warmth and professionalism are typical Davis qualities. Davis is simply brilliant in this role, as is Anne Baxter. A sorely underrated performer, Baxter definitely tops Davis for sweet cunning and measure as Eve.And the supporting cast...how fabulous are they? We have the great George Sanders as Addison de Witt, the cynical theater critic. Addison's the only one not fooled by Eve's plans, and delivers most of the sharpest lines in the film. Sanders oozes both charm and venom in a role that won him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Celeste Holm is much better here than in Gentlemen's Agreement, as Margo's best friend Karen. Her warmth and understated performance works well with Davis' paranoid theatrics. Delightful Thelma Ritter is just priceless as Birdie, and Gary Merrill is fine too, as Davis' beau (they were married in real-life at the time of making the film). Maybe the only downer is Hugh Marlowe, who has about as much screen presence as a cardboard box.Check out a young Marilyn Monroe in a small role as a would-be starlet who has been taken under Addison's wings. She gets some good lines as the dumb blonde she would be destined to play over and over again later years. Is it pure coincidence that Monroe gets the lines that parody Gable? Marilyn, as Norma Mortensen in younger years, idolised Gable as the perfect father figure. There's plenty of other occasion for name dropping in this film, with Fox stars Tyrone Power and Gregory Peck getting a mention, too. Smart marketing ploy, actually.There is a never a dull moment or spare scene in this film. It is rather long for a comedy-drama, but that just means more wit and humour can be added. Perfectly directed, this is one of the best satires of the acting industry you'll ever see. It also deals with universal themes ; ageing, ambition, deceit, the abuse of trust etc.Very entertaining 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Above Backstabbing Shines ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ultimate best film ever made about backstabbing individuals.Broadway veteran pro Margo Channing is fooled into taking in Eve Harrington, who supposedly idolizes her. Channing's maid,Birdie Coonan, sees Harrington for what she is, but is unable to convince Margo that Eve is dangerous.Eve is quite a character. In one movie, she nearly breaks up a friendship, destroys a marriage, and wins a major part in the Broadway production of "Footsteps on the Ceiling." That will be a memorable name always for me.The cast is top rate. This film marked a comeback for Bette Davis, and what a performance she gave as Margo. Anne Baxter is memorable as the cunning Eve. Gary Merrill, Celeste Holm and George Sanders are all in top-form as characters revolving about Margo but fooled by Eve as well. It is only Sanders, who won the best supporting Oscar as the cynical writer, who is able to turn the tables on Eve.Davis and Baxter were both up for best actress; a mistake, since Baxter belonged in the supporting division. Thanks to this divide, Judy Holliday won best actress for "Born Yesterday."Celeste Holm, as the caring but duped friend, Karen, and Thelma Ritter, as maid Birdie, were up for best supporting actress.The dialogue in this film is crisp.By the end, though winning an acting award for "Footsteps," a young aspirant is hot on the heels of Eve. She no less is from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, my alma mater. A **** school in a **** film.</fullReview>

A record 14 Oscar nominations for the cast and crew, it is as wicked and sophisticated as they come, with Bette Davis at her eye-popping, cigarette-swinging best as Margo Channing, Broadway's leading diva. Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington is deliciously calculating as the up-and-coming actress who moves in on Miss Channing, first ingratiating herself with Miss Channing, and eventually replacing her. The supporting cast is equally fine with George Sanders as "that venomous fishwife" Addison DeWitt, Celeste Holm as Margo's long-suffering best friend, Karen Richards, and an ethereally beautiful Marilyn Monroe as Miss Caswell, "a graduate of the Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts." Joseph Mankiewicz's script and direction are superb, with dialog so crisp and poisonous, it makes you wonder where script-driven movies have gone. Chock full of quotable lines, fabulous New Look costumes, and sheer irony. So thick and rich you'll be tempted to eat it with a fork but use a spoon to get every drop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fox's best movie for years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, "All About Eve" was one of 20th Century Fox's best movies for a number of years, with a memorable cast headed by the inimitable Bette Davis as Margo Channing - probably her best role ever, and one that merited an Academy Award. She was absolutely brilliant as the aging star, while in the remainder of the cast George Sanders stood out like a beacon as the caustic Addison de Witt (he, at least did get Best Supporting Actor). Anne Baxter was very good as Eve, and Celeste Holm as the best friend trying to be fair to everyone was just right. The story held interest right through to the very end, and the photography in Black &amp; White along with the music and script was first class. Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe, both light weights most of their career, were very good, while Marilyn Monroe's cameo role was interesting. It is a movie that can be seen several times without losing its punch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a legendary reputation and it certainly lives up to it. All the catfights, the backstabbing, the blackmailing... What an exhilirating film! The cast is beyond superb and the ending is eerie, but sublime. George Sanders alone is worth the price of admission. Those heavenly voice-overs keep changing the point of view, but it is always done so perfectly. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece that hasn't aged a bit and still revels in all its glory. Set in the world of the theater, we listen to all the various characters talk about Eve, and not surprisingly, there is no shortage of things to mention. There's a reason why that "bumpy night" is still being talked about!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It deals with the novice exceeding the star in the theatre. Yet "Eve" isn't just a reflection of any particular genre of show business. We don't see it happening, but the wisdom of people like Eve keeps sneaking up on us all the time...and bringing us down when we least expect it. Therefore, "All About Eve" still couldn't be extended to be just the entertainment industry, although the movies and "Sunset Boulevard" seem to take it all in their stride. It remains a wonder how a film made half a century ago still can retain a lot of its thought content value. THIS is a movie about the throes of human nature...and all in disguise of film epitome glamour, other lives and Bette Davis. At the time of release, it was viewed as provocative. In other words, Hollywood, still in the Hayes Code era but heading dangerously close towards the end of the Golden era, basically didn't like the truth. "Eve" is not made in the obscene sense of being provocative, but it is perhaps more for Joseph L. Manckiewicz's crisp writing and direction. "A Letter to Three Wives" is my personal favourite of his films, but it was that film which paved the way for his glory days at the FOX studios. It is not my favourite Bette Davis movie, but deserving credit, she brings home her strongest performance here by stealing the show. Anne Baxter, George Sanders and Celeste Holm, some of the strongest FOX studio supporting actors, all turn in respectable performances. Finally, Marilyn Monroe features in a small role, but noticable role, pre-exploitation period.Despite this, the film dipped a fair way short of my expectations. It has been more than a year since I viewed this film, and since it was during the period of early classics days, I could provide a better judgement of the film. This could be an indication that "Eve" is a film that I should have another viewing of. Perhaps bitchy soap opera type films don't always entice me...or perhaps "Eve" still pales to a more compelling "Sunset Boulevard" which remains more worthy of taking out Oscar's top golden statuette for 1950.

		<fullReview>The fact that "All About Eve" features one of the great Bette Davis's very best performances would in itself be enough to recommend it highly. Add in a host of other great actors and characters, with some of the best writing to be found in any movie, and the result is one of the greatest movies of all time, which most viewers remember long afterwards.The basic story is fairly simple - at the beginning, we see young actress Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) receiving a prestigious award, and for most of the film we go back to watch her rise to the top, mostly as seen through the eyes of those around her. Davis plays Margo Channing, who is Eve's role model, a great but now older actress who both affects and is affected by young Eve's career.There is a wonderful collection of characters, each with distinctive and interesting personalities. Their relationships with each other are fascinating, and the film makes full use of their potential. The dialogue is terrific, and the cast does it full justice. The characters and their lines are all perfect for the performers who portray them - George Sanders as the cynical and calculating columnist, Gary Merrill as the high-strung director, Hugh Marlowe as the sophisticated playwright, and so on through the entire outstanding cast. After watching this movie, whenever you see any of these actors again you may well think of them in these roles."All About Eve" is a testimony to how great a movie can be when it is based simply on the important basics of writing, acting, and directing. Anyone who enjoys older movies, or who appreciates good theater of any kind, will find that it is as good or better each time that you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'Good' Movie Is As Far As I'll Go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never watched this "Best Picture of 1950" until a couple of years ago because it just looked like one of those 1950s melodramas (translation: soap operas) that I can't stand, and it starred an older Bette Davis, who was only appealing to me in her youth in the 1930s. However, after hearing and reading so many rave reviews of this, especially on the IMDb Classic Board, and the fact it was out on DVD, I decided to check it out.I was glad I did. I liked it, thought it was entertaining and worth the 138-minute investment. I still didn't find it as good as advertised - at least for my tastes - but it was still a pretty involving story with good acting. How it could have been up for so many Academy Awards - 14, I believe - is beyond me, however.Neverthess, it's main attribute, as advertised, is the dialog which sparkles with "intelligence," as the Liberal film critic-elitists like to refer to it. It's a "smart" comedy, they say from their ivory towers. Make no mistake: the dialog is good, but I've heard just as good from some film noirs and other movies. Movies put more of a premium on that sort of stuff back in the days before computerized special-effects and limited attention spans took over.The best dialog came from George Sanders, playing a sharp-tongued theater critic. Davis was next, which is no surprise. Her career, thanks to her own real- life efforts to get good roles, was doted with characters that had good dialog. This role kept her Hollywood career going as it had been fading as she approached 40 years of age. She was beginning to look older than her years and many times that spelled "death" to an actress, but she was not the average actress.The only character in the film I couldn't stand was "Eve," by Anne Baxter, not for her role but for the way she delivered her lines. Baxter didn't do this at first, but as the film went on she kept finishing sentence after sentence with a whisper. It was extremely annoying and affected. People don't talk like that!Overall, for a film dominated by dialog for almost two hours and 20 minutes, it did a great job of holding one's interest. I only found one part that really lagged. It's a good movie - a well-crafted story - but putting in almost-mythical status as one of the greatest of all times, as some have, is a bit exaggerated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joseph L. Mankiewicz was a genius and this is his masterpiece, without a doubt! Mr. Mankiewicz's timeless tale for this film was something that paralleled the great writing of another author that knew the inside of the human race: Honore de Balzac.In this story about the theater, all the elements come together to weave a perfect movie, one that will endure the passage of time. Mr. Mankiewicz's screen play is about blind ambition and to what extremes does a person goes in order to realize that goal. The writer seems to be telling us that to Eve Harrington, her end justified the means by which she arrived at getting where she got.The cast assembled for the movie was the perfect blend of styles and acting ability. This film is dominated by Eve Harrington, who, Anne Baxter plays to perfection. We first see her as the adoring fan to Margo Channing, the star of the hit play on Broadway. She will do anything to get to where Margo Channing is. In a way, Eve is a user of the worst kind. She used Karen Richards, Margo's best friend in order to get in the theater world where she finally makes a splash.In that theatrical world, we encounter all kinds of sub species that tend to gravitate toward the limelight where others are shining brighter. They will do anything in their power in order to 'belong' to the glamour and all the things that go hand in hand in that circle.Anne Baxter was an amazing Eve Harrington. She was a young actress then, who showed a lot of talent and was perfectly cast for that role. Bette Davis makes Margo Channing come alive. Ms. Davis shows us what is to be at the top of her class and suddenly see her world begin to crumble, which in a way, it's the way of the theater. The theater and the movies are cruel to the stars that dare to age in front of our eyes. There will always be prettier and younger actresses to bask in their moment of glory in front of the adoring public, but watch out, never get old!George Sanders as the bitchy Addison Dewitt, is the maker and breaker of many a career. He has the power to destroy anyone that doesn't play by his rules. Mr. Sanders was excellent by being the cynic in a make believe land. In a way, the writer is telling us that even then, there was something rotten in theater critics that will ruin a play by just disliking it in the press. Celeste Holm is also effective as Karen Richards, a friend indeed, until she is used to give Eve her big break. Thelma Ritter is a delight to watch as Birdie, the wise maid that sees right through a phony when she sees one. Gary Merrill, George Ratoff, Hugh Marlowe and a young and fresh Marilyn Monroe complete the cast.Never before did a movie packed such an impact to reveal so much about the human comedy, as in this one. After all, that comedy, or call it tragedy, has existed since the beginning of time. All this because a brilliant Joseph L. Mankiewicz brought to the screen to dazzle audiences forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All About Eve is a 1950 American drama film written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck. It was based on the 1946 short story "The Wisdom of Eve" by Mary Orr, although screen credit was not given for it.The film stars Bette Davis as Margo Channing, a highly regarded but aging Broadway star. Anne Baxter plays Eve Harrington, an ambitious young fan who insinuates herself into Channing's life, ultimately threatening Channing's career and her personal relationships. George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe, Barbara Bates, Gary Merrill, and Thelma Ritter also appear, and the film provided one of Marilyn Monroe's earliest important roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magic of the Theatre !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'A Letter to Three Wives' was the only other Joseph L. Mankiewicz film that I had seen before watching 'All About Eve'. One can easily find links between the two films in terms of an auteur's style. In both films one can find an immense priority being laid on the writing and the dialogue which is very sharp and witty, instead of directorial flair in terms of visuals,although there are subtle moments of visual storytelling. Both the films share the storytelling techniques like the voice-over narration and flashbacks. I had thought that 'A Letter to Three Wives' felt very much like a stage play. The same has to be said vociferously about this film. Not only does it have a distinct play- like style when it comes to the storytelling and the showy, dramatic acting, but the film is also about the world of theatre itself. 'All About Eve' is in both ways a love letter to the theatre as well as a scathing attack on its players.Some of my analysis of the themes and other observations:1. Females in 1950s society: Margo is a huge star, but her position is as fragile as ever. This fragility gives rise to paranoia when she sees Eve making waves in her career as she knows her time is up. Karen represents a woman who has to remain satisfied with a secondary position in her life as she can't really do anything or achieve anything and has to experience satisfaction through her husband's work. One of the main reasons why she was so kind to Eve was because she saw a bit of herself in Eve and so wanted her to succeed and hence manipulated stuff to ensure Eve got to perform in one of the shows instead of Margo. In the end in order to achieve any form of happiness, Margo has to choose between her career and marriage. She can't have both as she is flirting with her sell/buy date when it comes to actresses in the theatre world. The ending shows that Eve's stay will also be temporary as the rise and fall in the theatre world for actresses is a cyclical process.2. Karma is a b**ch: Eve was in a way successful in driving Margo out of the theatre and replacing her as the new star. But at least Margo will still have a hope of achieving some sort of happiness in marriage with the man who loves her and whom she loves, Bill. Eve, on the other hand, as a punishment for her devious, conniving, immoral ways is forced in the end to sell herself and pledge allegiance to the devil himself, Addison Dewitt.3. Attack on the pomposity of the theatre world: The style of acting is very over the top especially in case of actors playing characters who are directly linked to the artistic process of the theatre world like Margo, Lloyd and Bill. I think one of the reasons behind this was to make the viewer feel distant from them and their world. But ironically we see that the whole world of the theatre gets shaped, heavy influenced and molded by people who are actually outsiders like the critic Addison Dewitt, the producer Max Fabian, Eve who was nothing but a fan and to some extent Karen who is just a playwright's wife but who manages to have a bearing on proceedings.4. Relationship between Margo and Eve: This relationship between an obsessive fan and her idol really reminded me of the same between Rupert Pupkin and Jerry Langford in 'The King of Comedy'. Eve, I think genuinely idolises Margo, but also wants to destroy her and replace her. This paradox is fascinating.5. Visual Storytelling: Observant viewers will be able to appreciate the subtle nature in which a harp and the words on its box is used to describe Eve's character. When Eve tells the false story of her past to Margo, Lloyd and Karen, Mankiewicz frames the shot in a way to make it look like Eve is giving a performance while the listeners are her audience which was exactly the case. Another great symbol was the stairway ladder visible beside Eve in the first shot where she appears in the flashback symbolising her future rise upwards in the theatre.Bette Davis plays Margo with the kind of authority and bravura that one would expect from her. 'All About Eve' shares some similarities with Billy Wilder's 'Sunset Boulevard' and Margo Channing is similar to Norma Desmond. Although I like 'Sunset Boulevard' more than 'All About Eve', but one has to concede that Margo is a more rounded and realistic character than Desmond in spite of using snappy lines and endless sarcasm. While Norma is an idea, Margo is a real middle-aged woman with insecurities and a heart in spite of her razor-sharp words. George Sanders as Addison DeWitt looks a bit like Jack Lemmon, but his English charm can rival Orson Welles in 'The Third Man'. Sanders owns every scene he is in. His cheeky looks, his voice modulations and those eyes, everything is so expressive and the deviousness of the character he plays adds to his charm. Of course Anne Baxter deserves a mention. She makes tonal shifts throughout the film in her demeanor and expressions. She proves to be a great juxtaposition opposite Davis.I think the only minor problem I had with the film was that in some scenes, Mankiewicz seemed to be engaging in self-indulgence to show off his written dialogues a bit too much in a flashy overly dramatic fashion. But that really is a nitpick.'All About Eve' is a great film about the theatre, about women, about fandom, about deception and so much else. Mankiewicz shines as a director/writer as he celebrates and critiques the world of the theatre, a bit like Addison Dewitt. Maybe there is a bit of Mankiewicz in Dewitt after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know of any movie that plumbs the depths of the human heart - or the empty cavity where one should be - to paint a blacker picture of it. Addison de Witt is repeatedly described as a snake, but even he, as he recognizes, is not as ruthless as Eve Harrington. Eve would truly kill her own mother for a good role - and remember the experience so she could play it convincingly on stage. She gives you the willies.Critics have raved about Bette Davis' performance as Margo Channing, and she is certainly wonderful in the part. As, of course, is George Sanders as the evil Addison de Witt.But what makes the movie so captivating through to the end is Anne Baxter. You desperately try to figure out when her Eve Harrington is acting and when she is being sincere. You want to know. But Baxter always leaves you wondering. Is she overacting just a LITTLE too much? Is she sincere? It's an astounding performance.And, of course, the script, which oozes venom, is brilliant. But we only appreciate it because it is delivered by great actors/actresses at the top of their form directed by the author of that script, Joseph L. Mankiewicz.This is a riveting movie. It is brilliantly made. You will enjoy every perfect minute of it.But you will have a hard time trusting even your best friend after you finish watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Study of Backstage Bitchiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Separating the hype from the truth is not easy, especially with an acknowledged classic like ALL ABOUT EVE. Some of its lines have entered Hollywood lore, especially Margo Channing's (Bette Davis's) line: "Hold on to your hats. It's gonna be a bumpy night." The film won six Oscars and revived Davis's career as well as giving George Sanders the role of his life as acerbic critic Addison de Witt. The supporting actors are all superb, notably Celeste Holm as the kind but spineless Karen who takes Eve (Anne Baxter) under her wing and ends up being blackmailed as a result.Thematically speaking, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's script exposes the emptiness of the awards culture that seemingly dominates the media landscape each year. Eve might pay tribute to those who helped her in her rise to fame, but the film shows how she wantonly abuses their generosity. All of her pronouncements are hypocritical, designed for a media accustomed to the sound-bite and the publicity photograph. Mankiewicz suggests that there is no basic division between the worlds inside and outside the theater; everyone simply plays roles and disrespects everyone else.Cinematically speaking, the style is fairly flat, almost theatrical, with many sequences comprised of shot/reverse shots interspersed with two-shots. On the other hand Mankiewicz has a flair for the suggestive; notably the portraits of Margo in her most successful roles festooned across the staircase of her expensive home, drawing our attention to the ways in which performance dominates her life. Or what about the shot of Maego standing beside a huge cartoon of her in one of her favorite Broadway roles just inside the theater where her play is being performed? Music is also used suggestively - just before Margo utters her famous line about the bumpy night, we hear Rodgers and Hart's standard "Thou Swell" on the piano, praising the charms of a woman. Later on in that sequence Margo storms upstairs in a huff to the sound of "Stormy Weather."Perhaps one aspect of the film that needs to be highlighted is the way in which it confirms dominant attitudes towards gender in early Fifties America, where women were expected to stay at home and support their spouses. Despite her performances as a theatrical grande dame, Margo believes that her life will not be fulfilled unless she marries Bill (Gary Merrill). And in a climactic sequence where the truth about Eve is finally exposed, Addison claims that she belongs to him.We are presented with a paradox at the end; whereas ALL ABOUT EVE provides at least three substantial roles for leading female performers, it still reinforces patriarchal values. And there's the cynical ending, where Phoebe (Barbara Bates) begins precisely the same process of hero-worship that Eve has completed in order to achieve her ends. All Broadway heroes, it seems, have feet of clay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are the stage performances?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve is all about Bette Davis and Anne Baxter. One an outspoken and uninhibited diva with a kind heart. She's always honest, even if it might hurt feelings, not in the least of herself. The other an innocent and naive wallflower that can turn into a skilled devious witch in the blink of an eye. The male leads are somewhat interchangeable, alike in looks and behaviour. Exception is DeWitt, who is slick, distinguished and amoral and therefore a rather interesting character. The scenes in which he confronts Eve are among the highlights. Marilyn Monroe has a small part, and, though we all know of her, eh, average acting abilities, she has a radiance about her that has future stardom written all over it. Oddly enough, for a movie about the theatre, we hardly see any scene in which theatre performances are shown. These scenes might have been left at the cutting table, but more likely it has just been a matter of indolence or incompetence. For a story about two top theatre actresses it must be quite a challenge to deliver these stage abilities on the silver screen, but quite essential too. It's nevertheless an enjoyable movie, where the interesting plot and acting power of the two lead actresses will keep you in your seat.</fullReview>

The drama that unfolded in All About Eve was realistic but also had that dramatic flair that we love in these movies and imagine is what's happening behind the curtains in a theater. Romance, fights, betrayal, etc. This movie had most of it and portrayed it really well, so that the audience (me) was caught up in the story lie into the end and not regretting that she had watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All About Eve (1950): Dir: Joseph L. Mankiewicz / Cast: Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill: Fascinating drama about confrontation when Eve Harrington appears backstage to meet Broadway actress Margo Channing. Eventually Eve replaces Channing thus receiving praise once reserved for her. Brilliantly written, and directed with insight by Joseph L. Mankiewicz who touches greatly upon the glam and vanity of being a star. It opens at an award ceremony where facial reactions play the key as to what follows through flashbacks. Bette Davis is remarkable as Channing who is growing older and feels her starlight fading away. Eve is played with great innocence by Anne Baxter whose transformation seems alarmingly true in the business but these decisions also bear consequences as she learns when her hunger for fame runs rabid. Great supporting work by George Sanders as a theatre critic used by Eve for success but perhaps he already knows this drill. Celeste Holm plays the wife of an author who specializes in plays. She discovers Eve thus opening an introduction to Channing. Gary Merrill plays a film director who is also Davis's much younger boyfriend, which also plays into delusional show business relationships. Easily one of the best and most inspiring films of the year. It has terrific art direction and a message about age, entertainment and infinity. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

I think a substantial amount of content could have been cut, and it would make for a tighter and more concise film. Karen (I think that's her name, the person who first introduces Margo to Eve), I can't remember almost anything about. Some scenes, like the ones between Addison and Eve, were really great. I originally thought I was going to have to write that Eve seems like a fake character, too happy and childlike, etc. but that changes. She goes through an excellent character arc. Margo was amazing, and really seemed to be a genuine, weary star.</fullReview>

I refer to movies that have opened up a separate room in my consciousness, where they remain as lodestones.All About Eve is so excellently written and performed, that one almost has a sense that one is watching a reality show, but a reality show with really smart and artistically gifted stars. In black and white. From a bygone era. The authenticity of the dialog, the natural acting styles, the subtle characterizations remind one of how rare such qualities are in the dramatic arts, especially Hollywood films. How amazing it is that films of this quality got made, and still do. How fortunate we are as the public that our lives are enriched by such movies. Yet, how unfortunate that they are the exception rather than the rule.My one quibble is a finale which I think was unnecessary. It has the feeling of being tacked on, almost like the producers felt that the main character had to face a kind of moral reckoning. Nevertheless, for 95% of it's length, 'Eve' is a priceless and exquisite journey.</fullReview>

Flash back to October, shy Eve is waiting outside of the theater for Margo Channing (Bette Davis) after her lead performance. The playwright's wife Karen Richards notices her there as always after every performance and invites her backstage. The obsessed fan tells them that she lost her husband in the war. Eve insinuates into Margo's life first by moving in and then becoming her assistant. Slowly, Eve schemes to undermine Margo and take over her place.This is one of Bette Davis' greatest role. She is pitch perfect as the aging star. Then there is Anne Baxter who personifies innocence at the start. It's a bit of a shock to see her spiral in her ambitions. It dawns on the audience that they've been had. These two great performances anchor a compelling story of the rise and fall of stardom.</fullReview>

This is another wonderful study of corruption, greed, bitterness and ambition.Bette Davis: such a horrible character, yet you can't help feeling sorry for her. Anne Baxter: such a sweet girl, but look what happens to her! George Sanders: the perfect balance of likability and sleaze.Taking the crown for me, though, is Thelma Ritter as Birdie. She doesn't have to say a word, and you can tell there's so much going on behind those eyes? just marvellous!Verdict: Humanity's sickening decay on glorious celluloid! Wonderful.

		<shortDescription>All About Eve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve is a realistic portrayal of backstage Broadway theater, with a classic story structure centering on the aspiring, conniving young actress developing a relationship and using her wiles to attempt to replace the aging diva. The movie is set behind the scenes of the theater, and the story revolves around deception and ego.The cinematography, lighting and set design, are all designed in a realistic manner, without any over the top elements. Costumes and makeup for each film are similarly very realistic.Bette Davis is superb in her performance as the aging diva Margo Channing. The dialog and acting performances are spectacular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This best picture award winner is an excellent classic drama film. The writing and dialog within this film is great. Even with such a serious topic, it is incredibly funny and engaging overall. In addition to its engaging plot, it's a visually beautiful film even though it's in black and white. With its setting within the theater, the acting is not only of high quality, but also very over the top in nature. I'm not the standard audience for a film of this nature, but I found myself very engaged throughout and the well over 2 hour running time didn't bother me in the least. Its engaging theme of homosexuality makes it incredibly topical and progressive film for its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Eve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"All About Eve" starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, and George Sanders was a great film because of the screenplay, the directing, and the acting. The dialog in this movie was also really good and powerful.Eve seems very nice and kind and think that she is obsessed with Margo so they try and help her out. In reality she just uses Margo's friends to help her be successful in the theater business. This shows that Eve is sneaky and a untrustworthy instead of being nice and kind like Margo and her friends thought. Many relationships and feeling change throughout the movie and that's what makes this movie exciting. This movie was great and I would highly recommend to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All About Eve is one of those films that you can tell got a special treatment from the Academy and possibly a little push because of it's subject matter. It's a film about the business. We just saw Birdman this past year win Best Picture and Eve was no different. Not to say it doesn't deserve it, but I think the Academy has a soft spot for those type of films. With that being said, All About Eve is a really good film. In fact, as far as I can remember this was the first major female driven film that won a ton of Oscars, though I don't think any of the actresses won their respected categories.I really loved the way the story was told. You see where it ends up, with Margo being disgusted of Eve for some reason, and Karen being somewhere in between. How did the relationship become so sour? And how does Eve, an unknown actresses, get honored? Well it's all so wonderfully told in the next few hours. I have to give major props to all the actresses. Whether it was Bette Davis' Margo, the heart and soul of the film and gives the performance of a lifetime. Or Anne Baxter, the sweet but manipulating Eve Harrington. Or even Marilyn Monroe who has a small role but is great as Miss Casswell. You can already start to see her charm on screen. The Margo-Eve apprentice storyline didn't become apparent to me till the it did for the actual characters. But it all made sense once it did, and you probably see this type of thing happen in real life more than you may think. George Sanders, who plays Addison was the major standout for the guys, but also because of that Shere Khan voice.This sort of story is timeless. The beloved actress is overtaken by someone much younger and more fit to the part, while behind the scenes issues ensue. It's funny because the story is about a play, but the story could really bode well for a play. It's also a very satisfying story. Especially when Barbara Bates' Phoebe rolls around towards the end. It's an all time classic film that stands the test of time and gave us some terrific female performances.+All performances +Unique narration style +Timeless story +Young Marilyn 7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually watched All About Eve a few years back on the classic movie channel. It is an interesting film with a great cast (notably Sher Khan from the Jungle Book! Hey it's a big deal to me). The story is a haughty and over-confident woman being upstaged by a younger, manipulative starlet. It's a powerful film and a cautionary tale about getting too comfortable in one's position of power. There will always been someone working to overpower you in your field. You must always remain on top of your game. The game is never over either, for in the end when Eve feels she has one, a new challenger appears, and she realizes with horror that she is now where her old opponent once was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Broadway legend Margo Channing (starring Bette Davis), is aging but not gracefully, has everything: a successful career, close friends, a man who loves her.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the film, I came up with the conclusion that the theme is female sexuality. Eve has no problem befriending women, and then stabbing them in the back by trying to sleep with their men. She pretends that she is innocent, but she uses her sexuality to get anything she wants. Flush with success, Eve reveals her true colors. First, she propositions Bill, but he turns her down. Next she blackmails Karen into arranging more starring roles for her. Then she seduces Karen's husband. This repression of sexuality is what gives her the ability to manipulate successfully. If you like the 1957 movie "A Face in the Crowd", you should like this movie too. Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight.All About Eve maximized the use of lighting effect in order to reveal the audience the entirety of what was happening. The movie depicted Eve Harrington's cunning exploits in the light enabling the audience to take a full view of how the seemingly harmless Ms. Eve reveal her true self in the course of the movie. The lighting seemed to have illuminated Eve's motives, revealing key facial expressions and body languages which may have been missed inappropriately by the audience where the setting may have been effected using low-key lighting.Mankiewicz also demonstrates how to effectively use the "single take" technique. As Karen hatches her scheme to strand Margo on the side of the road, she sits down in front of a fireplace with her back turned to the camera. Voice-over narration reveals her inner thoughts, but instead of cutting around to a front close-up of Karen's face, Mankiewicz holds the shot from across the room behind her, showing her head in front of the crackling fireplace. The fire becomes a hint to her mischief in this scene, an anomaly to her otherwise kind character.This is a good film. It's all because of Eve that we too can look at this film and realize that success at any cost is not success for us or for Eve.</fullReview>

Superb film with exceptional acting and directing, and has one of the best-written screenplays in cinema history, filled with witty lines, originality, and biting cynicism.

		<shortDescription>An acting showcase, with brilliant performances top to bottom and a great script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deservedly won for Best Picture from the Academy, along with five other awards. There will be spoilers ahead: I admit freely that I didn't fully appreciate this film the first time I saw it, more than 40 years ago. Then, I considered it merely a very good film. Subsequent viewings have caused me to revise those views. Previously, I thought Sunset Blvd. and Born Yesterday were better. My opinions of those two haven't changed, but I now believe that All About Eve is even better than they are.I'm not even going to do a brief summary of the plot, which I would normally do these days in a review like this. But though the plot is quite good and one of the film's virtues, it's secondary to both the dialog and the acting, which take this film from being very good to great.Memorable lines drop like leaves from a tree in autumn in New England. It's one of the most eminently quoted and quotable films ever made. I could have built this review entirely out of the dialog from this film and managed a credible job just by doing that. While all of the significant characters have memorable lines, the character with the most memorable lines is probably Addison de Witt, played marvelously by George Sanders, who deservedly won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar-and he may not have had the best performance in the film! Bette Davis, in a tour de force performance as the lead, Margo Channing, walks away with the movie, even as Sanders steals some of their scenes together. Davis had the misfortune of giving what was probably the best performance of her career the same year Judy Holliday did Born Yesterday. Great as Davis was, Holliday was arguably even better.Anne Baxter, as Eve Harrington, was also nominated for Best Actress and two Supporting Actress nods were given to Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter, losing out to Josephine Hull in Harvey. Holm's performance is slightly stronger than Ritter's, mainly because it's a stronger, more thoroughly developed role. Ritter's is primarily that of acerbic, slightly jaundiced gadfly Birdie and is more one-dimensional.I would be remiss if I didn't point out that Marilyn Monroe has a brief but memorable performance as one of Addison's dates. Even her character has a few memorable lines. It's a great script for actors and the actors go to town.This film is available on both Blu Ray and DVD and is well worth having. Most highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb drama.The story of a woman, Eve (played by Ann Baxter), who ingratiates herself into the social circles of a famous theatre actress, Margo (played by Bette Davis), and her theatre-centric friends. After a time it starts to look as though Eve's motives and methods aren't as innocent as they seem... A great story of manipulation, social politics and ambition. While you think you can see how everything ends up, how they get there is still very interesting. Plus, there's a twist or two in store...Superb performance by Bette Davis as the curmudgeonly, jaded Margo. While Eve might be the character in the title, Bette Davis gets the most screen time. Just about every line she utters drips with cynicism and is worth a soundbite/videobite. Very quotable.Ann Baxter is great as Eve. Good support from George Sanders, Gary Merrill, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe and Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe also has a minor role.Davis and Baxter got Best Leading Actress Oscar nominations for their performances (losing to Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday). Holm and Ritter got Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominations (losing to Josephine Hull for Harvey).An absolute classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first read the synopsis of this film, I was not very excited about watching it, regardless I pressed play and soon found myself completely immersed. I found the first few minutes of the film to be interesting because I wasn't sure what was happening nor who was speaking, but gradually the narration became clear and the story through it's flashbacks pulled me in almost immediately. I was so eager to know what would happen to this young girl, and how her idol would react to her presence. Then it was not her presence to which the famed theater actress began reacting to, but everything else. It was an interesting and beautiful film to watch. I thought all the characters were phenomenal, especially Bette Davis' character. She played her so well and brought so much life that despite her jealous fits you still sympathize with her and can't help but like her. To me this made an impact because it kept me interested even though I had several reservations about watching this film, not only that but I still find myself thinking about it. That small fact makes it a memorable and fantastic piece of art.</fullReview>

Memorably, Margo lights one up after being woken up at 6 in the morning, instead of going back to bed. How's that for healthy habits? Besides that, the movie was alright. I totally saw the ending coming, but it was still interesting to see it play out, the last shot is very cool, and if you think about it, metaphorical (I'm not gonna spoil it.). Bette Davis' acting is so unbelievably over the top its like the part was written for her. I did really enjoy the parts where the rolling would stop and one of the characters would narrate over. I thought that was a very interesting way of giving us all the back story we needed, as well as breaking the fourth wall in such a charismatic way. Anyway, for a predictable plot line, its a very unusual and remarkable movie for its time. I thought it was pretty cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one of those movies you just can't go wrong with. It has a great story, great actors and a great director at the helm.It's a movie that received 14 Oscar nominations at the time and took home 6 of them, including the one for best picture, in the same year that movies like "Sunset Blvd." and "Born Yesterday" were nominated. It's a stylish and very well done movie that from a cinematic point of view is a superb one, even when its moments and emotions are obviously exaggerated for its cinematic reasons. It doesn't matter since "All About Eve" is a real movie movie, made for the big screen and written for the actors to shine in it.Bette Davis is truly fantastic in some of the movie its moments but still I feel that Anne Baxter and George Sanders perhaps deserve even more credit for their roles. It after all is also Anne Baxter who plays the true main character of the movie, at least in the second halve. Because of this both Davis and Baxter also got nominated in the same category for best actress in a leading role. Of course not something that is very usual. Both lost out however to Judy Holliday for her role in "Born Yesterday".It's story progresses nicely throughout its 138 minutes of running time. It perhaps gets a bit predictable after a while, especially for todays audience but the class and style this movie got made with keeps you watching- and interested throughout its entire running time. The script provides the movie with a couple of great dialogs, which in return brings out the best of some the actors. It's a real story that got character driven and could had basically been about anything and still would had made a great movie. One fine multiple Oscar winning production from Darryl F. Zanuck and director Joseph L. Mankiewicz.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not "The Lady Eve"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humdinger of a "backstage" movie, featuring writing, acting and directing of the highest order. Made in 1950, this is a new type of movie for a new decade...if that sounds fanciful, well, perhaps, but certainly the biting realism and surgical-like exposure of the needs and greeds of the theatrical fraternity (and sorority) transcends anything I remember coming from Hollywood before this.Like the very best page-turning novel, this movie compels you to watch, no make that witness, so caught up does the viewer get, scene succeeding scene as you absolutely can't wait to see just where the plot goes next, how the characters end up and even just for the next great line - they come in waves, breakers at that! Davis is magnificent, now fuller of figure, her looks fading - the 50's were not a great time for her as fashions changed in favour of "method acting", but she gives a fabulous multi-layered, almost valedictory performance, starting out as the caustic queen of all she surveys who's checkmated by the machinations of on-the-make not-so-innocent waif Anne Baxter in a career-defining role.In truth it's all about Margo and Eve, but there's great support too from the whole ensemble, particularly George Sanders as the lewd, vile critic, who brings Eve to heel and Celeste Holm as Margo's devoted friend who fails to see the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing until said wolf has come between not only her and Margo, but even her and her husband. You could cut yourself on some of the barbed remarks delivered here, so sharp is the dialogue, every word a weapon, fitting for a movie about the theatre-world.The only thing that didn't work for me in this otherwise brilliant piece was the tacked-on ending when Eve learns that turnabout is fair play as her own little "Eve" appears on the scene, much as she did her own "girl from nowhere" entrance herself with Margo - this despite the technically superb closing image where mirrors imitate art literally! The scene itself though is such an artificial comedown after the climactic showdown between Sanders and Baxter, where they act their socks off as they sock it to one another.On reflection, if only one of the three Oscar-nominated main players (Davis, Baxter and Sanders) was to get the award, (Thelma Ritter deserved hers too in support - shame she disappears about half-way through the film), it's right that it was Sanders who won. Perfect practice for his later vocal outing as "Shere Khan" in Disney's "Jungle Book", he is the sleazy, easy serpent who destroys Eve's self-made Eden as he snakes his insidious presence into every nook and cranny.An epochal film then, with endings (Davis' career) and beginnings (Baxter and Marilyn Monroe in a telling early role). Say goodbye to Hollywood indeed - things got a lot bumpier in TinselTown after this mould-breaking feature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All About Eve tells the story of maturing Broadway diva Margo Channing (Better Davis) and the plot to usurp her crown by the seemingly adoring stage-door Jane, Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). Eve first gets herself hired as Margo's PA, then understudy, and is soon after Margo's director-boyfriend and her circle of theater friends. A short story, "The Wisdom of Eve" by Mary Orr that ran in Cosmopolitan magazine was the source of the script. Orr based the character of Margo Channing on German/Austrian actress Elisabeth Bergner (The Rise of Catherine the Great) who once had a would-be Eve in her life; a young actress named Martina Lawrence who (according to Orr) "?lied to her, deceived her, did things behind her back, and even went after her husband."In a rare Academy occurrence, both Davis and Baxter were Oscar nominated in the same category (Best Actress), which is generally believed to have canceled each other out. (Judy Holliday took home the award for BORN YESTERDAY.) The film garnered a record 14 nominations and seven wins including Best Picture in 1950. Look for ravishing Marilyn Monroe, typecast as an aspiring starlet in the party scene. So folks, fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night!Named to the National Film Registry in 1990.</fullReview>

After repeated viewings, subtle character traits emerge: Karen wants to be liked by everyone at any cost: "Eve, I've just heard the most wonderful things about your performance," which is said so that Addison can see how kind Karen is, even though Karen herself was responsible for "arranging" that particular performance... Margo is so vulnerable yet none of her friends really want to see that side of her... and the men are idiots. Even after Eve is exposed for what she is-- a lying bitch-- they STILL rally to have her star in their play, just because she's a fine actress and will make money for them: Lloyd, Bill, Max-- they all succumb! Margo is the least cynical person in this movie, because her character is colored with lots of shadings. She's not just "playing Bette Davis." Margo Channing is kind, clever, tough, compassionate, and the earlier-mentioned vulnerable. Watch this movie to see some wonderful characterizations, a fabulous script, and a truly over-the-top ending!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joseph L. Mankiewicz made his masterpiece here with All About Eve, a smart, sassy and completely captivating film about the life behind the curtain of the theater world that may in some instances mirror the world behind the film industry. Bette Davis resurrected her career with a tour- de force performance that is nothing short of exemplary. Anne Baxter is perfect as the sneaky, conniving Eve trying to do all she can to get ahead. Gary Merril, Hugh Marlowe, and Celeste Holm also give fine performances to complete the ensemble. Nevertheless, George Sanders gives the finest performance as the smart and sinister Addison DeWitt, an influential critic who has a major role to play in this event.Above all, the script is what makes this a classic film in its own right. Mankiewicz, just like he did in his previous film A Letter to Three Wives, perfectly balances the transitions between all the main characters. There isn't a dull moment here and by the end, it is a surprise as well as a satisfying look at backstabbing and deceit. This is a near-perfect movie that gets better and better with each viewing. Great acting, solid direction and perfect writing make this a true classic of the Golden Age.</fullReview>

It was all about Eve but Bette Davis had the strongest character in the movie, her performance in the party scene towards the middle of the movie is the most enjoyable part of the movie since that's when all the characters in the movie come into one frame and you can see the real dynamism between them all.

		<fullReview>Another AFI film off the list. Watching All About Eve, lots of things I'd heard over the years clicked and made sense. I heard the classic line, "Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night" I finally saw a Mankiewicz film, who I'd heard about for quite some time (Although I may have seen The Virginian) And last but not least, I realized why All About Eve was listed AFI's Heroes &amp; Villains list, and deservedly so.Anne Baxter put in a near-perfect performance as the title character, playing Eve with just the right amount of subtlety and charisma. I also really liked Bette Davis in the role of Margo Channing. I was reminded of Gloria Swanson's chilling performance as Norma Desmond in Sunset Blvd. Both characters are obsessed with their own stardom and have a desire to control their surroundings. (Both films also have similar beginnings as well) Ironically, both films were released in the same year.For a film that relies &#xfeff;predominantly on dialogue between the many characters to tell the story, I was surprisingly engaged throughout. This is proof that you don't need action to tell an entertaining story.All About Eve also has another ending that I really liked and fit the story perfectly in a circular manner. This is definitely a film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Around Eve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A special moment at the Sarah Siddons Awards when a new talent shines...the talent of a 'Junior - a golden girl, a cover girl,' young and pretty Eve who looks so innocent, grateful and fresh while receiving the desirable statuette for the role of her life. It seems that we already know all about Eve at the glimpse of her modest gesture. Yet, we soon realize there is a lot to be revealed for the sake of honesty between the award in her hands and her speech of gratitude; a lot in the drama fully equipped with classy entertainment and clever dialogs. The girl's heart is as old as a theater where applause gives all satisfaction but...each theater has its stage and its wings.As a holder of many awards, including the Best Picture Oscar, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's movie has been acclaimed as one of the most significant movies ever made, one of the 1950s' gems. Truly, more than half a century later, we can still say that the film is a captivating experience. Yet, its strength does not lie in innovative camera-work, great sets nor special effects. ALL ABOUT EVE relies on clever screenplay and absorbing performances. Its major strength, in other words, lies in the film's theatrical nature. Here, let me quote James Berardinelli who states accurately that "ALL ABOUT EVE stands out as one of the best small-scale dramas ever produced under the Hollywood system" (2003). He adds that the film "could easily be mistaken for a movie adaptation of a stage play." And from within the truly clever script and the stagy nature emerge brilliant performances.Although Anne Baxter as the title character calls viewers' attention naturally due to her duality, we get to know her thanks to other characters around her. As naturally as life can appear...a person is perceived better by others than by oneself. Viewers call their attention towards those people in the lead, particularly Bette Davis as Margo Channing and George Sanders as Addison DeWitt. They are not only given some best lines in the film but also portray their characters with real charisma and climactic focuses.BETTE DAVIS: There are many reasons why we can openly say that this was one of her greatest roles, a real milestone in her later career. Why? This part not only re-established the actress after her farewell at the Warners Studios and welcome at Twentieth Century Fox but Margo is a sort of character Bette was born to play. Bette and Margo...a lot of parallels between two women! Bette's primary contribution is her own personality: her strong straightforward attitude, charisma of an aging star, pretentious with producers who leaves 'peace and quiet for the libraries' striving to be on the top, jealous of women who are too many things for a man she loves. 'Liebestraum' by Franz Liszt appears to be merely a 'cheap sentiment' that she detests. Davis admitted her confusion as for where the fictional personality ended and the real-life personality began. Although her roles galore are worth attention, this performance of hers is a must-see.GEORGE SANDERS: As the narrator of the story and an intensely dry Martini of the drama, his major merit is distance to all characters and his 'rapport' with viewers. He is certainly 'nobody's fool' who is 'essential to the theater' and to both Margo and Eve. Sarcastic, sympathetic at moments, cold in emotions, a perfect observer who leaves us all with a breathless delight. His lines occur to be the main entertainment of the storyline that raise unique movie fans' experience. Similarly to the director, he also seems to psychoanalyze the characters around. Sanders as DeWitt makes the entire story truly believable and inspiring. He simply leaves a viewer with pure admiration for the performance that vibrant. Sanders's best moments include the sarcastic talks with young Marilyn Monroe as Claudia and acting as a sardonic 'master' of disguised Eve in the harsh talk filled with 'boxing terms.' ANNE BAXTER: She has a hard role, supposedly the hardest one, because as the title character she cannot allow herself to be predominated by other cast. Ms Baxter, as one of my favorite actresses, absolutely rivets me as a shy Margo's fan who takes a chance of a lucky evening and visits her idol in her dressing room. There, she submits herself to the self-expected emotions and desirable impressions from her listeners. She bursts out with all her passionate fan's love but no hysteria. And, viewers along with Margo Channing allow themselves for a delusive sympathy for the young Eve. Then, her task is to reveal her true nature and her means that, at first, appear so good and honest. Then, we realize that she would do much more for the part that good, for the goal that ambitious and the career that promising. Does she manage in executing that? I think she does it well artistically but we, as viewers, no longer like her, she disappoints us as a character and, consequently, major appreciation is not of Eve/Baxter.SUPPORTING CAST: There are two people who are most memorable as an extra ingredient to the whole drama's taste: Gary Merill as Bill Sampson and Thelma Ritter as Birdie. Mr Merill as Margo's lover delivers some best lines about the theater, about his own dilemmas and accurately depicts a young man in this reality. Ms Ritter is excellent at her doubts about Eve. The matter of liking the ambitious fox is rather an argument than an answer...until Eve stops acting as if Margo were a 'queen mother.' Some outstanding moments, delightful dialogs, and riveting performances...a great achievement you will never forget!Slow curtain...the end...Although the show on stage is over, it goes on offstage. Knowing the wings equals to knowing all when the winner gets her trophy and all around Eve are not content with everything. All except one...a 'replacement' to come who learns the cruel maxim: The end justifies the means...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An aptly titled masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People rave about Bette Davis in this film, and duly so. She's wonderful. But, for me, Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington is tops. Not only a favorite performance of mine, but character too. I put the performance up against entire careers. George Sanders, for whom I have a very high opinion, is at his best also. Celeste Holm ? whom I'm delighted to say is still among the living and working as of 2010, no less ? is indispensable. The demise of Barbara Bates adds a poignancy to the final scene as Phoebe stands before the mirror wanting success "more than anything else in the world." More than anything, a film is its characters. All About Eve exemplifies this by combining perfect casting with writing of the wittiest kind. The Killer to Killer scene where Addison unravels Eve's fictitious life is one of my favorites, period. She is loathsome, yet I can't blame him for being so caddishly enamored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Eve commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve included an all star cast of characters including Margo Channing portrayed by Bette Davis, Eve Harrington portrayed by Anne Baxter, Addison DeWitt portrayed by George Sanders, Karen Richards portrayed by Celeste Holm, Bill Sampson portrayed by Gary Merrill, Lloyd Richards portrayed by Hugh Marlowe, Max Fabian portrayed by Gregory Ratoff, Birdie Coonan portrayed by Thelma Ritter, Miss Caswell portrayed by Marilyn Monroe and Pheobe portrayed by Barbara Bates. The classic film All About Eve owes its fame to an incredible director/writer, Joseph Mankiewicz. Mankiewicz created a script and mixed it together with an incredible cast of performers almost as if the roles were created for the individual actors based on their true-life personalities. All About Eve is a story about Margo Channing who is a Broadway star who is growing older. Margo invites a fan into her home only to learn that she is trying to become famous herself and has set her sights on Margo's life as a star. The theme of the film All About Eve, is the pursuit of success. Eve Harrington wants to become famous in the theatre so badly that she will do just about anything in order to climb her way to the top in the fastest manner possible. Eve is a caring person on the surface in order to get in close with those that can help her to maneuver her way into stardom to the top. However,under the surface she doesn't care about anything or anybody and doesn't care who she destroys in her quest for fame. Addison sees the true person that she is and begins manipulating her in order to prevent her from ruining the careers of any more actors. Bette Davis is a cigarette-smoking strong, independent woman in the film. As the character of Margo nears a midlife breakdown Bette Davis plays the emotional roller coaster incredibly. Bette Davis has can give credit to this role as that which made her famous. George Sanders is the theatre critic Addison Dewitt in the film. His performance is incredible as he convincingly conveys cutting remarks to the actors almost as if he enjoyed the power. Thelma Ritter is not very well bred in the film. Birdie Coonan plays the unmannered, wisecracking character perfectly. Celeste Holm plays a housewife who is gentle natured on the surface, however obvious jealousies are bubbling inside of her. The performances of all of the actors blend together perfectly in order to create one of the most famous films of all time which is loved by generations of all ages. The character of Eve, a Broadway actress who is growing old is compared to the performance of Gloria Swanson who played an aging star in Sunset Boulevard. Both Davis and Swanson were nominated that year for the Oscar award of best actress, but the award went to Judy Holiday for her performance in Born Yesterday. The lighting, costumes, makeup, and set were all designed to portray the glamour and wealth of American actors in the 1950's, which was then present day. All About Eve is about the struggles of an aging star compared to those of a younger actress trying to make it to the top. The film was originally filmed in black and white therefore; careful consideration was given to the lighting. Many of the scenes were shot with lamp lighting giving a soft glow to the room. Frontal lighting and was used to illuminate the actors and it appears that filters were used when shooting Davis in order to give her a softer, more glamorous look. The costumes were circa 1950 with the women in glamorous gowns ornamented with jewels and the men in classic suit and tie giving the viewer a glimpse into the long forgotten glamour of actors of the last century. The all-star cast of All About Eve, the sets, the costumes, the makeup, and lighting were successfully give the viewer the feeling of being there in the room with Eve through the struggles of an aging Broadway star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: We begin at the end, were the young actress Eve Harrington is presented with a prestigious award. There, the cast around her remembers how it all came to this moment. How they found Eve around the stage door, apparently the devoted fan. They took her in, gave her a chance and she used it to all it was worth. Although being in the company of prominent theatre professionals, and despite given an award for a play later, Eve gives the performance of her life to play all angles, to rise to the top, quickly and at all costs. Only writer Addison DeWitt sees through her, but instead of revealing her he gives aid with small advice, as another little project of his.Comments: I find it is prudent to be careful when seeing old dramas, even when they are lauded and awarded as All about Eve is. They might be anything, a stellar classic or a boring slow movie that is just beyond me how everyone thinks it is so great. All about Eve is close to be the former, it is great, despite being quite long at 138 minutes (I believe). It is one of those movies where the sum is greater than its parts.First off, and most important always, is the groundwork. The story. It is complex, intricate and not too apparent. It carefully examines its main characters, but not too quickly, it reveals small tidbits here and there, gives a small hint. It is a drama but seem to lend a lot of qualities how to develop a story from the genre of mysteries or crime. But also there is a hint, small but always there in the background of humor. A witty one-liner or remark or the behavior of a diva. It is a splendid story, keeping at least me in its grip during the entire run.Second, there is the cast. Cast is nothing without a good story, but a good cast can let a story shine. This cast does. Anne Baxter is splendid as the coldly manipulating but oddly passionate Eve. Bette Davis is almost better, in part due to the more manic character of Margo. Supported by a good cast of Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe and, in my opinion (he did get an Oscar for it), especially George Sanders who plays the devious, equally manipulating, Addison DeWitt.Not to mention Marilyn Monroe. She got a small role, really not very important to this story. She could have been excluded and not be missed. But with her looks, and her delivering her few lines it is apparent, at least in hindsight, that she would be a future star.And everything just fits together. This is a true classic, a gem that is one of those you should see.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, an 11 if possible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve is my idea of a perfect film,(and I am 17) beautiful and brooding at the same time. People consider this as one of the finest films ever made, and I cannot disagree. This and Shawshank Redemption are actually films that deserve to be in the top 250. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous, and the script is sharp and focused with great lines such as "Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night". The direction is excellent, and this is further advantaged by a terrific cast, a very good subject matter and sumptuous costumes. I couldn't help being captivated by Bette Davis's performance as Margo Channing, her presence in the film is actually the film's main merit. Davis was an incredible actress, and while not exactly pretty compared to Maaureen O'Hara and Rita Hayworth and not very easy to work with at times, she always brought a sense of command to all her roles, especially in this film. I still think that All About Eve is her best film, I honestly do, and she is well supported by a terrific supporting cast with the likes of the idealistic Anne Baxter and the suave George Sanders. All in all, a beautiful film, that is a must-see, if you haven't seen it already. It is quite long, but it is well worth watching for Davis's performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"All About Eve" is still a record holder today with 14 academy award nominations and 6 Oscar wins, including best picture and best director for Hollywood veteran Joseph Mankiewicz, who also won an Oscar for his literate and witty script! A favorite of the critics, "Eve" is considered by many to be screen legend Bette Davis's greatest film, confirming her title as the "First Lady" of Hollywood.Among Hollywood celebrities of the Golden Age, no actress is better remembered than the beautiful, sophisticated and talented Bette Davis, who was nominated for the Oscar in this backstage drama of the Broadway theater for her performance as the aging prima donna, Margo Channing, target of her two-faced understudy, Eve Harrington, played by Anne Baxter in another academy award nominated performance.This black comedy of the backstage world of the theater charts the rapid rise to the pinnacle of Broadway success by an unknown young actress, Eve Harrington, who is ruthless in taking advantage of anyone who is willing to help her, including her bitchy patroness, Margo Channing. Actress Anne Baxter puts in a stunning performance as the two-faced Eve, by turns sweetly innocent or wickedly scheming, depending only on which is more likely to advance her career. Baxter and Davis were both nominated for the best actress Oscar, while the all-star supporting cast garnered three more nominations, with George Sanders winning the best supporting actor award for his darkly comic turn as snobbish critic Addison DeWitt.Having starred numerous times on the Broadway stage, Bette Davis was a natural choice to be paired with "All About Eve" writer and director Joseph Mankiewicz, who just a year earlier had won a pair of Oscars for "Letter to Three Wives," an outstanding drama on the theme of marital infidelity. It wasn't only Mankiewicz's phenomenal success that made him the ideal director for Davis, but also the interest he shared with his star in presenting women as independent and strong-minded ? tough as any man.No discussion of "All About Eve" would be complete without a mention of the Oscar winning costume designs of Edith Head, who is responsible for the supremely tasteful high fashion costumes in "Eve." Edith Head won more Oscars than any other woman in the history of the academy awards. Her gorgeous gowns have adorned Hollywood's best loved leading ladies, including Mae West, Ginger Rogers, Olivia de Haviland, Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor and countless others.Ironically, "All About Eve" was remade in the 1970's, not as a movie, but as a stage play on Broadway and the aging actress chosen to play the role made famous by Bette Davis was instantly recognizable to all fans of the film as Miss Davis's original co-star, Anne Baxter ? making it seem as if Eve Harrington had finally succeeded in transforming herself completely into Margo Channing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All About Eve came out in 1950, the same year as Sunset Boulevard, Billy Wilder's subversive portrayal of Hollywood and its actors. Mankiewicz was equally scathing in his look at the world of Broadway stage, portraying the mythical ruthlessness and petulance of stage actors. Both were big hits, and All About Eve was nominated for a record fourteen Oscars, winning six, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing. It's the best film about theatre that I've seen, also happening to say more about the film industry too. Sunset Boulevard might be the film about stars that dwell in the glory days of the past and live in self-delusion, but All About Eve shows how they got like that.Like Sunset Boulevard, All About Eve tells its story in the form of a flashback. It all kicks off with the presentation of a prestigious stage-acting award to the eponymous Eve Harrington, accompanied by the commentary of theatre critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders). He introduces us to the players in the world of Broadway before we go 9 months back in history before Eve was a star. The film then charts the story Eve and how she has wormed her way into the acting clan. She does so by getting into a circle of theatre friends around an aging (and insecure about it) actress Margo Channing, whom she attempts to be a protégé of, using her a persona of friendliness and self-deprecation to mask a sinister plan of getting to the top.All About Eve is an absolute treat in terms of acting. The role of the older actress, Margo Channing, was considered for a range of in-form actresses, from Gertrude Lawrence (wanted script changes that the director did not), Susan Hayward (too young), Claudette Colbert (pulled out back injury), Marlene Dietrich (Mankiewicz didn't love her), and Ingrid Bergman (would not leave Italy) before Bette Davis was finally chosen. And it's the role of her lifetime, playing a character that ran only too true ? a brilliant actress, but one who felt her time was running out. Bette Davis knew she was handed a dream role when she was cast as the resolute diva caught up in the throes of mid-life crisis both on- and off-stage, and she's amazing her in performance. She's selfish and tough yet at the same time, vulnerable and insecure. Getting suspicious about her increasingly distrustful follower Eve, Margo lets her friends know that she doesn't trust her, though they, taken to Eve's put-on niceness, disagree, mistaking her fear for jealousy and harshness. Not willing to resolve the problem in a dignified way, Margo goes on a rampage and has a go at anyone who comes near her. Bette Davis was born to play Margo Channing and, in my opinion, is even better than Swanson in Sunset Blvd. She can be a catty cow or a coy pussycat, and Davis loves every scene she gets to tear into. At the same time, however, she evokes real sympathy for Margo. The film may be titled All About Eve, but Margo is and always will be the real star of the movie.Her supporting cast are to die for. Celeste Holm is excellent as Margo's sensible best friend, who at first is on Eve's side but eventually sees how conniving she can be and how ruthless she is in climbing to the top. When she took on the narration, I just got the feeling that things would turn out alright for Margo. She's the closest character to any of the audience throughout the movie, as, she is pretty much a spectator herself. Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe are a joy in their respective roles as Margo's boyfriend and playwright. George Sanders plays his trademark role as the cad with such cynicism and unfriendliness that it's no wonder he bagged the Oscar. As the diabolical theatre critic, he has some of the best lines of the movie. Thelma Ritter again proves why she is the best supporting player in the biz - as coarse but loyal Birdie Coonan, a member of Margo's "drone". Anne Baxter is pretty good as the sneaky Eve, though obviously my opinion of her performance is tainted by the fact that I despise her character (realistic as it was). There's even space for a Marylin Monroe cameo, in which she steals the show in the dumb-blonde role that she would carry for the rest of her acting life.All About Eve's screenplay is another one of its assets. Written by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz from the Mary Orr play "The Wisdom of Eve," it features strong characters and great dialogue that is witty, bitching and biting. Despite its running time, at nearly 2 and a half hours, it never drags on. Each of the characters are so perfectly drawn, you could imagine them doing things just like that in the 50s. Femininity, aging, betrayal, manipulation and ambition are just a few of the themes touched upon in All About Eve. It's funny, but it's also a lot cleverer than it looks. It's got melodrama, yet somehow never goes over the top. All About Eve takes the age-old story of a young performer buttering up an old one, with the intention of usurping them, but makes it into something new, something utterly brilliant. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A quite fascinating incite into literally backstage performances of actors and their careers.They say "write what you know about", and I'm sure the whole cast &amp; crew that made this film, could relate to at least some parts of the story. Very character based and subtle in parts, a great study of the politics, inner workings &amp; motivations of people and their careers.Anne Baxter manages to eventually dominate this film, even though persistently giving a meek, almost irritating performance, cleverly masking her ultimate intent.I guess Davis seems to be pretty much playing herself, still there's plenty strong indications, signs and a genuine empathy from her part. I also liked the party scenes which managed to give another dimension to another type of "performance" from all involved.At least 5 or 6 characters juggle the required balance to this film, all seeming individual and understandable which I think must be very hard to achieve.There's a lot to this film and I'll probably see more into it if I watch it again, it's so full of intricacies. Not a full on macho-action flick, but an absolutely gripping plot &amp; character based study into the ultimately changing position of people within their careers.A brilliant example of a very well made film from people with a clear understanding of how to do their bit best, for the greater cause.Watch out for an early appearance from Marilyn Monroe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ALL ABOUT EVE is a brilliant masterpiece of a film that is unique in that it is so cinematic, but its emphasis is on the word rather than the image. That makes the film more like a play than a movie-- and ironically the story is the best movie about ambition, and Broadway stage actors ever made. This is probably the wittiest, the bitchiest screenplay ever written! This is also Bette Davis' best performance in a movie. (What a blessed but ill-timed coincidence for her that Gloria Swanson was creating the spectacular Norma Desmond in SUNSET BOULEVARD the very same year- and then that neither actress won the Oscar that year as they cancelled each other out in the voting!)The whole cast is wonderful!

		<fullReview>I like this movie,it's full of stinging wit and dialogs,although it's written by a male chauvinist,Joe Mankiewitz. The notion seems absurd nowadays that women can't have a career and marriage,too,but it has to be taken in the context of the times. The only problem I have is Eve is so transparently phony that I'm surprised the supposedly hip theater crowd doesn't see right through her. Anyway,I love the comeuppance scene where Addison tells Eve about all her lies and how she belongs to him. Ann's voice drops from sweetly phony to guttural scowling with panache. It's almost a shocking transition. Everyone in the cast is good but I like Ann Baxter. Incidentally,Claudette Colbert was supposed to be Margo but she dropped out because of a back injury. The idea was there was supposed to be a similarity between Margo and Eve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All about Bette.............and Eve too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to start by saying that I absolutely love older movies and this has become one of my favorites. I saw "All About Eve" like 10 years ago, but as I am only 24 years old, well, you do the math. Suffice to say, although I liked it, I didn't quite understand it the way that I do now as an adult.....and I imagine I'll understand it even more in another decade and so on and so on...Bette Davis is MAGNIFICENT in this film. Though I am a Bette Davis fan, I am also a very tough critic, as I am a writer of screenplays and novels. I cannot say that I agree with all of Bette's Oscar nominations, in that a good few of them were given based on the popularity of the film and, well, because she was Bette Davis. I can't say enough about her performance in this film though...I think that the character of Margo worked so well for her because it hit so close to home. She was 42 and Margo was 40, She was a talented aging actress and so was Margo, etc. etc.... I love that the film is equally dramatic as it is comedic and Bette captured it so well. I don't want to spoil the film by any means, but look for the equally heart-breaking and hilarious scene titled "Coming Unglued" on the DVD. This is still during the time in the film where Margo is the only one that is on to Eve's plan. Just look for Bette, standing on the stage and swinging her purse back &amp; fourth, screaming at the play-write, "You may change this star any time you want, for a new, and fresh, and exciting one, fully equipped with fire and music. Anytime you want, starting with tonight's performance." It is amazing!! Anne Baxter as Eve is amazing as well and I just live for the moment in the film where she stupidly laughs in Addison's (George Sanders) face and he slaps her back into reality...LOVE IT! Celest Holme is also great. Her performance is very real. I don't think that she get the credit that she should, as she never over-acts, but still gets her point across...It's a wonderful film with wonderful performances, but to me, it's "All about Bette"...</fullReview>

"All About Eve" seems to bridge the gap to some extent between the old, slick movies of the '30s and '40s (where you always knew you were watching entertainment) and the grittier, more realistic material that began to appear more and more during and after the '50s. The performances are incredibly good all around (particularly Betty Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders,) a fact that is obviously enhanced by such a strong script.I still have not seen Billy Wilder's "Sunset Boulevard", which is allegedly the one of these two Hollywood on Hollywood commentaries that stands up better to time, but it is on my short list!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While on a very relaxed vacation recently with my two younger sisters, I was surprised to learn that neither had seen this gem. So we took along my VHS tape (which I gladly relinquished to one of them, since I'd just recently acquired the new DVD version) to the beach house we'd rented for a few days and, at first, reluctantly closed the drapes on a picture window overlooking a spectacularly moonlit bay! But I once again was enthralled from the first moments of George Sanders' voiceover and my sisters agreed that watching it was worth the brief respite we took from gazing upon the awesome natural beauty outside that window which so enhanced our time together."All About Eve" has it all (except, perhaps, color cinematography, not at all necessary, of course): a pitch-perfect cast, Joe Mankiewicz at the top of his form as writer/director, one of Alfred Newman's most subtly tasteful music scores, and top-notch professionals working their magic in all of the crafts that contribute to an absolutely satisfying viewing experience.It's a bit dated, especially that scene when Eve, Margo and Bill go to the airport and waltz to the gate with nary a security guard, screening device, bomb-sniffing dog, or a harassed and impatient fellow traveler in sight! Boy! Those were the days!My only complaint is Thelma Ritter's too-brief role as Birdie. But she did get some of the most delicious lines, including that one when she comments on Eve's sad (but utterly fabricated) tale, told to the film's main characters assembled backstage in Margo's dressing room: "What a story! Everything but the hounds snappin' at her rear end."Whatever one can say about the tyranny of those moguls of the major studios, you have to give Darryl F. Zanuck credit for shepherding this one to the screen. Its status as a box-office winner, its multiple Oscars (and even more nominations) and the enduring pleasure it affords those of us who have watched it more than once confines the few nay-sayers to a small minority, indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't heard about ALL ABOUT EVE, what planet are you living on? It's one of the most referenced films in history; it sneaks into single-white-female films ever after; it has a brilliant cast and script and direction... and, oh yes, it scored 14 Oscar nominations (equalled only by the not-as-witty-or-worthy 'Titanic') and 6 wins. Even if you haven't actually *seen* the film, you just can't consider yourself a movie fan if you haven't at least heard of it.There is so much to dwell on with this film--the direction, the script (zingers flying so thick and fast it would take years and about 100 viewings to get them all straight, much less memorise them!), its clever themes. What makes it stand out, though, really is the cast that was assembled to bring it to the screen. Bette Davis never gave a finer performance than her Margo Channing here--at times shrewish and a harlot, at others vulnerable and little more than a child. Who could have pulled it off but her? Ann Baxter too does fine, subtle work as the Eve of the title: it's a difficult role to pull off with the proper complexity that will allow for varying interpretations of the character. Baxter manages it. The supporting cast is fine as well, Celeste Holm (almost unrecognisable from her turn in 'High Society') as the gullible good friend Karen; Gary Merrill playing Margo's paramour to great and believable effect; and yes, the Oscar-winning George Sanders as the ultimate slimeball, Addison DeWitt. And who could forget Marilyn Monroe in her small part? She glitters--all "fire and magic"--even in the ten minutes of screen time she has.A fine, fine film--one of the best of the backstage films Hollywood was so fond of producing. Brilliant writing, with the story told through interspersed different points of view. Great observation, as well, of some of the things that make women, especially career women, tick. Yes, it *is* somewhat sexist, with the claim that whatever career a female has, she must ultimately work at being a *woman*. It's not a belaboured point though, thank goodness. In the final analysis, ALL ABOUT EVE is definitely a classic film that truly deserves the label of 'classic'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All about great acting and storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Margo Channing (a glorious performance of Bette Davis) is an aged Broadway-legend. She has about everything she's every wanted: success, good friends and a man who truly loves her. Channing also has a big fan, the young and ambitious actress Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). In a clever way and with a pitiful little story she succeeds in manoeuvring her way into the live of her idol: Margo Channing. Channing feels sorry for the young woman and employs her as her secretary. That: she shouldn't have done, because soon enough the real Harrington shows up as well as her cruel intensions of becoming a star. By all means, the over ambitious Harrington WILL get to the top and eventually succeeds in taking the place of Margo Channing. Channing only figures out too late of what is happening and she's the victim of her own kindness. In the mean time, Eve has finally made it to the top. All that is left behind is a trail of unhappiness and destruction.Joseph Mankiewicz made a true film classic in 1950 with "All about Eve". This picture got 12 Oscar nominations and eventually won 6 of them. Bette Davis didn't get an award in Hollywood, but she got one at the film festival in Cannes where she got her prize for best actress. For Marilyn Monroe, who only played a small part, "All about Eve" was her definite breakthrough. She's actually a very beautiful woman. The rest is history..."All about Eve" is classic all right and I personally thought it was a good film too. But in my opinion the film is a little overrated. First of all, I think "Sunset Boulevard" (released in the same year) should have received the Oscar for best film, not this picture. Don't get me wrong! This film has a great storyline and even better acting performances. But, instead of giving "All about Eve" an award for best picture, they should have given Bette Davis an award for best actress. She's absolute outstanding, although I'm sure there are certain similarities between her character and herself that make her performance even more realistic. The directing wasn't bad, but I can't say that it is a true Oscar-worthy achievement. If you compare THAT to what Hitchcock did so many times, you'll find it even more ridiculous to hear that the English director never got to hold that little statue once. About the story itself: I really liked it, because it had some nice twists. But I think it's a pity that the ending wasn't as good as the rest of the film. Still, this film became a huge success and an instant classic.I liked it. I thought it was a good film, but the 6 Oscar-awards coming from 12 Oscar-nominations seemed a little too much. Personally, I find other classics (that got less awards) much better than this one here: "The Maltese Falcon", "Vertigo" or "Citizen Kane". But there is no accounting for taste, is there?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All great movies have one thing in commom: it can be said of them that they "only get better with each viewing." There is no higher praise and "All About Eve" is one such film. The directing is good, not great, but that is in part by design; the reason the film looks "stagey" is because it's a movie about the theater, the "stage." Apart from the acting, of course, the most brilliant aspect of this marvel is the dialogue. I am not exaggerating when I say I could reel off three hundred lines of that film at a crack! I also like that director Mankiewicz took on some then-controversial mores. It is obvious that premarital sex is happening, the George Sanders character is so venomous that I think Mankiewicz STUDIED George Gene Nathan or something. Ignore those who call this film cynical; this is a slice of life in the theater of the late 1940s to 1950, and Broadway reviewers are known to be some of the harshest critics in the world; if you can't handle this, avoid the film. My own favorite strategem employed by Mankiewicz is during the party scene, when they are all sitting on a staircase. Some question if all the hard work is worth it, the business is a charade, and so forth, and the Ann Baxter stops them and equates applause with an orgasm! Brilliant! Says she in this scene, "Why if there's nothing else, there's applause. &lt;i&gt;It's like waves of love flooding up over the footlights and enfolding you&lt;/i&gt;." Ha! If you have ever complained about a modern film having a poor script, SEE "All About Eve." You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing I could add to what has already been said about this movie: It is terrific.I find it interesting that in the 50s, Eve Harrington was considered a moral criminal. When she is exposed by the character portrayed by George Sanders, she is humiliated and embarrassed because she was caught, not because of what she had done which only added to her list of crimes.Modern viewers who see this movie for the first time would probably wonder what all the fuss is about. The scheming and back stabbing done by Eve Harrington to move up the ladder of success is now common practice for women and men who want to rise to the top of their respective professions and anyone who reaches the top in todays work force, by whatever means, is admired and respected.Eve Harrington was ahead of her time, however I find this movie to be timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great picture. But not only was the story intelligent but so was Joseph L. Mankiewicz because he added a certain irony to his gem because he chose Bette Davis and Celeste Holm to play two good friends in the movie whereas they couldn't stand one another in real life.  As usual, Bette is terrific as Eve, an unsensitive, tough theater actress who is if anything rat. Anne Baxter is equally as her biggest admirer who has her own plans for herself by sticking close to Eve. As for the male actors, it is George Sanders's show all the way in his best supporting actor winning performance.  As good as the movie may be, the best part of it is certainly the script which never lets down the characters. It's a smart, clever picture by one of the century's best directors.

		<shortDescription>....one of the greatest films ever made....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made, "All About Eve" combines the finest acting, witty dialogue, sparkling tongue-in-cheek humor, and a highly-entertaining storyline. Bette Davis plays Margo Channing, an aging star of the stage. Anne Baxter plays Eve Harrington who claims to be Margo's most adoring fan. One night, Margo's dearest friend, Karen Richards (Celeste Holm), discovers Eve lurking around a stage door during one of Margo's performances, waiting for her to come out. A flattered Margo takes the seemingly innocent Eve under her wing. But we soon discover the adoration is really obsession, and Eve is actually out to take over Margo's romance and career. The crazed Eve's manipulations are a hoot to watch and Baxter turns in a beautiful performance. Some amazing effort went into the scenes in which Eve's "Jekyll and Hyde"-like transformation from sweet innocent into devious witch are shown. The appeal of this film classic is made even greater by George Sanders, as critic Addison DeWitt, and his jaded, but funny commentary. Also, Marilyn Monroe in a bit part as a young starlet (what a stretch!) is a true gem.The backstage intrigue of this film rivaled that of the tumultuous on-screen doings. Davis reportedly neglected each and every member of the cast and crew once she fell in love with co-star Gary Merrill who played her on-screen love, Bill Sampson. And from day one, Davis and Holm disliked each other so much that they didn't speak one word to each other unless they were in character. To top it all off, Davis was apparently hell-on-wheels and a viciously jealous woman who automatically disliked every other female. Monroe later claimed that Davis was a "mean old broad". This movie was, deservedly, the darling of the 1951 Academy Awards, winning six Oscars (including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Sanders, and Best Director for Joseph Mankiewicz). Of note that year was the Best Actress category. Davis was such a huge favorite to win, but Gloria Swanson was also up for her eerie perfromance in "Sunset Boulevard". Swanson was also considered by many to be a shue-in. However, due to both actresses' extreme popularity, Davis and Swanson cancelled each other out and Judy Holliday won for "Born Yesterday". In 1998, "All About Eve" was listed by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 Greatest American Films. Yep, this screen classic is not to be missed. Each viewing of this stylish and snappy classic is indeed a fun and bumpy ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All About Eve is perhaps the most perceptive film ever made and the American theater. Wickedly funny, yet with the foresight of it's era, perhaps the most grounded film of it's day. We are introduced to the characters as they sit through a knowing, yet curiously boring speech at the Sarah Siddons Awards (today, it would be the Tony's). Addison DeWitt, that creature of the theater, introduces us to the majority of the cast in a voice over effect. Surprisingly, most of the cast reacts as if they can hear every word Addison is saying (if you don't believe me, watch Bette Davis' and Celest Holmes' reactions especially). As Addison comes to end of his recitation, he introduces us to the character who the film is ostensibly about, Eve Harrington, the actress being honored by the old actor's speech. She also seems to react to Addison, believing the attention being paid to her is only her due. At that point, just is Eve is about to accept the award, the narration shifts to Karen Richards, the playwright's wife, the "lowest form of celebrity" as she herself says. It is important at that juncture that Karen continues, as she is the woman who has unwisely unleashed Eve on the theater, and it's greatest star, Margo Channing. One never not believes that Margo is the greatest star. Even the fact that the young upstart has momentarily diverted the spotlight, it will always return to Margo. We then see most of the cast backstage in Margo's dressing room the night Karen introduces Eve to Margo. Even at that early moment, Eve knows just exactly how to worm her way in, to use her affected guilelessness to her advantage. Eve continues to work her scheme, unaware that she has been noticed by someone who understands her all too well, Addison DeWitt. Their teaming will cause the havoc that this film wrought. But Eve will find herself trapped by her unholy alliance, and by a young woman who knows that Eve is every bit as gullible as her rival, Margo Channing.Is this the Best film of 1950. The Academy thought so in 1950, though now, most critics prefer Sunset Boulevard. The central performance in All About Eve, though, is more realistic and therefore to me the better performance. But there was no way Hollywood would ever have give the Academy Award to Bette, or to Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard. Their performances hit too close to home for the Academy and they would never have rewarded those performances.The most jarring scene for me in the film is when Karen and Margo are sitting in Karen and Lloyd's car, out of gas on a deserted New England road. Margo give a speech that was EXACTly the speech Hollywood (and to be fair American society) expected in 1950. When a great actress tells Karen (and the women in the audience) that none of it is worth while without a man. Remember that this was 1950. A woman as bright and strong as Margo Channing couldn't do all this without a man in her life and be the little homemaker. While it provides the catalyst for Margo to return to her fiancée director, Bill Sampson (played by the man who would become Bette Davis' fourth husband), to me it is unnecessary. Margo did NOT need a man to be complete, however, Eve could never have survived without a man as an audience for her conniving.The performances in this film are as brilliant as the dialog, with one minor flaw in my opinion. Bette Davis is simply glorious, possibly not the best performance in her career, but the one she NEEDED to give at that point in her career. George Sanders is splendidly oily as Addison. Thelma Ritter as Birdie Coonan, Margo's assistant and confidant, is a wonder. The one off kilter performance is unfortunately Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington. She is fine in the earliest scenes, as the nervous fan, but too obviously smug as the woman who uses her friends to get what she wants. The performance is still better than most of the performances in films at that time, though Bette Davis herself could have played the part of Eve better.Probably the best comedy Hollywood ever made at the end of it's Golden Era, it is a film that requires multiple views to truly understand.</fullReview>

The script is crackling with smart alecky, bitterly funny dialogue--the dialogue is like scratching an itch--you want to hear it over and over. It has the cyclic structure of all the greatest stories--the young actress at the end doing the same thing to Eve that Eve did with Margo. The picture with all the mirror images that ends it is perfect and illustrates the universality of the theme. You couldn't remake it as a movie. It might work as a musical or as an opera.

		<fullReview>This film is like fire and dry brush. The two women have the potential to explode at any moment. It's also about one of the most villainous characters to appear on a screen, and, yet, to her fans, she is the darling of entertainment. This is about two actresses who are at the top of their games, facing off like a couple of gunfighters or boxers, shadowboxing, waiting for the right moment. The great thing is that Bette Davis's character could be a true victim, but we know enough about her to know she ain't going to take this lying down. She's aware of the betrayal of her kindnesses and the empty flattery of her foe, but she also knows that she isn't dealing with a lightweight. The loaded verbiage, point counterpoint, is just amazing. The younger woman believes that she is the rightful heir to the throne and is willing to do anything. There are numerous supporting characters, who ply their respective trades to this movie, especially George Sanders, who is a master of pomposity, much like Rex Harrison. The movie works at every level, script, pacing, and acting. What more can we ask for?</fullReview>

Considering how strict censors were back then, you would expect they would not allow some of the more risqué double entendre.Besides very sophisticated dialogue, the characters are amazingly complex. They may simultaneously love and hate someone, and feel various shades of emotion between the two. Modern movies rarely show such complicated characters who can't be neatly pigeonholed as good or bad."All About Eve" was doubtlessly thrilling to see at its debut, and is equally entrancing now.

Can you imagine this being re-made? I'm sure most of those who love this movie cannot. It is the most perfectly literate and exquisitely directed movie from an era when Hollywood was the world's center of genius creativity in an art form that was less than 50 years old at the time.

		<shortDescription>Bette's best and a true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One really could not ask for a more perfect film. One of the reasons, often neglected today in Hollywood, is that it had a phenomenal script. Such witty, intelligent dialogue. See 100 movies of today, and you won't find its equal. A second reason - a perfect cast. Bette Davis, who filmed her role in a mere 10 days and had to have oil treatments because of a throat problem, is monumental as Margo Channing. It's really a women's picture all the way - Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington, Celeste Holm as Karen - these are all strong roles. Though the arch Addison DeWitt is brilliantly played by George Sanders, this role, too, has the feel of a woman's part in its manipulativeness and bitchiness. That may not be very PC to say, but there it is.Of all the scenes, I think my favorite has to be that one that takes place in the theater when Margo arrives very late for the understudy audition. What fireworks, what staging, Bette on the stage, Max and Lloyd yelling from the audience - "Are you threatening me with legal action...(Bette stomps out cigarette with foot)...Mr. Fabian?" Fantastic.I take issue with only one point, and it's a small one. Mankiewicz did not want to cast Jeanne Crain as Eve. He didn't think she was a good enough actress. Okay, but I still maintain that in the beginning of the film, Crain's genuine all-American look and real sweetness would have been great and would have given no hint of the Eve to come. I admit that she probably couldn't have pulled off the rest, but for me, Baxter was a fairly obvious conniver. I realized that Mankiewicz has it set up that way, as she interrupts Bill and Margo's kiss, but Crain would have looked innocent as all get-out. Also, Margo's jealousy of Eve and fear that Bill was attracted to her would have been more understandable. Just an opinion.The third reason - A great director. Joseph Mankewicz has written and directed a fantastic film about theater that, 55 years later, not only holds up on its own but has a life of its own. There is today a Sarah Siddons Award, the term "Eve Harrington" is used commonly in theater to denote an ingénue waiting to pounce on a role; "Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night," is one of Davis' most famous lines; and, last but not least, it spawned the musical "Applause," which I frankly have never been able to warm up to. My heart belongs to All About Eve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just one phrase comes to mind: They don't make it like this anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve is All About Perfection, it really is a flawless, time less piece of classic cinema. I know many feel that the theater references are now dated, and maybe that's true, the theater is not what it is portrayed in the movie, however, the film's theme remains time less.Sadly, the word classic has to be attributed, and I say sadly cause even though by regular standards calling a movie would be a grand thing, with All About Eve it is rather melancholic, cause every time that I see it, it reminds me that Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore.All About Eve is a massive combination of production, directing, and above all, WRITING AND ACTING. No person should be allowed to do films without seeing certain movies, and All About Eve is certainly amongst them. It's almost hard to keep up with the continuous flow of writing perfection, phrase after phrase of exuberant brilliance, every single line clicks, and believe it or not, that is a hard thing to do in writing for movies or plays. The story has everything, comedy, drama, tension, surprise, you name it, watching the film for the first time is bliss, and it's a bliss that never fades out after each re watching.The acting is perfect, absolutely perfect. It works both as an ensemble and as single performances, every single actor did a outstanding job. However it is obvious that the two main gals from Hollywood's golden age steal the show, watching Bette Davis and Anne Baxter is to see performing at it's best. Davis made many, many movies when she was young, but I think the pick of the litter of her performances is Margo Channing, same goes for Anne Baxter far as I'm concerned. George Sanders does steal the show from the 3 main male characters. And it's fun to see a young Marilyn Monroe start to glitter in an almost cameo role which was no cameo at all back then, but nowadays feels like it.I won't get into any details of the story or characters, I think pretty much all has been said and said again, and it's also quite stupid to be arrogant and post personal interpretations of the story and the themes it deals with.All that I what to say is that All About Eve is a perfect movie, and it's a shame we won't see any movies of it's like again. I'm not talking about remakes(which would be a tremendous sin), but films today just don't hold the brilliance that All About Eve has, it is really one of those films that sets very high standards for motion picture excellence, it ranks high up with the other films that do this such as Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Seven Samurai, Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather, Raging Bull and Schindler's List just to name a few.Everyone should see this movie, and any person that dares to write and make a movie without having seen it, it's really not all together credible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Acid Etched Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most film buffs know that Claudette Colbert was originally slated for the leading role of Margo Channing--but following a back-injury was replaced at the last minute by Bette Davis, whose career had been in the trash can since her departure from Warner Brothers. By most accounts the set was unusually explosive, with Davis proving as temperamental as the role she played and directing most of her fury at co-star Celeste Holm. But as they say, what counts is what you see on the screen, and ALL ABOUT EVE emerged as one of the most honored films of all time, racking up an unheard-of number of awards with its poisonously witty tale of an insecure, aging Broadway star (Davis) whose life and career are slowly consumed by a seemingly devoted but secretly calculating fan (Anne Baxter.)In some ways the film has not worn as well as you might expect: seen today, the construction seems a bit clunky, the plot is improbable, and the film as a whole feels overlong--not to mention a scene in which Davis delivers a "what is a woman without a man" monologue sure to give every feminist viewer an extreme case of acid indigestion! But the razor sharp script offers a showcase for a cast of brilliant artists at the height of their talents, and they skate across the screen with such exceptional skill that all criticism seems negligible.Although actors Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, and a superlative George Sanders give the performances of their career, the emphasis is on the ladies, and in them ALL ABOUT EVE is remarkably blessed. After seeing the film it is completely impossible to imagine any one except Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, and Celeste Holm in the roles of Margo, Eve, and Karen, and even the small parts of the backstage attendant Birdie and the showgirl Claudia are played by Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe with such brilliance that they become as memorable as the leads. The result is like acid-etched crystal: hard, sharp, and brilliant from top to bottom. One of the great classics. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wickedly Wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May Contain Spoilers!"All About Eve" is just a wickedly wonderful movie. Many films try to copy it (Even "Showgirls!"),but anyone can tell you that it is just that: a copy. Stick to the original, where Margo Channing (A clever Bette Davis)is getting stabbed in the back by the innocent-looking Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter, who played it with wicked glee), who is not who she seems. Soon, Eve is stabbing everyone in the back to get the role that would bring her fame.George Sanders steals the film as Addison De Witt, a critic that knows the story (And is narrating most of the film) and may seem like a creep to those who know him, but he isn't what he seems, either (Look at the way he confronts Eve toward the end of the film).This film is classic Hollywood at its best, by showing show business at its worst. When you look at the youth oriented show biz of today, you realize that the film makes a point: people will do ANYTHING to get to the top.And for those who wonder about me comparing "Showgirls" and "All About Eve," watch both of them back to back and see what I mean!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what happens when you sell your soul to the devil.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'All About Eve' won best picture for 1950, and its two stars, Anne Baxter (Eve) and Bette Davis (Margo), were each nominated for Best Actress. Davis was 41, had been in movies for almost 20 years, with almost 60 to her credit, and this movie certainly gave her middle-age career a needed boost. Baxter was in her 20s and compared to Davis really was just getting started. Marilyn Monroe also has a lovely but small role, during the birthday party scene, here 3 to 4 years before she started to hit it big. 'All About Eve' does not come across as a great movie today, 50+ years later, but is a very interesting 2+ hours. Eve has acting in her veins and seems to be willing to do anything to become a star, even selling her soul to the devil.SPOILERS follow, please read no further, OK!?What Baxter did so well here is convince us right away that 'Eve' was an actress, and as we see everything anyone ever saw was part of her act. The movie begins and ends with a ceremony, where Eve is receiving an acting award, and the narrator tells us how all this came about. Eve's entre' is her apparent worship of established star, Margo, but she really simply had designs on Margo's life, her men and her roles, first insinuating herself as Margo's understudy. When the equally shrewd person, writer Addison DeWitt, finds out what she is up to, in the end he threatens to expose her series of deceptions, effectively destroying her budding career, unless she 'gave herself' to him, totally. She does, because ultimately her career is the most important thing. She sells her soul, to all the fans and all the media, and DeWitt is the personification of all that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Only the Walls Could Talk!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve is a delectable comedy from the pen of Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who also directed, and those who like movies that talk will be in heaven with this one. It's nearly all talk; much of it gossip, or things that will be gossiped about later; and there's scarcely any action at all. Yet it's visually pleasing, and stylishly photographed in grayish tones, taking place in backstage dressing rooms, apartments, restaurants, beds, sofas, and in one memorable scene, in the backseat of a car that has run out of gas.Aging actress Margo Channing befriends a waif-like young woman whom she eventually hires as a girl friday, to help her around the house, schedule appointments, and in general assist her in her busy life. The young woman, Eve, is a schemer, with an eye on a career as an actress, and she uses Margo as her stepping stone to better things. As things develop, Margo catches onto her tricks, but by this time Eve has already finagled a role in a play, and before long Eve is herself a star. Such are the bare bones of the story. But getting there is half the fun, and how Eve achieves her goals is what the movie is about. The old chestnut of whether movies are about talk or action is exploded in All About Eve. For Mankiewicz, talk is action, and his characters use words like swords. Each scene features people engaging in verbal jousting, not to the death but for the fun of it. I can't think of a single line that falls flat, though when a character in an early scene carries on about how the theatre is everywhere (in a flea market, etc.), one senses Mankiewicz overreaching himself, aiming for an effect, part G.B. Shaw, part Rod Serling, that comes across as strained. Bette Davis, as Margo, is superb. Margo is bitchy, brilliant, insecure, self-pitying, and always deeply human, and Davis manages to breath life into the character, never allowing us, amid the merriment, to lose sight of the pathos of her situation, which is that of a middle-aged woman who has been able to have a ball all her life who must learn for the first time to be sincere, to deal with what's really on her mind. There's more to life than being a star. Margo knows that, and is trying to come to terms with this even before Eve enters the picture. As far a Eve is concerned, stardom is everything. She admires Margo as a star, could care less for her as a person. Anne Baxter plays Eve with a kind of controlled ham that's very effective. I find her far more convincing with the bark off than on, however, as in her early scenes she's comes off as disingenuous. As Margo's best friend, Karen, Celeste Holm is a nice mix of the catty and the upright. She's in the theatre but not of the theatre, and has a knack for playing second fiddle to others, not always successfully as things turn out. As her playwright husband, Hugh Marlowe gives a solid, unimaginative performance, right for the movie though unconvincing as the real thing. Gary Merrill's more lively as Margo's director-lover, bringing his trademark warmth to the part. George Sanders is brilliant as the caustic critic, the wonderfully named Addison De Witt, giving his lines (some of the best in the movie) a Shavian spin. Thelma Ritter is a delight as Margo's dresser, Birdy, delivering her lines with briskness combined with streetwise cynicism, an underling more than capable of standing up to her boss.Wordy though it is, All About Eve is fun to watch. Mankiewicz was nothing if not a skilled film-maker, and he sets up his scenes pictorially in order to make the verbal and visual mesh. He seems to have lost this talent later on, or at any rate he didn't develop it. In this film, we see Mankiewicz in all his glory. There are scenes that play as well for the way they look as the way they sound. Margo's dressing room is a wonderful creation all by itself, with its clutter and secret places. If only the walls could talk! In a Mankiewicz world they would talk, and what tales they'd tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Excellence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent six-time Oscar winner which was nominated for a record 14 competitive Academy Awards (sharing that honor with 1997's "Titanic"). "All About Eve" is a dominant part of the cinema that was monumental in 1950 and grows in importance as the years come and go. Broadway actress Bette Davis (Oscar-nominated) is self-absorbed and cocky to put it mildly. Enter aspiring actress Anne Baxter (also Oscar-nominated) who seems to wander in off the street one day literally. Of course Baxter is not near as naive as she seems. Some realize this (notably assistant Thelma Ritter, Oscar-nominated), but some seem blind to what is going on (Oscar-nominee Celeste Holm). Baxter slowly starts to take control from the inside of the circle and then begins to branch her unyielding power out in every direction. In the end it appears that Baxter's actions will get her everything she desires, that is until sleazy reporter George Sanders (in a well-calculated Oscar-winning performance) comes into the picture. "All About Eve" works in cycles and tells its story with stunning flashbacks. It is a film that was different for 1950. The film shows a dark side of the entertainment industry and showed the lengths that some are willing to go to become icons. All the performances are right on target with Baxter, Davis and Sanders making bright impressions. The cast had a lot to work with though as Joseph L. Mankiewicz (Oscar-winning in writing and direction) picked up his second directing Academy Award in as many years. He became only the second individual to ever accomplish that feat (John Ford was first). Watch for a then-unknown Marilyn Monroe in a short supporting turn. Dominant, wicked, sophisticated, intelligent and definitely thought-provoking, "All About Eve" proves that the cinema can convey most anything when the fundamental elements are present. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

There is a total absence of montages, which really draws out the plot.

		<fullReview>I like most of this movie because it's fun to hear the one liners zip out at 80 miles an hour. Tho' the cheap screenplay wants us to believe that a strong woman like Margo feels "nothing without a man in her life". What a cop out. Margo would eat every man who crosses her path. She doesn't need them. Except maybe to spit them out and move on to the next one.(oh wait, we're supposed to view Margo as being vulnerable beneath her little temper tantrums. In other words, be as independent as you want, but don't make a man too uncomfortable or he won't love you. Did anyone else notice this little piece of sexist propoganda?)Anyways...The real star of this picture is Thelma Ritter. She saw thru Eve in the first five minutes while everyone else was sweet to her. Don't mess with Thelma Ritter. By the way, I've never seen Ritter give a bad performance in her career. She was always sensational.Also: George Sanders is even more vile here than he was in Rebecca. A real smarmy piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"All About Eve" is nothing short of brilliant... a total masterpiece. The script is wonderfully flawless, the acting outstandingly entertaining, and the music is remarkable. One of two movies to get 14 Academy Award nominations (the other being "Titanic", 1997, except one is a good movie and the other is just about a large inconvenience for two teenagers). The whole movie has bite. As Maltin said, it has a "heaven-sent" script. It deserved its Best Picture Oscar, although it should have switched places on AFI's 100 list with the lesser "Sunset Boulevard" ("All About Eve" made 16; "Sunset Boulevard" made 12). Some parts, I must say, are out loud laughs, especially the "That's not a waiter- that's a butler" bit, and all of George Sanders' opening commentary. Also, at two hours and twenty minutes the film never seems long. Not one scene is unneeded. The music is excellent, first-rate, sweeping. It's large when it needs to be, somewhat sad when it needs to be (like a little reminder poking you), and perfect all the time. Glad it too won the Oscar. Timeless should be a word applied to this. As Celeste Holm's Karen said in it, "Don't run out of adjectives, dear." You needn't worry. The surprising element is, is that I have seen it quite a few times and haven't gotten tired of it yet. I hope I NEVER get tired of it. Watch it by yourself, alone, and you'll be surprised at all of the jabbing and witty comments you find.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stealing One's Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film isn't really ALL About Eve. It's about a young woman's schemes for theatrical success and how she affects all the lives around here.The protagonist is Anne Baxter playing Eve Harrington. Celeste Holm, wife of playwright Hugh Marlowe sees her night after night outside the theater where Bette Davis is starring in her husband's play. Eve tells a sad tale of woe to Bette, Celeste, Hugh, and director Gary Merrill once she's admitted into the star's inner sanctum. The only one who's skeptical is Bette's maid Thelma Ritter. Baxter is admitted into Davis's entourage.Davis, Daxter, Holm, and Ritter all received Academy Award nominations, the first two for Best Actress and the latter two for Best Supporting Actress. The first three already had won awards so more than likely they canceled each other out in the voting. Davis and Baxter lost to Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday and Josephine Hull in Harvey beat out Holm and Ritter. But in many ways these may have been the career roles for all these players. Bette Davis made a comeback with this part of Margo Channing. She had left Warner Brothers the year before after a string of very forgettable post World War II films. Davis really was Margo Channing, a big star who was now getting on in years and refused to realize she could not play leading parts for too much longer. Bette had a whole lot of insight to bring to Margo.Anne Baxter had won a Best Supporting Actress Award for The Razor's Edge. But Eve Harrington is miles apart from the tragic Sophie. Sophie is a decent soul who through a tragic accident that claimed her husband and baby went completely bonkers. Eve is a cold and calculating little minx who sets her sights on stardom and she's not too scrupulous about what she has to do to attain it. Both parts show the depths of this very underrated actress.I've always thought Celeste Holm has always been ignored unfairly when people talk about All About Eve. She and George Sanders narrate the film in different spots because the film is told in flashback as Eve Harrington is being presented the Sarah Siddons Award. It's her perspective from which Eve and the rest of the characters are viewed. She's an essentially decent soul, not as ego driven as the others who make their living in the theater. Her life is in her marriage to Hugh Marlowe and it nearly is wrecked because she took pity on a waif outside a theater. Celeste is living proof of the old adage about no good deed going unpunished.All About Eve got a few awards though including the big one for being The Best Picture of 1950. Joseph Mankiewicz got his second Best Director Oscar, he had won the previous year for A Letter to Three Wives.And 1950 proved to be the high point of George Sanders career as he took home a Best Supporting Actor for that 'fishwife' theatrical columnist Addison DeWitt. He also that year stole Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah's with his portrayal of the Saran of Geza. In fact the Saran was a BC version of Addison DeWitt.Sanders is the only other person who sees Baxter for what she is besides Thelma Ritter. He turns out to be quite the investigative reporter and his confrontation with Baxter is the climax of the film. He's not a nice man, but that may make him the only one really equipped to deal with Baxter if she becomes successful.All About Eve hasn't aged a bit in 56 years. I'm not sure about not making films like this any more, but they sure don't write them like this. It's one film you dare not put the mute button on or go to the refrigerator because you'll miss some witty gem. They come pretty fast and furious.And yet for all the sophistication of the film, Margo and her circle aren't a bad bunch. Naive yes, when it comes to Eve, but this con woman takes advantage of the fact that people want to believe someone like Baxter when she tells her tale and they have good extincts.Fortunately none of their good deeds are permanently punished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I admit, I find the story of the Mankiewicz brothers to be one of the most interesting in all filmdom. Part of the allure is their experimentation in narrative perspectives and the nature of fabrication.Here, the fabrication is extra sweetly dimensional. We have a movie about movies, actresses portraying actresses with resonances among all these four elements.And we have the character who fabricates a character (Eve), who incidentally is as much a written object as the characters of the movie are. And of course she believes otherwise just as Bette's character does (and, we presume Bette herself did).The writing is pure genius, aided presumably by psychotropics as was the later 'Cleopatra,' which was begun with similar aspirations. I found the acting superficial, but again that's part of the fun I guess.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of dramatic filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the greatest dramas ever written, this brilliant film elevates an outstanding script with extraordinary acting. It received 14 Oscar Nominations in 12 categories and won 6 including Best Picture and Director. However, it is much better than that.Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is a waif that is constantly seen waiting outside the theater for her idol Margo Channing (Bette Davis). When Margo's best friend Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) invites her in to meet Margo it begins a relationship that is destined to turn into a typhoon. Margo is taken in by Eve's hard luck story and her obsequious deference, and she decides to employ her as her personal secretary. With duplicitous and cunning ambition, Eve maneuvers her way into becoming Margo's understudy. Just turning 40, Margo begins to become self conscious about her age and sees Eve as a threat to her career and her relationship with Bill, who is eight years her junior. The resulting tension between Margo and Eve is electric, with power plays, blackmail and conniving at every turn.John Mankiewicz was one of the most prolific and gifted auteurs of the studio era. He won back-to-back double Oscars for directing and screenplay in 1949 and 1950 for `Letters to Three Wives' and `All About Eve'. His accomplishment in this film is gargantuan, with a powerful script and forceful direction of a talented cast. The dialogue is fantastic, with snide humor and barbed innuendo that cuts like a stiletto. The scene between Eve and pompous theater critic Addison Dewitt (George Sanders) where he confronts her about her past is like a mating of snakes.The acting is stupendous. Bette Davis appeared in over 100 films in her 58 year career, nominated for 11 Best Acting Oscars and winning two. This was one of her very best performances and it escapes me why she did not win the award that year. Davis is a whirlwind of dramatic power in a riveting portrayal of the tempestuous Margo. She imbues Margo with a gigantic ego and equally enormous insecurity, which yields some of the best and most bitter tantrum spewing ever been put on celluloid. Anne Baxter is deliciously evil as Eve. Her sweet helplessness veils a cold, calculating serpent waiting for her opportunity to strike.The supporting actors were also superb. George Sanders won a best supporting Oscar for his haughty performance as Addison De Witt. Celeste Holm was nominated for a supporting Oscar and was terrific as Margo's well meaning, but meddling friend. One of my favorites was Thelma Ritter (also nominated for Best Supporting Actress) as Birdie, an unrefined and blunt woman with extraordinary perceptiveness about Eve's true nature.This is one of the best dramas ever made and among my favorite films of all time. It was rated number 16 on AFI's top 100 of the century. I rated it a 10/10. They don't make them like this any more. It is required viewing for classic film buffs.</fullReview>

Stars: Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, with an early bit part by Marilyn Monroe.Baxter, Davis, Monroe and Sanders ... There are great actresses, there are very great actresses, and then there is Bette Davis. Davis had such a strong personality that when she played a role like Queen Elizabeth she didn't convince you that she had turned into queen Elizabeth, but that queen Elizabeth had turned into Bette Davis. In All About Eve she is simply in a class by herself and the picture itself is one of the great landmarks of the Hollywood cinema along with the likes of Casablanca and Sunset Boulevard, Eve has, in fact, much in common with the latter in which a long over the hill movie star tries vainly to make a comeback. Amazingly both of these masterpieces came out in the same year, 1950, marking it as one of the milestone years of American film history. Over the years as a non-critical film buff I had caught Eve several times on late night TV and always enjoyed it but, seeing it again in a pristine new print on the big screen at the Berlin film festival in a sidebar section devoted to the most beautiful women of the silver screen, I was totally Wowed ! ~ and left breathless at the end realizing I had just witnessed an all-time masterpiece which I had more or less taken for granted before. Well, Okay, Bette is staggering ~ but everything else is equally tip-top: The crystal clear black and white photography, the edgy outlining of every single character in the supporting cast, supreme arch bitch Anne Baxter, ultra suave super cynical George Sanders as poison pen critic Addison Dewitt, with a glowing young Marilyn Monroe on his arm, Celeste Holm, celestial as the perfect wise-cracking protective best friend, and all others in perfect tune in a perfect symphony of backstage maneuvering and interlocking personal dramas --spiced at every turn with gold-plated tailor-made dialog topped off, of course, by Bette's unforgettable party line "Fasten your seat belts -- it looks like it's gonna be a bumpy night"" What is really amazing about the dialog of this film is that it was all written out beforehand by director Mankiewicz but is so perfectly suited to every character (including a zingy one- liner by Marilyn) that it feels like they were making it up as they went along with the story. So natural it is supernatural! If this is not the most perfect film ever made in Hollywood it is certainly one of the top three. If you ever get a chance to see it with an audience on a big screen be sure to fasten your seat belt and prepare to be knocked for a loop.

She had the power that future generations attribute in part to people like Stevie Nicks... she had a mastery, a beautiful mesmerizing and bewitching ability. To watch her act is to be a student of microexpressions... Tonight I watched for the first time a movie I consider now to be a perfect film. The movie won 6 Oscars, and rightfully so. Everyone is exceptional, no one overstays their welcome or overplays their hand. The movie works on so many levels, what it says about the times, what it states silently in the mise en scene and props. The dialog is absolutely delicious, the story profound and disturbing... I rate it immediately 10/10 That movie, All About Eve (1950). Extraordinarily brilliant in every way. Bette Davis is lovable and masterful as always, all the women seem to understand there's wool there thrown over the eyes of the men, but there are twists, there are turns, the entire film smolders and burns, and will not let you go, or turn away... you must keep watching, here enjoying the treat, there disturbed by the rich and unmistakable sickness of the plot... there's nowhere to go but forward... and in the end, you'll want more and more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatic masterpiece for the ages, with all the Shakespearean artifacts that still resonate today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If for some the glamour of the Hollywood of the late 1940s and early 1950s could not transcend the first page of the entertainment magazines of the day, think again. This is probably one of the most intelligent movies ever made for mass appeal. Firstly, the cast of actors not only represent the golden age of Hollywood, but a unique artistic tapestry, which it is hard to find or even put together these days. Secondly, the script is as intelligent and compelling as one could find in any Shakespearean library. And thirdly, the film does a superb job presenting a range of human dimensions and complexities that after 65 years after its release, we still have not fathomed to explain entirely.During the first half of the film you would appreciate the artistic range and savviness of one of the best Hollywood actors ever, Bette Davis. Her uncanny ability to tear up the silver screen is more than palpable and compelling, but simply astounding. She really deserved the Oscar that year, for a performance that put her on a pedestal for generations to come. The rest of the cast simply exceeded expectations. Anne Baxter simply proved that she had the skills and range to showcase herself as a multilayered actor, which is hard to find these days. Celeste Holm certainly held her own by bringing the audience into the movie in a measured and sensitive way, and George Sanders could not have been a more intelligent choice for the role. His portrayal of theater critic Addison DeWitt was as amalgamated and compelling as ever. On the lighter side, if one would like to see an upcoming and untainted Hollywood star, this is probably the best movie to see the enchanted, glamorous and extremely beautiful Marilyn Monroe.The movie is certainly a must-see for any person wishing to explore the unexplained nature of unchecked and untamed personal ambitions. It is simple a clever study of human psychology, when the word psychology was still in its infancy. Yes, the unexplained world of human emotions is presented in this timeless classic in a way that takes us a step closer to understanding our core nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this the best film ever?? - It might be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Hitchcock-fan, and what he did with the camera, it forced me to go back into the good ole' days of cinema from the 30s-60s. Which is like, I thought, you gotta turn on those "40s-50s" eyes-and-ears to appreciate it. But then I realized, seeing these old films wasn't going back in time at all, it was just discovering new fantastic films and new fantastic actors.And after my Hitchcock-journey I wanted more...and there it was...the ultimate movie - All About Eve.What can I say...what a wonderful movie this is. Bette Davies is just extra-terrestrial in this one, and her supporting cast is there to give her support.Bette Davies should have won the Oscar this year, but apparently the Academy voted for the picture, which kind of canceled Bette Davies and Anne Baxter out. Such a pity, this was Bette Davies' finest moment, and one of the most memorable performances ever seen in the movies.If you're a movie fan like me, and like all kinds of things like 'Lord Of the Rings' to 'August: Osage County'......check out this one. It's the movie of the century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Eve (1950)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film should be called KARMA! Seeing this young girl who has fantasied about becoming a amazing actress has in deed become one. With the use of betrayal and "loyalty." I was impressed by the use of narration in this film. We hear, I believe four narrators. All of them tells this story in their perspective and they do it well. This film leaves you wanting more towards its ending. Eve finally getting what she deserves but its something we'll never see but we can assume and guess what the future holds for her. The use of mirrors were great, they brought us through each scene at different angles. The plot of this film was great, the actresses/actors played their parts well, I believed every moment of this film. It made me dislike Eve, at first I felt bad for her like the others in the film but then I begin to realize that she was playing all of them. I kind of put two and two together before the film reached its climax but in all it was a great story. I liked this film a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So glad I finally watched it... and i loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I was a teenager I used to read a fashion magazine where they always made references to old great Hollywood stars. There was some mentions about an actress named Bette Davis and how great she was on a movie named "All about Eve"(1950) and I wondered who was she and what was that movie. Some time later I became fan of a Korean drama titled "All about Eve" (2000)and I wondered if it was a copycat, a tribute or an imitation of that - until then- unknown movie. I told myself "Well, I guess I'll never know because in my country it is hard to see old movies being broadcasted by our local TV stations". However, for my great surprise, yesterday I came across with "All about Eve"(1950) on cable TV, and I decided to give it a chance.I was a little bit worried thinking that maybe I wouldn't like the movie because its title in Spanish, my first language, was "La Malvada". Oh no - I said- that title sounds so... evil... maybe I won't like this film. But as soon as it began, the narrator said another title instead. He said "Hablemos de Eva". Then I changed my mind: "Maybe I could like this". And it was so. I watched it and I can tell you that it has been the best 1950's film I have ever seen. Now I understand why this film was so remembered in that magazine. Good acting, good story, good script, like-able characters... I really loved it. I watched it with my sister and she loved it, too. I wish that nowadays movies could make me feel the emotions, the "feel- good movie" sensation it caused in me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read that 1950 turned out to be a major year for movies that went on to become part of LGBT culture. That year saw the releases of "Cinderella", "Sunset Boulevard" and "All About Eve". The latter two share similar themes. Much like how Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) has disappeared from the screen in her middle age, Margo Channing (Bette Davis) is aging and is seen as "less useful".Although the movie is a favorite of gays, it essentially contains homophobic themes. Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is depicted as possibly lesbian, and is a vicious individual trying to steal the limelight from Margo. Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) is depicted as possibly gay and is a cynical, emotionally vacant individual.Whatever the case, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's movie remains an important part of cinema history. Bette Davis appears to be having the time of her life as Margo. A young Marilyn Monroe appears in the movie as an aspiring actress. See it if you get a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic tale of an innocent star-struck girl named Eve (Anne Baxter) who idolizes theatre actress Margo Channing (Bette Davis). With the help of Margo's best friend Karen (Celeste Holm) she meets Margo and slowly starts to get closer and closer to her. She's only trying to help her...or is she?Quite simply this is one of the best movies Bette Davis ever did and one of the best movies ever. The screenplay is incredible--full of great lines and sharp observations. The cast is great across the board. Davis said this is one of the best roles she ever had and she's right. She's incredible all the way through. Holm is stuck with the thankless goody-two shoes role (no one is THAT nice) but she pulls it off. Thelma Ritter is funny (and vicious) as Birdie. Baxter matches them all as Eve--sweet and kind one minute, ruthless and vicious the next. Then there's George Sanders as vicious theatre critic Addison DeWitt. He's great. They were all nominated for Academy Awards but only Sanders won. This is also got awards for Best Picture, Director and Writing. Basically this is a great adult movie about the theatre world with one of the best scripts ever written. A true classic and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute masterpiece about deception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They sure don't do quality filmmaking like this any more. Once in a while, a masterpiece will commence in Hollywood these days, but it doesn't happen very often. This movie is over two hours long. Normally I get a bit fidgety where I'm sitting, but I didn't look at the clock once during this movie. It makes the long running time fly by with ease. It has a masterfully done build-up that takes it's time with fantastic character development. All About Eve is true to its title. Bette Davis &amp; her gang may have been conned by Eve Harrington, but it was blatantly obvious to me from her first sob story at the beginning of the film about working at a brewery that she was full of it. If you have a good read on people, you'll notice it as well. Even though I knew what I knew, I still had an amazing time. It helps that despite Bette Davis's cantankerous nature, she is amiably cranky. Bette Davis is so, utterly convincing that I couldn't help but be on her side, especially as her character takes a path towards paranoiac actions, and obsessive jealousy. Bette's performance should be forever immortalized as one of the all time best. She was absolutely amazing. Anne Baxter is Bette's match as Eve. Her conniving, backstabbing demeanor is unforgettable. She was thoroughly convincing as a con artist. She is also up for the challenge as her character evolves in the second half. She pulled it off with bravado and perfection. Her character is very unlikable, yet she still had this irresistible charm as well. George Sanders (Addison DeWitt) is just great as the no-nonsense type. Celeste Holm (Karen) and Gary Merill (Bill Sampson) have pivotal parts as well, and pull them off with panache and conviction. It has one of the best endings you'll ever see. I won't spoil it, but it had me clapping. It's a thoroughly satisfying ending, filled with karma and payback. It was very clever. Let's just say you won't be disappointed if you like comeuppances. Final Thoughts: This is the definition of a classic. Rarely ever do you see movies made these days, done adroitly as this one. It has a phenomenal cast, a terrific story, and some excellent dialog. It's just a masterpiece about betrayal and deception. Go see it!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here, the screenplay is the star, and the actors are the supporting cast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actors are only as good as the material they must memorize, and here, that material is a combination of silk, satin and only the finest of cotton. Certainly, female leads Bette Davis and Anne Baxter are the epitome of perfection, and dominate everybody around them. Their fellow actors have nothing to gripe about either, hence a total of five acting Oscar Nominations. Every detail in this movie is picture perfect, even if the obvious backdrop of New Haven in one sequence is clearly stock footage and the final sequence drawn out to be a tad long.Davis, in arguably her finest film, is obviously emulating Tallulah Bankhead (no matter whom the original story was based upon), and it is fascinating to watch her go from bitch to saint, as well as the titled Eve (Anne Baxter) go from saint to bitch. Davis's Margo Channing is an extremely complex character, perhaps not as drag-queenish as Tallulah could be, and you will find yourself sympathizing with her as she reaches that difficult age of 40, which she expands on realistically through several philosophical monologues in which she reals the truth about who she really is underneath all the glitz and glamor of Broadway. Underneath all of that sardonic humor is what even Eve describes her to be as a truly great woman.Starting off like a drenched urchin, Baxter makes you pity her, but soon you see where her ambition really lies and how she intends to utilize, throw out and possibly destroy the others around her. But along comes the wait-and-see lion type character played by George Sanders and you know her fall will be swift and destructive, and no matter what happens in her rising career, her true character will end up being exposed for the manipulative passive/aggressive cat she really is.Celeste Holm has the hardest job, making you like her Melanie Wilkes like character without being annoyed by her excessive sweetness. You can see initially why she's fooled by Baxter, and in watching her grow a few claws in the film's second half, you really root for her to aid in Eve's soulful destruction. Thelma Ritter turns a hamburger helper part into steak simply by just being Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe adds sly sensuality to a typical sexpot who happens to have a bit of hidden smarts in that bubble head of hers. It is obvious that there is something very special in her, and it is nice to see her working with Davis, equally as exciting as it was to see her with Barbara Stanwyck a few years later in "Clash By Night".Speaking of Stanwyck, there's a very funny reference by cub reporter Barbara Bates in the final scene referring to her and Susan Hayward as actresses from Brooklyn, but "they're only movie stars", a reference which reflects the snobbery of Broadway towards movie people. Then men in this film besides the bitchy Sanders (who deservedly won his Oscar) are less showy but they go out of their way to do more than just be a masculine presence on the arms of these colorful females. This could have given the film a camp presence, and it certainly does have that, but there is also a thought-provoking intelligence to it that is mesmerizing.Directing his own script (just as he did the previous year with "A Letter to Three Wives" for which he also took home two Oscars), Joseph Mankiewicz instills much unique detail into every segment that the film is truly unforgettable. Delightfully bitchy dialog that has gone down into the screenplay hall of frame is surrounded by some lesser known unknown gems and even in those sequences (such as one where Davis and group all bite viciously into a stalk of celery as a response to Sanders and Baxter's presence at a table near theirs), and everything comes up roses for everybody. You'll cheer for Margo Channing as she learns a major lesson from Eve's scheming, responding in a way that truly makes her a much better person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right off of the start one thing becomes apparent: my opinion of Sunset Blvd. is critical to how much I'd like this film. Fortunately, I love Sunset Blvd, so much in fact that I gave it one out of eleven "ten's". However, the similar topics forces a comparison, and seeing Sunset Blvd first leads to a natural bias, leaning towards that film. I truly enjoyed All About Eve, and if you see it first, you may think different than me, numerically.Like Mad Men, which gets an apparent creative boost from being about creative folk, All About Eve is a film about entertainment by entertainers. Which, as the trend goes for such occasions, makes it incredible. The story is rich, with many little things that can't be pinpointed. But on a larger scale, everything is enjoyable. The actor's performances are mesmerizing; Davis' aging, displaced star is wonderfully upsetting and relateable. Sanders' deWitt is slimy but charming, with such a confident voice. But it's all about Eve. As Chris Rock would say, "you're goddamned disgusting!" And she is, oh, so wretched. Even in her first scene, the false humility and gratefulness leaks through her facade, and the cracks grow from there. By the end though it comes full circle, with a bitterly poetic conclusion. Eve's speech, and the glances the camera takes at the crowd, speak volumes about her character and the film's themes.Another point of note is how sharp the dialogue is. Being about theatre, many references get tossed around, of which I caught about 2: Macbeth and Hamlet. But all of the conversations have weight and wordplay that would make Shakespeare himself smile.All About Eve, despite being over 60 years old, is remarkably fresh. To start, this is probably the only film I've seen all year in which death is not a plot point. Also, in a medium which can be seen as male- dominated (there are 6 films higher than this on the Top 250 principally starring women), seeing female drama is unique. This story of deceit, undermining, fame and fakes is well- directed, well- acted, and enjoyable. Love the film, hate Eve. 9.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is a rarity in that it was praised at its release, and has never critically waned. That, however is not the rarity I refer to; the rarity is that the film is deserving of the praise. It won many awards at many festivals, and was nominated for fourteen Oscars- a record tied only by the abysmal Titanic, in 1997- a film that represents an almost polar extreme from this film, in that it was all glitz and special effects, and had a terrible screenplay- one that dates Titanic, made almost a half century later, far more than All About Eve. This film garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (for Mankiewicz) and Best Supporting Actor (for Sanders). Yet, despite all that, and my admiration for Mankiewicz's great writing, All About Eve is not a flat-out great film. It's close, a near-great, but the fact is that, for all of its stellar writing, it simply is not a deep film. In a sense, it recapitulates the shallow values all its lead characters embrace, in varying degrees. That, along with its rather pedestrian cinematography by Milton Krasner, as well as bad rear projection, in a scene of Eve and Addison walking in New Haven (even if its minimal soundtrack, by Alfred Newman, is commendable), are just enough to keep the film out of the pantheon of all time greats. Despite that, All About Eve is a great way to spend a few hours, and a shining example of classic Hollywood at its best (nearly).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ambitious Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) gets close to the great and temperamental stage artist Margo Channing (Bette Davis) and her friends Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) and her husband, the play-writer Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe); her boyfriend and director Bill Sampson (Gary Marrow); and the producer Max Fabian (Gregory Ratoff). Everybody, except the cynical critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders), believe that Eve is only a naive, humble and simple obsessed fan of Margo and they try to help her. However, Eve is indeed a cynical and manipulative snake that uses the lives of Margo and her friends to reach her objectives in the theater business."All About Eve" is a magnificent timeless tale of ambition, manipulation and betrayal, and certainly one of the best classics ever. Everything perfectly works in this movie: the direction is very precise and tight; dialogs are very acid and intelligent; Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders and Celeste Holm have awesome performances in very powerful characters; the dramatic story is amazingly good, showing what an evil person can plot to reach fame and success. I believe this movie will always be among my ten favorite movies ever. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "A Malvada" ("The Wicked")</fullReview>

Its one of those classic film lines that will always be floating around. I love when I discover little interesting things like this to cure my curiosity. very interesting to see Margo scheming, and how she makes it to the top.The neat thing about this movie is it could be applied todays society..

		<fullReview>I don't know what it was about 1950. Perhaps filmmakers had sufficiently recovered from the destruction of WWII to finally take stock of themselves, but it is in this year that Hollywood suddenly became self-aware; and it apparently didn't like what it saw. Billy Wilder's 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)' is cinema's most scathing satire of Hollywood's demented and destitute moral values. Likewise, Nicholas Ray's 'In a Lonely Place (1950)' demonstrates how the studio system snuffs out genuine talent through its intent upon "selling popcorn." But it was 'All About Eve (1950)' that truly took America by storm that year, uniting an ensemble of the industry's most charismatic stars and giving each of them acerbic mean streak that is both wonderfully compelling and entertaining. Though the film, scripted and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz {who is also responsible for 'The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947)' and 'Sleuth (1972)'}, specifically concerns itself with the theatre, the parallels to Hollywood are unmistakable, and such is the screenplay's apparent distaste towards the film industry that I'm almost surprised of its success.On the brightly-lit stages of Broadway, respected but aging theatre star Margo Channing (Bette Davis) clings extravagantly to roles for which she is far too old; as though Mankiewicz and Billy Wilder were exchanging ideas, you can almost see her turning into Norma Desmond a few years down the track. One night, Margot is introduced to ostensibly her biggest fan, a meek and sincere young woman named Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) ? now, remember that name! Had I known beforehand that Eve is considered one of American cinema's finest villains, the first half of the film would have severely confused me ? what detestable qualities could possibly be exhibited by this shy, modest and frankly adorable admirer of theatre? I decided that the mutual looks of contempt with which Margo and Karen (Celeste Holm) greet Eve's theatre award (a less-prestigious version of the Oscars) were merely the result of unfounded jealousy, and their resentment that such a modest girl could have received the high honour. When the penny finally dropped, oh, how I felt like a fool!Bette Davis, late in her career, was one of the few actresses with enough sheer charisma to persevere in Hollywood despite her relative lack of glamour or traditional beauty. In 'All About Eve,' her aging features look tired and almost grotesque ? I say this not derisively, but as an observation for how well Davis suits her character. Margo Channing could never have been played by an actress still completely at ease with her looks. In comparison, Anne Baxter illuminates every room, particularly after her selfish intentions are revealed to the audience. The moment of revelation, when she stands, still in costume, positively pulsating with ambition, desire and lust, is a shocking betrayal that really took me aback. The film uniquely emphasises female dominance, with the inconsequential, malleable husbands (Hugh Marlowe and Gary Merrill) frequently relegated to the sidelines. However, George Sanders, as the sharp-tongued columnist Addison DeWitt, holds such contemptuous views towards society that he recognises Eve's game from the very beginning, watches it with amused, admiring eyes, before promptly reasserting his male superiority over her in the final scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Eve is all about many other things.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There can be no denying that All About Eve has retained some sort of epic feel watching now that I can only imagine must've felt rather jarring back in 1950, when it was first released. Here is a film that covers and raises so many points and issues, and does so in a very grand and atmospheric manner. If director Joseph L. Mankiewicz was trying to raise points and debate surrounding Hollywood; the need for greed; that lust for being famous and the transition or rivalry between theatre and cinema then All About Eve can only be attributed to being an epic success.The primary reason this feels so fresh and the one manner in which you can read into All About Eve stems from the fact that whatever points Mankiewicz raises, they are still apparent here and now in our time. The film covers the life and certain times of higher-ups in the American entertainment industry, circa the late 1940s and early 1950s. We get all sorts of characters and various different view points revolving around the sole theme that greed, good looks and good stardom will see you through. The opening voice over is by that of Addison DeWitt, played by George Sanders. He is a critic of the theatre and goes around a room during an awards ceremony, pointing each person out. We are initially presented with this viewpoint of a critic; the smartest and eldest character in the film but the point of view quickly changes hands as the film wears on, giving us a rounded and fair perspective of the themes and events Mankiewicz will raise.So All About Eve is a tale of stardom; a rise through the ranks. It is a morality tale of how to act, how not to act and uncovers the mentality behind it all. Eve is played by Anne Baxter, she has an encounter with established actress of the stage Margo (Davis) and ends up in the dressing room full of mouthy servants; glamorous actresses and their equally handsome male partners ? it is a large utopia within a very small room for Eve. Then there is the gradual obsession the film builds on regarding Eve and her idol Margo. Eve does not look at Margo, she gazes and the shot construction suggests so. Eve is willing to go not only the extra mile for Margo but just a little further, setting up phone calls and making her breakfast without any prior mentioning. Eve refers to Margo as 'mistress' and the film piles on all the necessary scenes that presume us to think she is a stalker what with her attending all the plays over and over.In fact the film is very tempting in its early establishment of these character conventions that it takes Margo's lover away from her. He must travel off on a train to Hollywood for more work, sort of paving the way for Eve to fill the space left empty by the male. But when the film unfolds and it appears the deeper issues are beginning to make themselves known, the themes of greed and disgust at the greed float to the surface. When a revelation involving Eve is made apparent, it seems that the lust for one certain female star was so great that Eve would stop at nothing to get to where she wants to be. This is where the themes can be applied to nowadays. Young girls even now are looking at pictures of female actresses, envying the faces; the build and the fashion statements. So much so that the line between being a 'fan' of someone and being obsessed by them becomes blurred and ambiguous in its retrospect.There can be no doubt that these days you do not need to have done much to be famous, not least in America in which All About Eve was also produced via and set. Starring in your own pornographic film; winning a reality TV programme; having the natural looks and physique as well as being in connection with a famous brand name are all sure fire ways to get noticed or famous ? none of which require effort or intelligence and it is these people that we have younger people obsess over. It is a similar thing in All About Eve; an actress is huge in the theatre and garners a cult following ? but one fan is mad enough to take it to the next level that they will lie and deceit their way to fame. Now, it is this ideation that in order to become 'someone' you do not particularly have to do 'anything'; something Mankiewicz touches on in this film when a lot of talking and soppy sounding stories get you 'into' a clique.There is a sad irony behind Marilyn Monroe playing Miss Casswell because she is really just playing herself. Additionally, there is a sad irony behind three of the cast being victims of suicide in years to come: Sanders who plays the critic; Barbara Bates who plays Phoebe (who adopts the role of 'Eve' when 'Eve' becomes 'Margo') and of course Monroe herself. All victims of stardom? All victims of their own success? It is still happening today with Hollywood stars not being able to take the weight and escapism through drugs doesn't help either. So greed and obsession with success is the theme: people wear 'Hollywood fur' even when they do not need it and when the show 'must go on', it is corrected as "No, Margo must go on". In Hollywood's 'golden age' of production, here is a film with themes that could well still count for today's era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of ambition in the theatre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve is directed and written by Joseph L. Mankiewicz The film stars Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill and Marilyn Monroe.The film opens with narration from respected theatre critic Addison DeWitt(George Sanders)at an awards ceremony for new star Eve Harrington(Anne Baxter).Within the first five minutes of Addison's narration we learn that Eve is not an actress because of her own hard work and effort but because of the effort she has put into destroying the lives of a group of friends in the theatre world who have tried to help her.The group of people she has wronged are at the awards as well,they are Margo Channing(Bette Davis)who is one of the top stage actresses, Addison himself, Karen(Celeste Holm), Bill who is Margo's fiancé(Gary Merrill who was Bette's real life husband at the time)and Lloyd Richards(Hugh Marlow).The rest of the film tells you all you will ever need to know about Eve and what happened to those she has hurt(the only one who really comes out of this the winner and without a lot of heartache is DeWitt who plays Eve at her own game and wins).Anne Baxter is superb as the scheming and duplicitous woman who will stop at nothing to become a star but doesn't think how her actions will make her despised by those she works with. Bette Davis gives one of her best performances Margo, tough, funny and not a woman to go down without a fight. George Sanders steals every scene he is in, the dry wit and hysterical observations of his character make you miss him when he's not on screen.Keep an eye out for a very young Marilyn Monroe as Addison's date at Margo's party. In this brief scene Marilyn proves her talent for comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mesmorizing Game of Subtleties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this DVD for cheap at the local store, I bought it simple for the cast and a vague memory of hearing the title somewhere. So I took it home, popped it into the player, and immediately became sucked into this darkly humorous piece of manipulation.We see from the movie's beginning how it will end. A beautiful young starlet appearing from practically nowhere to achieve great fame. The rest of the movie takes us back to this young woman's beginnings and her trail of lies that positioned herself just where she wanted to be. Even though Eve is the title character, what we see the most of is the results of her actions among her so-called friends.It has all the right elements of drama and intrigue, just short of someone literally stabbing someone else in the back. Modern crowds used to constant action might be bored, but if one is willing to watch the ingenious and devious dance, he will be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a Christian perspective....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Christian and I give this a '9' I had read comments about the quality of the writing in this film but I really had no idea to what extent this would elevate the experience. The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to "act" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying."All About Eve" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films "A Face in the Crowd". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years.And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so "liberated" today. So what more can I say? If you love movies and you haven't yet seen it, you've suffered long enough; don't wait another day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Eve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz in 1950. The American drama tells of Broadways life backstage and the story of how a girl on the bottom schemes her way to the top, not caring about whose toes she steps on. Anne Baxter plays the roll of Eve, the young girl who "gives the performance of her life." The twist in plot revealed by George Sanders' character made me think about all the events that happened earlier in the movie differently; mainly about Eve's intentions and attitude towards the rest. Her lies tried to break up a marriage potentially ruin her "mentor's" career. This well made film didn't lack in individuality or creativity, although a little too dramatic for my taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is why I love film. It gave us a truly remarkable performance by Bette Davis, but everyone knows how great this performance is. There is some dialog in this movie that ranks as some of the best in my opinion. There is so much to like in the movie. There are very few movies where I think about the chemistry of the cast, but this movie has more chemistry than all of the movies put out this year. One of the things that popped with me that I did not expect was some of the lighting was superb. Especially when they lit Eve when we first get introduced to her. Everything about this movie just screams Bette Davis, but I really enjoyed DeWitt and Eve quite a bit. This movie really just had everything. The script was top of the line and the cast was unreal. Great movie that really shows why some of these movies are classics that will never die.I do not usually do this but I went back and changed my score from a 10 to a 9 because of the fact I remember that my mind was wondering a bit throughout the film. It was a little long, but never bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hollywood at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More and more classic Hollywood films are being forgotten by all but the film buffs - sadly I fear the next generation of casual movie fans may see very few pre-1960s films except Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Wonderful Life and perhaps Gone With the Wind.If a fifth movie could be added to that list, it should be (but probably won't be) All About Eve. While much can and has been said about the superb acting, what makes this film so memorable for me is the writing. The story of Eve's diabolical ascent is simply so compelling and perfectly done that it's one of those rare perfect stories of fiction, the kind writers will be ripping off and using as inspiration for centuries. On top of a delightful story, the dialogue is crisp, intelligent, and in combination with the acting, almost realistic (of course, no one really talks like these people, but it would be a lot of fun if they did).All About Eve is essential viewing. The opening narration is a bit boring and dated, and much of the ending is all too predictable from about halfway through, but other than that, anyone who likes an intelligent movie should be on the edge of their seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent Darryl Zanuck production - excellent music, and an air of ultra-class complete this superior satire. And, it had Marilyn Monroe, too.Joseph L. Mankiewicz, wrote and directed this film, the story of an ambitious actress's rise from glamor-struck girl in a theater alley to Broadway star. Mankiewicz has gathered up a saga of ambition and conceit, pride and deception and hypocrisy, that just about drains the subject dry. The self-seeking, ruthless Eve, who would make a black widow spider look like a ladybug?is the motivating figure in the story and is played by Anne Baxter with icy calm, the focal figure and most intriguing character is the actress whom Bette Davis plays. This lady, an aging, acid creature with a cankerous ego and a stinging tongue, is the end-all of Broadway disenchantment, and Miss Davis plays her to the hilt.The supporting cast is brilliant and includes award winning George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Thelma Ritter, and Marilyn Monroe. It is easy to see why this was the Best Picture of 1950.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am aware that there are people who rags on older movies gaining their reputation because they are old, because they are "classics", rather than their quality, and I agree there are some movies that have gained a higher reputation than they should.All About Eve is a movie that doesn't carry the hype or household name status as some movies like Kane, On the Waterfront, etc., it quietly sits back with it's record amount of Oscar nominations and full acclaim among movie circles as a treasure of cinema.But the scary thing about All About Eve is that it IS that good, and more. Not only in the way it portrays the rise and fall of being a star and the places people will go to achieve it, but in it's vividness of how the entire thing is played out, to the screenplay, direction, delivery, twists.I've never seen a Betty Davis movie before, but she is INCREDIBLE in this film, one of the best female performances in any movie, ever. Anne Baxter as the conniving title character with hidden intentions and hidden qualities to her character is also dead on, and I believe either could've been a deserving winner in their year they hadn't cancelled each other out. Celeste Holm as a playwright side character, George Sanders as a poisonous writer, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, all light up the screen. The screenplay as mentioned is incredibly vivid and intriguing, the direction and set design of Broadway is electric.All About Eve is the definition of flawless, and one of the movies of it's breed that lives up to all the acclaim and reputation it's gotten.A+ Review posted by Julien R. at www.boxofficefanatic.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good period piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this again recently, after many years. In this site there are many who proclaim this the best film ever, and wax ecstatically about Bette Davis, and on and on - but I'd submit that its fascination, especially now, lies elsewhere.George Sanders is a delight to watch and hear. He is the "Babe Ruth" of filmdom at playing ego-maniacal, smarmy, unctuous characters. In more recent times, Dabney Coleman and G. D. Spradlin have served to carry-on this type of characterization.Watching Celeste Holm's character could turn even the most hardened chauvinist into a rabid proponent for women's lib.Baxter's Eve Harrington can be excused for trying to hasten her supplanting Bette as Broadway's leading light. However, one can't help but imagine even such a ruthless individual biding her time a bit longer, and perhaps accomplishing her goal with everyone's influential support, and without the inevitable besmirching of her reputation among theater insiders. But, we should forgive her haste; she needed to get something done before Bette chewed ever available piece of scenery in sight.Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe acted like a pair of narcoleptics; one wondered which one might nod-off first,Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable representation of the post-war, 1940's - early 1950's melodrama, enjoyable as much for its lapses as its virtues. I found myself enjoying further just picturing (and wishing they'd included) a scene where Celeste Holm - mink coat, high heels and all - drained the gasoline from their auto, so Bette would be prevented from catching the train to New York, miss her performance, and permit Eve's making her understudy's debut. (Celeste's having drained the auto's gas tank of a full tank, was clearly explained in the film, and was the event which led to Eve's big chance, and some of the subsequent double-dealing. However, I would have loved to see her actually accomplishing this feat. It could have been the best part of the flick.)</fullReview>

Everyone, that is, except for those who strive to be like her (me, included).It's a timeless classic with a great cast, great costumes, a great plot, not to mention an unforgettable ending.

		<fullReview>In 1950 there were two great satirical melodramas aiming for the Best Picture statuette. The one that walked away triumphant was this mordant examination of theatrical backstabbing, while Billy Wilder's majestic masterpiece Sunset Boulevard was left empty-handed.While perhaps falling just short of the latter's sweeping splendor, this scabrous classic still stands high on the list of the greatest films of all time.With a heaven-sent script packed with sharp dialogue and biting one-liners, and blessed with a raft of terrific performances, most memorable Bette Davis' aging actress Margo Channing, this sparkles with multi-layered brilliance.Also to look out for is an early appearance by Marilyn Monroe as an actress so bad she 'might as well have been riding a pogo stick for all the difference it would have made'.If only all films could be this good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a little embarrassed to admit, that as a film buff, I saw "All About Eve" for the first time this year on DVD. I was more than little curious to see this film which garnered a record setting 14 Academy Awards nominations, not to be equalled until "Titanic" 47 years later."All About Eve" is splendid! The film has the best written screenplay I've ever experienced in any Hollywood film! The screenplay displays a lot of insight into the minds of theatre people. All lead acting and supporting acting performances are impressive, especially Bette Davis as Margo Channing! Bette Davis gives a terrific performance as the aging, insecure actress confronted by her younger, schemish protege (Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington). I was surprised to learn that director/writer Joseph Mankiewicz had no background in theater. Yet he wrote such a highly insightful and wonderfully written story about backstage backstabbing!"All About Eve" quickly became one of all time favorite films. Rarely does such an exceedingly well written film come out of Hollywood."All About Eve", of course, invites comparisons to "Sunset Boulevard" of the same year, as both have similar stories. "Sunset Boulevard" is more notable for it's cinematography. Yes, "All About Eve" appears "stagey" and lacks any fancy lighting or camera moves, but in the end, it doesn't matter. "All About Eve" is a must see film for any discerning film buff!</fullReview>

Then Celeste Holm, who is sensitive and moving as a playwright's wife.

I mean to inspire such loyalty and affection from such wonderful people as the three seemed to be, I knew Margo could not be all bad, that there had to be a a big core of goodness in their somewhere.

She becomes Margo's understudy,she starts manipulating the director, the playwright, and one ofthe most wicked critics. She plays coy then she turns andbecomes ruthless. All of this leading up to her ultimate goal,becoming a star in her own right. A great film that gives us aglimpse into what may happen behind the curtains of Broadwayproductions and films. It also shows that aging actresses havea hard time accepting that they've outgrown the roles that havemade them famous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tour de Force!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the black night of the cold New York theatre district, a seemingly sweet and naive Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) stops playwright's wife Karen (Celeste Holm) and convinces her into meeting her idol, legendary actress Margo Channing (Bette Davis)and there the battle of the bitches begin. Eve's machinations are seen through by an acerbic theatre critic (George Sanders in an Academy Award-winning performance) and Margo's assistant (Thelma Ritter)but the stardom she craves comes at the cost of her friendships with Margo, Karen, Karen's husband Lloyd (Hugh Marlowe) and notorious director Bill (Gary Merrill). The script is witty, insightful, comedic and hits the nail on the head. Acting is brilliant all around - apparently Academy Award voters were undecided between Bette Davis and Anne Baxter for Best Actress and decided to give the award to Judy Holliday. As much as I adore Bette, I personally would have given the award to Anne Baxter whose manipulation and conniving is astounding. Sometimes it's too realistic to be true but the film is a tour de force of entertainment - get it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie, Though Perhaps Over-Rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ingénue insinuates herself in to the company of an established but aging stage actress (Bette Davis) and her circle of theater friends.The problem with this film is that it received 14 Oscar nominations, which would lead you to believe it is possibly the greatest film of all time. It is not. While still a great film, it pales in comparison to many other films, and many of those never got nominations (or won the awards). Not sure what that says about this movie, but it sure says the Academy is not always right.What I learned from this picture: having Bette Davis eyes is not a compliment. Maybe Davis was attractive at one point in her career, but clearly by 1950 she was not. How much longer she remained a star I am not sure... but it is more than a tad ironic that Davis' star seemed to fade here just as Marilyn Monroe's was rising. (And Anne Baxter clearly steals the show, but that is to be expected.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect back-stabbing film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about All About Eve but I had not ever seen the film. I thought this film lived up to all that I heard about it. The performances by Bette Davis as Margo, Celeste Holm as Karen and Anne Baxter as Eve are incredible. Their performances are effortless. The main theme of this film is doing anything to get what you want. This is back-stabbing at its best. Eve gets herself entrenched into Eve's life and slowly takes over. The only person to see her for what she is in the beginning is Birdie, played superbly by Thelma Ritter, who is Eve's assistant. She makes people feel sorry for her and then uses them to get what she wants. Karen is put into the middle of the trouble when Margo starts to see Eve for what she is. Karen ends up betraying Margo, unintentionally, and gives Eve the big break she has been looking for. She ends up making a pact with Eve to help Margo but Margo saves her from being beholden to her. This film uses lighting to help with the theme. In the beginning of the film Eve is shown in soft light-almost as if the lighting was filtered. Margo, on the other hand, is shown in a harsher light. This is to show Margo's age and to emphasize that Eve is the younger of the two and that Margo is reaching a crossroads in her career as far as age goes. . As the film goes on I noticed Margo looking softer and Eve looking harder. At the end Margo is seated at the awards dinner looking happy and when we see Eve in her hotel room she looks hard and unhappy.Dialogs role in the theme is evident in much of the same way. In the beginning Margo is brash and a little vulgar while Eve's dialog is sweet, almost saintly. She talks about how she was married to someone in the navy and is widowed and how the play Margo is staring in is the only thing that got her out of the house. She uses the same type of dialog, showing herself as naive and only wanting to help Margo, as she establishes herself. Margo becomes bitterer in her dialog. The scene that best showcases this is at Bills birthday party that Eve arranged. She drinks too much and let's out all that she thinks about Eve. This scene is important to the film because it is through this that Eve gains the sympathy of Bill, Lloyd and Karen. This scene also has one of the all time greatest lines in film "Fasten your seat-belts, it's going to be a bumpy night!" which was said by Margo at the beginning of the party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bitting, Witty, and Totally Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the rough and tumble, dime-a-dozen action movies you see everyday, you'd think that All About Eve would be boring. The action is little, and it's all interiors and upper class hangouts. Yet, it isn't boring. This movie bites. It's screenplay keeps the action crisp, and every character is bad and/or totally helpless, just more proof that no matter how well-bred or famous you are, you are nothing more than animal trying to win your way in the world.The story is basic. Eve Harrington is a sweet, looking, homespun girl from the Mid-west who is given a chance by her idol, the sarcastic, always smoking and drinking Margo Channing. Little by little, this girl is revealed to be more than innocent. Instead, she is a cruel and malicious girl who uses everything from cheap tricks to blackmail to get her way. She isolates Margo from her friends (Mr. Lloyd Richards the playwright and his wife Karen Richards who unwittingly helps Eve before realizing her true self)and steal both Margo and Karen's fiancé (Bill Sampson) and husband, respectively, from them.The only people who see through this girl's act is Margo's maid, the tough-talking Birdie, and the critic Addison DeWitt who is every bit the demon under the guise of a cultured man. Addison DeWitt eventually blackmails Eve into his service, ultimately getting the best of her, before another "starstruck" kid comes to steal eve's limelight, and the cycle begins again.The plot seems basic, but the screenplay makes it fresh as morning dew. There are more biting one-liners in five minutes of this film than in every film of the past ten years. Margo, who realizes Eve's actions thanks to Birdie, but is helpless to prevent them, quickly starts gnawing at Eve. Her constant drinking seems to make her all the sharper. She would be called nowadays a b***h, she treats everyone else like filth due to her own basic insecurities. She insults, nags, tear down, yet we see this woman is just desperate to be more than just a name on a poster. Bette Davis gives this woman more depth than you can believe.Eve Harrington is a spiteful soul. She was never loved, and she is incapable of loving. She knows only to get on by way of tricks and smoke and mirrors. Anne Baxter plays her with excellence. She is the perfect villainess. George Saunders plays Addison DeWitt with much the same force, but his sentences whipcrack in the air, and he can leave even the worst people defenseless and vulnerable with the sheer power of language.Celeste Holm plays Karen, docile, sweet, wanting to help this poor backward girl to get on, before finding herself in Margo's position. This character seems useless, but she is so nice and out-of-place in this world of backstage backstabbing that you want to help her. The three main men apart from Addison, Mr. Richards, Bill Sampson and Max Fabian (the producer) are played well, but not as well as the women.The other two roles are Birdie, played by the wonderful Thelma Ritter, and Miss Caswell, played by a very young Marilyn Monroe. Both do their roles excellently and add another facet to this multi-layered film.The costumes, make-up, music, sets, all add up to create this wonderful 40s New York atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic, not to be missed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ms. Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill, Thelma Ritter, George Sanders, a young Marilyn Monroe. This is the quintessential film about theater, its quirks and obsessions, and the people caught up in its esoteric world.We see the narcissistic world of drama, played to the hilt, by Anne Baxter, who will stop at nothing for fame. Applause from the audience is ..."waves of love"... as she maniacally describes her need to perform. Initially a waif, who ingratiates herself to Margo Channing (played by Davis) the grand-dame of theater. Anne Baxter as the young Eve is both believable and odious. She is first a friend, then an under-study, then a star. All in a short time.Addison DeWitt (Sanders) sees through her cherubic persona; ..."you should have no problem resting now, Eve"...he quips, after she has nearly destroyed Channing's career.Davis also has some excellent lines. Describing her career, she tells Celeste Holm ..."a woman forgets she will need her femininity, after she has climbed to the top, after she gets all she wants"... a brilliant insight into women's issues, considering this was 1950. Margo Channing, at 40 was considered too old- Davis is wrestling with this issue, as well as competition from Eve.Gary Merrill is charming, and cynical. He eventually sees through Eve's motivations as well. This film is a classic with excellent performances, and could never be remade today. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't a perfect film. In fact, it starts rather slowly, in a fairly predictable way. Sometime around the party scene it takes off, and never looks back. Do not give up on this film after twenty minutes.Nor should you stick around for the plot, which is acceptable but nothing special. This film is made brilliant by superb actors and by dialogue you could shave with. The main focus is on Davis, and she's excellent. But so is Baxter, and Holm is probably better than either. Addison's performance is career-defining and a well-deserved Oscar. Monroe's cameo shines like a girl's best friend and Ritter is spot on. In this environment, merely good performances like Merril's get swamped.It's astonishing that a film with acting this good could take six Oscars and only one for its acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The golden age of Broadway, the golden age of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"All About Eve" is set in a vanished world, the glitzy "Golden Age of Broadway." But, remarkably, the film doesn't seem dated. This classic tale of ambition and manipulation features characters real enough that you can imagine the same story happening today. Scheming Eve Harrington insinuates herself into the life, and eventually the career, of aging actress Margo Channing. A vivid array of theatre types either help or hinder Eve as she rises to fame; they include Margo's younger boyfriend/director Bill, famous playwright Lloyd and his wife Karen, Margo's sharp-tongued maid, and influential critic Addison DeWitt. The characters are well-drawn, with many foibles; nearly everyone behaves stupidly or cruelly at least once.The screenplay for "All About Eve" was based on a short story, and at times the film feels too literary or talky or stagy. Scenes tend to be long, as they are in stage plays, rather than short, as is usual in the movies. The camera work is fluid and competent, the lighting is bright and professional, but they lack that cinematic spark. Still, though, it's hard to say exactly how to change the screenplay?it's full of witty observations about life and the theatre, which would be a shame to lose.Bette Davis deserves all the praise she gets for this role, and the movie loses a lot when she's not in it (especially toward the end). I was struck by how she conveys Margo's larger-than- life personality, the "actress who can't stop performing," while also showing us Margo's real human needs. George Sanders is excellent as Addison DeWitt (was there ever a more perfectly named character?), gradually revealing the slime beneath his cultured persona. Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe are great fun.The character of Bill is supposed to be 32 years old, prompting 40-year-old Margo to fret about how she's losing her looks and dating a younger man. Gary Merrill acts the role of Bill well enough, but he looks at least as old as Bette Davis, making this plot line somewhat unbelievable. Celeste Holm and Hugh Marlowe, playing Karen and Lloyd, are unremarkable. And I still can't decide how I feel about Anne Baxter's performance in the major role of the manipulative Eve.Though "All About Eve" has its flaws (I'll admit it, I prefer "Sunset Boulevard"), it's a smart movie, with an excellent script and some wonderful performances. Cynical and entertaining, it will make you wonder whether you know any modern-day "Eves".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considered to be THE show business movie, and for good reason!! Anne Bancroft and Bette Davis just act the dickens out of this movie, and they got all the accolades they deserved for this.Margo Channing is the cr?me de la cr?me of Broadway actresses. She gets awards, trophy husbands, and legions and legions of fans. As a matter of fact, one fan, one Eve Harrington, has seen every performance! Rather then shoo her away, her friend (played by Celeste Holm) encourages the two together. Soon, after a hoary sad-story about her husband dying and starting to go to the theater and discovering Channing, Channing decides to put the girl into her circle. But the warning signals soon come up, first from Margo's assistant, then Margo herself. But Eve is either too kind, or too manipulative, you're not really too sure for Margo to do anything about it, because she always seems to be two steps ahead of everyone else, again, you don't really know if by accident or by purpose. So this is all fun, Bette Davis is pulling her hair out over this, and Baxter is literally saying "What? What? What did I do?". Again, you're never sure if she's THAT naive or what, and that's what makes this film so much fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story provided an excellent opportunity for the people involved in this film to turn out a Grade B soap opera with a theater setting. Instead they came up with a near masterpiece.Two things make the difference: (1) the gongoristic script, and (2) the glistening performances.You've never heard such dialog. "You're maudlin and full of self pity. You're magnificent." But a thousand examples wouldn't do the script justice because it's all of a piece. It was written -- some might argue aptly "overwritten" -- by Joe Mankewitz and directed by him as well. For a few years he was all over the place, but he never turned out anything else like this film. Nobody could. It's unique.All of the performances are adequate and most of them are more than that. I had a little trouble with the Eve Harrington character, played by Ann Baxter. She seemed out of her depth somehow, which was a shame because she's one of the central figures. She's a likable and attractive woman and the grand daughter of Frank Loyd Wright or somebody, which is all for the good, but her breathlessness limits her range. Hugh Marlowe is better than usual. Marilyn Monroe is indescribable and has some of the funniest lines. The rest of the cast is superb. Gary Merrill's baritone is reassuringly masculine. Bette Davis gives a Saturday Night Live imitation of Bette Davis with her broad gestures and husky voice projecting to the balconies. Celeste Holm is so damned sweetly likable without being a stunning beauty or a bravura actress. Her devotion to Davis is solid without being stolid, just what the role calls for. Perhaps best of all is George Sanders. Great name for the character too -- Addison DeWitt. Addison, as in "adder." Twice he's referred to as "venomous." Okay, the dialog and performances are overblown, but unashamedly overblown -- "I am once again available for dancing in the streets." Almost every line is equally juicy and ripe.In a way, "All About Eve" is what used to be called a woman's picture -- all that jealousy and backstage intrigue revolving around publicity, age, beauty, and men. Davis has a rather lengthy stint of monologue in which she discuss womanhood as a career. And the men are, frankly, all dummies except for Sanders who may or may not be gay. I only mention the possibility because he's the only man who really understands what these babes are up to. The other men -- even the reassuringly baritoned Merrill -- are as manipulable as Play-Do, but not Sanders. He smirks with his secrets throughout the movie until he cashes his knowledge in at the end. Actually, without wanting to be accused of stereotyping, the movie should have a good deal of interest for the gay community. It's got all the icons. Bette Davis at her bitchiest, the fear of aging and losing one's beauty, the skewering insults, the toughness under the froth and lace.I do kind of wish that Thelma Ritter hadn't disappeared half way through the movie, like King Lear's fool. I missed her a lot.It's curious that the agents of social control objected to a scene in which Betty Davis smokes a cigarette in bed. It sets a dangerous example. There was some static too over Gregory Ratoff's eructation after a glass of baking soda. Presumably, this might set a bad example as well. Before you know it, everyone will be burping and even children will take up the filthy habit. And of course married couples had to be shown in twin beds. Curiously, there was never a peep out of the censors about the brutal beatings and lethal shootings that were everyday fare in films of the period. Smoking is out, but killing is okay.Anyway, see this. There's nothing else quite like it, especially now, when the art of speech seems to have been pretty much lost in American movies. I can visualize it now, Mankewitz presenting this literate script to a committee of MBAs and having them brush it off -- "too talky."</fullReview>

This is a great performance by this wonderful actress, herself well established in her own career, and is one for which she received a nomination for Best Actress. Anne Baxter also received the nomination for her role as Eve, and carried this performance well also.

		<fullReview>I guess "All About Eve" is one of those performances where everything just "clicked" and worked like magic. Bette Davis was frighteningly good. I think it's too cliche or facile to say "she is Margo Channing." I think Ms. Davis was too good of an actress (better than Margo would have been in the real world); and could just put on and take off a character like a nice sable coat. The ladies in the movie were the real standouts --from Marylin Monroe's cute few minutes on-screen, through Thelma Ritter's tough ex-vaudevillian "Birdie." And of course in addition to Bette Davis' performance there's Anne Baxter's evilly plotting "Eve," and Celeste Holm as the misled playwright's wife "Karen." But the writing, directing, and photography in the movie are top-notch and it doesn't get much better than this. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stylish melodrama with Davis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I do like a lot of things about this movie and I like the movie itself overall, I don't quite understand its exalted status among classics. Perhaps its mostly Davis herself, such a commanding screen actress who so rarely received a role worthy of her talents. In this one they came really close, but she was let down to some extent by Mankiewicz's direction and by her co-stars.Joseph Mankiewicz wrote the thing as well as directed it, and he's a bit too much in love with the stuff on the page to let the film really breathe. Baxter in particular is undermined by a rather literal interpretation of the script that robs her character of ambiguity, ultimately. As far as Gary Merrill, I haven't ever really seen the appeal of the guy as a leading man but this is a pretty good character for him. He feels like an afterthought, and George Sanders really steals a lot of the movie. Of course it's ultimately Davis' film, but Sanders is there soaking up every leftover scene, which is a more suitable exposition of what the story is actually about than anything going on between Baxter and Davis on screen.The film does an excellent job of evoking the majesty of Broadway stars in their glory years, and it was brave for Davis to take on a role with the explicit element of her aging out of younger roles -- many male stars were said to have turned down the similar role in "A Star Is Born" in various productions over the years. Obviously for her fans, this film is a must. It also offers some impressive moments of grandeur from Sanders. Baxter however doesn't have the presence to imply that she could be a replacement for Davis, and she doesn't effectively transition the character into the latter phases of the film. Celeste Holm's character is interesting as well, and she gives a self-effacing performance worthy of her own stature.There's a lot to like in the movie, but to me it could have been even better if the characters hadn't become so explicit and delineated by the end of the film. Addison DeWitt in particular seems to stop resembling even a human being by the end. He and Eve Harrington become self-consciously fascinating characters to the point where the humanity in the character drops away, and only Sanders' extreme ability keeps the whole artifice from becoming too obvious. Margo Channing is not only more sympathetic but also more believable; a rare combination in film indeed.</fullReview>

With the exception of the cardboard Hugh Marlowe (who was equally wooden when he played opposite Gary Merrill within weeks in 'Twelve O'Clock High')all the cast do the script proud, especially the supporting characters like Thelma Ritter's Birdie (Ritter, of course, had a pivotal supporting role in 3 Wives) and George Sanders Addison de Witt (surely Mank's alter ego, witness the name plus the fact he gets the lion's share of the cynicism and one-liners whilst being portrayed as an urbane observer of talented children). The structure is craftsmanship personified; Ann Baxter's Eve Harrington is auditioning from her very first appearance and the irony is that the actress, writer, writer's wife, director, everyone, in fact, who SHOULD be able to recognise a performance at ten paces, Fail to realize what a consummate actress Eve really is until it's too late; only the life-weary Birdy and world-weary DeWitt make Eve for what she is and they respectively speak up and face derision or keep silent for reasons of their own. The film remains a brilliant example of factory-town film making at its best with all the elements - writing, direction, acting, editing - fusing into the perfect soufflé. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anne Baxter and George Sanders are a revelation...more so than Bette Davis...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It always astonishes me that everyone is so overwhelmed by Bette Davis as Margo Channing in this superb and witty film about the theater. Davis, in real life, WAS Margo Channing--it was no great stretch for her to play this part. Furthermore, co-stars report that she was sometimes every bit as rude and bitchy as many of the parts she played--so much so that Celeste Holm refused to speak with her except on camera and poor George Sanders was subject to her rage at a party after he won his Oscar. When she turned her back on him, he purred over her shoulder, "What's the matter, Bette, sour grapes?" She spun around and spit at him! So the part of Margo Channing fit her like a glove--totally self-absorbed and egotistical about her own talents and overly temperamental in an actressy sort of way. The real stars, in my opinion, are Anne Baxter, George Sanders and Celeste Holm who inhabit their roles in such a way that they are brilliant. Baxter--even Davis admits--had the most difficult role to play and she plays the calculating Eve with great restraint (a word not in Davis' vocabulary). My favorite moments in the whole film are the post-Award dinner scene in Eve's apartment, after Margo has told her "You can always put that award where your heart ought to be." Enter young actress, Barbara Bates, another "Eve" who worships the actress. The scene where she drapes Eve's cape over her shoulders, Sara Siddons Award in her hands, admiring her reflection in a three-paneled mirror while the main theme builds majestically, makes an unforgettable climax to an unforgettable film. Everyone makes the most of the ripe dialogue--and another real treat is seeing Marilyn Monroe, shining like a beautiful beacon in a small but cleverly written role--one couldn't help feeling she would soon be on her way to major stardom--she glowed. So does the film. A real treat--but remember, here is Bette Davis playing Bette Davis--no real stretch in that. Only difference is that here she had marvelous dialogue that she was able to completely identify with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but definitely not great drama, with a far-fetched premise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good dialog, very good acting (particularly by Davis and Sanders), but a premise that isn't all that realistic; Baxter runs off from some small town with stolen money, then plans to get close with Davis by seeing all her performances in a play! Once that is achieved, the extension of the plan is to study and brown-nose Davis and play a goody-two-shoes innocent until her big break arrives as an actress. And the far-fetched thing is that it all works! We aren't even sure that Baxter has any real experience in acting. It would be one thing if she made it overnight in a movie, but in theater?? Sure, she knows the lines by heart, having seen the play a zillion times, but to be so good the first time in a major role?! Quite far-fetched, especially for a drama.As one can plainly see, the plot is very much Hollywoodized in the moronic old-school sense, but the theater setting is a good idea as it presents a variety of characters and twists. Some twists aren't very credible; 1) Baxter's blackmail plan doesn't hold much weight, but it seems to be enough for Holm; 2) Sanders's blackmail of Baxter has much more weight admittedly, but since she is planning to make it in Hollywood wouldn't her native town folk recognize her and thereby force all the filth in her past to swim up to the surface? But okay, the latter blackmail, all in all, has plenty of credence.Though interesting throughout in spite of its length, the movie is universally overrated. So much so, in fact, that one famous salivating male film-critic even praises Monroe's acting! To actually mention HER performance, what with all those other good actors and the much more relevant characterizations, is to truly get carried away with the male hormones. ("Yes, yes...! Even the extras are great! The way that man walks down the street in scene no.235 in the lower-left corner of the screen... Amazing!") Monroe's appearances are few and brief, and her affected acting is totally out-of-place. She is a feather-weight among heavy-weights. I have to add even that as far as looks are concerned Monroe is totally overshadowed by Baxter's beauty. Even Davis's charisma overshadows Monroe's looks. Monroe is no beauty here, probably due to the fact(?) that this movie was shot before she had all that facial surgery. If you'd like to read my "biography" of Marilyn Monroe, contact me by e-mail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"All About Eve" is a drama movie in which we watch an ambitious girls who does whatever is possible to rise. To succeed this she introduce herself and gets close to a famous actress and her group friends. So everybody thinks that Eve is only an obsessed girl, fan of this famous actress and does not want to succeed anything or take any advantage of this friendship.I liked this movie as a classic movie and nothing more because from the start you can understand many of the things that will happen after wards and that was the main disadvantage of this movie. This maybe happened because if you have watched similar movies then it's pretty easy to understand what's going on. The plot was simple and nothing special and about the same for the direction of this movie. I liked the interpretation of Anne Baxter who played as Eve Harrington but I believe that the best interpretation of this movie belongs to Bette Davis who played as Margo Channing and she was outstanding in her part.Finally I believe that "All About Eve" is a simple and nice movie to spend your time but do not expect anything special from this movie. In my opinion this movie has not the best plot or the reason that I did not like the plot was because I figured out pretty early what happens and then it does not have any interest to me. Although I believe that if you are a fan of mystery and drama movies and you have not seen many of those kind of movies then you will like it very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard about this film for years, but only now, the same night I'm watching my first Bette Davis film and having a marathon, am I able to properly experience it. Again, it's such an iconic film and you can pretty much know how the whole thing will work out (but again, the opening scene does make it clear as well if one is paying attention). Davis' performance is considered among the best ever, and it's very deserved. But Anne Baxter is also pretty amazing, and she plays the two sides we see of Eve perfectly, revealing her character more and more as the film goes along until we see her for the monster she is. But it's still very much a theme that is present in our times now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You all know all about Eve...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All about Eve is a 1950. movie directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders.The first scene in the movie is at a award ceremony regarding the theater. The most prestigious award (the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement) goes to non other than Eve Harrington, the brightest star of the theater, the golden girl like critic Addison Dewitt calls her (one of the narrators). According to Addison, we (public) know all about Eve and before the story really begins, we see Eve Harrington collecting her award and the movie freezes just at that most glorious moment of her life, the highest point of her young career. And later, once we meet Eve, the director takes us back to that moment.Who is Eve Harrington?! She is a lovely, innocent, sensitive, honest, understanding, warm young girl who is in deep love with the theater and crazy about her acting hero Margo Channing, the born star of the theater, a temperament, sometimes harsh woman capable of fighting through life. Eve meets Margo, becomes her assistant and little by little invades her life in a sweet way. Suddenly everyone becomes fond of Eve and Margo who is going through a midlife crises starts feeling the threat of innocent, young Eve. Margo is insecure, jealous, oversensitive and starts driving her friends away by her behavior while Eve is slowly taking her place, in her circle of friends and in the theater. Margo is falling and Eve is rising... I don't want to spoil the film for you so I'm going to stop but I will warn you that there is a great turn in the movie which I absolutely loved.Bette Davis as Margo and Anne Baxter as Eve were both stunning, I loved them. The bought me with their acting and contributed greatly to the movie's overall effect. Other supporting actors were great also, especially George Sanders as the cynical critic Addison Dewitt. He is the only one who won the Oscar. The dramatic plot is great, the editing also. The dialog is precise and intelligent. I have only words of praise for this movie. I loved it. The twist and the turn, the victims and the victimizers. I really tried not to spoil this movie for you, Eve is really a incredible character, unique and Addison Dewitt puts it very got at the end: "there never was and never will be another one like you". See for yourself...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Winner, Best Picture, 1951.An aspiring actress Eve, deceives an established and respected actress Margo with her charade. Margo gets impressed by her hundred percent attendance for all her shows and takes her as a personal assistant but Eve slowly gains the favor of the men involved in making the play and all of Margo's associates which ultimately results in her dethroning as the actress of the year. And as she decides to set foot in the Hollywood after she has received accolades for her brilliant performance, a stranger prepares to take the same position she took at Margo- a personal secretary. So the movie concludes with the phrase 'what goes around comes around'.Bette Davis is probably comparable only to Katharine Hepburn and has shown it once again why she is still called the First Lady of Cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All about Eve would have been stellar on 'Suspense Radio', not to forget, presented by 'Roma Wines'. It has the supremely raspy and volatile voice of Bette Davis and a very cynical and intriguing plot, quite unusual for a film of the 50s. There are plenty, and I really mean it, one liners which can be remembered after the film, most of them spoken by Davis, Thelma Ritter and George Sanders. This would've been the one of the most successful radio play in USA. But AAE is a feature film, having everyone perform, from Bette Davis to well, everyone. And how did I like it? Well, let's say, I enjoyed it despite its unsympathetic characters and plot and its wholly disturbingly cynical ending. It's a different thing to watch in on screen than to hear it on the radio, I guess.All about Eve is probably the perfect title for the film, and the main poster itself is very smartly made, with Ms. Davis in the foreground and Anne Baxter behind. There will be confusion as to who the main character is here ? I understand why both Anne and Bette were up for Best Actress. As Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) put it '?More about Eve Later. All about Eve, in fact", Anne Baxter's dominance over the film is gradual and calculated. The movie begins with an award ceremony to felicitate distinguished theater performers and their plays ? we hear the deep narration of Addison Dewitt, who stays away from the stage itself, but is an integral part of the theater- he is a critic and commentator. He mordantly remarks about the people surrounding him ? a playwright's wife, Karen Richards (Celeste Holmes), who according to him, would've not been closer than the fifth row had she not married her famous husband, and Margo Channing (Bette Davis), a phenomenal middle-aged actress. Both women seem indifferent to the awards ceremony; Channing seems to smoke cigarette after cigarette, staring at the main table where a prestigious award has been kept. Then enters Eve, the most sought after actress, to accept the prize; the scene freezes just when she is about to take the trophy, and we are taken back in time to see how she managed to receive this honor. The co-narrations along with the critic are Margo and Karen. Eve first acts as alacritous fan of Channing who gets to meet her through Karen, Channing's best friend. Channing is the typical petulant, larger than life, effervescent and slightly obnoxious and over-dramatic actress who is not exactly malicious but very proud and ambitious. She is touched by Eve's story and employs her at her home. When Eve begins to overshadow her and somehow create strife between Margo and her close ones, Margo, who holds high opinion of herself but is vulnerable within, grows suspicious of Eve. Eve's meteoric rise to super stardom is laced with lies and deceit, as we begin to know more of her intentions.The film was hard to watch, because it is imbued with bitterness and sin ? a woman, in order to reach the very summit of fame blackmails, lies and turns emotionally sterile. The acerbity in the script is highly concentrated; I never expected such coldness to come from a film of the 40s. The women here are the highlights, with Bette Davis taking charge for most of the part, This is probably a film in which she played herself; just reading some of the quotes of Davis regarding her co-stars, such a Celeste Holmes, it is not surprising that this role is tailor-made for her. Her director had told her that she was to 'treat a mink coat as it were a poncho' and god she does it well. She possesses all the excess that is required of her character ? her self-indulgent and over-the top behavior or rather antics work well here. Some of her childish outbursts are hilarious, and I have encountered actresses and actors with such temperaments. But to certain extent, I felt that in all her fireworks, she never released a fire-lantern that would have caused a spectacle and shown a different side to her. In all her scenes, she was sassy ? I wish she had just toned it down a bit to elevate her personality. Anne Baxter's Eve is a despicable fox ? her obsequious nature in the beginning garnered some reserved sympathy but when she turns heel, she bears her sharp fangs, becoming an icicle. It is very interesting to observe her body posture in the beginning; her shoulders are always towards the front, as if she is waiting patiently to pounce.The other ladies are luminous in their roles. Celeste Holm deserves accolades for bearing Bette Davis, whom she found rebarbative after an incident with her. To actually sympathize with Margo and settle herself in the story which has her play a more relatable character in a circus called 'theater' is a difficult task. Thelma Ritter as the crass but trustworthy assistant is a scene-stealer, giving great effect to her one liners, especially during the green room scene. Marilyn Monroe was embarrassing though, clumsily spitting her dialogs and blotting the otherwise well-penned scene. No wonder Davis barked at her. There was only one man worth mentioning in the film ? M. George Sanders, brilliant in his role. The other two men were unjustly ignored; I wish they had been given more space.The foremost reservation I had regarding the film was about Eve's intentions, which although executed with Machiavellian skill, seemed questionable. Why did Eve have to do all this when she was, according to all, a brilliant actress? It's not as if she had a grudge against Channing, so her intentions seemed unclear. Many evil characters usually do have reasons for their wrongdoing; Eve didn't. That's puzzling about Eve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Eve: A Timeless Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the story The Wisdom of Eve by Mary Orr, All About Eve is an elegantly bitchy backstage story revolving around aspiring actress Eve Harrington.The film stars Bette Davis as Margo Channing, a highly regarded but aging Broadway star. Anne Baxter plays Eve Harrington, a willingly helpful young fan who insinuates herself into Channing's life, ultimately threatening Channing's career and her personal relationships. George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe, Barbara Bates, Gary Merrill and Thelma Ritter also appear, and the film provided one of Marilyn Monroe's earliest important roles.It was written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz.Tattered and forlorn, Eve shows up in the dressing room of Broadway mega-star Margo Channing, weaving a melancholy life story to Margo and her friends. Taking pity on the girl, Margo takes Eve as her personal assistant. Before long, it becomes apparent that na?ve Eve is a Machiavellian conniver who cold-bloodedly uses Margo, her director Bill Sampson, Lloyd's wife Karen, and waspish critic Addison De Witt to rise to the top of the theatrical heap.The film returns to the opening scene in which Eve, now a shining Broadway star headed for Hollywood, is presented with her award. In her speech, she thanks Margo and Bill and Lloyd and Karen with characteristic effusion, while all four stare back at her coldly. After the awards ceremony, Eve hands her award to Addison, skips a party in her honor, and returns home alone, where she encounters a young fan?a high-school girl?who has slipped into her apartment and fallen asleep. The young girl professes her adoration and begins at once to insinuate herself into Eve's life, offering to pack Eve's trunk for Hollywood and being accepted. "Phoebe", as she calls herself, answers the door to find Addison returning with Eve's award. In a revealing moment, the young girl flirts daringly with the older man. Addison hands over the award to Phoebe and leaves without entering. Phoebe then lies to Eve, telling her it was only a cab driver who dropped off the award. While Eve rests in the other room, Phoebe dons Eve's elegant costume robe and poses in front of a multi-paned mirror, holding the award as if it were a crown. The mirrors transform Phoebe into multiple images of herself, and she bows regally, as if accepting the award to thunderous applause, while triumphant music plays.Mankiewicz's inside knowledge of show business and its particular personality types gives the film an authenticity and allows for its famously devastating acid wit in All About Eve.It was an an unflinching analysis of power relations which suggests that postwar America had not yet achieved the moral perfection it so wanted to claim.Aside from that,it was a smart, sophisticated, and devastatingly funny movie about ambitious women.The portrayal of the cast were excellent.And above all, All About Eve is a Hollywood classic that only improves with age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Behind every great woman, there is a man ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night", the more I watch "All About Eve", Best Picture of 1950, the more I wonder what exactly this 'All' is about. Is it about Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), the central character who's introduced on the night she wins the prestigious Sarah Siddons Award, which is to theater what the Oscar is to cinema? Is it about Margo Channing (Bette Davis), the aging star? Is it about Eve's insatiable ambition? Is it about the friendship of Karen (Celeste Holm) or the suspicion of Birdie (Thelma Ritter)? Is it about imitation? Deception? Life imitating Art or Art deceiving life? Is it about theater? Jealousy? Love? Passion? Manipulation? I guess there are many possibilities that could came up from such interrogations but maybe, we can put all these words in a same box with three letters graved in: E-V-E, but simply Eve, as a more poetic word to define womankind. Not that the movie has a pretension to show both the bright and dark sides of female nature, but it sure has a little pedagogic value about it, isn't it fitting that the film received the most Oscar nominations for female acting performances (all the actresses I mentioned in that paragraph)? And now before I would go on, please don't treat my words too cynically ? after all, I didn't make the film, so put the blame on Joseph L. Mankiewicz.I admit I cheated a bit to come to that conclusion, the movie says it itself in the trailer: "All About Eve" is all about women ? and their men. However, I didn't really care for most of the male characters, only foils for the fair sex, the real star of the film, but still, and this was the masterstroke of Mankiewicz's Oscar-winning script, whatever the male supporting cast lacked was contained in one single male character, the critic, Addison DeWitt (the Oscar-winning George Sanders), the man who devoted his life to theater with a level of passion that could've only been equaled by Eve's devouring ambition. Addison is not just the narrator of the film, our confident, THE Man, he's also the match for Eve, because he combines two essential qualities: understanding women and having the ability to overpower them. He understands women because all his work consists on guiding people's feeling into his personal ones, guiding as a euphemism for manipulating, he can fool but not be fooled, and he overpowers women, because he still have enough principles not to let himself blinded by his heart. Margo has the principles, Eve has the manipulative power, but Addison has both. Addison is the perfect neutral barometer to help us understanding women.Margo has the principles, she might be capricious but this is only the expression of an ego that became fragile since the big 4 have been reached. Margo is stuck in the middle-age crisis that expresses itself on stage when some roles get more difficult to play with credibility. She hides her vulnerable lack of self-confidence in a sort of diva attitude that makes her lower her guard when Karen introduces her to a young fan named Eve. Margo is first flattered by Eve's humility and devotion. Progressively, Eve's zealous nature starts to annoy her. At the end, Eve finally unmasked the true nature of her personality, an extraordinary mastermind of blind ambition, and probably the most memorable cinematic bitch since Veda Pierce. Eve's power would ultimately contribute to Margo's redemption after a powerful moment of personal evaluation, and even if Eve wins at the end, literally, she has lost something precious: the integrity that provides the independence. Margo is independent because she owes nothing to anyone; she's a true star because she sacrificed her own stardom for happiness, while Eve sacrificed her integrity for stardom. Swinging between the two opposite poles of female nature, "All About Eve" is a gender study with the theater world as a clever subplot. I say clever because in a way, Eve's attitude conveys whatever theater is about: acting, illusion, inspiring desired feelings, notice how we never see Eve on stage, if only to get a glimpse on her incredible talent. But do we need to? Isn't Eve's behavior all about acting, pretending to be what she's not. She might overact here and there but overall, she's convincing, because no one could ever guess that behind this angelic face, is hidden the heart of a she-wolf. The revelation of her true hypocritical and unethical ambition that earned her the #16 position from AFI's Top 50 Villains might come late in the film but it makes the dry and immediate slap she gets from DeWitt after she laughed at him even more satisfying, it's probably the most rewarding scene of all the film. Eve is an eternal actress treating her entourage as a supporting cast before being straightened out by Addison DeWitt, the one who could kill her character off at any moment."All About Eve" is about theater as much as its eternal rival "Sunset Boulevard" is about cinema, both worlds are embodied by their female lead characters, Eve Harrington and Norma Desmond, or both mirroring a pivotal moment in the lead actresses' respective careers: Gloria Swanson and Bette Davis. Both Best Picture nominees question the notions of success, but we finally understand, that it's only the institutions that throne and dethrone, and audiences that applaud or boo, cherish or forget. An actor or an actress are simply puppets dancing on strings held by these institutions, maybe being a star is being the true conductor of one's success. This is why Eve, contrarily to Margo would never be a star, there will always be Addison in front of her, and behind her, a wannabe Eve, hiding in a box of admiration an eagerness to take her place.Well, I guess this is what the ending shot of "All About Eve" is all about ?</fullReview>

Soon she finds that her assistant is more talented than she had imagined and may have hidden motives. This film is full of deceit. Eve gains the acceptance of Davis's crowd and begins to work her way up. Once the aging star begins to see that she is trying to steal her light she acts out. This only lets eve know she is feeling threatened. What is the price you are willing to pay for fame? This film questions if your dignity is worth the fame. Like other movies from it's time it shows the behind the scenes of the theater. The ending was very well made. Eve letting a stranger into her home and trusting that person was the mistake that Bette had made. Everyone is after your fame. It showed how egotistical people are when the idea of fame is involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A terrific story of the evanescent certainties of the performing life, All About Eve is also a finely-judged tale of the fickle nature of friendship. The axis of the film is the relationship of two actresses, the celebrated figure of Bette Davis' Margo Channing and the doe-eyed, yet peculiarly insistent ingénue Eve played with soft-focus insidiousness by Anne Baxter. The other characters find themselves drawn to this duo for all sorts of reasons which get articulated as the film progresses - love, venal self-interest, some without choice. I found the role of Birdie, Margo's assistant, as well-drawn (and well acted, by Barbara Bates) as any of the bolder relationships.There are lots of reasons why this is a really remarkable film. A notable one is the manner in which the central twists and overall betrayal do not end in some sort of Shakespearean blood-letting, but rather an acceptance that to be in this business is to make the best of it. Perhaps this is the reason why I find one other central issue so intriguing: the drama and outcome of the film revolves around the fact that Eve is a most talented actor, and, in an unseen central episode, gives a startlingly brilliant audition (also starring Marilyn Monroe). By the end there is a bizarre conflict of truths that a conventional narrative may have tried to consolidate but this leaves open - that success brings isolation and paranoia, but talent's waning ends in the reconciliation with the truth of love and friendship. Ably, acutely played by Bette Davis, Gary Merrill and Celeste Holm (Baxter is well- cast, rather than notably well-played), this is a gem of a film that looks on the business of the stage with compassion. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We begin at an awards ceremony at which Broadway's bright, new star Eve Harrington is about to receive the most distinguished honor theater has to offer. As the master of ceremonies goes through his paces leading up to his introduction of Eve we scan the faces in the crowd. And the people we are told know Eve best do not look happy. At all. Interesting. So who is Eve Harrington, how did she claw her way to the top? And who was left behind in her wake? We're going to find out all about Eve.Flash back a year and Eve Harrington is no Broadway star. She's a nobody. Margo Channing, now that's a star. Margo is one of Broadway's brightest lights but as she turns 40 years old she now faces the anxieties any aging actress would. Is it only a matter of time until she's shoved aside? She's a great star and she knows it but she can't go on playing younger characters forever. Time catches up to everyone. But for the moment she's a big success, her current production is a smash hit. And apparently there is no bigger fan of said production than Eve Harrington. She's seen every performance. She's undoubtedly Margo's biggest fan. And then comes the critical moment when young Eve meets the great star Margo. Before you know it Margo has taken Eve under her wing, making the young star-struck girl her assistant. Things go swimmingly. For a time anyway. Eve does a fine job attending to Margo's every need and Margo seems to really like the young girl. The only hint of discord comes from Margo's maid Birdie. She sees Eve studying Margo. Closely. Too closely. What are Eve's true intentions? Could this seemingly sweet young girl really be up to no good? Fasten your seat belts...The movie may be all about Eve but the standout performance no doubt comes from Bette Davis playing Margo. The perfect meeting of actress and role, autobiographical in a way with Davis undoubtedly facing many of the same questions in her own life that Margo does. In retrospect the fact that Davis did not win an Oscar for her performance is rather laughable. It's the performance of a lifetime, a tour de force the likes of which is very, very rarely seen. Anne Baxter plays Eve, a challenging role no doubt as it is a character who undergoes a great transformation over the course of the film. Baxter does very well although there is the nagging sense that she is more believable in the first half of the film than she is later on. The other standout is George Sanders playing snobbish theater critic Addison DeWitt, a man who has a talent for getting right to the heart of the matter and cutting people down to size. His dry wit is one of the film's great charms. The other men in the story don't make much of an impression. Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter have their moments but aside from Davis and Baxter the woman who draws the most attention is one Marilyn Monroe. She was basically an unknown at the time and has only a bit part here but she plays that part perfectly and when she's on the screen you can't take your eyes off her. Is that because all these decades later we have the benefit of knowing she's Marilyn Monroe? Maybe that's part of it but there's no denying she did a great job here with what little she had to work with.All About Eve is smart, witty, brilliantly written. It's a movie which is entertaining and more than a little surprising. Some fascinating characters lead the story in some very interesting directions. High drama with room for some good laughs too. Davis turns in one of the most memorable performances of all time and is ably supported by a fine cast around her. There's very little not to like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Never Stop Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve. It seems that there are only a few films that really can be called classics. People have heard of these films and they refer to them when mentioning or suggesting films for others to see. They creep up into the conversation. "Oh, but you have seen _____, haven't you? That's a classic film!" It appears that All About Eve is one of these films. There is nothing more enchanting than fame?at least to the people portrayed in this film. The world of acting is continuous. All of the characters act. There is not a single moment when any of them are through acting, not even at the end. If the performances seem strange or an account of 'over-acting', that's because there is no such moment when the actors are not performing. This leads to performances. Above all, Bette Davis is the true star. This is the very first film I have seen her in, though it will not be my last. Yes, people call her a legend and she is famous, but this movie shows just how much she deserves to be a famous legend. She knew exactly how to play Margo. I do not know if there is any other actress that could have given the performance she did (at least in that time period.) It may be called All About Eve, but I was really mesmerized the most by Bette Davis/Margo. That being said, Anne Baxter, or Eve, was exceptionally good. At first, she seemed a little stiff, but by the end of the film I understood why she behaved the way she did. Her determination to get exactly what she wanted was very apparent throughout the whole film. Finally, Marilyn Monroe, who played Miss Casswell, was only in the film for two scenes, yet she was one of the most memorable?which really does prove something about her performance. She was great at switching between Miss Casswell the Woman and Miss Casswell the Actress (though who in this film was not an actor/actress in some way?) There really were no bad performances, which is a very rare thing for a film. Of course, you cannot review All About Eve without discussing the script. I have not seen every film ever released, so my claim that this is the greatest script I have ever found may not be entirely accurate, but I do not know how else to describe it. The dialog is just wonderful. So many wonderful lines have emerged and become well-known because of this movie. ("Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night!") The script alone could have made this a brilliant movie. Some of the lines may not feel completely realistic, but is that really the point? The great thing about the dialog is the way that it "snaps" from line to line, thereby adding to the entire experience of watching the film by engaging you further in the story. This is not a film for everyone. This is only a film for those who have ever wanted something in their life and have been willing to destroy others in order to get what they desired. This is a film about passion and the way that we act in order to protect that passion of ours. If this feeling is familiar to you, then go to the nearest DVD store and rent (or buy) it. You won't be able to forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Eve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All about Eve reminds me of today's society, not just Hollywood society but also our society as a whole. In the film Eve's main concern is to get ahead. I feel as though many people could relate to this because in many cases in order to get ahead in your own career it is necessary to con your way in. People in today's society scheme their way into jobs they don't deserve. Many like Eve purposely sabotage others in order for them to have their big break. I found it a little ironic that for a while Eve was able to keep the act of a good assistant, showing her true talent for Broadway acting without really knowing it. This movie is very good, and despite its negative reflection on society it was a movie that I enjoyed. Bette Davis although she was a supporting role was incredible, her presence was very commanding and my eyes went to Davis whenever she was on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film, a fun, yet gritty story about life in Hollywood. From the time it started, I was hooked into a marvellous cast, screenplay, and direction. I had never watched a Bette Davis film before, but I tell you, this ones a great one to start with. Her performance is certainly Margo, she just says every word with a 'stardom' feel about it-- especially when she says "A milkshake?", that is one line that I always carry with me. Anne Baxter makes a good effort as Eve, but only really when she is alone, she acts really well, but she is often over shadowed by Bette Davis. Celeste Holm also makes a good performance, many of her scenes are flawless, though there is that Davis problem. I still applaud Celeste for a good stab at it. I'd also like to recognize Thelma Ritter, I just adore her delivery of her character. I think that's an easy character to base anyone on, and Thelma did it with a cool calm approach. The other stars did well, but I admire the women's performances a lot more, since it's really a womens film!! I love this film to bits, it's inspiring and not once does it leave me bored. 10/10 for me.</fullReview>

MankiewiczWith Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, Gary Merrill, Celeste Holm and George Sanders.Wonderful, acid and sarcastic masterpiece about Baxter as the dreamed fan of Davis, but soon all going to discover "all about Eve". One of the best written films ever made, with immortal dialogs and probably, the best Davis performance - and surely, one the best performances ever too-. Look for Marilyn Monroe and Thlema Ritter in small roles. Winner of best picture of the year - Davis don't won the award! -. One of the great inspirations for Almodovar's masterpiece "Todo sobre mi Madre". Released in Spanish as "Los secretos de Eva" or "Eva al desnudo". This movie going to give you a bumped night, undoubtedly, one of the greatest!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawless All-Star Cast working with, arguably, cinema's greatest screenplay...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just about as perfect a film as they come, 1950's ALL ABOUT EVE was an instant classic upon its release and remains one of the most talked about films by cinema historians fifty years later. The film received an unprecedented 14 Oscar nominations (a record unbroken until TITANIC) and walked away with 7 Oscars, including Best Picture of the Year. Joseph L. Manckiewicz, for the second year in a row, won dual Oscars for directing and writing this sparkling comedy drama about an aging actress named Margo Channing (Bette Davis), who befriends a star struck fan named Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) who we slowly learn has her own agenda in befriending her idol. This film is an on-target skewering of the New York theater scene and the poor souls who toil in it. Davis and Baxter are both flawless and were both nominated for Best Actress. George Sanders won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as an acid-tongued theater critic named Addison DeWitt, who becomes a prime player in the delicious twists this story takes. Gary Merrill plays Bill Sampson, a theater director and Margo's much younger lover. Hugh Marlowe (in probably the most significant role of his insignificant career) and Celeste Holm play Lloyd and Karen, the playwright who writes almost exclusively for Margo and his wife, Margo's best friend. There are also memorable turns by Thelma Ritter as Margo's housekeeper and a very young Marilyn Monroe as Addison DeWitt's "protegee", Miss Casswell. The cast all work at the top of their game, thanks to inspired direction, but it is the screenplay that is the real star of this classic. I can't think of another movie in history with dialogue that sparkles and dances the way it does here. Mackiewicz's Best Screenplay Oscar was richly deserved. His Best Director Oscar primarily stemmed from having a perfect cast. Ironically, Claudette Colbert was originally slated to play Margo but had to drop out due to an injury, twist of fate that allowed Bette Davis to give the most amazing performance of her career which should have won her an Oscar as well. A true classic in every sense of the word...don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a real standout film from its era. The dialogue still seems smart and funny. the off-screen affair between Bette Davis &amp; Gary Merrill probably added to the obvious chemistry between them on screen. Marilyn Monroe is the perfect scene stealer, but is hardly alone with other supporting cast members like Thelma Ritter, who easily dominates her few scenes as Davis' dresser. Although Davis was the star and the story revolves around here and "Eve", its George Sanders who steals the show. His long, confrontational speech with Anne Baxter near the end of the film is easily one of the best things about the film. I wonder how the subtext of lesbianism and homosexuality (Addison DeWitt's obvious "beardsmanship") got past the censors. Perhaps it was the heavy handedness of Davis' character's desire for a husband that overshadowed it. Margo Channing's willingness to give up the stage seems a bit overdone, even for its era and is the one false note in the film, especially coming from an iconoclast like Davis. Nonetheless, this is a great film that holds up well, even on repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Miss Harrington knows all about it."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About half way through the film, one realizes just exactly what Eve Harrington is, and it begins with a capital 'B'. Anne Baxter turns in an understated but tantalizing performance as the title character, at the same time challenging co-star Bette Davis for the Best Actress Oscar, though won by neither that year. The film is a scathing portrayal of getting to the top in the ethereal world of the Broadway theater, and how one woman pulls out all the stops to go for the brass ring.One generally finds the best one liners of the era in stylish noir thrillers, but this one offers some great ones. Margo Channing (Davis) commenting on her own brashness - "Oh relax kid, it's just me and my big mouth". Her friend Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) reacting to yet another Channing outburst - "We know you, we've seen you like this before. Is it over or just beginning?" Brilliant stuff.One of the surprise appearances of the film for me was that of Marilyn Monroe in a performance that might have paralleled Eve Harrington's own in real life. How fitting would it have been to have her cast as Phoebe at the end of the story, daydreaming her way to future stardom in a case of life imitating art? I got a kick out of how the script managed to work in the names of leading celebrities of the day into the script. There were references to Tyrone Power, Gregory Peck, Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward and even producer Zanuck."All About Eve" is a great take on the old 'what goes around comes around' theme, peppered with insightful bitter wit and colorful players. It's focus on age obsession with Davis' character is particularly poignant today with the TV tabloid emphasis on out of control faux celebrities and wanna be's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been reported that Bankhead once said to Bette, "You stole my act." It's also been said that Tallulah was the only person in Hollywood or Broadway that actually intimidated Davis.Nowhere is the parallel more apparent than Bette's Margo Channing in "All About Eve": the vocal inflections, raised eyebrows, huffy attitude, and posturing with cigarettes, all point to the Tallullah source.Yet, when one watches a Bankhead performance (all that's left is what's on film) one doesn't see only Davis. So, while Bette's "source material" reference is clear, it's also apparent that the two actors brought their own unique qualities to their work.They both are fine artists, and while Davis may have "borrowed" a lot from Bankhead, Davis added so much more of her own creativity to come up with a distinctive and unique presence that can only be summarized as "one of a kind."</fullReview>

And as Margo she has one of, in my opinion, the best pieces of film dialogue: "You're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing, sitting up.

Generally speaking, the current era is focused almost exclusively on youth and looks, not on wit and intelligence. Hence, sad to say, there is no current analog for Bette Davis. This movie is funny (as well as serious), intelligent, and sexy and holds up to several viewings. Bette looks stunning. The scenes between the men and the women seem like real adults interacting, not cutesy couples playing at love. The script and cast are terrific. Marilyn Monroe makes her first (I believe) appearance in film in that ditzy-yet-endearing comedic acting that became so familiar. I hope to God this film is never remade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an excellent script and crackerjack performances steer this classic backstage theater melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joseph L. Mankiewicz, it should be noted with All About Eve, shows how good a screenwriter he is. He's very good, almost too good if that's possible. It's such a richly textured script with its dialog and plot turns, its evolving and revealing characters that reveal through their distinct personalities, that it almost becomes too much of a good thing. In a way the script reminds me of the main star character of All About Eve, Margo played by Bette Davis, who knows she's good and is almost arrogant in its flamboyance (if not quite as insecure in comparison). This isn't as a put-down per-say; the film overall is one of those smashingly entertaining mainstream Hollywood classics, a less weird and noirish take on somewhat similar material as Sunset Blvd. If I won't immediately want to re-watch All About Eve as much as I would Sunset Blvd, it would still remain something I'd recommend in a heart beat to an aspiring movie buff.Especially if one wants to see Bette Davis movies. This is possibly her quintessential performance, full of fire and bravado and put-ons and tears and slight little motions with her eyes that tell more than other actors can do in an entire scene as usual. She embodies this character while still coming off as a real star herself, and giving a great performance. On top of her (appropriately) stealing the show in every scene she's in- even that quiet scene between her and Celeste Holm- Anne Baxter shows her up in a more subtle turn as the title character (the only one of the principles without some narration), since she does has a transformation that we can guess will happen but comes around somewhat unexpectedly. It would've been poetic irony had she won the Oscar, considering how her character winds up, but on its own it's one of her most incredibly touching and dangerous characters.The beauty as well with All About Eve is that it transcends what could have been just a (in quotes) "chick flick". It has backstabbing and double-crossing, second guessing and secrets withheld, high and tense emotions, and just the real full-on presence of mature and tough female actors. It could fall in to the traps of convention, but even when it feels familiar it's never boring, it's never too contrived where it distracts from the flow of the story or character dynamics, the supporting performances from female and male performers (notably Thelma Ritter and George Sanders) surprise and hold up their own with the stars, and it's cool for just about anybody (it's not like, for example, certain other Bette Davis pictures that seem much more skewed for female audiences). It's both terrific theatre and finely staged film-making, without pretension but delivering one of those final shots that is right up there with Sunset Blvd.Bottom line, I won't put All About Eve in my top ten favorites of all time, but most scenes are unforgettable as far as classic Golden-age Hollywood goes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the Eve's aim wasn't like that and she wasn't introduced to Addison DeWitt, it would be an ordinary film for me and I would never hide it as a part of classicals archives. Yes, this is the main reason that it proves itselfs. I appreciate the staff of film so. Eve acts her amazing role skilfully and the others of course, too. Marilyn Monroe suits her role but I think she would be a good choice to play Eve.To the story, Margo Channing is a well-known theatre player whose staff contains her darling also the director Bill Sampson, her writer Lloyd Richards and his wife Karen Richards. Eve is a peculiar girl who meets Margo Channing by means of Karen Richards. I said peculiar but at least she introduces herself as she is like that. She fools everybody and starts to serve Margo Channing like a servant. Nobody doubts this condition except for Birdie Coonan who is the assistant of Margo Channing. Then the time goes and Eve's aim appears spontaneously. Eve wants to substitute Channing but she displays such a modesty that makes everybody pity for her. After that Eve goes forward desiring to take Bill from the Margo Channing.I think the film must be separated into two parts. In the first part, that makes you ask the question "I wonder What will Eve's end do?" and more exciting from the second part, in the second part which is more boring but also completing the puzzle you'll find the character of Eve, all about Eve.This film is an impressive example for the people who wants to be a star and do anything to became a star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'All About Eve' is a dramatic yet realistic portrayal of show business and backstage life New York theatre. A cinematic masterpiece and one of the all-time classic films, this award winner has superb acting, directing, and highly believable characters, which i think someone could relate to, at one time in life. The film is kept together by Mankiewicz' witty,tough and believable screenplay. The film is based upon his view's about show business, and thanks it's not all fancy and glamorous, it can be nasty and deceitful. The film also shows the fear of ageing and what can happen when the loss of power and fame wears off, for whatever reason.It was nominated for fourteen awards - more than any other picture in Oscar history, until Titanic (1997), forty-seven years later. The skillful film won six Oscars: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders), Best Director (Joseph L. Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (Joseph L. Mankiewicz), Best Sound Recording, and Best B/W Costume Design. Four actresses in the film were nominated (and all lost). It holds the record for the film with the most female acting nominees:* Best Actress (two) - Bette Davis and Anne Baxter* Best Supporting Actress (two) - Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter'Bette Davis' skillful and leading role as Margo Channing has generally been considered her greatest career performance and her most memorable role. Her part as an ageing, 40-year old Broadway actress fit the 42-year old Davis perfectly, at a time when acting roles were drying up for her. Anne Baxter as the devious Eve warms our hearts straight away, she seem's so sweet and innocent, but that all changes later one. The question is did she plan to take over Margo, was she really a huge fan? Or just a jealous stalker? These can all be questions of strong possibilities. Thelma Ritter gave a great performance, and although she had a smaller role she did it tremendously and gave it her all. George Sander's played a great scheming wannabe agent, but did a great job. And the beautiful Marilyn Monroe, my idol, her small scene opened up her and lead the way for her being around such legendary people which she herself became too, i would of like to see her with a bigger role.All about Eve is without a doubt one of the best films of all time and must be watched, it will alway's stick i your mind like glue, and is a film you have to see before you die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is campy, great, funny, clever, and just plain fun. If someone didn't know who Bette Davis was, they'd know everything they needed to about her after seeing this movie. Her real life and her character in the film are practically one and the same. There's a reason it is consistently rated as one of the best classic movies of all time. If you like old black &amp; whites, great dialog, and cynical wit, you'll find it all here. Occasionally a few lines slip into slightly corny territory but that may simply be a matter of 50's sensibilities clashing with modern expectations of how a character might speak. All About Eve has moments where a look or a turn of phrase is dead-on perfect. Those moments will stay with you long after you've finished watching it. 'Nuf said. Watch it and you'll see why it deserves its place in film history.</fullReview>

They're not believed by the males close to them, who still see Eve as a vulnerable waif. (Even Addison is fooled at first!)I love my DVD with its extra film commentaries by Mankewicz's son, Celeste Holm (the only surviving star) and others...The subtleties--Eve "sleeps" her way to the top... but this is only suggested---never shown. (Thus my 6 year old can walk thru the livingroom when "EVE" is on--.) Great script writing---great lines, also.

Nothing is as it seems in the miasma of ego, posturing, deception and self-promotion. A deliciously savage self-commentary, and none escapes unscathed.My own connection to this film is when Eve, after clawing her way to the top, actually just forgets the actual award in the taxi. I did an analogous faux pas when I won an award at a stodgy trade convention, I left the trophy (and about a month's salary) on the tables of an establishment where women disrobed inexotic fashion. I was saved embarrassment by one of the dancers running the thing out to my taxi as we were pulling away.</fullReview>

Watch this movie and see where many of today's "soap" operas and dramas draw their strength. Could Alexis and Krystal on "Dynasty" easily have been replaced by Margo and Eve? Could J.R. Ewing draw his rapier wit and cunning from Addison? And it's always a delight seeing Marilyn Monroe in a role that Hollywood made for her, and which she did so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILERS FROM VERY BEGINNING!***I had always heard OF All About Eve. Fortunately, I had never really heard much ABOUT the movie. I am most thankful for that, now! When I finally got a chance to see it over Christmas, I went in knowing only that it was about backstage Broadway life and that Bette Davis had received rave reviews for her performance. Therefore, I was totally na?ve, entering Joseph L. Mankiewicz's world.I was totally stunned by the final 20% of the movie &amp; how far afield my judgment of Eve had been! I pity the viewers who have already heard how things turn out before watching it. I then, naturally, went back and watched a second time, knowing what everyone else probably knew to begin with. This really helped me see what a master work of film craft this was!I came away amazed at how my (and probably most na?ve first-time viewers) opinion of Margo Channing and Eve Harrington changed between my first viewing of the first ? of the film and my second viewing! Ms. Davis certainly deserved all the praise she received for this role! Seemingly conceited, vain, childish, selfish and totally paranoid, to Eve's gentle sweetness, Margo winds up emerging as a tremendously more likeable human being than her devious understudy. Childish, vain, selfish? Perhaps-although probably less than many would have been in her position. Paranoid? Ha! As hindsight showed, of course, she is the only one with enough intuition to mistrust Eve. Despite her foibles, Davis' Margo emerges as a thoroughly human, decent person. It is hard to come up with adjectives for Eve in a family website!All About Eve could represent the last gasp of the glory days of Hollywood. Box office receipts were already down, television was beginning to take its huge bite and experiments with everything from 3D to Smellorama were just a few years away. So were the dark, troubled films of rebellion, as the studios gave up on the old formulas for the most part. All About Eve took the old formula and showed just how well it could work. The acting of Davis and Anne Baxter (Eve) is superb, as is that of George Sanders (the appropriately-named columnist Addison DeWitt), Celeste Holm (Karen), Gary Merrell (Bill) and Hugh Marlowe (Lloyd). The cinematography is wonderful and the script a true joy. Listening to the good-natured bickering and cajoling between Margo and her long-time maid Birdie (Thelma Ritter) is delightful. So are little touches like the exchange after Karen (having unwittingly betrayed Margo) breaks into uncontrollable laughter after Margo announces she no longer feels the need to play characters half her age ? and Margo's delightfully instinctive move to scoot her wine glass away from her as she does.Of course, is was 1950, not 1955. None of the married or semi-married men (We assume Addison is a bachelor) go for Eve's seduction ploys. She gets hers when she realizes Addison `owns' her. (Incidentally, this may have been the only time I have ever grinned [though just a little] when a man slapped a woman on screen.) And, of course, in the end, we see Eve opening the door to an Eve of her own. Poetic justice still prevailed in Hollywood-and when it was this well-done, old-fashion morals and sentiment worked as well as ever. Not many more movies like Eve would be made. Then again, All About Eve is timeless and will always be there for new generations. All About Eve was really All About What Makes a Great Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dazzlingly witty and superbly acted masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'All About Eve' is one of those classic films that few of my generation have heard of or will ever see. I wouldn't have picked it out of the library collection had a friend not recommended it me. It's a shame it's not better known, as it is a truly great film.Margo Channing, aging theatre star and prima donna, is introduced by her friend Karen to Eve, an apparently obsessed young fan. Eve has a tragic story to tell and is taken under the wings of Margo and Karen. But the movie makes clear from the start that Eve is not what she seems, and soon she is causing ripples in the lives of both older women. Ripples that grow into whirlpools.The script is a gem, funny and very clever, full of lines like this:Lloyd Richards: You've developed a certain cynicism since you've been married to me. Karen Richards: I developed that cynicism the day I discovered I was different from little boys.Characters frequently trade lines like barbed arrows, but it's not all dazzling wit: there's plenty of fascinating insights into the characters' personalities, and also a couple of rather chilling moments, when a lot of tension that has built up gets released. It's both a brilliant satire and a compelling drama.The actors are all excellent, with Bette Davis as Margo and Anne Baxter as Eve standing out. Davis gives Margo real depth: she's a complex mix of ego and insecurity, warmth and venom. Baxter is pitch-perfect as Eve: just a little too sweet, just a bit too modest. It's a performance of a performance. Both got Oscar nominations for Best Actress (the movie recieved 12 and won 6, including Best Picture). There's also a glittering cameo by Marilyn Monroe. She was not famous yet, but somehow, despite the classy actors around her, she draws the eye in every scene she's in.Go and track it down. It's worth the effort.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a reason this film walked off with at least 6 Oscars and has stood the test of time. Rapier wit written by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and a stellar cast with acting skills from the proscenium stage one doesn't see in film today. This is probably Bette Davis's swan song, as Margo Channing the just past her prime Queen of the Stage. Ann Baxter is superb as the overly ambitious girl who will do anything to get the fame and glory she desires. George Sanders as the serpentine gossip columnist is at his most devious. Plus a wonderful supporting cast.The are classic lines that are delivered with the craft of the royalty of American Theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST PERFORMANCE BY THE BEST ACTRESS IN THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ALL ABOUT EVE won 6 Oscars, including Best Picture and was nominated for a record 14. A total that has been equalled once but never surpassed. AND THE GREAT BETTE DIDN'T WIN!! DAYLIGHT ROBBERY!! True, she had formidable competition this year, particularly from Gloria Swanson in her comeback "SUNSET BOULEVARDE" and taking nothing from the thoroughly deserved Best Actress winner Judy Holliday for the comedy classic BORN YESTERDAY, nor from EVE herself, Anne Baxter. But Bette is utterly mesmerizing, and with a gallery of exceptional performances around her, in the end it's hers we all remember. With a plethora of outstanding films and performances prior to this and luckily for her fans, with many more to come, Margo Canning remains her best ever delineation. Perhaps Baxter, in the title role that gives full range to her own talents, from sweet to spitefullly manipulative, took votes from Bette. But that's no excuse for this outlandish oversight on the Academy's behalf. The deliciously malevolent dialogue is spat out with glee by both leading ladies as well as by George Sanders (an utterly deserving Oscar winner) &amp; the ever delightful Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe, in a small role, made sure she was noticed too among the fireworks. And let's not forget the stellar work of Celeste Holm &amp; Gary Merill. Not to be missed, and repeatedly to be enjoyed, ALL ABOUT EVE is unquestionably the best ever film about the behind the scenes machinations of the acting world. In fact, IT IS THE BEST EVER FILM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All About Eve, represents movie making at its best. The true test for a great film, is how many times can you watch it, and still enjoy. I've seen "Eve", hundreds of times, and am always totally amused and enraptured by this great film. The storyline, direction,script, cinematography, score, and above all the great cast make this a movie to see over and over again. re; cast, "Eve" has the best ensemble cast ever, the entire cast should have been given an Oscar...Bette Davis was absolutely brilliant as Margo, there has an never will be another Margo on screen!! Anne Baxter was outstanding, especially in her later scenes. Thelma Ritter almost steals every scene shes in (the only flaw in the film, is where's the Birdie character played by Ritter later on?) George Sanders is sophisticated, and sinister as Addison De Witt, a role which he played to the hilt.. a well deserved Oscar winner..The other male characters, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, and Gregory Ratoff are all well cast, and well played. Celeste Holm made a perfect Karen.. and of course, Marilyn Monroe, as Miss Casswell, looked breathtakingly beautiful,with a promise of a great future to come.(I'll never understand why it took 2 more yrs.,for her next major role in"Don't Bother to Knock"??). The film that equalled it's Oscar nomination record, Titanic, I've seen only twice, thats enough!It(EVE) should have won more than 6 Oscars! Oh well, it will live on forever...Unparalled Wit and sophistication on screen !!</fullReview>

Bette Davis is unparalleled in her role as an aging, canny, beautiful and charismatic movie star. Anne Baxter plays Eve perfectly. And Marilyn Monroe gives a scene-stealing turn as a gold-digging starlet. You should not miss this for the incredibly sharp dialogue alone, not to mention the way it strikes a chord regarding the less admirable sides of human behavior.

		<shortDescription>One of the Greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never has such greatness been achieved in a film about lives off the stage as in All About Eve. If you want proof, look no further than George Sanders' Oscar-winning performance as the critic Addison DeWitt. The poison pen donning DeWitt, though holding but a handful of scenes, carries the film on his character-actor shoulders. DeWitt is treacherous and vile to the well-acted quartet of main characters, but to myself and others, DeWitt is an antihero -- cunning and, as he puts it, "nobody's fool". A cool character through the foolish antics of Margo Channing and the devious plots of Eve Harrington.The other characters, save Eve, are too human and fall into each others traps. Eve, on the other hand, is much like DeWitt, only less precise and too ambitious.Anne Baxter's Eve is often overplayed, but Davis, Merrill, and Marlowe are on the money, though they pale to Sanders. Look for Thelma Ritter and, especially, Marilyn Monroe giving short but excellent performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there a better reaction shot in film history than the one Bette Davis's Margo Channing gives when Anne Baxter's Eve Harrington acknowledges her as an inspiration at a ceremony honoring Eve's success as an actress? On a casual viewing, "All About Eve" may seem like an unlikely candidate for great film status: it's not epic in scope, it's not even about any "big" issue, and, Davis aside, it's not full of above-title stars. But each time I watch it, I'm more impressed with how rich a movie it is. It's perhaps the one film I've seen that comes the closest to being able to do what a novel can do: develop full, psychologically complex characters whose inner thoughts you can read, even though they're never (or rarely) directly stated. This film is a monument to screen acting. Not one actor hits a wrong note (though Baxter is occasionally over the top). And the writing is as sharp as writing ever gets, with one quotable line after another firing off the lips of the actors without giving the audience a chance to catch its breath.Even though it's about the theatre, one has to believe that "Eve" is really more about Hollywood and the business of film making. A group of show biz veterans who helped the art form grow up have to sit back and watch the business taken over by a younger set with ideas of their own. Never before have I seen assembled for a film a cast with more chemistry than the one here; it practically makes the screen sizzle whenever all of them are on it together."All About Eve" is a totally adult, fairly cynical film produced at a time when many films felt it necessary to tack on hokey happy endings no matter how unbelievable they might be, or spell out the film's message with a bullhorn and a neon sign for an audience the film makers obviously didn't think were savvy enough to get the message on their own. Come to think of it, "Eve" stands apart from the majority of films released today that are still being made for the lowest common denominator. A truly great film and one not to be missed.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are no great dramatic moments in ALL ABOUT EVE; no suicides, no murders, no fist fights, no chase scenes. Rather the film is about people of the theatre (that's "thee-A-tah") to whom life is drama. The film is full of little dramatic moments: grand entrances, dramatic exits, fiery confrontations and lines of clever dialogue drenched in wit or sarcasm or acid. There are precious few casual or ordinary moments; the characters all know the power of words and the greater power of delivering those words with style. My favorite moment is a great example. During a heated quarrel with her beau, Bette Davis, as Broadway star Margo Channing, has an equally dramatic confrontation with a candy dish. As the two squabble over matters both petty and poignant, superficial and sincere, Margo divides her attention between the man in her life (played by the man in Davis' life, Gary Merrill) and the contents of the candy dish. As she swaps snide one-liners, Margo debates whether or not to surrender to the temptation of a diet-busting sweet. She picks up the lid of the candy bowl and picks out a chocolate; she sets it down and picks it up and puts it back. The simple act of eating a piece of candy becomes high drama. Then, at precisely the right moment, she pops it into her mouth and chews ferociously, conquering the chocolate, even as the chocolate conquers her. She loses the battle, but on her own terms.The title is misleading. It is only partly about Eve; it is equally about Margo. Margo Channing is "a great star, a true star," so we are told. Into her life comes Eve Harrington, a dangerously ambitious young actress, more interested in a short cut to stardom than in paying her thespian dues. Little by little, Eve worms her way into Margo's life and bit by bit she tries to steal Margo's place as the first lady of the theatre. Eve ultimately wins, sorta; but even as Margo loses the battle, she loses on her own terms. ALL ABOUT EVE is a great movie, one of the all time best. But the film has no clear-cut arc or structure. Rather, it is meant as a character study, a collection of wonderful little scenes that allow a remarkable cast to shine. A film about actors for actors. As such, most of the performances are just a tad over the top; not hammy, but theatrical. Yet, pitch perfect; we never doubt for a minute that any of the characters would act just like this in real life. Davis is at the peak of her skills and gives the performance of her career: petty, flamboyant, bitchy, sincere and "maudlin and full of self-pity." The rest of the cast is made of pros: Merrill, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe, Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe in a small but telling early role. Especially fine is George Sanders as Addison DeWitt ("I am a critic and commentator. I am essential to the theatre - as ants to a picnic, as the boll weevil to a cotton field."). His character is both the film's villain and moral conscience; seeing through the other characters' artifice, keeping them honest, a trait he avoids in himself. Coming to the role with an established screen persona of an arrogant cad, Sanders is perfect as a man who has made an art out of being demanding and judgmental. It is one of the great screen performances. The one truly odd performance is that of Anne Baxter. Her performance as Eve is obvious, arch and almost amateurish. In another film, it would be awful. Here it is just right. The audience sees through Eve's manipulations and lies -- and so should the other characters. But in a world where everything is a performance, sincerity is whatever is the most flattering. We take it on face value that Eve is a great actress on the stage, where she may indeed be real; but off stage we are meant to see the difference between her false theatrics and the other characters sincere theatrics. Baxter's performance is bad for all the right reasons. I remember seeing this film with a college audience in the 1980s. The audience laughed when Davis gave her famous monologue about the sacrifices she made for a career ("Funny business, a woman's career, the things you drop on the way up the ladder so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you get back to being a woman."). I wonder how many of the proto-feminists in that audience would laugh at it now. ALL ABOUT EVE is about blind ambition, but it is also about the acceptance of change. A star knows when to take center stage; a great star knows when to take a bow and exit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many films that we as viewers call `a classic', and I believe that we (myself definitely included) tend to overuse that term. When discussing the `classic' All About Eve however, the term is more than warranted.Possible SpoilersAll About Eve is the story of an ambitious and almost `too sweet' woman named Eve who manages to work her way into an elite group of theater people headed by Bette Davis, who plays the stage actress Margo Channing. Margo may be intelligent and beautiful, but she is the perfect target for the young Eve; She is 40 and is concerned about holding on to her roles and holding on to her younger boyfriend, the theater director Bill Sampson. Eve becomes Margo's personal assistant when Karen, Margo's best friend and the wife of the playwright who pens most of Margo's work, finally satisfies her curiosity and goes to talk to the woman she sees at every performance. Eve sees her `in' and grabs it, thereby giving her the opportunity to slowly manipulate the circle of friends and slowly pit them against one another while she rises to her own ambitions.There are two things that make this film one of my favorites. The first are the great performances turned out by a couple of standouts in an altogether great cast. Bette Davis positively radiant as Channing, and is at her prime in her career. She takes a scene and chews it up then spits it out with an amazing amount of panache, while still convincing us that she is vulnerable. My other favorite is the outstanding George Sanders, who plays the velvet voiced and acid tongued theater critic, Addison DeWitt. DeWitt will rip you to shreds, but he will do it with such style and ease that you have to wonder for a moment if you have been complimented or insulted. Sanders is brilliant in this role, and despite the fact that I cannot recall a time when I've ever seen him play anything BUT the snake guy, he is in rare form in `Eve'. I'm sure it's no coincidence that these characters' lines are the ones that most people remember.Conversely, as the acting IS dead on, if it weren't for the fantastic script, the roles would have had no substance. The writing in All About Eve is so lightning paced, that even those of us who have seen the film many times feel the desire to slow down the film a bit in order to catch every nuance, every aside, or any impromptu look or gesture. I've heard criticism of the film stating that it was `too dramatic' or `too overdone'. I'm inclined to disagree with that based on the fact that it is a film featuring a cast who are theater people and are therefore inherently dramatic. I found it to be completely believable and natural for the setting it was in. At a recent meeting of our `film club' my friends and I watched All About Eve, and it is our tradition during the discussion for each person to point out one good thing and one bad thing about the film. If I recall correctly, the harshest criticism about this film was that it was `a little dated'. When one is forced to find something bad about a film and this is what they come up with, that is pretty reflective of the integrity of the film. All About Eve set an Oscar record for its 14 nominations and walked away with Best Supporting Actor, Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay among others. I've noticed that All About Eve is one of those great films that people (at least ones I have encountered) acknowledge as a `classic film' but haven't actually seen it. Perhaps this is a sign of the film's longevity ? it isn't as timeless as say, `The Wizard of Oz'. Whether that is true or not will be determined in the coming decades, but whether or not the film eventually becomes hackneyed and irrelevant, sliding into obscurity, I'll still be extolling its virtues and showing it to those who have not yet experienced this jewel of a film because in the opinion of this movie lover it is sheer perfection.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)When I was a kid I would go to the second-run movie theater virtually every Saturday and watch three features, a cartoon and a newsreel indiscriminately. It was all wonderful to me (although I would hide bashfully behind the seat during the love scenes). I would come out of the theater several hours later (sometimes watching one of the features twice) amazed at what I'd seen and changed forever.The first adult movie that ever really held my interest though was All About Eve. Such is the power of the all too human story and how directly and clearly it is told from a celebrated script and some sublime direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Bette Davis who was then, by Hollywood standards for actresses, an ancient 41-years-old but not yet halfway through a 58-year movie career, stars as Margo Channing, a New York stage actress feeling very heavily the loss of her splendid youth. Eve Harrington is played with a veiled duplicity by Anne Baxter in a breakout role. I sat with fascination, understanding perfectly how and why she had insinuated herself into Margo's life, and on the edge of my seat to find out what would become of her. Yes, a child may well know of such matters, and it is to the credit of Mankiewicz and everyone involved in the production that a movie could be made that would inform and fire the imagination of a ten-year-old boy while at the same time intrigue and entertain adults. Ah, if only they made "chick flicks" like this today!Of course, All About Eve is more than a chick flick even though the men, Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill) as Margo's beau, and Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe) as a writer (and husband of Margo's best friend, Karen, played by Celest Holm) headed for Hollywood, take a back seat to the main action which is the playing out of the eternal power struggle between (take your pick: they all fit psychologically): youth and age, the daughter and the mother, the bride and the mother-in-law, the upstart and the established talent, the new and the old.Bette Davis is excellent of course, and the role fits her like a glove. But what transfixed me as a child was the contrast between the wholesome good looks of Anne Baxter and her sneaky treachery. Could someone so pretty be so bad? I may have wondered who I would have preferred for a mother, Davis or Baxter, and perhaps have come away not knowing. For Bette Davis the luster had gone from those famous eyes, and so it was only natural that her character Margo feared the loss of love from men. Even that I understood as a child. And in Baxter, youth would be served and perhaps she could be forgiven the lies because time does not stand still for anyone, especially it does not stand still for a starlet.Notable in supporting roles are Thelma Ritter and George Sanders, the former as Margo's maid and alter-ego Birdie, the latter as the cynical and barbed theater critic, Addison DeWitt (named perhaps with the 17th/18th century Brit wit and essayist Joseph Addison in mind), who escorts about town none other than a not-so-dumb blonde named Marilyn Monroe in her screen debut. The script, resplendent with some very sharp one-liners, was adapted from the story, "The Wisdom of Eve" (a bit of irony-on-the-square in the title perhaps) by Mary Orr and of course became the Broadway musical Applause (not yet a movie). Mankiewicz won Oscars for both his script and his direction, and Sanders won for Best Supporting Actor while the movie itself won for Best Picture over such fine films as Sunset Boulevard and Born Yesterday. Both Davis and Baxter were nominated for Best Actress but lost out to Judy Holliday in Born Yesterday.Bottom line: one of the great stories of the theater, a classic Hollywood film not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?All About Eve' is enjoyable for it's great script and terrific performances. The story is compelling and the characters interesting and there isn't a weak performance anywhere. That said, it is too long and could easily have lost another twenty minutes and this could have been done by speeding things up and dispensing with the monologues which are mainly voice overs of scenes with static players. Davis is great as Margo Channing and Anne Baxter is a sly as a snake in her scenes. The wonderful Thelma Ritter has some great lines but disappears halfway through the movie without explanation. If you love the theatre you will love this movie but it's certainly not for everyone because it's very talky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ALL ABOUT EVE is one of the best films of the twentieth century. It is a wonderful, believable story with great acting. The film has several major roles and each one was perfectly cast. When Bette Davis--who plays a bitchy character quite naturally--can evoke sympathy for her character, she is in top form. The opposite is true of Anne Baxter, who can play the sweet, charming and innocent woman with ease, but as EVE HARRINGTON, she makes you hate her. George Sanders, always the consummate actor, gave the best performance of his career. I cannot think of a film that I would rate higher than ALL ABOUT EVE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt about this being a great movie that gets better with age. Conniving, gossip spreading, backstabbing and blackmailing are just a few of the things it takes to make good on the stage. That is at least what young aspiring actress Eve Harrington(Anne Baxter)stoops to, to get her taste of fame.Miss Harrington is taken under the wing of the stage's grand dame Margo Channing(Bette Davis)and becomes her understudy. She convinces a critic (George Sanders)that her undeveloped talents are still better than that of the aging Channing; and she deserves to take the lead in an upcoming play being developed with Channing in mind for the lead role.Incredible script from director/writer Joseph Mankiewicz. This may be Miss Davis' best role. Baxter is charming and devilish. Sanders is stuffy and always on his 'high horse'. Something he has always done well. Celeste Holmes and Gary Merrill get caught up in the scheming and dirty dealings, but on the other hand just want to keep the peace. Marilyn Monroe saunters in and almost steals the show with her small but memorable role. Also in the cast is Hugh Marlowe and the veteran actress Thelma Ritter.This film ages like a fine wine and brings you the equivalent pleasure. Bravo and on with the show, again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After all these years: Worse than Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps because I was never a big Bette Davis fan, I failed to see this much-acclaimed movie when it came out and didn't bother in the intervening years. Our daughter wanted to see it, however, and so 60 years after it first hit the screen, three of us watched it. I really didn't know what to expect. It had won so many awards, and, even though she wasn't a favorite of mine, Bette Davis did have a considerable reputation in her day, and this was often cited as her best role. To my surprise, when the film ended, I learned that all three of us thought it was terrible. George Sanders in his patented role as an arrogant stinker and the young Marilyn Monroe who appears on his arm in a party scene were the only two characters we found interesting -- and MM is only interesting, of course, because of her later stardom. Ms. Davis chews the scenery as was her wont in her role as an "aging" (40) actress still playing roles meant for actresses in their 20s. Nearly every other actor in the film indistinguishes himself or herself. I hope not to remember this movie for very long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Sunset Blvd," made the same year as this, silent film star Norma Desmond says, "We didn't need dialog. We had faces!" Well, this film is all dialog. While much of the dialog is great and often witty, it's just too much of a good thing. It's like a filmed stage play, with scene after scene after scene nothing but talk. While the dialog is great, the plot is weak. How easily Eve joins Margo's inner circle of friends is far-fetched and the final episode featuring Eve's new fan is rather contrived and silly. However, the acting is fabulous, particularly Davis, Sanders, and Ritter. A worthy film but at least the picture and director Oscars should have gone to "Sunset Blvd."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the best performance (among so many) ever given by Betty Davis as Margo Channing, an actress who fears she is aging and nearing the end of her tenure as a theatre icon, in a film that is also filled with wonderful performances by Anne Bancroft as the scheming Eve Harrington who worms her way into Margo's good graces and then tries to take over Margo's life, both professionally and personally, the latter by trying to seduce Margo's fiancé, played nicely by Gary Merrill. Additional fine performances are given by Celeste Holm, as Margo's best friend and the wife of the director (Hugh Marlowe) who directs just about all of Margo's plays, and George Sanders who plays Addison DeWitt an acerbic theatre critic who's onto Eve's machinations but supports her nonetheless. A small part, her first, was performed by Marilyn Monroe as Miss Caswell, a young actress trying to break into show business with the help of Addison DeWitt. The film has everything: great acting, humor, a wonderful story line and certain lines that have become quoted over and over again, like "Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night." All About Eve was given more nominations that any film in the history of motion pictures (13), until Titanic, which I believe garnered 14. It's a powerful film with fabulous dialog and acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the above comment. It's redundant to repeat the prior praises; however the fact that Bette Davis did't win the Oscar for best actress is because Anne Baxter refused to be entered in the Oscar race as "best supporting actress." As she was quoted, the movie is not called. "All About Margo." Had she done so, they both would have captured Oscars. George Sanders certainly deserved his Oscar as the "I love to hate you" theater critic who enabled Eve to rise to stardom. All the other players in the cast were great too. Even Marilyn Monroe is good in her small role as a sexy, air-headed actress wannabe. It is an excellent script that holds one's attention throughout. There is a little something in it for everyone. It is my understanding that that the restoration "pros" stated that had they had to chose only one film to save, it would have been "All About Eve."</fullReview>

It includes actors of the old school (that means proffessionally trained to act) that have actual dialogue--it is funny, it is romantic, it is sad, but it is not a twitty romantic comedy of today. It seems as though every facet of this movie had been carefully structured. The character of Margot Channing (which of the people who knew Bette Davis said it seemed as though the character had been molded especially for her) is an interesting veteran of the theatre who is frightened by marriage from Bill who is only five years younger than her, simply because she is afraid some young thing will catch his eye. The movie is about jealousy, truth and all of the crazy things that go on in Hollywood. This is a must see for anyone who wants to walk away from a film feeling smarter, like they can actually take something with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film in a class by itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Backstage backstabbing is the theme for this juicy Academy Award winning drama. Bette Davis is simply stunning as Margo Channing, an aging theater star who is drmatically upstage by her biggest fan, a ruthless younger actress named Eve Harrington, played by Anne Baxter. When Margo invites her protege into her dearest circle of friends, Eve manages to steal from her idol the success she once envied.All About Eve is probably my favorite "american classic film" for a great many reasons. For starters there's that impeccable ensemble of actors headed by the late, great Miss Bette Davis who turns in probably what is next to "Baby Jane" her most well-known and detailed role as theater diva Margo Channing. Lest we forget her co-stars, including Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington, George Sanders as Addison DeWitt, Celeste Holm as Karen Richards, Gary Merrill as Bill Sampson, Hugh Marlowe as Lloyd Richards, Thelma Ritter as Birdie, a very young Marilyn Monroe as Miss Caswell and last but not least, Barbara Bates as Phoebe. All of them listed above give what is in my opinion some of the most scintillating performances ever captured upon celluloid. Secondly, there's the matter of that script, probably one of the best if not THE best script to ever come out of Hollywood. The dialog within it is scintillating, and the quick verbal repartee is priceless in so many instances too numerous to mention here.This film was honored with a record 14 Academy Award nominations and it won six: Best Picture, Director, Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders), Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design and Best Sound Recording. Amazingly enough Bette Davis and Anne Baxter who were nominated both for Best Actress were beaten by newcomer Judy Holliday's dynamic star turn in George Cukor's Born Yesterday. Frankly, if you ask me I think Bette Davis should have won it that year. Her performance as Margo Channing was simply amazing.For its day, All About Eve was a very long film, clocking in at just over two hours. It's a very "talky" picture, especially when it gets into the "cocktail party" scene (the film's piece de resistance). However, it is the breadth and depth of the story that writer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz is telling that requires our full and rapt attention. And we do give it. For as many times as I've seen this film (probably around fifty or so by now) it still is looked on as THE perfect film by so many people, myself included. No matter how hard anyone tries, no one will ever be able to either replicate or duplicate it.Believe me, this film ain't called "the bitchiest film ever" for nothin!My rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers.This film was the basis for Fassbinder's superb The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant, it also must have had an effect on David Lynch?s Mullholland Drive. We are presented with scheming women situated in a world that thrives on deception and illusion. Likewise all the relationships between the characters are illusory. What seems to be love or devotion is in fact hidden cruelty, and desperation. Everyone is exploiting everyone else. Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) forges an unlikely relationship with Margo Channing (Bette Davis). Eve has enormous ambitions in the cutthroat, and deceptive world of the theater, and hopes to study her idol with the eventual result of taking the place that she held in the theater world. Margo is smart enough that she probably knows this from the start, but she is aging, and her theater career, is consequently on the verge of decaying, and as a result she allows the flattery and sycophantic behavior of Eve as a way to ease the pain that is destroying her ego, and relive some of the adulation that existed in her earlier years. The other players include Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe), as America's most commercially successful playwright and Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill) as a brilliant director. It's Bill that delivers a sparkling monologue defending the position that the theater exists in many incarnations, thus explicitly linking the movie's portrayal of the Broadway way of life, to the way of life of Hollywood. Finally, there's George Sanders as Addison DeWitt, a theater critic, and power-hungry social climber, who's the only character who is not a self-deceiving hypocrite and hence the only character who understands Eve. The name of the main character alone is enough to communicate to us that this is not just a film about theater, however, but also about women, the compromises they have to make and the poses they have to strike to get by in the world. Both Eve and Margo are aware of how low and cruel they are, but justify themselves by the very fact that the world is equally cruel and unfair to them. Except for DeWitt, all of the men in the film exhibit a selective blindness to the real nature of Margo and her student Eve, not out of kindness though. The movie is about the way women, to succeed, must provide men with illusions, and how the men look the other way when any sign is made manifest that those illusions might be false. This kind of game playing is almost universal between the sexes, and it's of vital importance to the film's world view that it's the effeminate DeWitt who sees through this heterosexual game playing, and exploits it as an outsider. In a magnificent stroke of irony, this film also features an early performance by Marilyn Monroe, the high queen of illusion of the American cinema, as an ambitious and none too bright young starlet. The movie is revolutionary because it marks a rare time that Hollywood decided to be honest about what it was doing, to it's stars and audiences alike. All About Eve also has a script by Joseph Mankiewicz that features some of the most razor sharp and cynical dialogue ever to crackle from the screen. If you haven't seen it, then see it, by all means.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Margo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Margo Channing is clearly the most interesting character here. The title character, superbly played by Anne Baxter, is not even second. But then, this a film with so many interesting characters, all of them superbly played. The bulk of the film, however, is far more concerned with what effect the threat of Eve has on Margo, than with Eve herself. It wouldn't have been nearly as good a film as it is had it been done any other way. First of all, it's necessary for Eve to be a bit of a mysterious character. Margo, on the other hand, is the "victim" we're all meant to relate to. What a switch! The audience relates to a mega-star actor and not to a young, "innocent", wide-eyed fan. How'd they ever pull that off?Well, when "they" is Joseph L. Mankiewicz, there's plenty "they" can pull off. Modern audiences beware: this is one of those very old-fashioned movies that has a great story, three dimensional characters, relaxed pace, and crackling dialogue. It's also in black and white. If, however, you are not put off by those things (many young people are, I don't know why) then you should treat yourself to this film. It's on the AFI's Top 100 list, it's got a great user rating here, and it's very well regarded, but I still think it's under-rated. That's how good this is. It's right up there with Lawrence of Arabia, Grand Illusion, Rear Window, The Godfather, 2001, and Citizen Kane, as one of the absolute greatest films ever made. The last time I watched this... hmm, let's see, it was the day before yesterday..., I really enjoyed trying to spot the edges of Eve. Where do the lies stop? How much of the events of the film did she intend from the beginning? Is she a meticulous schemer, or simply an opportunistic improvisor? There's evidence to support both conclusions. Not that it really matters, of course. Because it's not about Eve, as I said, it's about Margo. It's also fun to listen for the numerous references to the title, which are littered all over the film. But these are little touches which it's fun to watch out for on a second or third viewing. If you're discovering this film for the first time, just sit back and enjoy the wonderful dialogue, full of witty banter and fierce barbs. Not to mention insight. Just glory in the incredible performances. Breathe a sigh of relief at the uncommonly adult relationship between Margo and Bill (it's so rare, even in good films, to find Hollywood offering a truly convincing depiction of a romance between adults... the fact that the romance is not the center of this film, I think, helps enormously). Anyway, see this one. It's great.</fullReview>

"All About Eve" is the best backstage drama I've ever seen. It's biting, funny, sharp, and satirical all at the same time. It's hard for me to just call it a drama; it's like calling "American Beauty" a drama -- there's more to it than that. For anyone who's ever been involved in theatre, this is a must-see movie. The way Margo dismantles people verbally is one of the many highlights. And don't forget the cameo by a struggling young actress named Monroe, along with the rest of that party scene during that bumpy night. Backstabbing, betrayal, double-crosses...the best movie of its kind before "Dangerous Liaisons" showed up. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..all about "the star"..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..and there IS another movie called "The Star", which stars THE STAR, Bette Davis. Almost every "user" says that "Eve" is the real-life story of La Davis. Close - "The Star" is much closer, because it takes the story of an aging actress - who even sells her Oscar for booze and pocket-change, and -again - is saved by a man. "The Star" shows how desperate losers audition for roles far beneath them, just to be in the public eye, yet wanting that public to see them as they were - not as they would've-gotten-the-role, present time. I can't even place just when it was released or where it falls in the 100 films Davis made, nor if it is in black-and-white. It is far more convincingly directed to tell the story of "has-beens". Younger people most likely have never heard of it......even I have not heard anything about it in a long time, but everyone needs to look for it, as a comparison to the brilliance of "All About Eve". Whatever studio produced it should look through their vaults and re-release this film. It's every bit as "theatrical" as "All About Eve".Many "users" have written brilliantly about this movie. "Jkingel" is one of the few who mentions "Applause" was adapted from it, although how it could successfully become a musical about such a stellar cast of personalities is beyond me. Even Lauren Bacall, who played the Broadway-lead in "Applause" admits that when La Davis attended one of her performances, it was not known she was in the theater, and La Davis was not amused. Maybe it could have been turned into one of our "modern" operas, but a musical??? The brilliance of Mankiewicz's script was, no doubt, the loser.Because Davis wasn't the original lead in "All About Eve", she came to the set with a lot of baggage. Can't you feel the dread all of the other performers must have felt upon hearing "the set-eater" is coming in? HER ?? Thelma Ritter and George Saunders were the only two really seasoned actors/actresses in the already-hired cast. Celeste Holm was established, but not the caliber of actress Davis was - is there any wonder La Davis was bitchy on-set, knowing EVERYONE knew everything there was to know about her, all hoping she would fall on her face? I took it for granted that Holm was pretty-much like the role she played. Correct me if I'm wrong, but she was always a "supporter" - that she won the award for "All About Eve" proves that. Anne Baxter was just beginning a career that includes several good roles. How could anyone one of them hope to NOT disappear when La Davis came on ? Yeah, what DID happen to "Birdie".....? Just like "The Little Foxes", "All About Eve" is a perfect example that movies used to be about acting, rather than "action".....both starring Bette Davis. One of the more recent films that was dialog-driven is "Sophie"s Choice", with another astounding actress, Meryl Streep. Unlike Davis, will she EVER have a role like that again ?I agree films like "All About Eve" is one that any-and-all movie-players and directors should study. It can also teach modern-day people a lot of what life is about, no matter which profession they are in - be on the look-out for the younger folk coming in. They are career-driven and greedy...... Anne Baxter lost an Oscar because she refused to be cast as "supporting", but Holm may have beaten her out. In all of the script-writing schools, there has to be a writer who can produce dialog as sharp as this movie contains. If not, then we are in for a lot of dull movies without good performances. I agree with one other "user" - "All About Eve" should be rated much higher than 10, and definitely higher than 45 on IMDb's list of best movies. Give me these old gems every time - I want to learn something about human nature. If I want colorful explosions, I'll watch a film about war. "All About Eve" is superb in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hollywood classic that has held up well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most popular and lasting movies of all time among movie fans All About Eve is a story about the New York theater life and it's backstabbing, manipulating Broadway acting community. Based on a magazine story by Mary Orr and written for the screen by Joseph L Mankiewicz as a satirical look at infighting among self-centered stage actors as strive to achieve and hang on to stardom. Mankiewicz was an important figure in the Hollywood studio system staring as a screenwriter in the 1920's and become a successful producer of major films beginning in the 1930's and branching out into directing films in the the 1940's he worked for Paramount, MGM and Fox and succeeded in everything thing he did weather it was producing, directing or writing. Often working with large ensemble casts he assembled a great one here with Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Thelma Ritter, Gary Merrill, Marilyn Monroe, Barbara Bates and Hugh Marlow among the cast. This was nominated for 14 Academy Awards including an amazing five cast members in Davis, Baxter, Holm, Ritter and Sanders. Sanders won Best supporting Actor in his first and only nomination and win. Baxter and Davis were nominated for Best Actress and Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter were nominated for Best Supporting Actress but in both categories they split the vote and canceled each other out and came away with no Oscars. It won the big prize as Best Picture and also Best Director and Best Screenplay for Mankiewicz in addition to Costume Design for Edith Head and Best Sound. It was All About Eve vs. Sunset Boulevard at the Academy Awards for 1950 with 25 nominations between the two films and Eve winning six to Sunset's three. This is a fine film and holds up well but it's a little too melodramatic and too much of a soap opera for me in it's bombardment of dialog. I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Listen, anyone who knows anything about film, knows the greatness of All About Eve. The direction and script and acting are top 5 all time, no doubt! The testament of this is the number of Oscar-caliber performances that drenches this film. Davis, Baxter, and Sanders have always gotten their due accolades. All three gave all-time great performances.. But look closer... If Celeste Holm walked away with a best supporting actress Oscar would anyone bat an eyelash. Thelma Ritter steals every scene she's in! that's saying something in this movie. Marilyn Monroe lit the screen like a firecracker. And let us not forget Gary Merril's performance in this movie. If George Sanders wasn't a lock, Merril would've been deserving of Oscar consideration...How many films can you think of that was overflowing with performances like this. When that occurs every scene in the film is a battle of the titans. This is one of the very best the cinematic world has ever offered...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have probably seen this film 30 times - It still remains fresh, witty, exciting with the finest dialogue ever written for film. I take pride in watching it with people who have never seen it before and envy them for their first experience of it. Davies is at her peak giving one of the performances of her life, it was also positively MADE for Saunders (who I totally fell in love with in this film) Celeste Holm was perfect as was Thelma Ritter and so the praise goes on. I adored Judy Holliday in Born Yesterday (who won the Oscar for best actress that year competing with Davies) and I only wish that the 2 films had been released in different years - Bette so deserved it for this. I know I am joined by many as rating it as my favorite film of all time - They just don't make them like this any more.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All About Eve is a superb movie in all areas of film production. First and foremost a top notch story has been crafted with excellent dialogue. Director Joseph M. (I know I'll misspell his last name!) gets the most out of his all star cast. Bette Davis is the star (both in real life and as Margo in the movie) and she delivers as usual in her role as the aging stage star who feels threatened by an up and comer. But I thought Anne Baxter was the premier performer in this movie. She is simply outstanding as the ambitious and duplicitous aspiring actress Eve Harrington who ingratiates herself to Margo. It's hard to believe she didn't make a bigger name for herself along the lines of Davis. The three male leads are up to par with the ladies as well. A minor quibble is that Marilyn Monroe's character didn't have a larger role. She is simply gorgeous in this movie. It must have been because she hadn't yet become the star she would be in later years. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All About Eve is dated in its appearance but it couldn't be more modern in its treatment of human nature. People haven't changed. A classic? Yes but not in the top 100 films of all time. The acting was good but I wasn't overpowered by any scene. I didn't sense romantic chemistry between the various couples, for example, and didn't buy it when the characters managed to forgive each other after each outburst. I found that the narration was unnecessary. Everything that happens on stage is hidden from the viewer... we hardly get a feeling that we're in the theater business, so rarely do we see theatergoers. And on a totally wild note, does anyone besides me think that Anne Baxter looks like Kathleen Turner?Despite these minor flaws, the pacing was good, the story captivating, and there's a great ending.Who should see this film:-- Anyone curious about classics but worried about being bored, this one's safe. Note, however, that it's in black and white.-- Theater vixens fighting their way to the top. And see "Working Girl" and "Heartbreakers" too.I believe that old films should be rated for how they play today, not originally. But All About Eve still packs a punch. I'll give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

But I was never really into her type of classic movies, so I hesitated a little, but I finally just forced myself down to watch it. I owe my mom a huge apology because this is one of the best movies I have ever seen! It has such a great plot that is terrifying to think about but you can't help but keep your eyes peeled on the screen as Eve just rips away Margo's life. The ending, I loved the karma, you'll know when you see it. The acting, man, ladies and gentlemen, this is what acting dreams are made off. Without a doubt Bette Davis steals the show, I loved watching her just slowly falling apart. Anne Baxter played such a great b-you know what. Did you just want her character to get her own medicine or what?All About Eve is a terrific classic that I will forever cherish.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Specimen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films have matured as gracefully as 'All About Eve', a poignant, caustic commentary on the ludicrous world of show biz, with a message that is as meaningful today as in the year it was released. Bette Davis stars in a true-to-life role as Margo Channing, an aging Broadway celebrity who is charmed by passionately devoted fan Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). Eve's dedication to Channing and to her show biz circle (George Sanders, Celeste Holm and Gary Merrill among others) gains their trust and affection, and abets her sinister ulterior scheme, which is, in fact, 'all about Eve'.This memorable production boasts an elegant screenplay and good direction, as well as impressive performances by the central characters (Celeste Holm's lacking delivery being the sole exception), all wrapped up in incessantly intriguing storytelling. The textbook character development that adorns the script is fascinating and in itself constitutes a motive for all vintage cinema fans to indulge in this fine specimen.Overly conventional cinematography and an unnoticeable score keep 'All About Eve' from achieving cinematic supremacy, yet they have proven too marginal to seriously threaten the film's undisputed historical legacy. Worthy of its fame, six stars out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fasten your seatbelts: This is a trashy film. Here is what I wrote in my 1990 diary: "An over-acted, over-written, overrated soap opera. Too much repartee, too much phony sophistication. Critics hailed it as one the greatest."I don't like to clutter my reviews with movies I detest, but this is one of the worst ever made, because it takes the viewer's indulgence for granted. It takes it for granted that the viewer will want to be subjected to hours of flat-footed, uninspired misogyny, humorless misanthropy, indulgent self-loathing and contempt for "ethnic" people of lower classes, as well as thespians and their fans. This movie isn't even original, it's a remake of "A Star Is Born" smothered in vile sentiment. A more fitting title would be "A Steer Is Born". This is an emotionally cruel movie, and its writer emerges as the main villain, peddling insult as insight. Where is his love of humanity? Where is his compassion? Indeed, where is his sense of beauty? He doesn't even TRY to create something beautiful, which makes his failure all the more repellent. He seems to think there are only two kinds of people: the stupid and the vile. He cranks up his cynicism to such a degree, that nothing whatsoever could pass inspection. It starts out as a condemnation of an upstart and ends up as condemnation of literally everything and everybody. There is no cinema in this one. </fullReview>

The plot is plain and boring, the acting is quite stale, the script is slow, it's long, uninteresting and has most definitely not stood the test of time. I love films from the 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's but this has got to be one of the most hyped films in the history of motion pictures. Naturally it does not deserve a place in the IMDb top 250, but since that list in itself as quite heavy on the Hollywood side, that doesn't surprise me in the least bit.

		<fullReview>What more can be said about this greatly cherished account of backstage life in the world of theatre? A brilliantly acted film with a superlative screenplay, ingeniously cast with fine direction &amp; a memorable music score, this movie really couldn't miss - and it didn't. It is very doubtful that there will ever be another film which will equal (or even rival) this incisively cynical &amp; sophisticated comedy/drama masterpiece from 195O. Bette Davis - as a replacement for the assigned Claudette Colbert who hurt her back - gives what many believe to be her finest, flashiest performance as Margo Channing, the insecure 4O year-old diva of the theatre. Davis plays her role with such assured relish that it's practically unthinkable that another actress could be more effective in the part. During the production, Davis strained her vocal chords, which gave Margo that distinctive husky voice a'la Tallulah Bankhead: it was an ironically lucky stroke of timing! So much has been written about this film, so I will try to shed some rarer light on it. It was noted that Claudette Colbert deeply resented Davis due to the fact that felt helplessly "robbed" of this prime dream role: she alternately envied and despised Davis for taking Margo away from her and playing her with such brilliance. George Sanders was perfection personified as poison pen critic Addison DeWitt: he won the Best Supporting Actor AA. Months later, at a cocktail party, Sanders recalled that Davis spat at him after he remarked "What's wrong, Bette? Sour grapes"?. Davis intimidated Marilyn Monroe, bluntly stating that her "baby talk" voice was atrociously ridiculous. When Celeste Holm would appear on the set and spread a cheery "Good morning", Davis would disgustedly respond "Oh, these TER-RI-BLE good mannahs!" Holm was cool to "the Queen Bee of Warners" as she referred to Davis ever after. Most fans know that Davis coveted the New York Film Critics Award for her playing of Margo and that she and Gary Merrill fell into a rather lusty love affair during production. As Margo's loyal companion, Birdie Coonan, Thelma Ritter is tops &amp; Celeste Holm is perfect as the kindly humble Karen: she and Margo have a most interesting contrast in personalities, which is best showcased in the classic scene in the car while Lloyd is out fetching some emergency gasoline. For years, the film held the record for being nominated for the most Academy Awards: 14. If you want to see this gem in all its glory, invest in the DVD version: it's crisp, sharp &amp; clear. My favourite goof? Look at the clock on Margo's bedside table: time stands still!</fullReview>

The theater crowd surrounding Margo Channing accepted Eve Harrington without any questions or reluctance immediately and without reservation.4. The playwright and his wife seemed to have a real solid marriage. It was improbable that he would leave his wife for Eve.5. Gary Merrill, whom I like as an actor, was about as over-the-top in his acting style as one can get in the opening scenes. He was gesturing as if he were Peter Finch's character in "Network."6. The ending was not believable when the young actress was about to repeat the cycle using Eve this time.The ugly * All of the smoking on screen gave me a psychosomatic asthma attack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the lists of the bests include All About Eve and it seems that all the people who are interested in black and white classics love the film. And it is in the IMDb Top 250 too. I believe that this movie is seen as a masterpiece because of the messages it has about the world of theater, the world of the players (like Sunset Boulevard, but I will explain why I love that movie and hate this movie) All About Eve, yes, criticizes fame, there is sarcasm. However, as an audience who is interested in cinematic elements (is it strange?), All About Eve cannot be masterpiece. The way of story telling was not impressive at all and this causes the movie to be uninteresting most of the time. In other words, can I say that it was not dramatically powerful? There is not any sound scene except the final and the scene which Marilyn Monroe appears was very nice. She added color into the film, she breaths life into the film. And as said, the alarming final was stunning. I love Sunset Boulevard, because cinematically (includes everything) it was great and impressive. And why I have compared All About Eve with Sunset Boulevard? because, they are alike in terms of the thematic element, probably, many people would agree with me at this point. Sunset criticizes the world of cinema industry, Eve criticizes theater industry. I know that All About Eve was not a blockbuster which you eat pop corn and drink cola and have a good time, but entertainment are important too and art is much more important though and I can't say that All About Eve is artistic. After I had watched All About Eve, I watched a Billy Wilder film and a Orson Welles film. It did good a lot.</fullReview>

This only shows the Oscars, were not fair even on the '50s. The movie is marvel in monotony. Betty Davis's acting was overrated by herself and few cronies who put her on a pedestal, since there was not many contenders in the acting field during that era. She was one arrogant and conceited actress off and on screen. The only thing in the movie worth was Anne Baxter. The script has been praised beyond comprehension. Next time I will see the Hate! Section before I watch any movie, since if you go by the best section, you will invariably end up with a bummer of a movie like this. As far as Script-Billy Wilder and Charles Brach were better contemporary script-writers than Joseph Mankewich. The essence of the movie is, nubile post menopausal women in long trench coats walk to and from the theater and doing so, attract few useful idiots. Then the movie is hyped by the critics who in their warped sense of cinema, pronounce the movie in the Top Ten column. Warren Beatty's "Bugsy" should be in the Top Ten movies of all times (along with "Good Fellas") but it is not even in the Top 100..just an example of the Hollywood Morons(Capitol M!) making suckers out of the public..the correct word is Unjust Enrichment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't seem fair that when a movie is a classic, people are put down when they don't like it. There are exceptions to the rule like "Citizen Kane" or "Star Wars" or "Breathless", among many others. There are some films that are important, maybe not amazingly good, but still important for what they did for the industry or in the advancement of film. But when a film is a classic because it is apparently just good, one should be able to dislike it. "All About Eve" is just plain boring. It was on AFI's 100 Greatest Films and won multiple Academy Awards, including best picture, but it is one of the hardest movies to sit through. It is supposed to be a satire on the theater world and ultimately acting in general, but it isn't funny. It is slowly paced, which isn't necessarily bad, because "A Man Escaped" is very slowly paced, but it works for the tone. But in a comedy-drama, the pace should be an in-between. Comedies are usually fast paced and dramas are usually slower, but "All About Eve" can't really find it's zone. Which again can be brilliant, as in "Pulp Fiction". Two entirely different films, yes, but similar in that they don't have a distinct genre. Regardless, "Eve" will be forever etched in film history as a wonderful movie and it doesn't matter what anybody really thinks now. But it still seems unfair that there are some movies that people HAVE to like, just because they are staples, and if they don't, there is something wrong with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Dud Wins the Best Picture Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking a second look at a picture I found to be a dreadful bore in 1950 when I was 12 years old is even more boring after 56 years of life experience. Why waste over 2 hours on a movie about a bunch of stuffed shirt snobs and their irritating pretenses? There are better things to do with your time, such as watching virtually any other movie made by Darryl F. Zanuck during the great golden age of 20th Century-Fox.Anne Baxter is the main character, and she was a joy to watch in dozens of superior Fox movies such as "Swamp Water" or "Yellow Sky" -- to name just two. These were entertaining pictures which could be watched over and over, still enjoyed. In Eve she plays an overambitious cutthroat aspiring actress, who is oh so dull to watch.The entire boring mess is about Broadway, its stars and creative talent. Taking a cue from Walt Disney's Thumper, who said, "If you can't say something nice, don't say nuthin' at all." Here it goes: There's not one homosexual in All About Eve. If you see a Broadway play in 2006, just try finding a play or musical WITHOUT a homosexual theme. Of 20 current ones, not so many as 5 are non-homosexual. And this year's Tony went to a play that advocates homosexual teachers preying on their minor students. Oh, they don't tell you about that until after you buy the ticket.Off subject, sorry. "All About Eve" was hands-down the worst picture to win an Oscar during the 1950's when some really great films were made. Avoid this dud at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OVER RATED CRAP</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so tired of hearing about how good this film is. It was not good when it came out. Bette looks every mile of her age in this one. My goodness the only thing good about this silly movie is her Safety Belt line. The rest of the film is crap. The story is silly. The award that Eve wins is just too much right from the start. And the car scene, give me a break. Turning on the heater of a 1950 car without it running after it ran out of gas. As well, turning on the heater and leaving the head lights on. When the guy came back with the gas, the blasted car would have had a dead battery.Couldn't Bette found a better pair of gloves for in the car. Her hands in those gloves look like a cartoon. And of course Her things hang way to low.Her things seem to sit on her waist. I have always found that odd about her. I went to this film when it first came out, and it was a bore then too. George is a bore in this. But then he was always that. Fasten your seat belts you are in for a bore of a film waiting for the greatness, it never comes.</fullReview>
