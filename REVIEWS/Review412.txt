		<shortDescription>A unique, stunning, exhilarating and beautiful experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Constructed, believe it or not, as a heist film, composed of interviews, actual filmed footage from the seventies, re-enactments (done incredibly tastefully and intelligently) and a large number of photographs, "Man on Wire" from director James Marsh is a brilliant, audacious, stunning, and utterly enthralling film, and having seen it not more than an hour ago I can already say with confidence that it is one of the best documentaries ever made, not because it achieves the sort of brilliantly real observations on human behavior and emotions that a Maysles Bros. film does, but because it is a surprisingly hilarious, unbelievably well-crafted movie about so many absurdities, so much ridiculousness, such insane, insane acts (and yet so beautiful as well), and one which looks in on some of the most interesting people I think I've ever come across. I normally don't take to non-'cinema-verite' documentaries, but this is just about the biggest exception possible, as I will say with confidence that this is an a terrific film.Philippe Petit, the wire-walker who walked between the World Trade Center towers in 1974, is one of the most absurd and audacious people I've ever seen in real life or recorded on film. His spirit fills every frame of the film, and his commitment to this dangerous, illegal, and almost unbelievably courageous act is astounding to witness. The film thankfully affords us the chance to get to know Philippe, and it would have been so easy for Marsh to focus only on the incredibly entertaining planning process for the audacious climactic act, but he doesn't, as through the interviews we get to know Philippe, Annie, and Jean-Louis quite well, and the interviews don't feel as put-on as they do in many other films.I said that "Man on Wire" was one of the best documentaries ever made. I'm going to disagree with myself. As a documentary there have been many which are more effective. As a film, however, the skill that went into "Man on Wire" is absolutely outstanding. The editing, the quality of the re-enactments, the wealth of footage and still photographs, the excellent interviews, the film's wildly funny sense of humor (the audience at my screening laughed louder than a sold-out screening for most comedies), and the absolutely inspired idea to construct the film as a heist film make this one of the most memorable, exhilarating, and enthralling films I've ever come across. The idea to make it a heist film makes complete sense as well, as the careful planning that went into their entrance into the WTC towers and reaching the roof, and all the steps that led to it, definitely have the air of a typical heist film, complete with surveillance, inside men, disguises, false ID's, and all sort of wacky ruses. It's terrifically entertaining."Man on Wire" doesn't ignore 9/11, but it thankfully doesn't become a film which isn't about what its actual subject. There are fleeting moments (including the shot, which unfortunately is in the trailer, of Phillipe on the wire between the two towers and an airplane in the top left corner of the screen) which are immensely powerful and resonant, even chilling, but the film switches back to its effortlessly entertaining original format seconds laterThose with a fear of heights might find themselves hyperventilating at certain points in the film, as even I, someone who has never had an issue with looking down the side of a cliff, felt vertigo coming on at the still, looking down off the edge of the tower, of Phillipe sticking his foot out just before he began the walk across. I guess those are the only people I wouldn't highly, highly recommend this film to. It's a terrific, massively entertaining film, and even I, the grouchy fan of pretty much only ultra-realistic documentaries, have to admit that it is an immense artistic achievement. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect heist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at the Waterfront Film Festival in Saugatuck, Michigan.Man on Wire is an exciting documentary about Philippe Petit who, thanks to his friends, managed to sneak into the World Trade Center in 1974 and do a high-wire act between the Twin Towers.From the very start of the film it pulls you in, this is an amazing story and Petit is an amazing person to document. Sure, he's a reckless person and has a wild personality, but he's fascinating to watch. The interviews with him and his friends and "team" who helped pull off the stunt are extremely interesting and great to watch. It's fun watching old footage of Petit performing some of his previous acts, this guy really has talent, and may be a bit too determined and crazy. The reenactments are also well filmed and a nice job of telling the story.This documentary plays like a classic heist film. It's filled with suspense and has many of those caper moments of mistakes that may ruin the entire job. Even though the final outcome is already known, it's still thrilling and you don't know if they will pull it off.A well crafted film that does a wonderful job of telling the story of one man's dream and how he managed to make it a reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What does Philippe Petit do now? Is he Professor of Advanced Balance at the Sorbonne? Is ha a therapist dealing exclusively in acrophobia? He seems to be a man so specialized that he was meant in life to do only one thing, at one time, and this film is about that moment and shows why a moment--a half hour, actually, in the early morning of August 7, 1974--can define a life and reshape one's perceptions. After the long slow methodical buildup, when the moment comes, calmly accompanied by a famous piece for solo piano by Eric Satie, it is so awesome, so still, so transcendent it makes you cry. No question why this film needed to be made.Why is it that walking across a wire up in the air can be an aesthetic experience so exalted it brings you to tears? I don't know, but that's what 'Man on Wire' is about.Philippe Petit is a clown, a sprite, a magician, an athlete, and a dancer. When he was seventeen, before the World Trade Center was even built, he knew it had to be his. It was as if it was invented just for him. . This was his greatest exploit. His triumph. It was to make him world famous.A 'funambule,' the French call them. A tightrope walker: the epitome of risk-taking Only this time he increased the risk. Like his earlier walks between towers of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris and pylons of the Sydney Harbor Bridge, only more so, Petit's walk on a wire between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, the tallest buildings in New York City, was illegal, a 'rififi,' a break-in, a caper. Some call it "the art heist of the century." But it's not an ordinary heist. They stole nothing, except the air, our breath. Petit and crew didn't take anything out. They took in a ton of equipment, most importantly enough heavy wire and support wire to secure his pathway across the towers.If you could make a documentary about a successful robbery, it might be something like James Marsh's film about this event. There is the conception, the reconnaissance, the gathering of accomplices, some of whom out of wisdom or fear opt out, even up to the last minute. The false start and bailout. The months of rehearsal. The miniature mock-ups of the top of the towers (handsome, and in wood). The trial runs and on-scene observations, the skillfully made false documents and identities, the changes of costume (for Petit himself, businessman, construction worker, and the ballet shoes and black velvet costume of the tightrope walker And of course Petit and company were documenting all of this. Marsh has admirably gathered all the images, plus simulations, plus the present-day talking heads, several in French, the others in English. This time simulations seem quite justifiable. There are things we need to see--particularly the crew dodging and hiding from guards on the towers.It's all like a game; a lark. And at the same time, lethal, dangerous, and a defiance of the laws of man and God. The simulations are appropriate because this is all so unreal anyway. Why not add a little fakery?Philippe Petit is more than a little bit strange. And in some indefinable way he is also quintessentially French.. Not only has he an incredible insensitivity to danger (and drive to overcome it), but this diminutive, almost weightless fellow has his unmistakably Napoleonic side, his grandiosity. But also playfulness. One of the best moments is when he is being arrested and photographed (charge: trespassing; event description: "man on wire"), he takes a policeman's uniform cap and balances it on his forehead by the bill, then flips it onto his head. His exploit had made him a celebrity and a mascot. He enhanced life, made a partly clunky new landmark beautiful and remarkable.After the event, he knew he was famous. How can you ask me if I'm thirsty, he says to a psychiatrist, when 300 journalists are waiting to interview me? And his first act after release was, as somebody put it "to bang a groupie," which he himself describes as "disgusting." Maybe he was steadier out on the wire, where he remained for half an hour, high over New York, without a net, crossing and re-crossing eight times by his friend's count. And then afterwards, somehow things were so bent out of shape that he ended two key relationships--with his girlfriend and his collaborator (both of whom help narrate this film).This is troubling, but Petit is also wise, a saintly kind of man, immune to ordinary temptations (except groupies?). When asked why he'd done it, he said: "If I see three oranges, I have to juggle. And if I see two towers, I have to walk." The psychiatrist judged him "same and ebullient." His was a pure act, an existential declaration of joy, an example of how to live life daily to the fullest. "Every day for him was a work of art," says his girlfriend. "L'art pour l'art," art for art's sake, is his motto. All of which is pretty thought-provoking, and may be inspiring. At a time of many excellent documentaries, this one seems indispensable. It provides a very pure kind of thrill. Needless to say after 9/11, the buildings gone, the recreation of this moment evokes nostalgia and loss.Actually Petit has done much since the event. Right afterward the charges of trespassing and criminal conduct were dropped with the promise that he would perform juggling acts for children in Central Park, and he was given a permanent pass to the towers. A policeman interviewed at the time says when he watched, he knew he was seeing something unlike anything he'd ever see again. Sometimes you do know. When he was interviewed for this film, he was artist in residence at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and Magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily one of the best documentaries I've seen, Man On Wire swept me off my feet not with spectacle but with a certain quiet recognition of the incredible events it chronicles - a team of young, rebellious twentysomethings who rigged a wire across the twin towers that their mascot, Philippe Petit, walked or as one police officer comments, "danced," across for forty- five minutes. The reenactments are superbly done, and director James Marsh keeps the film at a short 90 minutes to keep it from getting boring. Perhaps the most surprising thing was the eloquence and insight of the comments by Petit and company. His ex-girlfriend Annie, for instance, said of meeting Petit for the first time "he courted me... and then my life was all about him. it was as if I had no destiny of my own... I was following his destiny."Viewing the movie as a character study of Mr. Petit offers another layer to film - this man, who seems wholly self-consumed and unaware of a) the potential problems of any such idea he stumbled upon and b) the emotional pressure he was putting on his friends who could have aided his death, speaks frankly even when discussing the aftermath of his stunt - which indirectly ended many of his friendships with people close to him.But despite his own shortcomings, viewers cannot deny Petit as the man who did something that none of us could ever imagine: he pinpointed his dream and he achieved it. "The towers were built for him." Annie comments at the beginning of this powerful and poignant study of triumph and aspiration. And in the end, it is the not the actual nineteen seventies footage depicting a tiny man walking the line between life and death that communicates this theme the most; it is a pencil drawing Petit drew on a wall beforehand - two rectangles and one, sloping line between them. It is this thin curved line, this gossamer thread connecting two shapes that signifies the whole expanse of the human spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Laid Plans of Crazy Frenchmen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...sometimes work as director James Marsh and subject Philippe Petit prove in the sublime and inspiring documentary, "Man on Wire." Here we see Petit and his cohorts recklessly plan and execute the most daring stunt in the history of the world. In August of 1974, Petit walked a tightrope between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in NYC.As part of Hollywood's increased awareness of the possibilities of counter-programming, summertime has become a haven for documentaries. Thanks to Michael Moore and Al Gore, most of the blockbuster documentaries over the past few years have been in the form of political propaganda. By simply wanting to tell the story of one man's amazing act, "Man on Wire" breezes into this summer like a breath of fresh air. The act depicted is singularly focused, but the logistics behind perpetrating the act are fascinatingly complex, and the aftermath of the successful completion of the act is breathtaking.Director Marsh wisely avoids the typical trappings of documentaries by filming the story like a fictional narrative, jumping back and forth in time, shifting points of view, and creating palpable tension leading up to the death defying act of Petit walking across the wire. The film relies heavily on reenactments, and Marsh stages them like mini expressionistic student films full of stunning cinematography and wonderfully antiquated in-camera effects. The careful juxtaposition and blending of archival footage, still photography, reenactments, and interviews is a master-class in the school of film editing. Also adding to the film is the quietly tense music score composed of pieces from Michael Nyman and Erik Satie among others.For those who never saw the Twin Towers of the WTC in person, the film shows beautiful archival footage of their construction. For those still haunted by their fall, the film offers a bit of catharsis as we get to watch them reconstructed piece by piece on film and lifted again on high through Petit's potently mad dream. The film is as much a love letter to New York City as it is a testament to the power of one person's vision. The film allows us to see how Petit did it, but it also gives a glimpse of the greater "why?" For beauty, for the thrill...for the sad knowledge that no one in the history of the world will ever be able to do it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I Die? What a Beautiful Death!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man on Wire (2008) **** There was no why. No rhyme or reason, other than the fact that those towers existed. Existed, as one friend notes, for Philippe Petit to walk between them. People have always found it difficult to comprehend that Petit wire walked between the World Trade Center towers, nearly 1400 feet above the ground, without being able to justify his cause. Petit once simply stated that when he sees oranges, he juggles; when he sees two towers, he walks.The story of how Petit and his motley crew pulled off the stunt is just as interesting as the walk itself. That day in August 1974 and the events which lead up to it are the focus of James Marsh's incredible documentary, Man on Wire. Marsh mixes documentary footage, provided by Petit and his colleagues, with reconstructions, blended so seamlessly every foot of film might as well be authentic. Petit and his friends tell the story with eager enthusiasm, particularly Petit himself. He is a man like no other. He is a ball of energy and charisma, completely harmless to everyone but perhaps himself. He has remained a child at heart.He details the moment when he first concocted the idea to walk between the towers. While sitting in a dentist's chair, waiting to have a tooth fixed, he catches a glimpse of the towers as they are being constructed in a newspaper. He ran out of the dentist's office in a state of grace. He gleefully recounts that he didn't stick around to get his tooth fixed, and suffered the pain for weeks. But pain was no matter, he'd found his dream. He described his intentions not as a wire walker setting out to conquering heights, but as a poet looking to conquer the stage. A friend recounts that each day for Philippe was a work of art.Petit had walked between the towers at Notre Dame, and the harbour bridge in Sydney. He was always arrested afterward of course. How joyful that when he was arrested after completing his feat in Sydney that his first order of business was to pick the watch of the police man arresting him for a gag! His reckless love for what he was doing was not fool hardy though. "The fact that death frames what you are doing makes you take it very seriously," he explains. Death was of course on his mind, but his aims were as a poet, a dreamer, an artist - not a dare devil: "If I die, what a beautiful death!" To accomplish his walk between the towers required months of preparation. The crew practiced in a field in France, with a wire the exact length between the towers. To mimic conditions, he had his friends jump and pull on the wires. He never loses balance, his concentration is impeccable. But the work doesn't end just with practice. They had to get nearly a ton of equipment to the top, all without being discovered - at least as impossible as the walk itself. They had to somehow get the rope across. How they do so is ingenious. They acquired id's to get inside, dressed as a mix of businessmen and construction workers (the towers were still partially under construction. One of the most incredible parts of the story is the night they went up to set everything up and do the walk. They're interrupted by a security guard as they begin unpacking. Philippe and his friend Jean-Francois have to run and hide under a tarp, on a beam above the WTC's 400 meter elevator shaft. They hide there, their bodies tangled, not moving, not speaking, for hours waiting for the guard to leave.Man on Wire is built like a suspense film. It's engrossing and expertly crafted, and told with the passion and thoroughness of oral storytellers of old. Philippe Petit speaks as if he were reciting poetry in his thick French accent. Marsh accentuates the action with pitch perfect choices in the soundtrack, ranging from Satie and other classics to the disco classic A Fifth of Beethoven.When Petit finally makes his walk, his friends gathered to watch below as he either committed suicide or one of the most poetic crimes of the century, the emotion is overwhelming. He recounts it with unbridled joy, his friends with tears in their eyes. I too was nearly moved to tears of joy. I can't remember the last documentary film to strike such a chord.If Petit had of failed, he would have fallen to his death and likely been remembered as "that idiot." Petit recalls thinking with one foot on the wire, that to place his other foot on it and take that step was probably going to be the end of his life. Well, this life. If he fell, he would have fallen "to another life." That was his philosophy. But he didn't fall. He made it, 8 times. One police officer describes him as a dancer - he didn't just walk. He taunted police, laid down, knelt down. He had the time of his life. He was arrested with force as soon as he stepped onto the south tower - the police did not take kindly to his taunts. The charge: trespassing and disturbing the peace. The sentence: perform a show for the kids in the park as penance.There is something so life affirming about one man boldly walking into what should have been his demise. People responded to his act of daring as if he had given charity. In a way, he had. His performance was a gift to the world. What that gift was is as abstract as the reasons for the walk itself. Sometimes we don't know why something is beautiful, we just know it is. What Philippe Petit did was beautiful, a work of poetic grandeur. Why I do not know. Words do not exist to explain. I just know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, this is what cinema is all about, and this film is striking in that it encapsulates so much in a documentary. Man On Wire has more suspense, thrills, wonder, imagination, human spirit and inspiration than any other film I have seen in recent years. The music, composition and photography, structure and editing are all superb. Some of the shots are simply breathtaking. Some scenes in the film are incredibly atmospheric, and they will be forever burned in your mind. The film captures a human sense of achievement, drive and determination better than any other film I know. Heres the ultimate proof of this films power - the audience didn't shift until a good couple of minutes into the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The triumph of will as genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Genius is a transcendent capacity for taking trouble first of all" Frederick the great by Thomas Carlyle "Genius: the mental endowment peculiar to an individual; that disposition or aptitude of mind which qualifies a person for a certain kind of action or special success in a given pursuit." Webster's International Dictionary This is Phillip Petit, the 25 year old who in August of 1974 walked a tightrope between the Twin Towers of the WTC. Yet what is that which makes a documentary on such a fantastic, quixotic accomplishment relevant to us mortals? Is it not the same kind of awe the passers by experienced when they saw that morning a tiny figure suspended above the void, the same kind of marvel the people interviewed experienced again when they described Petit's walking on air some thirty years later? What is Petit's accomplishment if not a profound religious experience, a form of divinity in itself? And it is exactly because Petit's action bears no explanation, it has no rationale behind its daring do, no tangible end by which to hold it and examine it in the light of logic. The action in the same time the reason of it. What did Petit accomplish but a monument of human perseverance, enduring will and the triumph of mind over matter? If MAN ON WIRE is so successful at what it does, it's not only because of the feat it purports to describe but because of the path it takes in describing it. Staging it as a heist thriller, filmed in black and white in shades of noir, orchestrated like a bank robbery of sorts, the same kind of films Petit laboriously studied as he was preparing his takeover. By presenting us with real people who emote better than a lot of actors could even dream of. By placing Phillip Petit pivotal in the narration of the events unfolding, a passionate man with an almost half-mad gleam in his eye but also a love of life that leaps across the screen as utterly genuine. By adopting the skeleton of a real movie - not a sterile "went there, did that" documentary but one with a premise, plot, setup and payoff, climax and conclusion.Filmed with true cinematographic flair, in turns suspenseful, faith-reaffirming and awe-inspiring, MAN ON WIRE is the unexpected show-stealer of the year, sneaking under the nose of Hollywood behemoths with 50 times its budget and doing what they're too sluggish to do, too dazzled by their own spectacle. A simple story beautifully told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful film, fascinating characters, sublime acts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival, it's European premier, and it was a packed audience. Unfortunately due to an error, the reels were swapped in the middle of the film, which threw the timing a bit but to be honest the poor organisers looked so miserable as they apologised that no one minded, and the film was just as beautiful as it should have been.We were lucky enough to have a Q&amp;A with the director and the star, Philippe Petit where we all asked the same old questions; 'how did it feels?' 'are you scared of death?' 'what made you do it?' but what made the experience and the film so refreshing was the personality of Petit. Of course you would assume he is a rampant egotist, he was a very good looking young man, talented, with a raft of friends happy to be involved in his dangerous and exciting endevours. Petit is actually incredibly funny and oblivious. I would describe his act not as simply entertainment but as a sublime experience, taking us to the edge of terror and death.I was worried I'd spend the whole film with clammy hands, watching a guy on a high wire so high up, but his friend describes it so well the feeling you get watching him walk up there, it's so poetic and peaceful.This is a very unusual film, very beautiful and exciting. I would say that it is suitable for any age but take your mum and dad, they'll love it.</fullReview>

It is intensely fun, good-natured, laugh-out-loud funny at times, poignant and heart-wrenching at others. The images, not just of the central feat, but of many of Philippe Petit's performances are arresting and jaw-droppingly beautiful. Each of the supporting characters is colorful and entertaining in his or her own way, but none more so than Petit himself, who is so instantly likable that it is hard not to get immediately drawn in to this fascinating tale.Even with this description, I am not doing the film justice. I have not seen a film this good in years. If you have a chance (I believe it is scheduled for release in August), GO SEE THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fascinating and even wondrous man caught in a beautiful movie, not just documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Man on Wire with my mother and a friend, and after it my mother said simply "something like this will never happen again." Meaning not so much that someone won't try something death-defying or crazy like walking a tight rope somewhere or climbing up a building (matter of fact that still happens in Manhattan as recently as a couple of months back), but that this sort of situation- a man going across something as perilous and unique as the Twin Towers- is based in a film that preserves his story like so. Philippe Petit was already a tight-rope walker who did some crazy stunts (i.e. crossing Notre Dame's stretch of space in Paris), but this was his crowning achievement which, oddly enough, didn't quite get the kind of buzz the film might depict; the day of Petit's walk across the towers, Nixon resigned from the presidency.Just a simple profile on the man might be enough, and hearing this artist (however "French" he might get in saying that it's like poetry, which maybe it is for all I know) is something to behold as a figure who sees himself as a rebel but not without some reason or in what he does. But Marsh's magnificence is first to actually make us forget, just a second, that the towers are no longer with us; it's never mentioned in the film that they're gone, so the lingering absence is all the more troubling once remembered by the viewer. One is left with the purity of this on-the-surface stunt that becomes akin to a bank robbery to Petit, as he plans and spies on the site and forms a 'crew' to do the job of sneaking up to the top level and for three days continuing to stay elusive (even going under a tarp for hours on end with a co-hort to hide from guards) while attaching the cables- which also, at one point, nearly falls apart as a plan.Then, second, Marsh reveals himself as good as a director of dramatization in a documentary I've seen since Errol Morris; perhaos even more daring with his black and white photography of what starts as a sneak-in (watch for fake sideburns on the actors), then transforms into a full-blown noir with beautiful lighting and exterior shots of the building and other angles that just stun the crap out of a viewer not expecting such artistry. In a sense Marsh is attempting something as daring as Petit, only by way of telling the story, however non-linearly, in a manner that should get his DP an academy nomination (if, of course, the academy ever got wise to nominate for cinematography for a documentary). And, on top of this, despite knowing partially the outcome- mainly, of course, that Petit lived to tell his tale to the camera as did his (once) friends and lover- it's still thrilling and even suspenseful to see all of this buildup if one isn't entirely researched on the details.But it's not just about the build-up and execution of that tight-rope walk, although when Marsh gets the chance to show his subject walking across this or other examples he puts it to beautiful, heart-aching music that transcends the material just enough. The man himself, and the people who knew and/or worked under him, takes up most of the time in the story. Petit is a curious fellow who can ramble like any energetic and, obviously, passionate Frenchman, and confesses how he's always been a climber since a child and loves the aspect of showmanship when he can (when not wire walking, he juggles and rides a unicycle, a lovely if strange clown).We also see his effect on others, like his friend Jean-Louis who co-planned the WTC project, and his lover Annie Alix who found him irrisistable and barely spent a moment worrying what would happen to him. And then there's the assorted 'characters', like in any good noir, that spring up as entertaining and interesting both in present and retrospect form; even a guy with one of those *real* twirling moustaches comes forward and talks, as well as one particular member of the crew who spent 35 years smoking pot and also during the WTC job (Marsh has a wonderful way of sort of 'introducing' them as well, in a walk-in profile and name tag). Hearing them expound about the mechanics of the job, and of Petit's personality and effect on them all, for better or worse as a kind of partially blind optimist, is also a major part of the appeal in Man on Wire.While Marsh possibly leaves out some possibly intriguing details about Petit after this job ends (save for the immediate details about his sentence and a brief, Clockwork Orange-filmed 'fling' with a local girl), and here and there finding him or even the film pretentious isn't out of the question, so much of it is alive and enthralling and even spiritual to a certain degree that I could forigve most of its possible faults. Just seeing some of that 8mm and film footage, shot at the practice sites, and the stills of Petit's walk late in life, is something that's hard to even put into words how to feel. I'm almost reminded of the wonder one feels when seeing the physically demanding art of Jean-Cristo, who also finds specific locations to pursue his craft. You can't say it specifically, but you know it's art, as is Marsh's film itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While reading the user reviews of this documentary, it appears to me that a lot of people may have missed some critical subtext in the film. Most reviews tend to focus on the undeniable artistic beauty represented by Phillipe's walk between the World Trade Center towers. However, by the end of the film I felt that the filmmaker used contrasting statements and emotions of the characters to highlight the selfishness and narcissism that can sometimes go hand in hand with the drive of an artistic genius. By the end of the film, Phillippe has become the toast of the New York for his daring and beautiful walk between the towers. He has charges against him dropped in exchange for another performance for children. To celebrate, he promptly devours the attention and beds the very first groupie he runs into. Contrast this with the fate of his conspirators, who faced similar risks of arrest and punishment for no reward. They remain anonymous, several of them were arrested and deported. One of Phillippe's main supporters, Jean-Louis I believe, is shown crying when thinking of the aftermath. Not weeping at the beauty of the act, but instead at the callous disregard of Phillippe, who has received what he needed from his "friend" and discarded him, moving on to bigger and better things. Even more sad is the case of Annie, the self described introverted and shy woman who made Phillippe's dreams her dreams. They clearly have a twisted relationship - Annie views Phillippe as some sort of beautiful deity who can do no wrong,a nd Phillippe views her as a placeholder for more beautiful fawning groupies to come. When Phillippe drops her like a hot potato the instant he becomes famous, she can only continue to obsess about the beauty of his wire walk. Nearly 30 years later, it is clear that this rather sad relationship is her greatest pride in life.In the end, this film highlights personality types. There are certain people, artistic and driven, who can accomplish miraculous things. But often, that artistry and drive is fueled by extreme narcissism that ignores the impact of a person's actions on others. For example, Phillippe could care less that if he falls or drops his balance stick, he could kill a totally innocent person. He also does not value the assistance and loyalty of these other people, who help him out of respect for his abilities or a desire to be a part of something. Once they have served his purpose, they disappear. Because in his mind, they were no longer necessary, and were only ever insignificant rocks circling a great star. The film is an interesting character study. My only complaint is that too much time was spent slowly chronicling the largely dull build up to the caper, instead of analyzing the benefits that accrued to one man at the expense of a multitude of friends who were promptly discarded in the birth of a star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh dear. I'm in the minority on this one, but Man on Wire did very little for me.Perhaps it's down to the unlikable Philippe Petit himself, who is surprisingly hard to root for. I didn't care for his personality and the fact that he had so much of it just exacerbated my feelings.For a 90-minute documentary there's remarkably little actual information. My general knowledge of the incident is still almost non-existent and I only watched it last night! Too much time is spent on Petit's other exploits and the WTC walk - supposedly the focus of the film - comes perilously close to being glossed over. The basic, essential facts of the operation are recounted in an incidental manner and are buried under mumbling voices with heavy French accents.What Petit did was undeniably spectacular - and at its best the film captures that well, with the wire walk sequence being thrilling - and I'm tempted to say it's a shame such a feat received such a poor documentary treatment, but it's an Oscar winner, and an overwhelming success with critics and audiences alike, so I'll accept that I'm just one of the few for whom it didn't work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An inspiring, uplifting story although told in a rather more pragmatic film. With all the original conspirators talking to camera and a fair bit of original footage the story basically tells itself. Marsh steps in to stick the whole thing together with reconstructions. Some feature the flamboyant Petit himself - elsewhere, and for me, more distractingly, with graphics or a son et lumi?re-style rigging sequence. At least he stays true to the Gallic light-heartedness of those recalling the event.To his principal credit though, Marsh never refers to the razing of the buildings in the 9/11 terrorist attacks (although the necessarily underhand infiltration of the building has a conspiratorial resonance that makes it horribly tense). Instead the film tries to preserve the pure existential nature of the stunt. A man does something which has apparently no purpose and is framed only by social censure (it's illegal) or death. Gilding the act with Satie is a case in point of the whole film: arguably overdone, but perhaps inflated melodrama is all that allows us to deal with an act this surreal. 7/10*'Il ne regrette rien' counts as a comment-terminating contravention of IMDb guidelines, apparently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man on Wire is the sorta film that brings back all sorts of memories. As someone old enough to remember this Philippe's amazing feat, seeing this brought back memories of old. And of course new. As a 8 year old living in NJ, I had never been to or seen NYC up to that point of my life. But a friend of mine told me about a tree nearby tall enough to see the Twin towers from the top. It was at the time of the crossing that i climbed this tree to see the top of the towers. I couldn't see the actual crossing from the 15 some odd miles from my house. But to think someone could actually do this was something i just couldn't believe. I watched the news that night and remember the video of his arrest and the footage inside the police station. Seeing this film brought back that amazing times. And for those couple hours of movie viewing brought back a time when things like this were truly amazing and cool, and when the towers stood as a great symbol of the NYC skyline and America. As evil on a human scale as 9/11, this period shown in this movie show the opposite of that scale. And how one man's dream can now be shared by all of us in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Postmodernists believe that truth is myth, and myth, truth. This equation has its roots in pop psychology. The same people also believe that emotions are a form of reality. There used to be another name for this state of mind. It used to be called psychosis." -Brad Holland"Art: the dearly purchased outcome of an immense spiritual risk." - Susan SontagThis documentary is operating on at least 6 levels. On the first level it's an informative tour of history. It tells us that in 1974 a French tight rope walker by the name of Philippe Petit strung a wire between the World Trade Centre buildings and then danced upon it for 45 minutes. It introduces us to Petite's gang, collaborators and girlfriend, but avoids any real probing into Philippe the person. On the second level, the film functions as a thriller or heist movie. Using re-enactments and gripping home footage, we watch as a group of acrobats plan their daring break-in and audacious crime. The documentary is every bit as exciting as a modern Hollywood thriller.On the third level, the film is an attempt to mythologise Petit. Petit enthusiastically narrates the picture, stating that it was a profound vision, a feeling of destiny, that led to him conquering the towers. The documentary paints Petit as a genius, a maverick artist, inspired by imagination and fuelled by sheer will power. Like a painter, Petite had a vision and the unbridled determination to actualise this mental image. Petit's narration is itself ridiculously theatrical and self-mythologising. He sees himself as a lover, a Romantic, an adventurer, a master artist, and his tightrope walk as nothing less than a grand statement about mankind. His tightrope walk wasn't just a narcissistic attention seeking attempt, it was art! He was challenging the world to grab life by the horns and live a life on the edge!So on the fourth level, Petit embodies the process of art and the role of the artist. By stringing a wire between the twin towers, Petit conceptualised the space between them. He made empty space concrete. He showed millions of people something they had never seen before: a third tower made of air. He concretized a dream so that it would turn into a dream once more in the minds of others.Like Pixar's "Ratatouille", a better recent film which deals with the same themes, "Man on Wire" says that every artist requires the space and freedom necessary for self expression, but more importantly, that this freedom will invariably pose a risk to the artist. All art requires its creator to put his or her deepest and innermost self "on the wire" for the world to see, thus risking both humiliation and failure.Of course, it is unlikely that Petit had such noble and grand intentions when he first decided to walk on air. But I suppose his actions were nevertheless inspirational, albeit it in a clichéd "chase your dreams" and "be all you can be" way.On the fifth level, the film is about the World Trade Centre's collapse. Of course, other than an ominous shot of an air plane, there are no overt references to 9/11 in the film. "Why burden this beautiful story with the ugliness of that?" the director has stated. But he is being disingenuous. A mood of sadness and nostalgia for a pre-9/11 world suffuses the film. We see the towers being built, the construction mess foreshadowing the wreckage after the planes hit, but more importantly, we see the wonder and joy of New Yorkers as they stare up at Petit on his wire. The film lusts for a simpler, more carefree time, when a gang of playful kids could break into the tallest buildings in the world, simply to hop and skip on the rooftops. On the sixth level - and this is something the film doesn't actually attempt to explore - the film is about imagination as a destructive force. A braver documentary would contrast Petit's "art" and "imagination" not only with man's ingenuity and ability to construct a building as vast and complex as the WTC, but with a small gang of terrorists who dream to bring such huge structures down. This is "Clockwork Orange" territory; free will as art, ultra-violence as the result of stymied creativity, creativity as destruction. For all his guts, planning and bravery, Petit's act pales in comparison to the work of several Saudi Arabian terrorists thwarting high tech security, hijacking multiple jet planes and taking down the World Trade Centre and Pentagon buildings, an intensely visual act which was designed as a clear "artistic" statement, the "primitives" of the east violently striking the symbolic hearts of Western Hegemony, "free trade" and corporatism. But maybe people are too sensitive for such things.And so "Man on Wire" re-packages the WTC towers, converting them from symbols of creative destruction to pillars of hope. Petite's myth is therapeutic, comfortable and appealing, but it is not the whole truth, nor is it as beautiful as it pretends to be.8/10 ? An excellent film, lent its power mostly from Michael Nyman's wonderful score. Incidentally, much of the music was "stolen" from Peter Greenaway films, who, ironically, used them in a far more depressing fashion.Interestingly, the film doesn't contain any footage of Petit actually doing his famous walk. The director argues that such footage doesn't exist(what about helicopter news footage?), but on some level, doesn't the absence of any actual filmed record further embalm the feat in an aura of myth and legend? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great example of exploiting context. A great example of narrative efficiency. A great example of cinematically fictionalizing reality, even more and better than "JFK."Here's the event: somewhat charming French street juggler moves into tightrope juggling, moving to higher elevations. After a while, in the tradition of guerrilla performance, he does his walking illicitly between high, public structures. Eventually he walks between the twin towers of the trade center. Hardly anyone notices except the financially stressed owners of the place who use the stunt to promote rental space. The stunt is easily eclipsed by a fellow who climbs buildings, including this one.Now fast forward. The towers are gone; and we as a people have spun them into some cosmic story. They matter all of a sudden. This is rich territory for a filmmaker who would want to ride that narrative strength and coherence.So the story is re-manufactured. Now this guy's whole life has been dedicated to this creative expression. It is no longer something done as a street performer would ? for sheer attention. It is now a work of art. He is not just on a wire (so high no one can see but the people he enlisted); he is "dancing." It is "beautiful." It justifies a life, no, it justifies all of humanity.The way it is presented is thanks to Warren Beatty's "Red's." Or is it "Sweet and Lowdown," because I have no idea where the real and surrogate seam is. Anyway, the presentation is as admiring retrospective of the man and his challenge. The key witness is his lover, whose testimony matters more than any. Its a love story, with him tightly in her through the (here shown as) elaborate, obsessive planning of the caper.Then the foreplay of the caper itself, where he shuts her out. There's a comical view of an airplane traveling back and forth from France to New York, always in the context of who he leaves behind, his lover. He does invite her for the actual act, but on the street as an ordinary passerby would be. Then immediately after he indulges in one of the instant groupies that briefly appear after something like this. Hungry, obsessive, needful sex and then she is out of his life.All in all, it worked for me, and apparently for nearly every viewer. It is taught. It strikes the right balance in several dimensions. It exploits a notion of adventure, puckishness, risk, patriotic externalities, dedication and yes, even sex. Its a masterful concoction.Those towers. As iconic now as the white house, the pentagon.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exhilarating! Thrilling! Riveting! Stunning! No superlative could be wasted on Man on Wire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The documentary, chronicles a life-affirming story of a man who was willing to risk his life for no particular reason. It's about an illegal and dangerous coup where the criminal objective was to create a beautiful spectacle. It's a nostalgic salute to a pre-Zero Tolerance New York, which may have been riddled with crime but where city officials and residents apparently realised that some things are more important than health-and-safety.Watching Man on Wire, it is impossible not to think of 9/11 and those now iconic images of planes crashing into the towers. Yet 9/11 was not part of Petit's story and there is no reason to believe he should have some novel insight into the motivation behind, or significance of, the terrorist attacks. So it is a good thing British director, James Marsh, decided not to burden the story with references to the terrorist attacks. Yet still, the scenes showing the WTC being built by labourers, coming to life bit by bit as Petit waited with bated breath for the completion of the towers so that he could attempt his gravity-defying feat, are a poignant and welcome antidote to the ceaseless images of the towers collapsing that we have been subjected to over the past seven years.Petit and his friends have some inspiring thoughts on life. As Petit says: 'Life should be lived on the edge ? see every day as a true challenge and then you live your life on a tightrope.' But they were not campaigning for some social cause. Petit is not an activist, but a tightrope walker, unicyclist, magician and pantomime artist, and in the film neither he nor his compatriots are held up as spokesmen for some political cause.The group's towering achievement was no quest for 'dads' rights', as it is for those 'fathers 4 justice' who dress up as superheroes and climb famous buildings in London. It was not a ploy to raise awareness about global warming, as it was for Alain Robert, the 'French spiderman', who climbed to the roof of the New York Times headquarters in June this year. Just hours later, a Brooklyn IT consultant scaled the same building to draw attention to malaria. The two inspired a third climber to make his way up the façade last month, promoting his conspiracy theories about al-Qaeda and the Iraq war. He unfurled a banner which read Bin Laden's Plan, the title of his own book.Petit, by contrast, did not parade in the air to lecture the people below. After descending from the Twin Towers, policemen and reporters asked incessantly 'why did you do it?' He answered: 'There is no why.' It is not just the meticulous planning of the 'coup', but also the plotters' lack of a 'good reason' that has allowed this astonishing feat to become an enduring urban legend. They did it simply because they wanted to ? it was a challenge, and a beautiful one to behold.Considering the dramatic and legendary story ? and the fact that Petit is such an animated and engaging interview subject, and has footage from several of his stunning performances ? one could say that director James Marsh had an easy ride. How could such rich material not make a great documentary? Surely all it needed was some clever editing? Yet Marsh has brought his own vision to the story. Man on Wire is a spellbinding docudrama constructed as a heist movie. And a heist movie is never simply about the crime itself ? it is also about its execution and its plotters. The photograph of Petit in his tight black tricots on the thin wire suspended across the Twin Towers looks like an image of a lone man, but this 'impossible' feat required years of planning and it was a collective effort ? as shown in Petit's home videos and in the film's reconstructed black-and-white images of him and his accomplices smuggling the heavy equipment into the WTC, bypassing security, hiding from a watchman for hours under a tarp, and using a bow-and-arrow (!) to affix the carefully-constructed ropes between the towers.By involving multiple characters in the story, Marsh brings out the complexity of the plot masterminded by a bunch of bohemian Frenchmen and Americans and 'The Australian' (a man Petit met while he was scaling the Sydney harbour bridge). Man on Wire is about friendship, romance and trust, and the possibility of refusing to be bound by any natural or artificial limits. Indeed, the towers themselves were concrete and glass monuments to that very refusal. But Petit took this daring and ingenious endeavour one step further ? not being content with watching as the tallest buildings in the world were built, he decided to climb them and cross them, without permission, without a safety harness and without an answer to the NYPD officers' and journalists' question of why he did it.And guess what? He's still healthy and safe today.by Nathalie Rothschild -- Nathalie Rothschild is commissioning editor of spiked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An award winning film this may be but it's not exactly an enjoyable one. It drags on and on and is nothing more than an ego trip for the man who walked across a wire.I had the 'pleasure' of watching it for my uni course and never has 90 minutes felt so long. The actual bit where he walks the wire is interesting enough but the 80 minutes of pure talking and meandering that came before it. Get to the point and walk the wire I felt like shouting.Now I know all art is subjective and I'm sure for some it is a very interesting documentary but I'm sorry to say I missed the point.

		<fullReview>In announcing the Audience Award for this film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, Sir Sean Connery described it as one of the best three films he had seen EVER. With that heavy recommendation, I was well-primed to disagree. I'm not sure about the numbers, but it one of the best and most worth-while documentary films I have ever seen, if not the best.The synopsis hardly impels people into the cinema. So let me tell you how it won the audience award. Into entered the chart at the top and stayed there, beating various mainstream releases scheduled for release instantly. The effect on audiences is remarkable. It touches people.The great philosopher Wittgenstein said he went to fight on the front line, so that, as a philosopher, he could have a better comprehension of life and death. For the Frenchman in this film, it is about art. An artistic accomplishment that is serious. A high-wire walker/dancer that pictures himself as a poet, conquering beautiful stages. And from the age of seventeen his ultimate dream-stage is the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre. His passion for life is like that of the early mountaineers. An exaltation of the human spirit. A triumph of skill and daring. Life and death in the same frame. Asked why, he replies, "There is no why."Placing a tightrope between the towers is, of course, illegal. So he plans it as carefully as a bank robbery. An interesting reflection on rules being there to be broken is cast up - but neatly parallelling the contemporaneous Watergate, we ask, to what end? Balanced along the 200 feet between the towers, a quarter of a mile from the ground, he dances back and forth eight times. We are left breathless and moist-eyed. And then he is then duly arrested and sent for psychiatric treatment (an amusing comment on how the American system can treat greatness).Man on Wire is a beautiful film. An inspiring film. A film of a human being totally committed to his calling. And in a very small way perhaps, a crowning tribute to the magnificence of the architecture before it was destroyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit to having been rather sceptical prior to seeing this film - despite the universally positive comments in every single review I'd read. After all, this was a 90-minute documentary on a man tightrope walking where there was no actual footage of the main event itself! Needless to say I was blown away by what is surely one of the best documentaries ever made (and probably second only to One Day in September in this respect).A masterly crafted piece of work, from the very start it is Philippe Petit's vibrant, larger-than-life personality which dominates proceedings. And one realises early on that it is this very personality which, by force of will alone, drove the whole adventure along, dragging along a throng of helpers and hangers-on who seemed positively normal by comparison! If there is one thing that can be taken from viewing this wonderful film, it is that a single individual's love of life can have a very profound - and positive effect - on a great many people. Marvellous - storytelling at its best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAN ON WIRE (2008) **** Wholly absorbing and ultimately rewardingly fascinating documentary about the historical event of French tightrope walker Philippe Petit's daredevil theatrics in crossing over the chasm of NYC's World Trade Center twin towers in 1975. The film is treated almost as a bank heist thriller as Petit recalls in flashback recreations of his incredible plan/dream/life-time achievement in hatching the idea on a whim to a nearly obsessive fever-dream in self-fulfillment of destined derring-do. Director James Marsh makes a clever thriller and lump-in-the-throat valentine to the iconic feat that is only more poignant in the shadow of 9/11 (which is the subtext but never mentioned). A truly magical and at times funny and in the process, humane tale of one man's desire as a global moment in time. A must see and one of the year's best and my choice for Best Documentary Nominee for this year's Oscars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you do if you were drawn or literally compelled to do something -- something so crazy and fantastic that to succeed would be a gift to the world and to fail would mean certain death? That question is put to the test in the film "Man on Wire" which I went to see last night. It is a film of beautiful poetry, catharsis, humor, breathtaking moments, grief and strength -- in an incredibly quiet and peaceful way that makes it seem as if the film itself doesn't even know how moving it is.The thing that struck me most about this film is what it didn't say. September 11th is never even mentioned, and we do not have to endure yet another scene of those two towers coming down. Quite the contrary, about 25% of the film is dedicated to the construction of the towers.You see, part of me was saying "Oh, what a shame. All that work and those buildings are just going to come down in about 30 years." But the flower that was being watered was saying "That's right. Keep Building. Make them REALLY big. Make them look STRONG. Make them big enough so that they become a symbol of what mankind can achieve. Don't stop until they're THAT big." Because those buildings simply must be THAT big, they have a very important duty to fulfill in about 30 years.I think we as a country are just starting to come OUT of the grieving process and see what happened to us while we were there. I think we're just starting to get stronger too. We're seeing how the rest of the world sees us -- and like true Americans, we're not falling all over ourselves apologizing and suddenly trying to become Ireland or some dream country where the fields are always green and the folks are always helpful and friendly and man and beast live together in Ecological and Spiritual harmony regardless of race, creed, religion or sexual orientation. Though I think I might like it if we WERE that country one day, we aren't right now, and its gonna be a while.We are who we are, for better or for worse. Right now we've got a lot of "worse" but that's our problem, not theirs, thank you very much. And just because we're really screwed up ourselves doesn't mean that we suddenly have no right to tell Russia to stop attacking Georgia or that China needs to take a serious look at some of its government's policies and its record on Human Rights.We're still the world's greatest Super Power. We have a duty to fulfill that comes along with that title whether we like that or not. Uncle Ben (no, not the one on the rice box.) said it best "With great power comes great responsibility." And sometimes, when you're responsible for bringing the potato salad to the picnic and you're running a little behind schedule, you leave your own kitchen dirty till you get home.Don't get me wrong. in my mind our Government doesn't get to say "Sorry the dishes are still dirty, we were out playing war." We've got to strike more of a balance. Chores first, imaginary weapons of mass destruction wars later. And I'm also not saying that we don't have a LOT of problems to fix in our country. We all have a list of what they are. There's some things on your list I don't agree with and some things on my list you wouldn't agree with, but that's OK -- I'll bet you 90% or greater of our lists are identical. I'm sure as heck not a Republican, but I'm not even really sure if I'm truly a Democrat anymore.This movie made me think about all of those things -- and it did so without mentioning a single one of them. Really, this film shows us the beauty of the towers being built, the simple fact that they were THERE caused this man to want to do this crazy high-wire walk between them that even HE couldn't explain -- and he did two extraordinary things during his walk that I won't spoil for you that made the walk all the more reckless, and 30-some-odd years later, that high wire walk became a beautiful kiss, an embrace between a man and the towers that in some way brings some closure for me. Because now I know like I know like I know down deep in my heart that for at least one day, those towers felt loved, and Philippe blew them a kiss for all of us.Merci, Philippe. Thank you, Phillippe. Your dance kissed my friend and said goodbye for me. For that you have my gratitude.

		<fullReview>Man on Wire -- Reviewed by Ellen Kimball"Man on Wire" is a fascinating and in some ways disturbing documentary. It chronicles how a talented high-wire walker, Frenchman Philippe Petit, assembled a team of accomplices and how they helped him to carry out an astonishing feat. On August 7, 1974, Phillipe stepped out on a wire (really a thick cable) suspended 1350 feet above the ground between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. He performed with no safety net for almost an hour. He crossed between the towers eight times before he was arrested for what later became known as "the artistic crime of the century." Prior to that event, Petit had successfully managed other astonishing wire walks, but this one was the true bravura performance. What Petit and his crew accomplished was not legal. They had to gain access to restricted areas of the World Trade Center where they were not supposed to be. They also had to carefully plan the technical aspects of how it would all work. Critical to their success and Philippe's safety was determining how to rig the wire. The movie shows in extreme detail how they prepared and it also explores the successes and failures they experienced. The film includes extensive current day interviews of the team's participants regarding their roles in this daring adventure. There is also original film footage shot in 1974 and even earlier. There is some dramatized material interwoven with a seamless result. This reviewer acknowledges director James Marsh and editor Jinx Godfrey for their remarkable achievements. I believe that the attack of September 11, 2001 is still so painful to most of us that we are not eager to watch a film about the World Trade Center. As a former New Yorker, I know that am still filled with grief over the losses experienced there. However this is a story of a daring feat and, in this venue, I can tolerate it, albeit with a sense of great sadness. As I watched "Man on Wire" I felt the lingering undercurrent that these two magnificent twin towers are no longer there. That is what disturbs me. The events of 9/11 reside in a place of infamy still as haunting the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor, if we are old enough to remember it. The bottom line is that "Man on Wire" celebrates an outstanding achievement and does it well. Credit this film for immense success in accomplishing this in the face of our continuing grief over 9/11. Incidentally, the film never mentions the 2001 event. The film won two awards at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival last February. It is in limited release. Please check your local listings for theaters and showtimes. I'm giving this a solid 'A' on Ellen's Entertainment Report Card.Magnolia Pictures Directed by: James Marsh Written By: James Marsh Based on the book "To Reach The Clouds" by Philippe Petit Rated: PG-13 Grade: A Opens: August 8, 2008 (limited run) View trailer at official site: http://manonwire.com/(Opens Friday, 8/8/08 for a limited run in Portland, OR.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful documentary about the pursuit of passion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philippe Petit is a man of incredible charisma, grace, and focus. We are told in the documentary "Man on Wire" that as a young man sitting in a dentist's office, Petit saw an artist's rendering in a newspaper of the not yet built Twin Towers and became fixated on one day walking from one to the other on a line suspended between the two. He steals the newspaper from the office in what will become a pattern of committing petty crime to serve his passions."Wire" is a heist film and performance piece. Petit engages in guerrilla ballet as he breaks into buildings and then suspends wires from them in order to perform tightrope feats high in the air. His object is not to get from one end to the other, but to dance, play, and perform while high above the ground. The trespass of the buildings is an integral part of the performance and the thrill of this along with his charisma and persistence of vision allows him to gather a group of willing collaborators.We get the impression that Petit pursued these stunts not so much for the notoriety as it was his passion. But his biggest performance--an attempt to walk between the Twin Towers--because of its audacity brought him fame and it is interesting to see how Petit and his band of collaborators deal with the newfound notoriety. In order to succeed in their feat, however, his crew must devise away to reach the top of the towers and suspend a wire between them without being noticed.Director James Marsh's film is light on its feet and surprisingly touching. When Petit is performing, he moves with such grace and audacity. You will be surprised by the beauty of his feats. Marsh's film consists of talking head interviews, dramatic reenactments, and actual video and photos of Petit and his crew. Marsh's use of an insistent score and talking heads against dark backgrounds at times recall the films of Errol Morris."Wire" avoids being a mawkish remembrance of the World Trade Center, but still finds a way to honor it through recalling the performance of Petit. The film ends on a surprisingly bittersweet tone as old friends recall their lost youth and wild exploits. And as the film closes, Petit once again walks across a wire suspended above the ground, alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Documentary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really great documentary. It's a "Tour de Force of Will". The energy that Petit shows even in his old age is inspiring. I was hungry for more information and sad when it finished. I would have loved to know a little more about all of the principal players and what they are up to now.It is really quite something to imagine a time when this kind of feat was even possible. Obviously, times have changed a lot since the early seventies and we all understand the unspoken appeal of this whole story, but at the end of this documentary I kind of felt a little sad that our world has become a place where things like this are essentially impossible to pull off nowadays and amazed that this guy and his gang of buddies did it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering that "Man on Wire" won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, I was expecting a lot from this film. Sadly, while a decent film, it certainly was no especially memorable or transcendent. It's watchable and competently made but that's really about all.This film is about a man named Petite who is insane about walking on the tightrope. One of his exploits involved walking on a cable hastily strung between the two towers of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, but this wasn't enough. When he learned about the Twin Towers begin built in New York in the 1970s, he was determined to talk between them as well. But, Petite wasn't about to ask permission (he probably wasn't about to receive it) and with a group of friends he planned to sneak onto the property and to this stunt. Much of the film is about the planning of the walk as well as the walk itself.Overall, while a decent film, I didn't particularly like Petite--who seemed like a self-absorbed guy who used his friends. Because of this, it was hard to really care about his stunt. However, the film was well made--quite competent and well constructed. Not a film I'd rush to recommend but worth a look.By the way, surprisingly the film has a bit of nudity--just be forewarned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Death Is Very Close"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1974 French tightrope walker Philippe Petit traversed a wire cable that he and his friends rigged from the very top of one World Trade Center (WTC) tower to the top of the other WTC tower. The cable was two hundred feet long, and suspended well over a thousand feet above street level. Petit made eight crossings and spent 45 minutes on the wire. As if to put an exclamation point on his accomplishment, he even placed himself in a recumbent, horizontal position on the wire, with his face looking up at the sky. "Man On Wire" is Petit's story. The documentary consists of interviews with him and those who helped him, reenactments, still photos, and archival footage.Just getting the necessary equipment inside the two towers and in position at the top was an extraordinary coup, given the nearly impossible logistics, and the fact that the entire scheme was illegal. His plan required meticulous planning, mechanical skills, problem solving, help from a lot of people, and of course, a devil-may-care mindset.In one of his several preparatory trips to the WTC, he sits on the roof, dangling his legs off the edge. He reflects: "And slowly I thought, okay, now it's impossible, that's sure. So let's start working".At the moment he steps onto the wire at the top of the WTC, he recalls: "I had to make a decision of shifting my weight from one foot anchored to the building to the foot anchored on the wire. This is probably, I dunno, probably the end of my life, to step on that wire ... and death is very close".As a personality, Petit comes across in the film as intelligent, determined, single-minded, physical, resourceful, rebellious, and totally lacking in fear. He also seems a tad self-centered, and he likes to talk, a lot.That the man is courageous and daring is obvious. His achievement is breathtaking. The documentary is a fascinating insight both on the accomplishment and on the person who still lives to talk about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High wire act lacks tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this as I'd heard so many rave reviews. But Man on Wire was only okay. The movie is over-long, heavy on shadowy reconstruction and boring interviews, and totally fails to capture the awesome nature of the feat performed, which is served only by contemporaneous stills. The central character is not appealing enough to engage us, and reminded me of Malcolm Maclaren, which can never be a good thing. Like so many men who are driven to perform spectacular feats, he comes over as having been self-centred and demanding in the pursuit of his dream. I was looking at my watch within 20 minutes of the start, and feel that the good basic story would have been better served by a 45 minute TV documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hats off to this little documentary,produced by the BBC (in association with the Discovery Channel)about Phillipe Petit,the Frenchman who walked across the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. The film documents (with interviews &amp; reenacted footage of the infamous walk)Petit's burning desire to make history by walking across the towers on a thin wire. Petit is depicted as a 17 year old youth reading about the plans to build the towers in New York,while a patient in a Paris dentist office, and gets the idea (long before the towers are even built). The direction style here reminded me a lot of the documentaries of Errol Morris (only without the surreal images). This is a specialized area documentary,which means it probably won't be playing cinemas for very long (although I'm sure it'll turn up on DVD before long,or even aired on the Discovery Channel even before that). The film also makes very good use of Michael Nyman's music (of which I'm a big fan of).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent documentary and a wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extraordinary though it seems, in 1974, a Frenchman walked on a tightrope between the two towers of the World Trade Center. This film proudly announces on its poster that this stunt was the "artistic crime of the century". Upon a moment's reflection, it becomes clear that this probably was a crime. But was it artistic? Surely not.The man, who was, for forty-five minutes, an extra speck on the Manhattan skyline, is Philippe Petit. He is the extraordinary driving force not only of the story but also of this documentary. He has huge, childlike charisma which almost immediately engages. He tells, still with youthful wonder, how, as a seventeen year-old, he saw an artist's sketch of the towers in the National Geographic before they had been built. As he looked he drew a line between the tops of the building, ripped the page from the magazine and ran out of the dentist's waiting room where he was. It was the birth of a dream and is a wonderful thing to see.Later on, as he describes how he evaded capture by one of the guards in the towers, the night before his attempt, he plays a game of hide and seek with the camera. It is then that Petit is revealed as someone who is not just a childish dreamer, but is in many ways still a child, even after all of these years. Towards the end, he seems to be almost psychopathic as he recalls the adulation which followed his success, and yet he always remains charming and his story is utterly gripping.The film is at its best when it looks into the psychology of this man who dared to do what most would never even dream of being possible. This comes to the fore when director James Marsh uses archive footage and photographs of Petit's other exploits, at Notre Dame in Paris and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. There is something magical about the endeavours that he undertook, and Marsh frames it wonderfully.A lot of the film is dedicated to reconstructions of the actual attempt which are stylishly done and keep the tension going. The motley crew that Petit assembles are an interesting, if very strange, bunch and they tell their part of the story with the same enthusiasm and charm which fills the film.But, ultimately, this film is all about the moment when Petit stepped out onto a high wire. There is no footage, only photographs, and yet James Marsh manages to make those moments the most cinematic and magical of the entire film. Petit's stunt was driven by a strange egotism. It was selfish; a man following his heart and saying to hell with the consequences, no matter who gets caught in the crossfire. But, this film can leave you in no doubt that this was a beautiful thing to have happened. It was a wonderful work of art and this is a brilliant film.4 Stars out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even the great Knievel . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it." Oprah WinfreyRe-creations notwithstanding, Man on Wire is an authentic documentary about the romantic spirit of adventure still found in the human heart, at least the heart of slightly-eccentric Phillipe Petit, who walked a wire between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974.Although so many daring stunts have occurred before and after, Evel Knievel's bone-crushing flying motorcycles come to mind, Petit's romantic descriptions of the plans and execution are even more interesting.With the delicious details of evading the authorities while carrying at least a ton of equipment to anonymous sex with a fan immediately after custody, not even the great Knievel can match Petit's English in an accent well suited to any B movie thriller. Add to that enjoyment the apt choices of music with Michael Nyman's La Traverse de Paris and Erik Satie's uber-minimalist Gymnopedies.The doc's structure is a traditional story within a story: The actual day of the twin Towers walk is framed by his background stories and biography, including his remarkable stunts between the Notre Dame steeples and the top of the Sydney Harbor Bridge. My colleague Frank Gabrenya of the Columbus Dispatch rightly criticizes the film's lack of follow up with Petit's life?such an interesting character makes you want to know everything up to today.But then, maybe his holding back details of his contemporary life is just another high-wire act keeping you wanting more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Documentarian James Marsh is a smart filmmaker. Here he has an incredibly engaging and energetic subject and he wisely lets Phillipe Petit (and his cronies) tell the story.An intertwined performance from Messr. Petit (today), film clips and photos of his early years, and insight from his unlikely support group who helped him pull off the "artistic crime of the century" ... a high-wire dance between the twin towers in 1974.Documentaries rarely have the element of surprise on their side, so it is always a challenge to tell the story in a manner that grabs the viewer. Here Phillipe Petit does what he has always done ... he performs for the audience. Even as he pantomimes his actions of over 30 years ago, one can see the young man in his gleaming eyes.The clips of the actual event are much better than the dramatization of the set-up. In fact, some of the home movies of Petit's practice sessions are priceless. However, the closest thing we get to a surprise is the bumbling goofs that make up his support team, save friend JL, who is captivating and emotional.What prevents this one from being great is that we are given very little details on Petit since his amazing event in 1974. I guess we are supposed to read his book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Feet Of Film For This Rare Feat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man on Wire tells the story of how Frenchman Phillippe Petit walked between the South and North Towers of the World Trade Center one August day in 1974. He wowed the world for 45 minutes as he danced on wire cable tied between the two buildings. This was not a spur-of- the-moment prank for a small and puckish man who spent many years planning this audacious display of joyful rebelliousness with a little help from his friends and a few strangers. Four-fifths of the documentary, which runs approximately one hour and thirty-five minutes, is spent giving the audience a thumbnail profile of this unicyclist-juggler-wire walker extraordinaire and unraveling the blueprint for his quixotic adventure. The 2008 film is a mix of current talking-head interviews, archival photographs and film footage, home movies, and re-enactments of events before and after the historic walk. After spending the bulk of the movie focusing on the planning, the last twenty-five minutes goes at a fast clip, retelling the minutes before the actual walk, showing the walk itself, and winding up with a short aftermath. Too much footage is spent on prologue and not enough on epilogue. Mr. Petit's story is certainly worthy of a documentary, but one leaves the screen wanting to know more of what has happened to Mr. Petit and his accomplices 34 years after the fact. He still walks wire and talks about the need to break rules, but what has that philosophy reaped him after all these years? During the last part of the film, Mr. Petit and his co-conspirators relate how their stunt almost literally fell through their hands as they were setting up the wiring. "At some point, I gave probably too much cable," Petit says. His helpers chime in and say "We could not hold it?. We almost lost the wire." One could say Man on Wire sags up front, is supple in the middle, and too tight at the end.</fullReview>

Like humility and loyalty...the man has none...NONE. Yes he did all that but what he soon forgets is that his dream was realized because a lot of people not only believed in his abilities but helped him...without them, there's NO "Man on Wire" No books, nothing. These people went back and forth between France and the US a couple of times, spent all that time planning and training with him, they've put their lives on hold for this guy so he could do what he wanted to do, and as soon as he came back down, he was gone from their lives. The man never once spoke in appreciation for all that they did for him, he even went and had sex with an admirer before seeing his girlfriend for the first time after the stunt. Well as a performer he's great, other than that the man plain s*&amp;%s!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Marsh's Oscar-winning documentary--based upon French acrobatic daredevil Philippe Petit's memoir "To Reach The Clouds"--concerning that mesmerizing August morning in New York City, 1974 when Petit "danced" across the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on a cable, 1350 feet in the air, with the world looking on (and up!). The film cheats a bit on the documentary format by re-enacting several key moments of Petit's preparation, yet the visualization is helpful (and rather necessary), while Petit himself, commenting on the goings-on with childlike abandon, is an amazing character worthy of the best fiction. I would have preferred less of Petit's disparate group of assistants and more on his thoughts of the Towers themselves (and New York City in the aftermath of 9/11, which is not mentioned); however, this is still quite an incredible journey...both intense and unexpectedly moving. Michael Nyman's piano theme is beautiful, as is Igor Martinovic's cinematography in the charmingly simple final sequence. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting story about an amazing stunt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fascinating film about a Frenchman, Philippe Petit, who had a dream about walking between the twin towers of the World Trade Center on a high wire. The film follows his story from the time he saw a picture of what the towers would look like long before they were built. The film is a mix of interviews with the participants, archive footage and dramatic reconstructions. This was all very interesting and surprisingly gripping given that we know from the start that he wasn't caught beforehand. The only slight let down was the fact that there was no film footage of the actual walk between the towers just some still picture, as this took place in 1974 it is hardly surprising though. There was however footage of previous stunts where he walked between the towers of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris and those of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.The planning involved in getting into the towers with all their equipment then getting the wire set up was as exciting as hearing about the walk itself, even though security was lower than one would expect in such a building these days they were lucky not to get caught.I'm not sure I'd want to watch it more than once but I'd certainly recommend watching it once to others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A watchable documentary made out of unpromising material.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the documentary 'Man On Wire' reminded me of Edmund Hilary's comment on why he climbed Mount Everest: "Because it's there" was his reason. And "Because it's there" seemed to be the only motivation which made a mid-20s Frenchman called Phillippe Petit, illegally in August 1974, walk a tightrope between the two towers of the World Trade Centre in Manhatten.English director James Marsh achieves a near impossible feat of fashioning a highly watchable documentary out of so little material. The obstacles facing Marsh were as great as those which faced Petit in 1974. For a start, it's a footnote in the history of the World Trade Centre. Secondly, there is no filmed record of Petit's walk between the twin towers. Thirdly, with the World Trade Centre now gone, there was no opportunity of revisiting the location of the event or even attempting to stage a recreation. Also, tightrope walking is an old-fashioned and rather slow form of what we now called 'extreme sports' ? nowadays it has been overtaken by bungee jumping and free running.And yet from this unpromising material Marsh (with funding from the BBC and Discovery Channel) has created a film which was the winner of the 2008 Academy Award for Best Documentary and BAFTA for Best British film. Marsh uses a mixture of dramatised reconstructions, 1970s footage of Petit, recollections of the participants and stills to recount the drama. The actual walk itself is something of an anti-climax as there only exists a handful of still photographs. Better are the poignant shots of the World Trade Centre being constructed in the early 1970s and the scenes of Petit and his team secretly hiding themselves inside the World Trade Centre, emerging at night and setting up their equipment on the roof , recalls many a heist movie. Critics attempting to find some post September 11th resonance (which is the sort of thing critics like to do) will be looking in vain. This is about nothing more than the adventurous spirit of a great eccentric. It was ironic that after this exceptional feat of bravery, on coming off his tightrope Petit was immediately arrested by the NYPD and sent to a local mental institution for psychiatric evaluation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film documents the 1974 wire-walking stunt between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. This is not the best movie ever, but with the attack of 9/11 it certainly makes the story seem more relevant. Besides that it isn't a bad story.Philippe Petit is a crazy street performer who became obsessed with walking a tightrope between the twin towers when he saw a conceptual drawing of the buildings when he was only 17 years old. Five years later, he was in New York walking back and forth between the towers, 450 meters above the ground for 45 minutes. The film retraces the road to this event with his tag-alongs, by way of similar wire-walking adventures at Notre Dame in Paris and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.What is also interesting about the film is that is traces the history of the towers with some great looking footage of the groundbreaking and even the topping-out ceremony. Each person in the story is a real character all on their own from the nutty Petit to his French assistants Blondeau and Heckel, his doubtful girlfriend Allix, the American collaborators Foreman and Welner, the Australian planning expert Lewis, and the colourful inside man Greenhouse. There is more than one journey going on in the film and the vivid personalities really make this film fresh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good God, this is a painfully slow and boring documentary. It's talking heads for the majority of it, and the director often has more than one character in succession saying the same thing, but in their own different words. What are we, in kindergarten?? Your audience is not stupid, things don't have to be constantly repeated.Parts of this story are told non-linearly, which is dumb. And I don't mean the current day with flashbacks/reenactments. I mean IN FLASHBACK (with current day voice-over), we get some of the non-linear storytelling. The editor should be shot for doing this, or allowing the director to dictate this. (If you've see the movie, you know what I mean.)How this won an Oscar is beyond me. If this was the 1980's, okay, maybe I can understand the subject matter impressing the Academy's voters. But this was the late '00s, this is NOT good documentary filmmaking. IF this film was a 30 minute short, cutting out all the characters repeating themselves, and cutting out the incessant planning for the WTC walk, then it probably would have been decent. But apparently the director just got lost in being in love with characters talking, and talking about their plans, and reenactments of very unexciting moments. (Why?? Why would someone reenact unexciting moments??)Now, if you happen to have the DVD and watch the short film in the Special Features section (the first one in the Special Features section), that short film is very entertaining. It moves, it's not boring, and you actually get MORE INSIGHT into Petit in this short film, than you do in the entire full-length documentary. That also is a failure of "Man on Wire"... that we learn so little about this man's take on life, when in fact the film should be about HIM. Not just on what he's done, but also about HIM. Bottom line, this film is horribly directed, and while it could have been an interesting film, it's not. Skip it and watch the accompanying 15 minute short on the DVD.My last issue, is that this film recycles the music/score from "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover." The composer really shouldn't have allowed that. It's good music, but every time it starts playing, I'm taken back to Peter Greenaway's film. Not good. This is why music scores are not repeated from one movie to another -- to avoid being identified with a previous film. Bad, bad, bad. Shame on this director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone had asked me if I knew that a person had walked a tight rope between the World Trade Center towers, I would have said yes, although I would not have been able to recall any details about it. It was one of many events that occurred during my lifetime that I somehow absorbed into the "common knowledge" area of my memory. I happened to be in boot camp at the time, and with no access to newspapers or TV, the buzz must have still been "in the air" long after it happened for it to register in my unconscious the way it did. So it was with mild interest that I began viewing this documentary, completely unprepared for the thrills and adventure that are normally associated with summer blockbusters. This movie unlocked the free spirit in me and allowed me to soar among the clouds as I have only been able to do before when dreaming. Phillipe Petit is now officially a hero of mine. The story of the event that changed the lives of the people involved, has enlightened my own. I can't imagine why anyone would not enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In these modern days of cinema its only a couple times a year that something cinematicaly beautiful is put onto the screen, and even then its not always so easy to see because these movies are not always playing at your local cinema. Up until this point in 2008 (its December) I really didn't see much in the way of great great Cinema. Sure the Dark Knight was "great" but only in the modern sense of action and media hype, it really had no substance. A couple months ago I briefly noticed this article in the Boston Globe about this documentary called Man on Wire. I read it and it intrigued me, a man walking on a high wire between the twin towers? what? I wanna f@###ing see this shiz. Obviously its playing nowhere. Last Night I was able to rent the last copy......As soon as Man on Wire begins it sucks you in. This story was just crazy to me, being younger I had never been told of such an event. the movie starts like Oceans Eleven, these french people (some speaking only in French) begin telling this tale of how they snuck into the towers. Before you get your answer the story of Petit begins. The story of a unique French man who for some reason fell in love with walking on high wires. The movie follows his attempts at danger at places around the world and introduces you to all his friends. As he travels the world, the movie is building up to the big walk on the world trade center. The amount planning and luck that these people acquire is amazing.In the end this is a story about a man in world not seen today, a world at ease with itself. Not only that but you really miss the twin towers after seeing Petit's love for them in the movie. Nowadays its all guns, police and terrorism, in this movie's time of 1974 it was different.Seriously watch this movie and if you think it sounds gay or something f#$% you go watch The Dark Knight and waste away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twin Towers remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A real treat, especially for documentary lovers, this film will undoubtedly resonate for all of us around the anniversary of September 11th 2001. It tells of tightrope-walker Philippe Petit (the French have a wonderful word, funambule) and his obsession with conquering the Twin Towers. And yes, I do mean what you think I mean. Having strung a wire between the towers of Notre Dame de Paris, and then between those of the Sydney Harbour bridge, and proceeded to walk, kneel, lie down, turn around and juggle on them, Petit and his accomplices planned the spectacular and all but impossible challenge of doing the same for WTC North and South towers. It is of course illegal to do this sort of thing, but they had got away with it before. Interweaving documentary footage, reconstruction and talking head reminiscences of the participants ? Petit himself is infectiously enthusiastic ? Marsh fashions a film which tantalisingly revisits the progress of events on the day and then leaves us dangling (sorry) to go back and explain or amplify earlier events and preparations. Despite the security challenges, the dangers of cross winds, wire oscillation and tension, not to mention the difficulty of getting an extremely heavy length of cable up a hundred flights and getting it two hundred feet to the opposite tower, the group pulled it off. It's a breathtaking viewing experience, conveying something of the awe the event inspired in bystanders back in 1974, and this despite the lack of moving images depicting the coup itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One month after tightrope walker Phillipe Petit left his footprints in the Manhattan air like some Jesus mime on a Frenchman's holiday, stuntman Evel Kneivel jumped across Snake River Canyon in the Magic Valley region of southern Idaho. Although James Cameron's "True Lies" was successful in its own right, Claude Zidi's "La Totale" got the job done with a lot less bombast without having to sacrifice an iota of the spectacle itself, just like Petit, who somehow turned impending death into something aesthetically beautiful and transcending. Categorically speaking, "Man on Wire" is a documentary, but that label seems too limiting for what it actually accomplishes. This singular film, which marries oral history to dramatized reenactments with a finesse that's unprecedented, works as a tone poem and ghost story for the dead rubble of that fateful day in September. It's also an ironic farce, a knowing extrapolation in retrospect. We know the hindsight. "Man on Wire" is a requiem for two buildings."Beyond anything you can imagine...it was mind-blowing," is how Jean Louis-Blondeau describes their benign attack on the World Trade Center; a wistful statement that addresses a bygone era, a time when a young man from France could waltz into a government corporate structure and raise an artistic jihad on the muses, with no clue that his actions were like an incidental rehearsal for a different sort of campaign, twenty-nine years later. The planning involved in setting up Petit's wire is so convoluted and rife with potential stumbling blocks, the lack of a bomb in their arsenal makes Petit and his associates resemble the ultra-left wing radicals of the Weather Underground as an organization of rascally mimes. Performance art as a fun weapon against conformity was the agenda of that August day in '74. And the filmmaker creates uncanny visuals to help bring alive the testified words about their meticulous preparation stateside, and back in their French backyard; a milieu of nature and leftover sixties camaraderie, naive renegades at purposeful play under a European sun. Annie Allix speaks with so much love towards Petit, you suspect that she'd follow him into the Symbionese Liberation Army, the revolutionary vanguard army who kidnapped Patty Hearst."Man on Wire", make no mistake about it, is a seance for the World Trade Center, which looms so large within our psychical mind-scape, it jostles with Petit himself for the audience's attention, and in essence, becomes the co-protagonist, his partner-in-crime. Most of the people who see "Man on Wire" will know this edifice better than anybody who died on September 11, therefore love this monument of concrete, glass, and wires, more than the flesh and blood of abstracted strangers. With certainty, Petit can be counted as one such person, which raises the question, last posed in "The Rape of Europa"(the documentary that chronicled the Nazis' insatiable hunger for museum things), about weighing the life of one person against an inanimate object that's good for the emotional well-being of a nation. The filmmaker treats the Twin Towers with the same reverence as National Book Award-winning author(for "White Noise") Don DeLillo did with the dust jacket art for his 9/11 novel "Falling Man", in which the Twin Towers jut out of the clouds, like they were buildings in heaven. When "Man on Wire" recreates the preliminaries for Petit's walk on the tower roofs, the filmmaker renders it in a phantasmagorical black and white, employing moving stars as a backdrop, as if Petit and his men wee floating in space. It's clear that the Twin Towers aren't moored to the ground. Reminiscent of a Georges Melies film, the sequence plays like a sequel to "A Trip to the Moon". "A Trip to Heaven", perhaps? Or, to use a more recent film as a reference point, Koreeda Hirozaku's "Wandafuru Raifu", in which the recently deceased choose a memory in their life so wonderful, it's worth adapting into a short film, a joyful memory transfixed to the soul's mind's eye for all of eternity, shot on a movie set in the after-life. If the World Trade Center was processed by the film crew in the Koreeda film, that fall day in which Petit stepped off its ledge and walked off into negative space, the workers would learn, was the Twin Towers' most significant and joyful memory.On August 7, 1974, New Yorkers looked up into the sky while the World Trade Center was being attacked. It would be twenty-seven years before it was attacked again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film should have never have been created. It is awful, I am currently watching it and I can tell you right now that suicide is a option worth considering. It doesn't even get to the actual incident until the final minutes. The rest of it is listening to some self-absorbed French lunatic talk about how he played hide and seek in his mid-30s. The fact that this won an Oscar is a joke. If I was still President, this type of blasphemy would not be acceptable in society. If this film actually portrayed the walk from tower to tower it would take a maximum of 30 minutes. This however, has been dragged out for 90 minutes and personally I want those 90 minutes of my life back. Thank you for reading my fellow Americans.Your President, Franklin Roosevelt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1974, Philippe Petit does an illegal high wire walk between the twin towers at New York City's World Trade Center. Philippe, his girlfriend Annie, and his friends started working on wire-walks on various monuments. First it's in Paris and then it's the Sydney Habor Bridge. In NYC, they gather new comrades as the gang plans out a scheme to transport the material up to the top which is still under construction. After making the walk, Philippe is arrested. In his arrest record under Details of Complaint, the police had written "Man on Wire".Philippe's french accent is almost hypnotic. He is a man of real drive. It's a relatively simple documentary. The surprising aspect is how much of a caper story the scheme turns out to be. It's better than most fictional capers and Philippe's hyper descriptions are mesmerizing. The pictures of the walk are awesome. There is something beautiful about the whole story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried really hard to get behind this guy and his performance, but I just don't understand why someone would spend so much time and energy on something so pointless. Who did this help? What was he trying to say? Was this anything other than a massive "Look at me!" ego trip? People seem fascinated by this story and I just plain don't get it. There's a dramatization out soon and I don't get that one either. People say "It doesn't have to make sense" or "He did it because he could" or "It's art don't question it." I disagree. I feel that "art" without purpose is ego-stroking nonsense. Petit seemed like a jerk with nothing on his mind but getting people to look at him. I don't feel like supporting his insecurity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not only a fascinating study on how far a person can push the limits of what one could conceive of being humanly possible but it stands also on it's merits as an exciting crime drama.The biographical aspects of this Documentary are sketchy at best and this actually serves to focus the attention squarely where it belongs, upon the truly amazing feat of not only figuring out how to walk across both World Trade Center towers on a wire which were an astonishing quarter of a mile above the ground but to do this under the very noses of one of the most highly guarded building complexes of it's time.The film starts off by putting the viewer at the brink of this wire walking caper then pulls you back to the very beginning of how it was conceived and the very unique individual it would take to obsess on this spectacularly daring feat and train gradually for it over many years.It is not until you are faced as a viewer with the actuality of this mind-blowing wire walk and the insane daring that is demonstrated for over 45 minutes of sheer terror and delight that you will also come to realize that the human mind has many potentials that lay hidden from the normal person and it takes someone of unique focus and training to bring them to the brilliant intensity of fulfilling their unbelievable dreams.When the spectator declares, such 'Beauty' to behold, then you may realize also that Art takes many forms and this is the true eye-opening epic moment of this Documentary which deserves my highest 10 for knocking me out of my complacency for a little while and wondering in astonishment at the many possibilities left uncharted.A very unique Documentary about human potential- don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Twin towers, like hero ? A film review on Man on wireTowers have always been important symbols in myth, film and real life. Babel tower witnessed human's unity turning into chaos. The Two Towers represent something powerful but evil and need to be destroyed in the Lord of the Rings. Back to real life, Eiffel tower is an eternal symbol of love to all. So what does the Twin Towers mean in the film Man on Wire? It is a dream that lures and motivates Philippe to reach, and a place where legend and glory are created. However, such high places like the Twin Towers can be conquered, and such beautiful things like the Twin Towers can be destroyed. Heroes and towers are alike, glorious, lonely, and can even be defeated. But it doesn't matter, because they once stood on the top of the world.The documentary, Man on Wire, tells us a story that happened between the Twin Towers where Philippe made his epic walk. From his early days to his preparations, from his lover to his friends, from the glorious walk to his later deeds, the 90 minute award-winning film give us a chance to witness the whole process of Philippe's legendary life. Unlike the recent adaptation the Walk, which uses advanced visual effect technology that gives the audience heart-beating experience and poetic way of storytelling that makes Philippe a hero with almost no flaws, Man on Wire did a great job as a documentary for its respect for reality and depth of theme. As a documentary, the director uses several unique film technologies in accordance with different scenes. All these details give the audience a sense of how Philippe's great dream turns into reality step by step. The director uses iris shot when Philippe was presenting his show on the street in his early days in most of the past scenes. This gives us a feeling that we are peeping Philippe's performance together with the crowd through the hole of history. At first, you may ignore this special scene, but as it shows again and again, you feel that you actually witnessed the whole process of Philippe's life and growth starting from his early street performing times. You have a sense that you are noticing every detail of the event, and this is foreshadowing the greatness that Philippe will achieve in the future. Furthermore, the director chose to use binocular shot to present the scenes of Philippe's second observation of the twin towers when he came back to America. This telescope-like scene not only coincides with the plot since Philippe observed the tower in more details, but it also reinforces the bond between the character and the audience, since we are actually seeing things from Philippe's perspective. We get to see the character better, and we start to regard Philippe as an embodiment of tower with bright future.These old scenes of the documentary are not as colorful and eye-catching as those magic Hollywood blockbuster or more recent film like the Walk does with the help of technology, and we may say less "Wows" when watching these. However, what we can feel is a sense of the credibility of history and the spirit of the respect to the fact. We not only just can see the things, but we can actually feel the colorful future through the shadow of the black and white. The open themes of the film make this good documentary a great one. One is definitely the success of the pursuit of one's dream. A dream is more valuable when others are constantly mocking it. In the film, the word "impossible" is repeated multiple times. The repetition of this word supports the theme by giving the audience a sense of the difficulty of the work and an expectation to Philippe for overcoming the "impossible". The overcome of the tower is also the overcome of Philippe's own heart regardless of all these disagreements. We can never forget the excitement when Philippe found his dream seeing the news that the Twin Towers was under construction at the age of 17. We can never forget how this magic tower, a symbol in his heart, lures Philippe to break the rules, to build the line, and to walk the air. If you have a dream, pursuit it! If you have a tower, overcome it! One must find one's own tower to overcome!But the theme doesn't just stop here. The ten-minute ending brings about a thought-provoking theme. After Philippe's success, he did not share the happiness with his companions. Instead, he chose to cheat his girlfriend, to abandon all his companions, and to take the honor alone. His friends suffered more severe punishments, and his girlfriend also left him right after the success. All these facts were shown to the audience without reserve or polish. The director doesn't make the judgment, instead, he present the truth to the audience to let them to judge on their own.Can we blame Philippe for doing so? Can we say what makes a hero is his loneliness? Must a hero be without any flaws? I have no answers to these questions at first. But seeing all his friends cried with smile at last when talked about the success when they were old, seeing the old Philippe again walked alone on wire, seeing them forgive about each other and move on, seeing the permanent tickets to the Twin Towers. I figure I have already had the answers in my heart.I don't know if it is related to the reason of making this film, even with such glorious history, great towers like Twin Towers cannot avoid the destiny of being destroyed in 911. Heroes like Philippe can be defeated as well. But it doesn't matter, because they once shined before, they once stood on the top of the world. Because they are like towers, they can reach the cloud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man on Wire is a documentary about Philippe Petit's unauthorized walk on a high wire between the two towers of the World Trade Center on August 7, 1974. The first sentence of my review should be enough to catch your attention--was someone actually crazy enough to high- wire it from one Twin Tower to another? Did this really happen? The answer is yes, and in fact Petit stayed on the wire for 45 minutes and went back and forth eight times.Man on Wire is a testament to humanity's ability to achieve things when sufficiently obsessed. The documentary gives all the background, including Petit's earlier career on a wire in such exotic locales as the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Harbor Bridge in Sydney Australia. The film is something of a thriller, as Petit and his collaborators had to get all of their equipment to the top of the towers, string the wire, and execute the high wire act without authorization. In the act, they are constantly under threat of getting caught by security, and the film has not a little suspense. The act itself is jaw-dropping.Man on Wire is an excellent documentary because it both tells the story in an engaging way while at the same time allowing us to get a feel for the people behind it. Petit is depicted as something of a visionary. The act itself, revealed in the film, is probably the most astonishing daredevil stunt ever achieved by man. The film is great in showing how Petit's utter joy at being on the wire completely trumps any fear that he has of the unbelievable height of the stunt (1300 feet). For anyone who knew and remembers the Towers, the film will also serve as a bit of nostalgia. Most of the story takes place during the Tower's final construction, so there is an element of seeing these great buildings at the time of their birth and enjoying them for the miraculous creations that they were. The real star of the show, however, is Petit, who shows us that anything is possible if it can be imagined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting, and sometimes even exciting, documentary.The story of Frenchman Philippe Petit's daring tightrope-walk between the two towers of the World Trade Centre in 1974. Shows the backstory - him growing up, his previous escapades (including walking between two pylons of the Sydney Harbour Bridge), the planning of the World Trade Centre event, the setup and finally the execution of the event.Quite exciting. Even though he obviously survived (as he was interviewed for the documentary) you do feel all the tension and danger involved in his feat. Being scared of heights only made me even more anxious... All the planning and setup was intriguing too.With the documentary being made several years after 9/11, all the footage of the World Trade Centre is quite nostalgic.On the downside, I couldn't relate to why he would want to do something like that. Being fairly practical and plus risk-averse (plus, as mentioned before, having a fear of heights), I just could not see why did did it, or does what he does as a profession. In the movie, Philippe Petit tries to explain, as best he could, why he does what he does, and his explanation has some merit, but to me he is just taking unnecessary risks.Whatever his motivations, the movie still makes for enthralling viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A miraculous documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the morning of August 7th, 1972, in New York, something occurred that brought shock and exhilaration to the city's inhabitants. Eccentric French acrobat Philippe Petit wire-walked between the two towers of the World Trade Centre, as onlookers watched in awe and the police waited patiently at either side. Not only did he walk between the towers without safety precautions, but he also tip-toed gleefully back and forth, beckoned for the helpless police to come and catch him, and even found time to have a lie down in the process. With Robert Zemeckis's The Walk currently in cinemas, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt starring as Petit, it seemed a perfect time to re-visit James Marsh's miraculous documentary Man on Wire.After encountering Petit on a radio show, what struck director Marsh so much about the story is how the meticulous planning that went into this highly illegal act and the round-up of Petit's assisting crew resembled that of a heist movie. With thrilling reconstructions, cleverly played out with silhouettes and shadows, we witness the intense research that went into making this extremely dangerous stunt feasible and safe, the various undercover operations done in plain sight to gather visual information on the building, and of course, the job itself. At one point, Petit and a colleague hide from wandering security officers under a plastic tarp for what feels like an eternity. Ever wondered how they got the wire over that tremendous drop? Well, now you'll know, and it's probably not how you thought.The central spectacle aside, Man on Wire is very much about Petit himself. Narcissist, egotist, attention-seeker - he is of course all of these things (what great performers aren't?) - but he is also highly intelligent, charismatic, and uses beautiful language when he talks. From a young age, he dreamt of walking in the clouds, and his early life was neatly synchronised with the construction of the World Trade Centre, to which he kept close tabs on over the years. Dazzling crowds with a unicycle and slight of hand tricks, Petit trained for his ultimate goal by walking between towers at Notre Dame Cathedral and Sydney Harbour Bridge. But the World Trade Centre remained an almost mythical entity to Petit, something that was built for him and something he was born to conquer.Anyone who suffers from a fear of heights may perhaps want to avoid the film. While his climactic walk in New York is shown only with still photographs (no video footage was taken from the top), his previous walks are caught in all their vertigo-inducing glory. Yet these stunts aren't designed to terrify, and although they certainly forced my heart into my mouth, they create an almost transcendent sense of wonder. When recollecting the World Trade Centre walk, many of Petit's accomplices break down in tears. This was a truly special thing - a man literally walking in the clouds - and it is something that can never be done again. It's also fitting that the 9/11 attacks are not mentioned in the movie, as this is as a much a love- letter to the memory of the twin towers as it is to the human spirit of Philippe Petit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man On Wire is possibly one of the best known stories of this century, telling about the amazing tightropist who crossed from the Twin Towers. However, it may be too well known, which makes this documentary dwindle in essence, giving us a prolonged account of the tightropist coming to his passion of crazy stunts. But in saying that, for those who don't know the story, this will be an exciting gem to view, giving a superbly directed documentary and some fascinating accounts of the illegal, yet not bad, stunt. Interesting to say the least, but all you want to see is the footage of a man crossing a wire 400 metres above the ground. You will feel terrified at stages, and the way they pulled off this daredevil trick feels like a real Oceans Eleven escapee. In all honesty though, not much is left to the imagination of you know the story beforehand, but still an exciting true story of one of the most feared phobias ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie sure did a great job in coming up with a screen time duration of more than one and a half hours out of this story, which is not really supported with adequate footage. The approach sets the movie way back by telling the background of Phillipe Petit. The thing is, it's strange that the movie consists heavily of interviews and with less dramatization or narration. It makes the movie didn't feel like a movie, but instead more like an expose. Another weird thing to see is that not all the people interviewed has the story-telling instinct as good as Petit himself. His expressiveness brings the whole thing to life, even without enough footage of the feats he's done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living the dream by defying the conventions !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Man on Wire' is a documentary about the famed tightrope walker Philippe Petit's unbelievable feat of walking on a thin wire strung between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. First of all,I have to admire the screenplay. We go back and forth between exploring Philippe's earlier life which deals with why he became so incredibly fascinated by the Twin towers from even before their construction started and the dramatic reconstruction of all the planning and execution it took to materialise this special dream of his with the assistance of his friends. The different transitions from one section of the screenplay to the other is pretty much seamless thanks to James Marsh.A special aspect of the documentary is watching Philippe speak and say everything that he says with an almost childlike joy. You can't help but find the excitement in his voice while he describes his passion, his dreams and his miraculous feat and how he achieved it extremely adorable. All he wanted was to do something by defying all the restrictions in life and truly live his dream and it is inspiring. I also loved everything that his friends lent to the documentary with their own insights especially Jean-Louis, Annie and Jean François. The sheer vastness of the improbability of the whole quest could have easily engulfed them, but they always chose to not let anything stop them from believing that this could be done.Although a major portion of the documentary is made in the style of a heist movie, but it never loses the intimate nature of the subject matter. The scenes of Philippe walking on the wires have a surreal beauty about them which is absolutely awe-inspiring and they have the power to leave the audience speechless. I personally would have wanted Marsh to explore and throw a little more light on Philippe's childhood revolving around how and when he discovered his talent, but having said that, it really is a minor reservation.'Man on Wire' is the kind of documentary that will fascinate you with some awe-inspiring archival footage on one hand, while it inspires you with its special subject matter and a special man on the other. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philippe Petit is a uniquely driven individual. People with this singularity of purpose, this drive, this determination, can be exhilarating to be around when you are on their side and fighting to realise their aims. And it is always their aims - egomania is part and parcel of the personality make up. As someone points out, if Petit had not been the extraordinary showman that he became, he mostly likely would have channeled his explosive energy into more destructive avenues and ended up in prison. Instead, he inspires friends and allies to commit a breathtakingly daring act that continues to inspire awe to this day. The filmmakers are canny enough to realise the man is pure drama, and the story demands attention, and so they let the narrative unfold without drawing attention to camera-work, transitions or effects. Petit is the kind of man you rarely meet, and who you feel privileged to share this kind of project with. But you'd hate to have him as a brother-in-law, or neighbour. An inspiring tale of a remarkable individual and the admiring cadre he gathered to manufacture a stunning achievement. Straightforward, riveting storytelling at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A look at tightrope walker Philippe Petit's daring, but illegal, high-wire routine performed between New York City's World Trade Center's twin towers in 1974, what some consider, "the artistic crime of the century." That description, "artistic crime of the century", is very fitting. While obviously a crime, and obviously dangerous (the fact he lived is a small miracle), it has a certain beauty to it. Indeed, no one really seemed outraged, but rather just wondered why... but as an artist, does there need to be a why? The act itself is all the reason necessary.What makes this great also is that if it was just showing the man on the wire, it would get old relatively quickly. But there is so much background, so much else going on, and this becomes a portrait of a man and not just his impressive feat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like its protagonist, the film Man on Wire is displays extraordinary focus, tautness and passion. Philippe Petit might have a crazy addiction to defying gravity and death but he also has amazing confidence that wire walking is his purpose in life. But he's not stupid. The confidence comes from extreme levels of preparation, a lifetime of experience and the devotion of his support crew. The attempt on the Twin Towers was astonishing in its audacity. It was an outrageous fantasy that Petit and his friends made real with military-style precision and nerves of steel. Petit and friends technically are trespassing and creating a huge public nuisance by shooting a cable between the towers and walking across it. But the film effectively conveys Petit's magical ability to transcend restrictions and dazzle all the onlookers and lawmakers. He is forgiven. Some of the film is re-enacted and some is footage from the past, but I must say the passages when he's walking between the towers are so filled with tension that I covered my eyes with my hands. Even though I know how it ends. I did feel very sorry, however, for the poor cops who wait for Petit as he walks, fearing quite reasonably that any minute he'll fall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think sometimes documentaries struggle with keeping the audiences engaged with uneventful story matter. But Man on Wire is not only an intense hour and a half, but it's actually an interesting storyline with clever uses of prerecorded video. James Marsh, director of the upcoming Theory of Everything, keeps us engaged for the full runtime and on the edge of our seat for something in which we know the ending, now that's difficult to do.We all know from the beginning that this isn't a tragic story of a man falling to his death from hundreds of feet high, but it's a fascinating story of an 'artistic crime' as the DVD cover would describe it. I actually had thought for many years that this was set up and planned as an event and not something that was of criminal activity. But Phillipe Petit and his crew are so passionate about how much this meant to Phillipe and fulfilling his dream. That's one of the many reasons why this film worked. It interviewed almost all of the people involved and you can tell how some 30 years later they are all still so enthralled with what happened that summer day in New York.Of course it helped that Petit had many videos of the process they went through in the early 70's to succeed with this 'crime'. You almost wonder if Petit was hoping someone would make a film about him someday while taking all these pictures and video clips back in the day. But I don't think some of the implemented recreation scenes worked as well as they should have. There is one sex scene towards the end that is completely out of place and could have easily just been described by Petit instead of having two random people act it out. But for the most part, this film is gripping from the beginning till the end. I am looking forward to the 2015 film adaptation of it starring Joseph Gordon Levitt.+Petit's personality +Use of old videos to tell the story +Intense+Amount of passion with everyone involved -Recreation scenes 8.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAN ON WIRE: the story of a french tightrope walker who sought to walk the distance between the rooftops of both World Trace Center towers. And did just that. Take a second to digest what that means. Negotiating a span of 250 feet, atop a building that's 1500 feet high. The tallest building in New York. One thing's for sure: the cojones on this guy can never be questioned. The beauty of this documentary is that it approaches the subject matter just as Philippe Petit did: as a bank heist. Plans were drawn, a team was assembled, and all sorts of clandestine recon was done. But it doesn't really grab your attention until you see those still photos. The heights become real and it hits home just how insane this person is. But he's such a romantic, that it's just amusing. "If I die, what a beautiful death!", he says. It has to be done because they're there. That kind of mischievous spirit cannot be stifled. The downside to this is that there's no film footage of this act; just still photos. As effective as they are, I can only imagine what a movie camera would've caught up there. Still, even with the commentary from those involved, the photos are the most immediately impacting aspect of MAN ON WIRE. It's a pretty good documentary, but a little on the subdued side. But at the very least, this movie brought this story to my attention. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a High-wire Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man on Wire is one of those true stories that, because of the DVD cover and introductory images, you know the ending to. You may find yourself squirming in your seat and feeling your pulse racing as the filmmaker carries us along on the preparations and execution of walking on a wire a quarter of a mile above the New York sidewalk.This particular tale is one narrated by a lead character who possibly achieved the single most awe-inspiring feat in the last 50 years by illegally extending a wire between the twin towers of the World Trade Center during the final phase of its construction in 1974, and tight-rope walking and stunting for 45 minutes during the midday lunch crowd.Philippe Petit was raised without much formal schooling and spent his childhood supporting himself as a juggler, unicyclist, and tightrope walker, and getting detained by the authorities many times for doing public performances without permits. The documentary allows the man to express himself and his desires in broad terms, and it becomes clear that self-challenging feats like earlier wire-walking at Notre Dame Cathedral and the Sydney Harbor Bridge only galvanized the central aesthetic drive of a man who defines himself in the physical feats he thinks up.The pictures of the World Trade Center, many super-8 clips, will bring a sense of loss to those in New York who remember the buildings and what they meant to the local community, and the world at large. That Petit chose the buildings to make his "statement", now in the wake of 911, carries volumes of meaning. This kind of stunt could never be achieved again today given the heightened security accompanying virtually any public place in New York.Adapted and directed by James Marsh from Philippe Petit's book "To Reach The Clouds", the film carries you along by chronologically recounting the sequence of events that led up to the Twin Towers tightrope crossing. Many of the actors in the reenactments look eerily like Petit, and his group of supporters, a feat that lends considerable thrust to the film as many of the men and women who helped Petit in 1974 are interviewed for the film.What becomes evident in the film is Petit's passion, and an unapologetic pride that he managed to circumvent security and do something that will seem to the viewer as an act of an insane man. Petit at one point states that the act of walking a wire between the Twin Towers was "impossible", and that immediately drove him to achieve the feat, and if he possibly had died during it, he would had died a "beautiful" death for attempting it.It may be interesting for many viewers to speculate on what is left for this risk-taker exhibitionist who today seems unchallenged by routine gymnastics and other performance activities. It's clear that the wire walk between the towers of the World Trade Center in 1974 was his crowning achievement, and don't we all wish we could do something as daring in our lives!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great documentary with a delicious directness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great documentary that left me thinking about my own life and dreams. Not only the content and larger-than-life feat performed in the movie are its strong points, but also the directness and authenticity of the interviews with the people involved in the stunt. The strength in this is that it doesn't make the documentary something far-off, distant and unrealistic idealistic, but rather something very close.In my opinion, the scenes should have been rearranged. It would have been better to work chronologically toward one climax instead of flashing back and forward in time. This killed the tension. The whole should more closely reflect the natural accumulation of tension Philippe and his companions experienced when coming closer to their performance, not only making it a climax for Philippe, but for the viewer too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man on Wire focuses on its main character Philippe Petit and what he had achieved in his life. The plot of the film is based on flashbacks between Petit interviews and reenactments, which were performed by someone other than Petit. The clips from the reenactments are in black and white, which gives a powerful meaning to the film. The reenactments are breathtaking as they make the audience wonder, "Will he be able to attempt his walk?" Hence, we see him in the interviews, we now he has survived.On top of that, I still felt waves of shocks going through my veins and body as I watched the reenactments and held on to my chair thinking,'Will he actually do it and survive?' The photographs of Petit showing him walk on wires is something that is very fascinating to the viewers' mind. The director of the film, James Marsh was lucky enough to have access to Petits old photographs because without the addition of the photographs, the film would have not had much of an effect and one could have easily questioned whether any of the events happened. Overall, the point of the film was to capture Petit's passion and show how far he was willing to go for his dreams even if it involved him doing illegal activity.</fullReview>

It's an absolutely amazing movie. I'm someone who hasn't watched many documentaries, but I feel no matter how many I watch from now on none can touch this one. It's amazing, not just in terms of a documentary, in terms of a film. Philippe is such an interesting and entertaining person that really brings you into his world. All the preparations he went through, the stress of pulling something like this off. It is a beautiful movie that nearly brought me to tears by its ending, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who simply wants to see a brilliant work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing feat, amazing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a short review, but I think some of these people giving a low rating to the film are too subjective about it. Sure, Philippe is a bit of a jerk; very self absorbed. Basically after it was all over, he moved on to a new life from those who helped with his WTC wire walk, and never suffered any consequences for their illegal actions while the rest of them did. However, the film is not about making Philippe a likable character, it's about documenting what was and always will be one of the most incredible daredevil acts ever seen.How can anybody deny the excitement? The consensus seems to be too much 'boring' lead up to the actual event, but why is it boring? I was absolutely fascinated with how they were going to do it. I mean, did any of you really think they'd use a bow &amp; arrow to shoot the line across, so they could pull the wire? If you did, it's only because you've read about his story before because nobody in their right mind would think, "Hey- I bet they were able to get that wire between the WTC buildings with a bow &amp; arrow!". Up until the point where they discussed how to get the wire across, I was constantly wondering how they had managed it. I don't know, maybe I'm more easily amazed, but to me the whole thing was fascinating; seeing how different people came in, and some left, some were sceptical, some were downright terrified. I thought it was incredible. Objectivity is the key when reviewing a film, and when looking at it that way I can't see how someone would say this is a bad documentary. I don't necessarily like Philippe's attitude, but most people on earth will never understand his mentality because they will never do anything close to what this man has done in his lifetime, and certainly nothing as dangerous, but I don't have to like him. This is not a popularity contest. This is documenting what happened, and learning about it, hearing what those involved have to say. We're not holding Philippe Petit on trial for being a jerk. All in all, it was fascinating, and I was gripped with absolute fear (I am terrified beyond belief of even small heights) while watching Philippe every moment he was on his wire. I kept trying to imagine what it was like, but all I could imagine was falling, plummeting to the ground below. It's worth noting Philippe has only had one fall in his career, and it was about 45 feet, cracking some ribs on his way down. An amazing specimen. If I graded it on his personality, and how he treated his friends afterwards when the fame hit, I'd probably give it a low rating, but this is not about his personality. I give it a solid 10 out of 10 because I was absolutely enthralled the entire time, and I felt it was absolutely thorough in its scope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious little was golden about the 25 year old Philippe Petit's August 7th, 1974 daredevil tightrope walk between the Twin Towers, 50 years after the death of George Mallory. I recall the day it happened, and for a few weeks afterwards, Petit's name had dwarfed that of the legendary daredevil Evel Knievel's. Then, he was forgotten. But, before the 1993 attacks on the World Trade Center and the 2001 9/11 bombings and destruction of the towers, his 'coup,' as Petit calls it, was easily the most memorable event in the history of the two ugly towers.The film goes in to great detail on how meticulously Petit and his cohorts planned the event, as well as earlier escapades at the Notre Dame Cathedral and a bridge in Sydney, Australia. It charts Petit's obsession with the Towers after reading of their building as a teenager. The film draws a reader n to the main event as well as any 'hesit' or 'caper' film made by Hollywood ever has, and Petit is a fascinating personality, albeit a bit grating. The 94 minute film never makes mention of the events of 9/11 and, on the plus side, this means no restatement of the obvious clichés and bathos. On the negative side- and this is likely the lone negative of this otherwise great film, the film misses a golden showcase for us to get a real 'in' to Petit's psyche, when he is not clearly mugging for the camera. After all, could anyone have had dearer feelings for those buildings than he?Nonetheless, the film succeeds on almost all other levels, from some truly inventive cinematography by Michael Nyman, to exquisitely edited footage and photographs by Jinx Godfrey, to J. Raph's and Michael Nyman's wonderful musical scoring; the highlight of which is Erik Satie's Gymnopaedies, especially #3, so skillfully employed in scenes of Petit's actual walk, making this film the third member of a trilogy of great films deploying this signature piece; the others being Woody Allen's Another Woman and Louis Malle's My Dinner With Andre. The re-enactments and descriptions of the planning- from fake IDs to the wires to faking invoices to hiding for hours on the top floors of the two towers, then waiting to rig the equipment all up, is fascinating, and Marsh nicely intercuts elements of the training in with the re-enactments so that, by film's end, viewers long familiar with the 'coup' will be seeing it with the awe of those people lucky enough to have viewed the actual walk all those decades ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh man, this movie was amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was amazing. I became really heavily invested in the people's relationships. At the beginning when we meet Annie, it is really interesting to see her description of Phillipe. She is clearly very in love with him, and by the end of this movie, I have decided that I really hate Phillipe as a person for how he treated Annie.In the beginning when they first start dating, he pursues her intensely and they get together, but she just kind of is roped into his dream. She doesn't even really know him that well before they start dating, and she says in the movie, that he never really asked her if she had any dreams that she wanted to follow. In the end, she is forced to follow his dream to keep her relationship with him alive. Later on in the film they reveal that she is only invited to go to NY once, after Phillipe fails the first time and he needs moral support. It is mentioned in the film that she threatened him, insulted him, cried at him, and begged him for permission to go to NY and he never said it was okay for her to come, until HE has some sort of problem.Annie's entire person really makes me sad. It is heartbreaking how supportive she was of him, and how easily he cast her aside for some groupie's pussy. Annie said it was exhausting for her to constantly try and figure out what was going on in his head. A lot of what happened was unfair to Annie because she was more of a mother figure to Phillipe than anything else. This is not the role of a girlfriend.This movie, while a beautiful and haunting image, is actually kind of a sad story about an egomaniac Frenchman who does completes a dangerous stunt. In the process, he loses 2 significant relationships, but he does do the thing he set out to do, cross the Twin towers.Ultimately this movie was a joy to watch, I just wish that it had ended better for Jean Luis and Annie.</fullReview>

A man walking on the wire of his dreams and rightfully achieving it after many ups and downs. There are also interesting elements in the friendship as well. The honest details and feelings provided by Philippe Petit all along the documentary are truly inspiring. From the moment he acquires the dream to the moment of developing the idea, the work behind the achievement of the whole dream.

		<shortDescription>Man on Wire - 4.5 Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I look at the movie's poster and instantly notice a man whose life is dependent upon that thin, almost invisible wire. That man is Philippe Petit, and on August 7, 1974, he was arrested for trespassing. More specifically, he walked, knelt, and danced on a wire he and his friends connected between the Twin Towers. I have a curiosity for extraordinary human feats and a phobia for heights, and the sight of Mr. Petit on that wire was one of the most beautiful and freighting things I have ever seen.I think that it's obvious that he succeeded since you cannot arrest a dead man. We all know that what he did was truly remarkable but what confounds many is his reason in doing it. Before I saw "Man on Wire", I stared at the poster, wondering what type of individual would do this, to risk a life so much that a wrong step could end it. Crazy was the word I thought of that would describe it the best, and then I watched the movie."Man on Wire" is the movie where Philippe Petit, accompanied by great direction from James Marsh, explains the events and the ambitions that ultimately led to that memorable day. Early on, we learn that Philippe wanted to "conquer" those Towers when he was still very young. During my childhood, I went from wanting to become a doctor, to a herpetologist, to an actor. Now, I'm reviewing movies. Philippe stuck with his dream, convinced that it was even his destiny. He grew older and became more enthusiastic and optimistic with his goal, which is quite extreme since it was very much illegal and not even constructed yet at the time.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/man-on-wire-movie-review/</fullReview>

The documentary has a very carefully structured pace, and it has a lot of photos and a lot of newly made reenactments that really make you understand more and more about it. It;s not just the act itself, or what it means to every person. the power in a documentary like this is how much it really means to the person doing it, just like the other day when I watched a documentary on orchids. It's not the actual orchids, it's the passion that the people in love with them have, and why it means so much to them. That's why this one works well</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man on Wire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From UK director James Marsh, this Academy award BEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE winner is a distinguishing of its own kind, it marvelously mends the interview with a re-enactment of the electrifying tightrope routine performed in World Trade Centre's twin towers in 1974 which was exerted illegally by French daredevil Philippe Petit and his team. So differ from other fly-on-the- wall documentaries, this allow Marsh to show off some intricate camera work to polish the film, the patchwork of authentic archives and the man-made acting montages is outstanding and infuses the audience with an experience of witnessing a live-action feature. Also the timing of the film is apropos, the melancholic memories of two towers could be intrigued feasibly, especially among Americans and those who have been there, which I assume is partly contributed to the film's triumph in the academy. But for me, although I have steeped into all the tension and frisson which tightrope walking (I have acrophobia) and the illegal bravura effectively conducted, I have a hunch that there is a big loophole concealed inside, which hampers the film to quench my thirst.The real reason behind Philippe's break-up with his best friend Jean François Heckel and his lover Annie Allix, which I believe has been intentionally eluded (an occasional sex affair with a groupie cannot be the whole story), which would penetrate into a more private world of those people, and could be the most evocative part, but unfortunately Marsh is not bold enough (or more plausibly Petit and his co-workers don't intend to unveil their ugly side of the story, for instance, if someone I do truly love wants to do this kind of suicide-like stunt, I swear I will never assist this behaviour because the selfish side of love will stymie me), nevertheless it is the most compelling and probably the most meaningful fodder beside all the pompous adventurers' antics. After my afterthought is that Marsh has failed to lift this film into a deeply affecting once-in-a-lifetime chef-d'oeuvre although he and Philippe have the lucky straw.The sad core tune near the beginning (from the composer Michael Nyman) gives a sentimental nostalgia and has an unparalleled echo with the ending, when the present Philippe doing his routine on the tightrope in the garden alone by himself, poignantly pointing out that maybe the perilous height will not kill him but the desolate egotism will eventually get this luckiest man- on-the-wire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no denying Philippe Petit is an astounding high-wire performer. He put together a team that ultimately succeeded on a grand scale. In the film, Petit is glorified as an idealistic artist driven to pursue his dream. Yet, all you need to know about the man is the first thing he did after getting out of jail was cheat on his childhood sweetheart girlfriend, the one person who supported his dream and stood by his side for years leading up to the WTC stunt. It was always all about Philippe.The film was enjoyable but left some loose ends. Mainly, how did he come to be involved with the individuals in his NY crew? They sort of appear out of nowhere with nothing that ties them into the circle of trust. Much footage is re-enactments, so many scenes are merely dramatic interpretations and not the real thing as would be expected in a faithful documentary. Overall, though, it's a well-done film. It's tough to imagine anyone pulling off a similar stunt in this age of surveillance and suspicion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man On Wire is the compelling story of Philippe Petit's high wire crossing of New York's World Trade Center in 1974. This was well before the 911 attack which, of course, took down the buildings. The times have changed drastically and not for the better.Petite had earlier walked the towers at Notre Dame in Paris and the Sydney Barbour Bridge in Australia. His reputation as a daredevil was already well known. One day he spotted the Twin Towers in a magazine and was inspired to conquer them the same way a mountain climber seeks to climb Mount Everest.The planning by Petit is funny and entertaining at the same time. The logistics of getting a 200 foot steel cable from one building to the other are amazing. He is so easy going and likable that it is almost impossible not to love this guy and his accomplishments. Man on Wire is easily one of the best documentaries ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How far would you go for your passion?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people has dreams, but some can be more odd than others. In this case it's about a man that dreams of tight rope walking on top of the New York Twin Towers before 9/11. And it's shot as a documentary but goes in a direction like some heist movie, except it really isn't a heist. But a man's dream of overcoming a obstacle that he dreamed for years even if it risks his freedom and can lead to death. Yeah it's a odd movie but it's also character driven and by the end you can't help but want the guy to succeed. I didn't really expect there would be a good movie about a man and his dream of tightrope walking but this one is it, and it works. It was awesome to watch Philippe Petit do daring stunts that are against the law but isn't wicked or mean in any way. Which made me root for this team that supports Philippe even more. The movie shows Philippe's past stunts as well and going through the plan for his biggest obstacle. For Philippe "to die...In the exercise of your passion." is a death that is worthy. A man's passion can drive a person into risking everything for it and this movie clearly shows it. It's a good thing when a person a passionate for at least something, cause if your not passionate about anything...It's a pointless life. If this movie is showing a heist, it is indeed a artistic and beautiful heist. The editing in this is done very well and is done in a way where it builds tension and develops in a way you want to know what is going to happen next. Overall it's a great documentary that is thrilling and entertaining most of the way through.8/10</fullReview>

I have a great fear of heights (no duh), the older I get (52 now)the worse it gets. My own mortality and the inevitable idea of death gets nearer and nearer. (It was quite different when I was in my teens and early twenties. I was indestructible. Right). I try and try to put myself in his shoes but I can't quite get there. Just the thought of looking straight down almost 1400 feet makes me woozy. I feel my legs turning to spaghetti and my brain to blubber. And he danced!!! And he laid down!!! And he did this for 30 minutes or so, eluding the grasp of "peace officers" who had their brains in their arses. I mean, how could you see someone do this thing and not be awed into silence? And all they wanted to do was arrest him. Cop mentality. Broaden out big guys.Anyway, I watched it again and again trying as hard as I might to put myself in Petit's shoes (ballet slippers), but I just couldn't do it. My brain overloaded and fizzled out. I could to say a lot more but, truth to tell, most of it has already been said. Nobody on planet Earth will EVER do what he did. And wonder of wonders, he made it.

		<fullReview>It's not often that I watch a film and have an intense, visceral dislike for all the people involved, but find what the final product to be so utterly captivating. To certain regions of my brain, Philippe Petit is an attention-seeking clown. He's a circus-performer who specifically searches for high-profile stunts in order to promote himself and become famous. When he talks about his "art" or his "dreams", or uses any of the other lofty language he so freely throws about during this documentary, I want to wretch. And his assistants are even worse, especially Annie, who praises this carny as though he were, quite possibly, the second coming of Jesus.But then, there's the actual event. It's mesmerizing. Inspiring. Terrifying. The lengths to which these people went, just to perform a stunt that, in their own words, didn't mean anything. Risking arrest and certainly staring death in the face, all in the pursuit of something that, to them (and eventually to me) was beautiful. An amazing documentary that has to be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing and well-told tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2001 destruction of the World Trade Towers raises the resonance level of this stunning tale. The short version is in 1974 a French acrobat, Philippe Petit, without permission and only moderate inside helped was able to string and walk a wire across the 200 foot span between the corners of the two trade towers. The longer version which makes up this documentary is the suspenseful (pun intended) tale of the small team Philippe assembles to painstakingly plan the attempt. The initial part of the movie is standard documentary covering the plotters and their relationships as they begin to work through the myriad of complications. The film transcends the standard fare in the middle third when Philippe and his team find a local New York accomplice and we begin to see rooftop photos of the lost towers with Philippe hanging precariously over the side. The suspense continues to build as the plan's pieces fall into place with the addition of more help and the solving of major hurdles such as how to string a line between the towers at night without getting caught. The side stories are fascinating as well told in interviews with World Trade Center officials who inadvertently contributed to the plan by being duped by the plotters. The excitement builds to such an extent that the actual moment when Petit steps out onto the wire is actually somewhat emotional for the viewer. An even less compelling production would still be worth watching for the history and the irreproducible accomplish so the fact that the production is so well done is really a bonus. Go see it! (but don't bring the kids as there is a graphic sex scene near the end of the movie.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engaging and quite thrilling documentary that has been over-hyped but is still very enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps helped by the loss of the towers themselves, this film had great success when it was released - not just with receipts but of course with awards - the Oscar for best documentary being the main one. I finally got round to seeing it a year after this and I was quite looking forward to it as a result of having heard so much about it and of course the sheer chutzpah of the "stunt" itself. The main challenges to the telling of this story are to do with the fact that, from the poster, we already know that Philippe Petit achieved his goal of walking out between the two towers, the second challenge being that, without much in the way of footage of this event, we could be ending the film just as well informed as we were at the start - bear in mind we're in a generation where "video or it never happened" is a popular phrase.This is a challenge the film overcomes by mostly keeping the tone light and structuring itself in the form of a crime caper, with the "big score" being the wire walk itself. The preceding stunts in Paris and in Australia are both well used to introduce us to the characters while the "main event" is always there in the background as the ultimate aim. This mostly works because there is a rather breathless passion to it with most of the contributors being lively and engaging - not least of which is Petit himself. This introductory approach gives way to a description of the "job" itself which does play out as a thriller the best it can, with failure only ever a heart-beat away, security guards sniffing around and of course the sheer risks of being unprotected on a tightrope at that height. This aspect works as well as the first approach and it does make for engaging viewing.The lack of significant video footage and the heavy reliance on dramatisations do hurt the film a little bit. The dramatisations are a necessary evil because of course it is not like the makers could even take Petit back to the location of the stunt to discuss it, but, necessary as they are, they are a hard thing to pull off, particularly if you are relying on them as heavily as you are in this film. This puts a lot of weight on the contributors, which fortunately they are mostly able to carry although for some viewers this may not be the case. Petit is the best example, for the most part he is passionate and fun but, as the film suggests the events and the fame change him (but doesn't explore this much, probably to keep the tone light) then you look at him in a slightly different light, perhaps one where he is not as light as he appears and is touched with his own self-importance. This makes him less effective since the film is built on him as a character as much as it is on the wire walk - this happened for me very late in the film and, even then, only to a point, but I can see why he for some viewers he would rub them the wrong way from the very start, essentially killing the film from the get-go.For me though it worked. The energy and the passion is the foundation and the 90 minute run-time is just about the length that this can work over. The structure of the film as a sort of light crime thriller helps it and the dramatisations are effective even if they are not always welcome as a tool. I can understand why the darker character aspects of Petit or, more significantly, the destruction of the towers in 11/9/2001 were not explored (the light tone would have made it too big a shift) but one cannot help seeing those elephants in the room all the more as they are not mentioned. Despite this though, an engaging and quite thrilling little documentary that has been over-hyped but is still very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The subject of this acclaimed documentary is French acrobat Philippe Petit and his audacious crossing of the chasm between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City on a tightrope on August 7, 1974. While it may seem like a contradiction in terms, but indeed "Man on Wire" is really a documentary that was executed with much suspense, so that the audience is fully in its grip to the very end. It fully deserves the awards it has earned last year from Sundance, all the way to the Oscar last February.An amazing aspect was this project was the apparently complete video documentation of most of Philippe's early days in Paris with his girlfriend Annie and best pal Jean Louie, and how they supported Philippe's seemingly crazy quest. They were able to gather everyone who was involved in the big stunt to talk about their role in that event. It was really great to see all the protagonists as young people and how they look like now.Philippe recounted his inspiration to cross the towers, allegedly even while the towers was still a plan on paper. The film was able to show breathtaking footage of his previous daring tightrope crossings at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Harbour Bridge in Sydney. The planning process details regarding the WTC crossing were also very fascinatingly recounted.The director was correctly ingenious when he decided to treat the run-up to the actual crossing like a criminal caper. Being a decidedly illegal act, Philippe and cohorts had to resort to to covert reconnaissance, fake ids and alibis, as well as sneaking and hiding around in the dead of night avoiding guards the very night before the big event.They also frankly dealt with the aftermath of the stunt -- how the resulting heavy media publicity affected Philippe and his relationships with his friends. The inconclusive and unclear manner of the interviewees' statements at this point certainly added much to the drama of that moment.******* spoiler warning ******** My one complaint about the film is that the highlight crossing of the towers did NOT actually have a video footage. After all of the heightened tension, we do not actually see the crossing as it happened that day. This supposedly main event was only told in the form of witness accounts and telescopic photographs. This, I felt, was a letdown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On August 7, 1974, Frenchman Philippe Petit decided "hell, you only live once," and strung a cable between the two towers of the World Trade Centre in New York City. He then proceeded to walk from one tower to the other, back and forth eight times, doing tricks along the way. 'Man on Wire (2008)' interviews those involved in Petit's audacious high-wire stunt, blending together testimonies, archival footage and re-enactments into a narrative structure that more closely resembles a heist film than a documentary. Months of preparation took place in France and New York, in which every detail had to be predetermined: how would they dodge security? How would they get a 200kg cable and other bulky equipment to the top of the towers? How would they string a cable across the 60-metre abyss?The story is itself so enthralling, and the illegal stunt so daring, that 'Man on Wire' sweeps you along for 90 minutes, and only afterwards do you realise that the tightrope-walk itself is depicted only by still photographs (apparently the intended cameraman was too exhausted to remember to film, leaving director James Marsh with no choice but to emanate Chris Marker's 'La Jetee (1962)'). Alas, I think the film, which won the Oscar for best feature documentary, did so mostly on the merits of its story, which itself received an emotional boost from the events of September 11, 2001. Marsh's approach is, for the most part, pedestrian, and the dramatised re-enactments tend to cheapen the film. Why not just let the force of the participants' words keep us interested?</fullReview>

Worthy of its Academy Award-winning glory, Man on Wire will leave you at the edge of your seat, and wanting more. What's beautiful about this film is that it weaves back and forth through re-enactment footage to modern-day interviews with ease. Unlike most documentaries that use re-enactment footage, the editor of this film made certain the footage didn't seem cheesy or forced. Instead, the editor gave a stylistic twist unlike any re-enactment footage I've ever seen in a documentary before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The eccentricity of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentary are often a tricky thing to put into cinemas with them either trying to send an important message or simply a labour of love. Man on Wire is an example of the latter.Man on Wire tells the story of Philippe Petit who committed the 'artistic crime of the century'. He was the man who formed and walked a tightrope between the North and South Towers of the Word Trade Center. The film tells the story of how Petit comes up with the idea and the preparations for the walk and of course a little be about his background.This is a very interest, compelling film that has many ideas to keep the audience's attention. There is character drama about why they did this act, the clandestine operation their had to undertake, the preparations the group had to do, the engineering side their had to do and previous tightrope attempts. The film is filled with artistic people, with Petit being a very eccentric character. This film tells a simple but important story; what ever you dream is you must find a way to fulfil it.James Marsh shows himself to be a very competent director, mixing interviews, stock footage, photographs and re-enactments. He crafts and edit's a good film and early on in the film criss-crossing between the events of the walk with Petit's early life. Marsh has a good eye for images, picking the ones he wanted to use and had a excellent ear for music. He allows Petit to be is eccentric self, whilst the other people who were involved were a lot more down-the-Earth.A very worthy documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a thrilling documentary that holds your interest from start to finish. The story has an extra layer now because of the collapse of the twin towers of the World Trade Center. The real tale here, though, is the courage and daring of the high-ware act itself. It's tremendously entertaining to follow all the details of how the act is brought off. (Sorry for being vague, but I'm trying to avoid spoilers.) Technically, the film is extremely well-done, and the editing is particularly fine. I've talked to hundreds of people now who have seen this at different festivals, and everyone has agreed that it's a great movie. It's also one of those rare documentaries that should be seen on a big screen if at all possible, to get the full sense of the daring of the high-wire act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wistful dramatic art pic that made me giddy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have to admit i was completely intrigued by this documentary on phillipe petit, wire walker extraordinare, before i even watched it. id seen it advertised and like a good horror movie i was attracted to it because it looked like it might disturb me. i wasn't wrong. The docu is the story of Petits' infamous wire walk of New Yorks' twin towers in 1974, and pic is narrated by Petit himself. One can view Petit one of two ways - is he a man who would stop at nothing in order to pursue his dreams? Or was he a single minded selfish egoist quite willing to use and discard people in order to get what he wanted? well to be honest, hes a bit of both. undoubtedly enigmatic with a mysterious aura surrounding him, we never get to see the real person... or what motivated him to do what he did (he also wire walked Sydney's harbour bridge and the Notre Dame Cathedral), instead we get interviews with Petit and his crew, former girlfriend and re-enactments of Petits' planning of his mega stunt. these re-enactments are cleverly spliced together with footage (though none of the towers walk actually exist) culminating at the end with clips of the day the dramatic stunt was carried out. Directed by British Director James Marsh, the movie has a wistful, romantic arty feel to it; one cant help but feel it depicts an event, as one of the policemen comments, that he'd 'never seen before or since' the title of the movie, by the way, comes from what was written on Petits' charge sheet, despite no charges being brought against him. An yes, if your afraid of heights like i am, when Petit lies down on the wire, you may feel a little faint. I did! David Ford</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk the line...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if dramatised documentaries like this, which you'd more likely catch on TV's Discovery Channel, really qualify as films, but like another recent outstanding example of this ilk "Touching the Void", I can only say I'd certainly pay to go into a cinema and watch, if they're as enthralling as those two. Philippe Petit's dream to walk a tightrope between the Twin Towers of The World Trade Centre of course takes on even more interest and pathos given the tragic events of 09/11 but this film as well as celebrating the out-there spirit of an amazing individual also stands as a tribute to the iconic construction of the building itself, a feat scarcely less believable than Petit's.In fact the film is just as much about the means by which Petit and his team breach the WTC security to set up the walk, an amazing true-life caper in itself. The movie naturally cannot recreate any of those scenes today on-site and makes use of smaller interior sets combined with actual video and photo records taken by Petit's entourage to take you into the scenes as they occurred. I think it was a good decision not to play up the subsequent events at the WTC or to take Petit back to Ground Zero - that story is not his and indeed, if played would have worked to the denigration of this celebratory piece.Okay, perhaps Philippe himself is guilty a little of trippy exaggeration when recalling his own memories and motivations but you only have to see him straddling the Twin Towers (he walked across 8 times, turning around and sitting down on the way!) to excuse his hyperbole when you see the footage of him doing his stuff, although it's ironic that no video footage was taken of the walk itself.What we do get though are beautiful, breathtaking, certainly iconic black and white photographs of the event, as it happened. Two moments from the film stayed with me in particular, firstly the realisation that the Towers were not directly opposite each other and that his walk required to be diagonally point-to-point and not straight across, which would surely have been easier for him; the second, the incredibly eerie and moving (in retrospect) picture of Petit on the wire with an aeroplane immediately behind him in the New York sky.A totally fascinating piece and a story I'm so glad I now know about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A show-off or egoist risks their life and gets away with it. Their achievement may be spectacular but also selfish. I love the beauty of mountains (and the sense of achievement that comes from conquering them), and so I'm very interested in the psychology of mountaineering. But (for example) B.A.S.E. jumping, parachuting from very low heights, strikes me as plain stupid. This film is a documentary about a man who, in 1974, walked on a wire between the roofs of the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York. Especially as the stunt was a success, you might think it would make for a dull story - of course, what he did was amazing, but the best mountaineering books are usually about missions that went wrong, stories which raise the question of why they were attempted at all, rather than straightforward tales of triumph. What makes 'Man on Wire' captivating, however, is the idealism of its protagonist, Phillipe Petit. Speaking about his achievements today (and in his eyes in archive home movie footage), you can see how he wholly believed in his actions, in aesthetic terms and also as part of his philosophy of life - by the end of this film, you are convinced that to call his action a stunt is to diminish it, although the ending suggests his relationships with those who helped him accomplish it were fatally damaged by his consequent elevation to celebrity. Those accomplices deserve their role in the film, however, as arranging the walk (without official approval) required elaborate preparation and cunning of the sort which, if you saw it in a bank heist movie, you would consider preposterous. This is a great film, the participants tell of their roles and convey their own (different, but essentially likable) characters; and there's a judicious mixture of cine film, still photographs and reconstruction to illustrate the tale. And even though you know the end before the film even starts, when Phillipe takes his first step on the wire, you can't help but hold your breath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting documentary about a man with a dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest parts of this movie to me was when Philippe Petit, the man who walked on a wire between New York's Twin towers, says that when asked why he did this feat, he answered simply "there is no why." This really seemed beautiful to me that a man would devote his life to something just for the sake of doing it. The film takes us back to a time when Petit was at the dentist, at age 11, and saw a picture of the Twin Towers being built in a newspaper. He recounts to us how he just ran out the dentist's and into the street, in complete bliss. A friend says in an interview that these towers were built for him to walk between, and Petit apparently felt the same way, with the rest of his life from that point on devoted to his dream.I must admit that I saw the film after it one the best Documentary Feature Oscar at the Academy Awards. It won this and any awards it won deservingly. The film jumps fluidly back and forth in time, using interviews, reconstructed footage of Petit's early life and preparation for the event, and actual footage of the event itself seamlessly. Everything fits together and feels very real. I won't say that this is the best movie I've seen, for parts of it tend to drag, but once you see the "man on wire" in action, you are held breathless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambrose Bierce would say "WTF" on this WTC ostrich act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, Ambrose, I gave this insult to America a "9" rating out of 10 on its film merits, just as the Robert E. Lee of our time--Adolph Hitler, German warmonger who instigated the deaths of 100 million--is glorified in director Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 documentary TRIUMPH DES WILLENS (TRIUMPH OF THE WILL), which has an average rating of 7.9 today from 4,560 IMDb voters. The fact that the title "Triumph of the Will" already was "taken" probably is the reason MAN ON WIRE director James Marsh did not tack it on to his flick as an apt subtitle. Wire-walker Philippe Petit's dogged determination to attack New York City's World Trade Center security went unmatched until Egyptian suicide airship attack leader Mohamed Atta. On the message board for MAN ON WIRE, one thread puzzles over why Marsh does not mention 9-11-2001. The reason is clear. This craven coward and others of his ilk had 27 years to help hype the sociopath egomaniac Petit to their heart's content--but did not do so, because only four or five people would have paid to see such blather. Because of 9-11, Marsh got the financing to film from the same sort who back NASCAR knowing people will turn out to see their heroes like Dale Earnhardt possibly fry in a fiery automobile crash. Marsh simply lacks the added chutzpah to add insult to injury by in any way acknowledging 9-11 (2,000+ Americans dead within 90 minutes when two air vehicles loaded with fuel were crashed into the tops of the two tall buildings Petit exploited first). As you once said, Ambrose, "mayonnaise is one of the sauces which serve the French in place of a state religion," and the Oscar voters smeared their faces with gobs of this white excrement when they gave Marsh the trophy denied to Ms. Riefenstahl.TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: The body of noted American author (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge) Ambrose Bierce, born June 24, 1842, recently was discovered in total cryogenic hibernation at the back of a Central American warehouse. Bierce is expected to be fully defrosted by late 2049 or early 2050. Based on my 85 previously posted IMDb comments and background in Bierce studies, the author's guardians have commissioned me to review a periodically updated list of films to help guide his future leisure pursuits, with the provision that my comments also be made available to the general public.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was suspended in dare by the Academy Award winning documentary "Man On Wire". The doc focuses on tightrope walker Philippe Petit's daring wire walk in between both of The World Trade Center towers back in 1974. Yes, this really happened! Petit is a vivacious French acrobat whose passionate spirit for the impossible resonates on his multi-cultural entourage which helped him tackle this towering worldly tightrope achievement. "Man On Wire" interviews most of the players involved in the illegal stunt coordination and even shows actual footage of the planning process. Petit especially is given more of the screen time, and why not; he is the one that was hanging on the most for the entire project. Director James Marsh marches the "Man on Wire" with profound insights on the varying emotions of all the players involved, and not to mention the nostalgic &amp; glorious footage of the early days of the twin towers. Petit's historical World Trade Center wire walk could have been told in an hour instead of the 90 minute running time which made this "yours truly" man tired; but then again the anticipation factor of waiting to see Petit walking the wire in between the towers was of heightened aspiration. Do not get high anxiety and walk the line to the "Man On Wire". **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Man on Wire" does many things with aplomb, but its best component has to be the music that penetrates through the soundtrack at the sight of Phillippe Petit dancing on a tightrope. The movie saves the piece of mood music, Ralph Vaughan Williams' The Lark Ascending, for the moment this meticulously crafted heist thriller has been building up to right from the first frame - the shots of Frenchman Petit illegally crossing a tightrope fixed between, and at the very top, of the World Trade Center's towers. It is the perfect companion piece to this wondrous sight. Soft, languid, lyrical in rhythm, sparse and hypnotic in harmony, it matches the graceful poise of this man on wire. To have been a spectator that day in the summer of 1974 I imagine would have given one a taste of a great vision, and a great folly. A police officer who witnessed the walk admits he struggled to follow his job instructions - he could have tried harder to constrict the crime but was so naturally in awe he wanted to just stand back and absorb the kind of image that probably occurs once in a lifetime.Read the full review at my personal website: http://www.sightforallseasons.co.nr/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing footage of the towers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the awful events of September the 11th 2001 i knew very little about the World Trade Centre in New York apart from seeing them many times amidst the New York skyline on TV or in magazines. Ever since those mighty towers amazingly collapsed so easily i have been fascinated with everything about them and although Man on Wire is not specifically about the towers themselves it gives great insight into the building and running of the towers which includes some amazing old footage. On August 7th 1974, a young Frenchman called Philippe Petit stepped out on a wire suspended between New York's twin towers, then the world's tallest buildings. After an hour dancing on the wire, with no safety net or harness, he was arrested and thrown into an underground prison. Until that moment no one but Petit and his team of accomplices, who had spent months planning their illegal 'coup' (as they referred to it amongst themselves) knew anything about it. Born out of a dream and an idea, Petit and his team of accomplices spent eight months planning the execution of their 'coup' in the most intricate detail. Like a team of professional bank robbers planning their most ambitious heist, the tasks they faced seemed virtually insurmountable: they would have to find a way to bypass the WTC's security; to smuggle the wire and rigging equipment into the towers; to suspend the wire between the two towers; to secure the wire at the correct tension to withstand the winds and the swaying of the buildings; to rig it secretly by night ? all without being caught. Not to mention the walk itself?I think what makes this Documentary so watchable is the way Director James Marsh combines original footage with some reconstruction . A combination that usually puts me off watching documentaries but combined with some superb atmospheric music ,great interviews and a gripping story this really works.Some of the footage of Philippe Petit as a young man is amazing.The enthusiasm he shows when practising the rope walking man shines through and even now as a 59 year old man that enthusiasm remains. When he tells the story his eyes light up and you can see he is a proud man when recalling his big achievement in life. I should imagine that at the time , he would have been a difficult man to work with and that is shown at times when friends and colleagues talk emotionally about fall outs that they had with him.Despite the enormity of what he did i never felt that he was in any danger walking between those towers. After all he was a expert in his field and everything he seemed to do came so naturally. At one stage Petit Says "If I die, what a beautiful death! " but i don't believe he ever thought that was going to happen.Because i never sensed that he was in any danger the walk played second fiddle to the film footage of the towers themselves . There are some amazing scenes where the construction workers are moving and fixing the girders and steel structures in place on the south tower, the very same lumps of steel that we saw as a tangled mess on the afternoon of September the 11th.I'm always in two minds as to whether a documentary like this can be classed as a movie so I'm always reluctant to review them . Man on Wire is entertaining but is it worthy of winning an Oscar as it did last month? Or should "Best Documentary" even be a category?I'm not so sure. 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As human beings we are culturally different, divided by social norms, religion, politics and ethnic backgrounds. But when a person steps out of our, what many may call "normal", mind-set and does something extraordinary, whether it's breaking a world-record in some ordinary sport, or performing something artistically beautiful for people to be inspired and captured, or revolutionizing a society's system to ease humanity's inevitable problems, we are almost in debt to awe at this person. Philippe Petit was born in France and had a fantastic interest in wire-walking, sitting in the waiting room of a dentist's office he came over an article on the building-plans of World Trade Center. From that moment, Petit got a vision; defying gravity by wire-walking between one tower to another. His mind was so set on pulling off this almost impossible task that for every single day up to the event, he had a constant determination.MAN ON WIRE is a brilliant documentary that cross-cuts between detailed planning notes, interesting and personal interviews, rare real footage shots/photos and elegant reenacts full of intensity and smarts. It's uniquely atmospheric and tells a profound story about a very unique man, and how he defeated his opponent in life. All the spectacular, exhilarating and fascinating aspects of it can make you talk about it for days, but it's in the final chord director James Marsh does something brilliant; it leaves a strange, bad taste - the narcissism of Petit makes for mixed emotions, and the sadness of his partner Jean-Louis is overwhelming, and the echoes of 9/11. MAN ON WIRE deserved it's Best Documentary Academy Award and is a beautiful story full of human magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent demonstration of the power of the human spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a start I can't get my head around the fact that a man actually walked on a high wire between the twin towers!Petit is unique. This is obvious from his present day interviews in this film and the 1970's footage. He obviously has no rational fear in a way most people would understand it. Otherwise how could he contemplate walking between the towers of Notre Dame or the Sydney Harbour bridge, never mind the World Trade Centre?The film works on a number of levels. It shows us the unique way that Petit thinks and sees the world. It lets us see the relationships he had with people who were close to him and helped him "do" the Twin Towers. Through interviews and reconstructions it shows how he and his team actually went about the practicalities of getting him on the wire. All these stories are fascinating in themselves. How he got to the top of the buildings with a crew containing self confessed flakes is amazing!Especially touching is the way it is made clear that Petit's life and the lives of those who were close to him were never the same the minute he stepped off the wire. His "encounter" with a groupie after his release shows this nicely.Anyone who believes in the power of the human spirit will want to watch this film again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring and captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentaries have always been most closely linked with investigative journalism, in seeking truth through the lens of a camera. "Man on Wire" seeks a greater a truth by telling a story so miraculous yet so simple that the mind is captivated by it. The sheer will of French tightrope walker Philippe Petit to walk the Twin Towers in 1974 is a feat that awakens the possibilities in all of us.Filmmaker James Marsh has found not only a thrilling subject for a documentary, but a terrific character to focus on. The language and story-telling ability of Petit (in a second language, no less) is fantastic. He is vivid in his word choices and provides these great almost literary details that Marsh is able to use to film some excellent recreations of the event, specifically Petit and his crew sneaking into the World Trade Center.Petit has such great perspective on himself and his actions and desires. He speaks of knowing dreams before they were even realities, of the line between the possible and impossible. He decorates this story in ways most outsiders might not think about it. Through his insights, the amazement of his work shines through.The life and death and the thrill of the tightrope walk scares us but intrigues us and the effect was hundred-fold for Petit. There were no questions of feasibility, only try and try harder, and it's impressive that he inspired so many of his friends and other strangers to get behind him regardless the risks.This was a crime of passion, not in the sense that he passionately committed crime, but that his passion happened to be a crime. Petit shows us that art and achieving a moment of greatness has more authority than the laws of society. Few will ever compare the highs of their lifetime to the highs (both literal and figurative) of Philippe Petit's. "Man on Wire" is a celebration of the human spirit and the power of dreams, insisting that true happiness is found from within. The story here really tells itself and Marsh just glues all this old footage, re-creations and interviews together to make it happen. Petit is fascinating and his story will make you think differently in at least one way</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dancing on a Wire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You think that documentaries are boring? You should see this MAN ON WIRE!! Philippe Petit, a Frenchman high-wire walker, unknown to most people, one misty summer morning in 1974 walked across the twin towers on a high-wire. A superb, unimaginable feat that took him months of secret preparations to accomplish and landed him in prison - outstanding feats always seem to provoke the small-minded. The British documentary film-maker James Marsh, after a long but always as exciting, introduction on Petit's previous feats (walking on a high-wire across Notre Dame Casthedral in Paris and later on Sidney's Harbor Bridge in Australia), relates Petit's twin towers feat like a "Rififi" type of thriller, presenting in detail all the aspects of the preparation and editing his material tightly, with a rhythm that catches your breath. Here is a suspenseful, some times humorous, drama that at the same time moves you to the point of crying. What the film is finally about is that of a courageous man who, against all logic, walks up and down on a wire, high up in the sky, sitting and relaxing in-between, almost dancing, like a Fred Astaire of the skies, for more than 45 minutes, challenging man, nature and the whole universe, making you feel that you can do anything you want as long as you really believe in it! But what is still more exciting is the beauty of it all, of those wonderful images of that man up there, alone and happy, enjoying his walk in the clouds. A breathtaking film worthy of many Oscars!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Marsh directs this exceptional documentary about a most daring accomplishment imaginable. On film we see the mental, emotional and physical preparation by Philippe Petit, a 24-year old Frenchman, who accomplished a life long dream. That dream became reality on August 7, 1974, when Petit and his crew of friends strung a cable in between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. On that wire some 1,350 feet above the hustle and bustle of New York City Petit spent 45 minutes walking across from building to building. His acrobatic movements and stunts on the wire cable have been described as "dancing in the clouds". Petit would be arrested and charged with all charges dropped later after performing tricks for school students. Editing is fantastic and the documentary filled with actual newsreel footage and personal photos is held together with music by Michael Nyman that is almost cerebral and definitely melancholic.MAN ON WIRE contains newsreel footage of the erection of the WTC twin towers. And it is a bit eerie watching knowing the future fate of those towers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>jaw-dropping, mind-blowing documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The spellbinding documentary, "Man on Wire," chronicles a very different kind of "assault" on the World Trade Center's Twin Towers from the one that happened on September 11th. This earlier one involved a French tightrope walker named Philippe Petit who, on August 7, 1974, illegally crossed over from the South Tower to the North Tower (both still under construction at the time) on a wire suspended more than 1300 feet above the ground. However, in this case, the attack was designed not to bring the buildings crashing down in a wanton display of death and destruction, but rather to celebrate them for the extraordinary feats of human engineering and achievement they clearly were.Although director James Marsh deliberately avoids any mention of the 9/11 attacks, that earth-shattering event can't help but cast a haunting pall over the film anyway - like some unacknowledged ghost hovering above the project. This is particularly the case in the early stretches of the film where we are shown grainy footage of the buildings as they were being constructed in the early 1970's. In fact, we're jolted to find that the familiar debris-littered hole we're looking at is NOT a picture of Ground Zero but rather of the site that would serve as the foundation for the buildings. Having witnessed the destructive end of the structures, we find it doubly poignant to be present once again at their hope-filled beginning.But "Man on Wire" is not concerned with what happened to the buildings on September 11th, 2001, but rather what happened there on a misty day in August twenty-seven years earlier, when a man dazzled the world by seeming to defy the laws of gravity and of physics and, more strangely still, the code of self-preservation that rules all living creatures. It's possible that we may never be able to fully understand what drives a man like Philippe Petit to do what he does, for even he admits flat-out that he can't define what it is that motivates him; all he knows is that he has some innate, obsessive need forging him on - some inner compulsion to live life constantly on the edge. There's also the secondary thrill that comes with skirting the law in a way that doesn't do any real harm to others. However, we're hardly in a position to criticize Petit for his vagueness, since our own undeniable fascination with those who routinely flirt with death can never be thoroughly explained either. Marsh's film plays with that fascination by taking us into Petit's world and letting us see for ourselves how this amazing feat was finally accomplished. Luckily, Petit and his crew recorded much of their preparations for it on film - with the director providing humorous, slightly surreal re-enactments shot in silhouetted black-and-white to fill in the blanks.We're also fortunate in that most of the key players in the drama are still around today and more than willing to sit down and talk about their part in it. This includes Petit himself who tries to put into words what was going through his mind at various stages of the project. In addition, Marsh interviews others who either took an active part in engineering the stunt or who were in some way ancillary participants in the event. What's interesting is how the fear of being caught by the authorities is almost as intense as the fear of Petit's falling to his death - a possibility that seems to register on most of them only at the point when he is about to venture out onto the rope. Yet, throughout, there are those random moments of quiet contemplation when doubts, second thoughts and cold feet begin to worm their way, if only unconsciously, into the minds of the people involved.And when Petit is up there, teetering on a thread strung across the top of the world, we sit in dumbfounded silence at the sheer aesthetic beauty and balletic grace of what we are witnessing - and catch our breath at what feats of superhuman wonder we mere mortals are capable of achieving when we set our minds to it. However, a little warning might be in order for the acrophobics in our midst: you might just find yourself having to clutch the nearest available hand or armchair rest to steady your nerves through the ordeal."Man on Wire," inadvertently perhaps, turns out to be as much a tribute to the Twin Towers themselves - and, by extension, the people who lost their lives in them - as to the irrepressible, death-defying daredevil who did his bit to immortalize them.Now, thanks to Petit and those who made "Man on Wire," we have another, more life-affirming document to remember them by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right out the gates, the filmmakers let us know that this is going to be a terse, smart, laser-focused piece of work. The improbable tale of an obsessive French shuck who does a high wire act between the unfinished Twin Towers in 1974 has plenty of great archival footage to work with, courtesy of the wire team themselves, who are so deeply into this mysterious project that they sweep you right along with them. The setup is classic heist movie, with a great motley crew of accomplices; the narrative of getting to America, to the towers, and to the roof is handled with perfect clarity and deliberation. But nothing prepares you for the walk itself - the pure beauty and release of what they finally achieve. I was emotionally overwhelmed, and the filmmakers are exceedingly subtle in putting you there - the wide, tearful eyes of the act's accomplices come afterward, confirming rather than prompting your own reaction. So that when everyone just shakes their head at the question 'why', you are in complete sympathy. This movie's silences resonate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1974, Phillipe Petit walked a high wire between the two towers of NYC's World Trade Center and for a brief moment became a media sensation. "Man on Wire" is a documentary account of Petit's stunt, focusing primarily on the preparations for it and detailing how he and his team of four snuck on to the roof of the towers in the first place.Let's just say that times have changed. Obviously, the twin towers are no longer there, but if they were, you can be sure it would not be as easy to stroll right in as it was for Petit and his crew. Petit was obviously a man obsessed with a goal, but those who come into the film wondering exactly why he was obsessed with this particular goal will come away still wondering. As Petit says at one point, it's a typically American question to ask "why?" in relation to something like this rather than simply enjoy the beauty of it.I can't believe Werner Herzog didn't get his hands on this story first, as the man obsessed angle would seem to be right up his alley.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the overcast morning of Aug. 7, 1974, one day before US President Richard Nixon resigned, New York City pedestrians stopped in their tracks to see what looked like an apparition, a man literally walking in the sky.It was not a ghost but Philippe Petit, a former circus performer turned tightrope artist who magically traversed the 200 feet between the newly constructed Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on a wire cable, a quarter of a mile above the street. He not only walked across eight times in 45 minutes but also lay down in the middle, unbelievably looked to the ground, and did a mocking dance to entertain the police waiting on either end.For those watching, it was a once in a lifetime experience, an activity thought of as belonging to circus performers or publicity seekers turned into a feat of artistic beauty. That achievement has now been recreated in James Marsh's award winning documentary Man on Wire, a compelling film beautifully enhanced by the music of Michael Nyman and Erik Satie.Marsh uses interviews, photos, archive footage, and black-and-white re-enactments to capture the event. Although we know that Petit survives, the thrill of seeing the feat accomplished is still breathtaking. Petit describes his feelings as "feeling intensely living.""I remember hearing, smelling, touching," he says, "seeing in a much more animal way. I could hear New York waking up, the traffic and the sirens, the mutter of a big city. I also could hear a strange kind of silence coming from another planet."Starting out as a circus performer, Petit first captured the world's imagination when he walked across the towers of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Sydney Harbor Bridge. He had not even heard of the construction of the Twin Towers until he saw an architect's drawing in a magazine while sitting in a dentist's office. It was then that the idea of crossing the towers became his dream.Petit, who at age 59 looks every bit as pixieish as he did at 24, tells us how his "walk" between the towers came about. "I thought, this is it," he said. "At one point in my life, I'm going to transform the negative space between those two monoliths into the most magnificent theater." To this end, Petit assembled a team of assistants that consisted of a mixed group of New Yorkers, Frenchmen and Australians (Allix, Jean-Louis Blondeau, Jean-Francois Heckel and Mark Lewis), and spent eight months planning the event.The plan included the herculean task of smuggling in a three-quarter-inch steel cable that weighs about 450 pounds, placing it into position, and securing it in an area 1,350 feet from the ground without being stopped by security guards. The building was basically finished but the upper floor was still incomplete and Petit and his crew had to disguise themselves as journalists, filmmakers and workers to enter the building and elude the authorities. According to Petit, "The actual plan was simple. I entered the tower at night with two crews. The plan changed a lot, and it was a festival of miracles that night as I recall it, but anyway, it did happen."After the police threatened to pull him off the wire by helicopter, Petit was persuaded to end his performance and was promptly arrested by New York's finest for "disturbing the peace" and "performing in public without a license," but was finally sentenced to put on a public performance for children after he had become a cause celebre.The police, however, like the rest of the spectators could not conceal their amazement. One of the officers reported, "I observed the tightrope 'dancer' -- because you couldn't call him a 'walker' -- approximately halfway between the two towers. And upon seeing us, he started to smile and laugh and he started going into a dancing routine on the high wire.? And when he got to the building, we asked him to get off the high wire but instead he turned around and ran back out into the middle.? He was bouncing up and down. His feet were actually leaving the wire and then he would resettle back on the wire again.? Unbelievable, really.? Everybody was spellbound in the watching of it."You will be spellbound as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the true story of how high wire artist Philippe Pettit illegally set up a tightrope wire between the twin towers in 1974 and proceeded to spend 45 minutes walking between the towers before coming off and being arrested (though nearly all charges were dropped.) I should point out I am not a fan of circus acts though I am an admirer of the high wire particularly when it is done without a safety net. The preparations for this all had to be done in secret and he had a first class team behind him doing the planning and setting up the wire.Pettit had a history of this before the WTC walk having done the Sydney Harbor Bridge and a large French cathedral (both illegally I think.) This predates the rather dangerous sport of base jumping and apart from being far more perilous creates a type of wonder and awe. I never quite appreciated the beauty of it all until I watched this film and the choice of music superbly complemented the achievement. After walking the WTC it was as if a part of his life was over. His relationship was his girlfriend and his manager ended and I heard they ended up together so it had a happy ending for everyone (though this is not mentioned.)He said during the film: 'If I die, what a beautiful death, doing your passion.' One word, outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie ruined me for "Jackass"! Of course the subject is the reason this movie is so gripping. The directing/editing team does an admirable job splicing together archival footage, interviews and re-enactments, but ultimately it is a lop-sided movie, because as much care that went into explaining the events in the first three quarters, the resolution is all lost as a result of there being not much explanation at all at the end. Yes, we get to see the set up from before the towers are even built, we hear multiple perspectives on every step, but when it comes to the aftermath of the attempt, we are given what feels like a rushed, impressionistic style and little to no information. Also, the emotional impact of scenes seems to connect in spite of and not because of the zig-zagging narrative, which makes me feel that it could have been more gripping if it were presented in chronological order. In short, I'm happy I saw it, because it elevated pranks and stunts to an art-form for me. It was only the movie's film-making style that I felt was not completely at the same level as its content. Ambitious project, at any rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tell me something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The event? It's there, for everyone to read about it. It occurred, of course. You can 'Google' it and now there's also Wikipedia. Let me say that I find it amazing that James Marsh took the time to reunite the protagonists of the event, interviewing then with the objective of getting the most amount of detail possible. Also, when finishing this raw material, I admire his intelligence in the editing room that makes such an easy telling event so much more. Don't get me wrong; I'm not suggesting it was easy to put a wire between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and walk through it as if nothing during 45 minutes, no. I'm merely suggesting that it's easy to tell what happened: I mean, you can read it in the previous sentence. With the director's editing work, this very short sentence becomes a movie. The process comes to light; the characters recall their feelings and their admiration towards Philippe Petit; a love story surfaces; a friendship story surfaces; a rivalry surfaces. The video and photographic material seems infinite, and most of the movie is, naturally, carefully measured edition because the original footage shot by Marsh involves this somehow fictional recreation of the night and day in which everything happened. The rest? Videos and photographs, taken and shot by the real Petit and his, well?His crew. I should complain about the use of music, sometimes too repetitive, at times too obvious. The way these people tell the story is so natural and pure they seem hired storytellers, almost reading a memorized acted script. I suppose this could be possible, and even though I assume is not, there's no need to accompany the talking with the "appropriate" music and/or sound?At least not all the time. Some moments (a few ones, with Petit talking, non-stop) in which the screen is ?in this aspect- invaded by complete silence, are among the best parts of the film. And I'm not so disappointed by the musical use because I can see there's true emotion in the movie's center, and with or without music, stretching for it or not, this stands out. What could have been avoided though is the illogical use of photographs and video material to justify or illustrate specific moments of the tale. We found repeated images because of this and it makes you think the filmmaker may not have complete confidence in the effect of pure, heartfelt spoken words.Because there is a chance that Marsh may have missed the true heart of his documentary, right there in the middle of all the incredible human experience that's presented to us. There you have Phillipe Petit, an artist. A person who was taken to psychiatrists that insistently required an explanation for the things he had done. A crazy little man with a soul so innocent and pure; someone who believes in the beauty of a little moment. It's amazing just to look at him, so convinced that he can make the world better by risking his own life.All of this, I don't know. I just assume. Part of some documentaries that are fascinated with a persona has to do with transmitting this fascination to the viewer. I said it all over: I'm not quite sure how amazed by Petit the director truly is. It doesn't matter because the artist's presence is so strong that it becomes inevitable to try and see inside him, through his art. Sometimes this is the only way possible, especially with artists. They don't choose to do what they do, they just know they have do it; and watching them doing, and listening to them speaking about themselves doing it is all anyone should need.I don't need to read Phillipe Petit's biography any more than I ever needed to read Damien Rice's, or Fito Páez's, or Sofia Coppola's or Woody Allen's (to put some cinematographic examples). It's all there: in the songs, in the movies, in their art. Phillipe Petit, a man who sees a picture of two gigantic Towers being built and knows they're building them for him, is the living proof ?one of many, surely- of this fact that I believe a lot of people take for granted. We pretend we know about it, we assume we understand, and yet we keep watching and listening and we keep asking: "Why? Why?". Shut up. There is no "why".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a documentary film puts your mind in a state of inhuman disbelief, you know it has to be a good thing. Man on Wire is the story of Philippe Petit, a "wirewalker" as he is called in the film. He is a man who dreams big and will stop at nothing to achieve his larger than life goals. The film chronicles his fantastic achievement that amazed the world in 1974, when he walked between the Twin Towers on a thin tightrope. This feat if not only incredible in itself, but all the preparation, mental and physical, is stunning as well. The film does an excellent job at detailing the story behind this immaculate achievement.Man on Wire has a wide cast of players, that all served a very important role in Philippe's stunt, but the main focus of the story is on Philippe himself. In my mind, a good documentary is one that tells an intriguing and fun story about something I'm personally interested in. However, a great documentary is one that does what I just described, as well as deliver a deeper subtext about human nature and life. Man on Wire superbly accomplishes the latter. The story focuses on Philippe and his achievement, but underneath the already exciting exterior, it is the story of man's determination to do the seemingly impossible. In retrospect this film is a character study of Philippe and what it means for man to have goals and dreams, and what it truly means to accomplish these dreams.The excellence of this film comes from its ability to take these exquisite subtexts and front them with an exhilarating and entertaining story, unlike anything anyone has ever seen. The quest Philippe set out on is an enthralling one of grand proportions. At times it almost feels like a heist film. Philippe puts together an international team of people to infiltrate the World Trade Center and rig his tightrope at the top so that he may perform his epic feat. The preparation is intense and and rigorous, and then the execution is even more so. It is all done with such intricate precision, with excitement building with every narrow step.This film is a fantastic expose into human nature, and Philippe Petit is every bit incredible as the movie itself. It is a documentary that exceeds expectations and is much more exciting than most fictional stories that we see in movies today. A great documentary that I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Oscar-winning film is not so much about Petit's extraordinary feats, but rather the struggles behind the dream to materialize them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you explain someone as crazy as Philippe Petit? You don't. You just accept the way he is. James Marsh's remarkable documentary explores the psyche and the controversial exploits of one of the world's most incredible daredevils. Famous for his tight-rope walking feats across architectural icons with only a balancing rod and without safety nets or harnesses, Petit fulfilled his dream and did what everyone thought was impossible on August 7, 1974. That slightly misty morning at the top of New York's World Trade Centre, Petit walked across a tensioned rope connecting the twin towers, more than a hundred storeys above ground and yes, with only a balancing rod and without safety nets.Till this day, and it will remain so for centuries to come, Petit's act remains unfathomable. It is something so mind-boggling that no one would ever think about it, let alone attempt it. Man On Wire reveals to us the behind-the-scenes that most of us would not care to know, the complexity of the plan, the crew members involved, and the painstaking effort everyone took to avoid security complications. This Oscar-winning film is not so much about Petit's extraordinary feats, but rather the struggles behind the dream to materialize them.Directed like a heist thriller, Marsh re-creates the scenes leading up to the World Trade Centre using black-and-white images and shadowy photography with a set of actors playing the roles of key members of the 'operation'. These scenes are backed up by Petit's energetic recounting of the whole event. Of course, Marsh falls short of re-creating the actual wirewalking act using CGI. Instead, a montage of still photos of Petit committing the 'artistic crime of the century' is all that fills the gap. The effect is tremendous, as it leaves viewers imagining how it would have felt to witness the event.Man On Wire ultimately leaves us in an uplifting mood. Not only does seeing a fellow human achieve the impossible give us a heightened sense of admiration, it also quashes the rules that govern the limits of what is deemed to be humanly possible. Life should be lived on the edge. Petit takes this notion to extreme levels that can never be completely understood by his own kind.

		<fullReview>Hands up if you had ever heard of Philippe Petit before the release of this fantastic documentary 'Man on Wire'. I certainly hadn't but after watching this I will never forget him.Philippe Petit (now 60) is an amazing high wire walker and had already performed unbelievably dangerous high wire walks in Paris and on Sydney Harbour bridge before he came up with the most audacious high wire plan of all time - to walk between the twin towers of the World Trade centre in 1974.'Man on Wire' is truly a breathtaking experience from start to finish. I was absolutely engrossed from the first minute. Director James Marsh has assembled an incredibly beautiful combination of images using rare footage, live interviews, recreated scenes and still photography.The film is set up like a heist movie, (Danny Ocean himself couldn't top this one though), we get to see the detailed thoughts, ideas, training and preparation of all the participants over a few years in intimate detail and I really had a sense of wonderment throughout the entire thing. Undoubtedly a fantastic movie and Michael Nyman's haunting and emotive score was the cherry on top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The artistic crime of the century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On August 7, 1974, Philippe Petit, a French wire walker, juggler, and street performer days shy of his 25th birthday, spent 45 minutes walking, dancing, kneeling, and lying on a wire he and friends strung between the rooftops of the Twin Towers. Man On Wire uses contemporary interviews, archival footage, and recreations to tell the story of his previous walks between towers of Notre Dame and of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, his passions and friendships, and the details of the night before the walk: getting cable into the towers, hiding from guards, and mounting the wire. It ends with observations of the profound changes the walk's success brought to Philippe and those closest to him...Man on Wire is a terrific documentary and probably one of the best I have ever seen. Philippe Petit, the man who "committed the deed" is a larger then life figure, a fascinating individual and an inspiration. Trough interviews he recalls every step of his journey, including past feats, the making of the plans and the actual walking on a wire between the two towers. And he does this with such passion and enthusiasm as if it all had happen yesterday. He is truly captivating as a story-teller and a delight to watch. Also interviewed were his friends, "accomplices" and former girlfriend, some of them even choke up when recalling certain moments of this adventure. Some of the documentary is reenactment obviously, but fortunately, there's a ton of video-footage and photographs of Petit and his friends conjuring the plan, preparing everything and eventually succeeding by executing this crazy goal of having Petit walking between what were at that time,two of the highest buildings in the world. The documentary was extremely well edited and balances very well the use of actual footage and the use of reenactment and also, the musical score was well chosen and makes some of the scenes even more astonishing. Man on Wire is a truly fascinating documentary about something that will probably never happen again and has been considered the "the artistic crime of the century".Side note: Man on Wire is a real treat, however, after watching the documentary, I read a couple of articles that stated that Jean-Louis Blondeau, one of the friends and accomplice, and Petit, were no longer in talking terms after the release of the documentary because Blondeau felt that Petit lied and embellished certain aspects of the story and Blondeau is apparently writing a book with his own version of the story.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will be honest with you guys, after watching this documentary I truly feel the loss of WTC. I mean before that it was just another skyscraper but after watching this documentary it has changed into something magnificent. It's almost like a love affair.What makes this documentary stand out is the whole difficulty level and the psychological pressure. I mean imagine wire walking between Twin Towers with all the wind and other elements it's just impossible and watching Philippe do that is just amazing. You feel a powerful emotion which is hard to describe. It's almost like seeing someone complete a dream and you get inspired by him because you always wanted to be like that.The effort his team put in and amount of struggle they did in that time is just awesome. You don't see any action sequences nor do you see any famous actors or anything, this documentary is just about one man and his dream to conquer the magnificent Twin towers (R.I.P) with just shear will power and his amazing talent to wire walk.I loved every minute of it and I have to agree it was worth watching.In short it was an honor watching this documentary, surely people like Philippe can achieve the impossible.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an amazing story. I'm captivated even though I know that success is coming (he is doing he documentary after all). What I loved about this film is the human face that was put upon it. It's about stardom. You have that one person who brings his soul and his talents to a feat. Along the way, many others have been a part of it, but when the actual event happens, who will come to the fore. This story is more about the ambitious task of rigging that cable than the actual event. Of course, if he fall, it's all for naught. But all the circumstances and years of planning that went into the creation of a cable for him to walk on. That is remarkable. And in more innocent days before 9/11, way before. The fact that they were not caught is just remarkable. The voices of the people involved are precious because there are huge egos and fears and human frailty. On every level, it is a fascinating story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than fiction doc flies high.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure the boys in Hollywood could slap together an absorbing caper/romance film from the factual material in the documentary Man on Wire. A couple of big stars, quirky but lovable supporting players and some dazzling computer graphics could give it a Spiderman patina. It would probably cost tens of millions (pretty faces can be expensive) to make but no amount of cash could surpass James Marsh's dazzling telling of wire walker Philippe Petit's quest to tightrope The Twin Towers in August 74. With an abundance of personal and archival news footage of the impishly courageous and charming Petit, Marsh has constructed a film that succeeds on a variety of levels. There is suspense in the benign crime of trespass, bittersweet romance between the dreamers and an undefinable overwhelming spirituality in the act itself. Petit as the film's focal point is a fascinating study of the passionate man (Ahab?) on a quest. His energy and enthusiasm are infectious, his ego rightfully intact as he bravely takes on death defying acts. "What a beautiful death it will be" he says when considering the down side. On the wire he is a man in full as he takes eight walks between the buildings stopping to lie on his back, talk to seagulls, bow and goad the police. Once on the ground and world famous he neglects friends and lover for an extended roll in the hay with a groupie. It is the first indication that the merry band of pranksters will never be the same. Over thirty years later it remains evident in touching interviews with ex-lover Annie and childhood friend Jean Louis. Other than a superfluous Kubrick homage and a clumsy Watergate analogy Marsh manages to give us slices of Topkapi, Marx Brothers and New Wave within the genre format. The Towers themselves convey a powerfully symbolic metaphor on transience and ultimate doom; the forces that drove Petit to do what no man will ever do again. With Wire, Marsh has done an admirable balancing act himself in this highly moving, inspirational and entertaining film documenting the most daring and greatest work of subversive art in the 20th Century. Sorry Christo, umbrellas just don't cut it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong here. "Man on Wire" was a fascinating story and documentary, and it even has some inspirational value to it. There are a ton of facts in this film that make it enjoyable and interesting to watch. The story is engaging, if for no other reason, because Philippe Petit is such a great storyteller. An example of this is seen in an early scene is which he tells how he ripped an article about the future Twin Towers out of a magazine at the dentist's office and went home with a toothache for the next week, though he admitted it was worth it all because the article helped him fulfill his dream. Although interesting, the fact that this film is a documentary makes it drag a little at some spots. In my opinion, this story would have been a lot better in movie form. Some of the events are so well described here that they could have been made into somewhat of a caper film. Such events as Petit sneaking into the building, hiding from guards, and of course, pulling off his amazing act of walking between the towers, would be somewhat more interesting if we could watch them acted out. Nevertheless, I give this film a recommendation. I had no prior knowledge of this before I saw it, so I found it an interesting story and depiction. It would have been better as a movie, best still worthy of the Academy Awards' Best Documentary.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Man on Wire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Marsh directed Man on Wire to critical acclaim, and snagged amongst other recognition, the best documentary feature in this year's Academy Awards. Containing the usual talking heads styled interviews with everyone involved one way or another in high-wire walker Philippe Petit's 1974 stunt at New York's World Trade Centers' Twin Towers, this film is extremely engaging as you the audience get to participate in what is sadly a stunt that can no longer be replicated.I guess it's already mentioned in countless of reviews that this film played out like a heist movie, where the perpetrators run through elaborate planning, trials and research in order to get their logistics all set up right. And true to a stunt of any nature, meticulous and painful planning is a necessary ingredient to ensure that the objectives get pulled off successfully with minimum fuss or injury. Surveillance is always key, and the copious amount of intelligence gathering performed by Petit and his team, is nothing short of commendable, if I may say so, involving everything from on-site surveying of activity and key locations, and helicopter rides.But you can't help but to feel a sense of how lax security got compromised at the time, where the group can get by with fake IDs for starters, and the rest just exhibiting some confidence in order to bypass gatekeepers. Then there's always the insider to provide support, as well as an enormous stroke of luck to make everything a lot more easier, such as having the use of the freight lift to lug their heavy equipment.While the film chronicles Petit's efforts in achieving his impossible dream, from the more humble beginnings such as initial practice in a backyard, and scaling other projects such as the Notre Dame and Sydney Harbour Bridge, what was niggling at the back of my mind were the Twin Towers themselves. There were enough images and clips shown of how the Towers got built, the sheer magnificence of it all, witnessing the erection from ground all the way up. There's this sense of pity and regrettable loss that they no longer dot the skyline of NYC, and not having personally been there before, I can only imagine how iconic those towers once stood.Man on Wire does get a little dry sometimes since there's only one mission objective and with its participants very focused on getting the job done, and it's a shame that there's no video clip of Petit performing those multiple walks across both directions in a 45 minute period - yes, it's not just 1 walk! - compared to something similar if done today, with the proliferation of video cameras, we'll probably have multiple angles of the same thing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie, encourage you to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man on Wire is based on a tightrope walker, Philippe Petit, from France. The movie explores his dream to walk between the tallest buildings in the world. Which at the time were the Twin Towers. We go through the film seeing the preparations, Philippe actually walking the towers (illegally), and the aftermath of the event itself.You really got a feel for how important an art can be to the artists, and the extremes people will go through for their art. Everyone can see how important tightrope walking is to Philippe. He was so enthusiastic about his dream that he convinced a small team to break the law, and most likely go to jail for it.To me on of the main themes of the film is to follow your dreams, no matter how impossible they seem. In one interview, a man said, "If you want something, nothing is impossible." It took the stunt team years to prepare for the impossible. You can't take no for an answer if it is something you really want. Another theme that I caught onto towards the end is that you do not always have to have a reason for everything that you do. People asked Philippe why he did what he did. He commented on how American the question was. Why does there need to be a reason, why cant it just be? It really gave me a new way to look at the world. Everything does not need to be taken so seriously all the time. I believe the editing was very well balanced. There were many clips that were actually shot by the stunt team themselves in the 70's, cut a ways filmed later, and numerous interviews of those involved. The reenactments were awesome. I have a lot of respect for anyone who is willing to make a documentary on a subject that happened in the past, as opposed to capturing the present. The filmmaker, James Marsh really did a great job of recreating multiple parts of the film so they did not stick out like a sore thumb in comparison to the other footage. The interviews with Philippe were so detailed and full of imagery, his commentary really helped guide the film. The music was one of my favorite parts of the movie. The composition is so beautiful, my favorite band, Playradioplay even incorporated a piano composition by Pascal Rogé entitled, 3 Gymnopédies: Gymnopédie No. 1, into an original song of his own. Listen to it at, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXXZwLsgsZg.Man On Wire is a wonderful movie that captured a historical moment in time forever. The fact that this film was not trying to persuade you to think a certain way on serious issue was a nice break to that pattern. The film really has a rebellious, exciting, carefree feel about it. Life is to wonderful to be wasted. If you don't have anything to do, create something to do that's worthwhile. I thoroughly enjoyed Man on Wire, and would recommend it to anyone over the age of 16.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exemplary documentary- making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the morning of 7 August 1974, Frenchman Philippe Petit did the seemingly impossible: after six years of planning, for 45 minutes, he walked a tight rope slung between the two towers of the still-uncompleted World Trade Center, spanning the 140-foot (43 metres) gap at a height of 1,368 ft (417 metres). On 11 September 2001, terrorists perpetrated the absolutely unthinkable: they flew two aircraft into the towers, bringing them down and killing 2,750. In 2008, British director James Marsh produced the award-winning account of the 1974 feat which has gained a special poignancy in the light of the 9/11 attack.The documentary is a mix of homemade footage of Petit's early career, some contemporary coverage of the walk, re-enactments of the entry to the towers, and extensive interviews with Petit and his key accomplices, skilfully cut together in a gripping narrative with atmospheric music by Michael Nyman and others. The amazingly colourful characters could not have been invented, most notably Petit himself whose impish facial expressions, heavily-accented English, compulsiveness and humour shine through this literally incredible tale. Neither Petit nor Marsh put a foot wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man on Wire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this film mainly for being British made, it won a deserved Academy Award, and the concept of the film was most appealing. Basically this drama documentary is the story of Philippe Petit, the French wire walker, juggler and street performer who in 1974 achieved his dream of walking across a high wire connected between the rooftops of the Twin Towers in New York City. This documentary is made up of traditional interviews of all people involved in making this event happen, archive footage of the people preparing for it, and some recreated material of the event. It is a shame that the full 45 minute walk across the wire isn't available, only photos of it survived, but you can still admire all the remarkable story. It won the Oscar for Best Documentary, Features, and it won the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film, and it was nominated the Carl Foreman Award for the Most Promising Newcomer for Simon Chinn (producer). Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extraordinary Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We came out from Man On Wire exhilarated, lifted up, and amazed.Not just the audacity and the excellent way the film was put together - the storyboard is one of the best I have ever seen - it keeps its footing perfectly driving at a poetic pace that many documentary makers would do well to note - never rushed, never boring - marvelous - but rather something almost metaphysical - beyond comprehension and meaningAn extraordinary experience that is about the positive qualities of human endeavor - courage, audacity, even a measure of foolhardiness - all wrapped in a wonderful real evocation of the 70s that current films try to evoke but somehow can't.Of course, it's also impossible to watch without thinking about the tragedy of 9/11 and it makes a great tribute to the building itself.I cannot recommend this highly enough - it should clearly win an Oscar for documentary - in a sense it is too optimistic to do so on subject alone - but James Marsh has done a BRILLIANT job at putting it all together - absolutely hypnotic, mesmerizing, and moving in ways that you wish film would always do -- wonderful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remembering The Twin Towers In A Much Different (And Better) Light...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What many considered "the artistic crime of the century," French high-wire walker Philippe Petit did what today would be impossible (because they don't exist and because of security) by performing a tightrope walk between New York City's World Trade Center twin towers ...in 1974.The feat itself isn't as interesting as the preparation and the history behind Philippe's successful walk. Having scaled between the arches at Notre Dame and the Harbor Bridge pillars in Sydney, Australia, Philippe's goal from early on was to walk on a wire much, much higher. At just over 1,350 above street level, the twin towers were his goal.Friends and even workers within New York's buildings aided Philippe in surprising ways. Many backed out when they realized how close he was to actually doing it, worried that if he fell to his death they would be partially responsible.But nothing was going to hold Philippe back. Security guards, wind, fog and fearful friends all plagued his attempt ...to no avail.As stated earlier, the preparation was fascinating, showing the documentary watcher the tensile strength needed to span the buildings, the bypassing of security guards, and the near failure of the entire episode because of a severe sagging of the wire during its initial deployment. The tense nature of how the story unfolded was pretty phenomenal. Looking up from the ground at Philippe as he walked the wire was simply awe-inspiring; he looked like a speck against the higher clouds.Arrested after his successful walk, the words "Man on wire" appeared on the violation written up by the New York P.D., which is where the film gained its title. But the film is much more than a simple man doing a tightrope walk. It's a historical recounting of one man's goal to achieve what seemed unachievable.It is strange to see a man doing something artistically dangerous ? and illegal ? on things that no longer exists. Perhaps that added to my enjoyment of the documentary. After watching the horribleness of 9/11 time and time again, it was unique and refreshing to see something being done to the towers of a quaint and beautiful nature. Something that many Americans probably have trouble attributing to the twin towers now. Which is why you should watch this.Thank you, Philippe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man on Wire (2008) **** (out of 4) On August 7, 1974 Frenchman Philippe Petit crossed the north and south towers of the World Trade Center eight times. This fascinating documentary plays out like a thriller and a heist movie because Philippe and his gang had to pretty much break into both towers, sneak to the top, avoid security and then set the wire across both towers in order for Philippe to walk. This documentary works on two levels with one being given insight into a genius or at least a man without any fear in him. The second level this works on is a nice tribute to the towers, which are of course no longer with us. Early in the film we see some striking footage, which looks a lot like the clean up after the 9/11 attacks but it turns out to be the early stages of the towers going up. Throughout the film there are plenty of images from the towers, which are certainly great to see considering most of the views we get today. The rest of the documentary is certainly spellbounding as we go along with this man who is trying to fulfill a dream of walking between the two towers. I'm not too fond of heights even though at one point in my life I jumped off a cliff 96-feet in the air into a lake but while watching this movie I couldn't even imagine what must have been going on in Philippe's mind. We here from the man himself throughout the documentary so we know he makes it across without falling to his death but this doesn't take away from the suspense, which there is plenty of. Hearing how two teams had to break into both towers and sneak their way to the top is full of wonderful stories that certainly build up tension as there were plenty of times where they were almost busted. The way everything had to be rehearsed and then executed really makes this film seem like heist movie where we're involved with a group of criminals trying to do their job. The biggest difference, as pointed out by those who took part in this, is that they were doing a crime yet hurting no one.</fullReview>

He may not be entirely sane, but constantly bursting with creative energy seems a worthwhile trade off. For him it's more about the process than the result. There is no 'why?' The end of the movie is given away in the posters and trailers, but the ride there is just as thrilling as the finale. Thankfully, no mention of 9/11 is made. I was worried about some sort of attempt at poignant epilogue. "It's impossible, that's sure, so let's start working." - Petit</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fraud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to strike a negative note, but Man on Wire is a film for the chronically credulous, and is complete and utter lying drivel from start to finish. One example - Petit's girlfriend claiming she could see him on the wire from down at street level - with accompanying pictures of her and other folk on the ground looking up, as if they could all see him - and "Barry Greenhouse," among them, claiming he could see the rope - one inch thick - was slack. We are being kidded - it's physically impossible to see someone walking a tightrope from 1,300 feet - a quarter of a mile - underneath them, and these folk, and the film-makers, and Petit, are LIARS. Second point : there is no footage in the entire film of Petit walking that wire - why not ? We get film of him doing the "twin towers" of Notre Dame, then the "twin towers" of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, but not the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Did he ever walk anywhere else, or just these three ? Did he ever do a walk that didn't involve twin towers at either end ? We see film of the preparations for the big event of his "career," film of his arrest, etc etc - but a 90-minute film about a guy walking between the most famous Twin Towers has not one second of film of him doing it, so if you're expecting to see any, forget it - you'll have to make do with some still photographs and an Erik Satie Gymnopédie you've probably heard a million times before. Point 3 - "Annie" ? "David aka Donald" ? "Mark the Australian" ? Don't these folk have surnames, 30 years later ? Why the anonymity ? And why do they never explain how they got involved with Petit ? How do you recruit outsiders to what's an illegal conspiracy ? Who approached whom ? Fourth point - "Alan aka Albert" says he couldn't speak French. Why would he need to, when Petit and his friends seem to speak English perfectly OK ? Fifth : they finally reach the roof and get started with the actual event - but have to use hand signals. A minute later we get told they had intercom radios with them, but one tower's radio had to be sent over on a rope, for some unexplained reason, when each team could have taken their own with them up the stairs. The unexplained reason for this nonsense is to create manufactured tension, like any other product of Hollywood that insults - or should do - the intelligence of even its teenage audience. Why does an alleged documentary need illogical, irrational stupidity like this ? They had radios - they could communicate - it was planned - but Petit tells us with a straight face nobody foresaw needing a signal for "I'm not ready" : they didn't need ANY signals. Doesn't anybody else notice these things, or are you all stunned into unquestioning silence by any mention of the Trade Center ? Does that sacred subject kill off your critical faculties ? The film is a continuous 90-minute sequence of non sequiturs, contradictions, invented drama and absurdities that destroy its claim to be a documentary : it's a piece of scripted fiction - and idiotic fiction at that. Petit says at the start of the film that the whole thing is a fairy tale : he's admitting it to our faces, but how many hear what he's saying ? It's frankly appalling that nonsense like this should win awards and get great reviews from everybody : they must be going about in a lobotomised daze if they can't see the whole film is a fraud. Unfortunately for its makers, I am fully awake, and I can tell snake-oil salesmen, charlatans, con men and liars a mile away. And, for that matter, intelligence agents - churning out yet another shameless, tasteless cobbled-together cash-in from the 9/11 film factory, to go with the Naudet fraud and all the rest of them. What's your real name, "David aka Donald" ? The film includes credits for the reconstructed scenes - at least they had the honesty to admit some were, unlike the Naudet film. Those scenes include shots of the Twin Towers, that seem to have been filmed just BEFORE 9/11, by folk who claim they had no idea what was in the future - but the future is the whole point of the film. It doesn't matter how these folk dress it up, or try to disguise it : if Man on Wire is about an event that happened in 1974, one that was impressive enough to justify the film's existence, and all the relevant film - except of the event itself - was already shot, why wasn't it made 30 years ago ? Why only after 9/11 do we see this turning up ? And why do we need reconstructed scenes, in black and white, filmed BEFORE 9/11 - when the real scenes should have been filmed, in colour, like the ones of the "training camp," in the 1970s ? How did they KNOW filming reconstructions was going to be impossible at some future date, to do it before that date arrived ? If you reconstruct scenes in a film, it normally means you're trying to recreate things from the past - like people, or buildings, that no longer exist - AFTER the event. The reconstructions in this film were shot BEFORE the event - before that future happened - and for some reason don't use the real characters, all of whom are still alive - why not ? To suggest they're no longer with us, when it's the Trade Center that's no longer with us. The film isn't recreating the past in the future - it's anticipating the future in the past, and anybody who was awake would see that.</fullReview>

If you look closely you can see its a fake they only have 2 videos of him in actual buildings or bridges. They never show how he gets up when he lays down. So its a fake they place him there with some sort of tricks. Last if he really did walk on a wire from one center to the other there would be tons of footage that all hes friends took yet there wasn't even 3 seconds of it in this movie. There was no video of any of it in this movie yet there would be since at the time this was the tallest building in the world!!!!

One example - Petit's girlfriend claiming she could see him on the wire from down at street level - with accompanying pictures of her and other folk on the ground looking up, as if they could all see him - and "Barry Greenhouse," among them, claiming he could see the rope - one inch thick - was slack. We are being kidded - it's physically impossible to see someone walking a tightrope from 1,300 feet - a quarter of a mile - underneath them, and these folk, and the film-makers, and Petit, are LIARS. Second point : there is no footage in the entire film of Petit walking that wire - why not ? We get film of him doing the "twin towers" of Notre Dame, then the "twin towers" of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, but not the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Did he ever walk anywhere else, or just these three ? Did he ever do a walk that didn't involve twin towers at either end ? We see film of the preparations for the big event of his "career," film of his arrest, etc etc - but a 90-minute film about a guy walking between the most famous Twin Towers has not one second of film of him doing it, so if you're expecting to see any, forget it - you'll have to make do with some still photographs and an Erik Satie Gymnopédie you've probably heard a million times before. Point 3 - "Annie" ? "David aka Donald" ? "Mark the Australian" ? Don't these folk have surnames, 30 years later ? Why the anonymity ? And why do they never explain how they got involved with Petit ? How do you recruit outsiders to what's an illegal conspiracy ? Who approached whom ? Fourth point - "Alan aka Albert" says he couldn't speak French. Why would he need to, when Petit and his friends seem to speak English perfectly OK ? Fifth : they finally reach the roof and get started with the actual event - but have to use hand signals. A minute later we get told they had intercom radios with them, but one tower's radio had to be sent over on a rope, for some unexplained reason, when each team could have taken their own with them up the stairs. The unexplained reason for this nonsense is to create manufactured tension, like any other product of Hollywood that insults - or should do - the intelligence of even its teenage audience. Why does an alleged documentary need illogical, irrational stupidity like this ? They had radios - they could communicate - it was planned - but Petit tells us with a straight face nobody foresaw needing a signal for "I'm not ready" : they didn't need ANY signals. Doesn't anybody else notice these things, or are you all stunned into unquestioning silence by any mention of the Trade Center ? Does that sacred subject kill off your critical faculties ? The film is a continuous 90-minute sequence of non sequiturs, contradictions, invented drama and absurdities that destroy its claim to be a documentary : it's a piece of scripted fiction - and idiotic fiction at that. Petit says at the start of the film that the whole thing is a fairy tale : he's admitting it to our faces, but how many hear what he's saying ? It's frankly appalling that nonsense like this should win awards and get great reviews from everybody : they must be going about in a lobotomised daze if they can't see the whole film is a fraud. Unfortunately for its makers, I am fully awake, and I can tell snake-oil salesmen, charlatans, con men and liars a mile away. And, for that matter, intelligence agents - churning out yet another shameless, tasteless cobbled-together cash-in from the 9/11 film factory, to go with the Naudet fraud and all the rest of them. What's your real name, "David aka Donald" ? The film includes credits for the reconstructed scenes - at least they had the honesty to admit some were, unlike the Naudet film. Those scenes include shots of the Twin Towers, that seem to have been filmed just BEFORE 9/11, by folk who claim they had no idea what was in the future - but the future is the whole point of the film. It doesn't matter how these folk dress it up, or try to disguise it : if Man on Wire is about an event that happened in 1974, one that was impressive enough to justify the film's existence, and all the relevant film - except of the event itself - was already shot, why wasn't it made 30 years ago ? Why only after 9/11 do we see this turning up ? And why do we need reconstructed scenes, in black and white, filmed BEFORE 9/11 - when the real scenes should have been filmed, in colour, like the ones of the "training camp," in the 1970s ? How did they KNOW filming reconstructions was going to be impossible at some future date, to do it before that date arrived ? If you reconstruct scenes in a film, it normally means you're trying to recreate things from the past - like people, or buildings, that no longer exist - AFTER the event. The reconstructions in this film were shot BEFORE the event - before that future happened - and for some reason don't use the real characters, all of whom are still alive - why not ? To suggest they're no longer with us, when it's the Trade Center that's no longer with us. The film isn't recreating the past in the future - it's anticipating the future in the past, and anybody who was awake would see that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Artistic Crime Of The Century': They Left The Film Camera Behind...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of this film I was intrigued. I'd never heard of a hire-wire act between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. I then heard that there was no actual footage of the feat itself, and I more or less completely lost interest - thought I might watch when it inevitably appeared on the BBC. Anyway, now I've seen it...After lugging all that equipment to the top of the twin towers, in secret, after all that planning, waiting, anticipation, it wouldn't have hurt for one of them to take a little super 8 camera would it? It seems even more incredible when you see all the other footage they made at the time...they filmed the Notre Dame stunt, they filmed the Sydney Harbour Bridge stunt, and they seem to film each other all the time: talking, planning and practising for the World Trade Center in their house and extensive back garden; they practically filmed each other going to the toilet. Yet, when it came to the 'artistic crime of the century', they make the brilliant artistic decision to leave the camera at home. That, it seems to me, was the bigger crime. It certainly made my jaw drop, anyway.Petit's character was more interesting than the stunt itself in a way; how did he come to be doing all this? It was never made clear, and there was practically nothing in the film about his family or background, apart from one contributor remarking upon his strict upbringing. What did his parents make of his stunts? Were they worried? Who were they? We can be pretty sure that Petit was looked after with a colossal private income, unless he had an amazingly well paid part-time job, which paid for thousands and thousands of francs worth of expensive equipment and constant flights to New York and back.The 'docu-drama' style was dated and irritating in places, as was Michael Nyman's annoyingly pseudo-classical score, regurgitated from 'The Draughtman's Contract'. The narrative was muddled. There was no tension created from the retelling or reconstruction of the subterfuge involved in smuggling the equipment to the top of the towers. It's a given that they got the wire across and fastened. We know he succeeded before we've seen the film, so why spend half an hour lulling us to sleep with dull technical details?.It was certainly quite a feat, but I'm not sure about it being an inspiring one. Personally it made me feel a bit ill to think of him up there, and it really achieves nothing other than self-congratulation. The tag-line for this film was 'The Artistic Crime of the Century'. Well, technically a crime, but also technically circus skills rather than art. And I don't need to ask why he did it; he's a gargantuan show-off, simple as that. The potentially interesting question of why he became one was criminally glossed over by this piece of 'art'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterley Pathetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with an open mind but fascinated to find a character who so completely encapsulated everything that i hate. Phillipe Petite and sycophantic friends disgorged their version of events as if they had discovered a cure for aids/cancer/death. I found their admiration of this glorified clown confusing in the extreme, only surpassed in intensity by Phillipe's admiration for himself. Petite manages not only to blow his own trumpet but also the horn, tuba and saxophone. This event seemed primarily concerned in stroking the ego of Phillipe and his desperate aching and repulsive need for approval, probably motivated by a childhood lack from his military father. I eventually felt sorry for Phillipe, though he seemed perfectly happy continuing on, riding even now the wave on his perceived greatness. Though this is like pity for a dog one thinks has a boring life - pointless, Petite is bizarrely fulfilled and to reveal to him the irrelevance of his deed would surely crush his fragile and childlike mind.</fullReview>
