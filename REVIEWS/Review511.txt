		<fullReview>James Bond and Oscar winning director Ed Zwick take on the Nazis.Saw a preview screening of DEFIANCE last week in Woodland Hills. Daniel Craig stars as Tuvia Bielski in the true WWII story of three Jewish brothers who hid in the Belorussian forests and built a community of partisan fighters, saving over 1200 Jews by war's end.Liev Schreiber (Zus Bielski) and Jamie Bell (Asael Bielski) star alongside Craig as his two younger brothers. Both Craig and Schreiber give powerhouse performances as the older brothers competing for leadership, and Jamie Bell, who most recently starred in the abysmal Jumper, gives a surprisingly great performance as well. Zwick has created one of the most beautiful and thought provoking films of his career and definitely one of the most Oscar worthy movies to hit cinemas in years. War and destruction has never been so captivating and moving. There have been dozens of war movies in recent years but none have left me caring so much or feeling so attached to the characters. My eyeballs wouldn't break from the screen for the full 120 mins, and by the film's end, I wasn't ready to stop watching. I can't wait for the release (which appears to be some time this winter) in order to see it again.It's a superb film with a nice balance of heavy hitting action and intense drama, but if that's not enough to make you want to see it, just the fact that these on screen heroes existed in real life definitely make it worth the watch.This is a WWII movie that doesn't hide or glamorize war but shows the intense reality of what happens when people band together against overwhelming evil and survive. A solid 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, light on facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed "Defiance" immensely -- there was humor and heartache, with a liberal dose of action. Not a brainless action movie, enough of a story to make it memorable, and fast-paced enough to keep me from becoming bored.On the other hand, although the movie captures the spirit of the story, it is far from a documentary, and I'd have preferred a more historically accurate film. I'm biased, though -- I read the Peter Duffy book "Bielski Brothers" soon after it was released ("Defiance" is based on a different book), and I found the real story even more compelling than the Hollywood version.Nonetheless, I live in the real world where directors have to shoot on a budget, and this was a good, diverting peek into a story that was long overdue to be told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting, Inspirational, Craig and Scheiber are Fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Defiance" is a very entertaining, exciting, suspenseful, and inspirational film about a tough topic: the Holocaust. Its many action sequences are well-paced and well-motivated. You know exactly why Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig) breaks into a home and points a gun at a man in front of his family. Daniel Craig and Live Schreiber are terrific as Tuvia and Zus Bielski, who lead a band of Jewish forest partisans during World War Two, thus saying over a thousand lives.The movie is not perfect. Characters speak English with Slavic accents. In other scenes, they speak Russian or Belarusian. Craig and Schreiber manage very good Slavic accents, both when speaking English and when speaking the Slavic languages, but Craig occasionally lapses into his English accent when speaking English. Female characters are not particularly well drawn, or given much to do. While this film is very good, it doesn't have the production values to be a timeless classic like "Schindler's List." The movie is controversial. Most of the controversies are shallow relative to the most important facts at hand. Many of those attacking this movie have axes to grind, including current events in the Middle East or feuds between Poles and Jews. The most important fact is this: the Nazis committed a genocide of six million Jews. In the midst of this Satanic nightmare, the Bielskis managed to save over a thousand Jews. That's the main, and absolutely true, point here, and it should not be lost in bickering over details.Compared to other treatments of the Holocaust, this film is fair. It doesn't show Slavic peasants as uniformly Jew-hating collaborators. Nazis, not Slavic peasants, were the authors and perpetrators of the Holocaust. Some occupied peoples collaborated, often out of fear and for financial gain or as payback for old grudges. Some occupied peoples did everything they could to help Jews, as does a Belarusian peasant in this film.The Bielskis were not immaculate. They did summarily execute captured Germans, as shown here. They did raid peasants for provisions, as shown here. They did work with the Soviets, but so did Uncle Sam. Remember that photo of FDR and Churchill smiling with Stalin at Yalta. The Polish IPN institute is investigating charges that members of the Bielski partisans, but not the Bielskis themselves, participated in the 1943 Soviet massacre of 128 people in Naliboki. Aron, the youngest Bielski brother, was, in 2007, accused of defrauding an elderly Polish woman. These failures of the Bielski brothers to be perfect in no way lessen their achievement, any more than any failure to be perfect lessen any hero's achievement. Again, in the face of genocide, the Bielski brothers managed to save over a thousand people. Were they perfect? No. Were they admirable, heroic, and worth learning about? Absolutely yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was good. Not Zwick's best effort though and as for the acting it was Liev Schreiber that delivered the most. Every time I see Craig I see James Bond and that other guy, Jamie Bell, was barely even on screen. I'm guessing most of his scenes were cut out of the film to pave the way for more Craig screen time. The action set pieces were mostly impressive but the problem is, its over before you know it. But I can honestly say, it was impressive nonetheless. Its not brainless by any means, the movie has a profound and compelling story. One can only wonder how these filmmakers come up with more WWII movie ideas every year.From a visual point of view, the movie looks absolutely beautiful. From the authentic weaponry and uniforms to the rich and colorful Lithuanian locations, Defiance may fall flat during some points throughout the film; as with every other black and white war movies that's been released, the Germans are depicted as war machines of death without remorse, if you can overlook these flaws I think it is an enjoyable film and in its entirety, Defiance is an overwhelming movie that doesn't glamorize the war but shows the intense reality behind it all. A must see for all war movie fans out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through suffering and faith they defied their destiny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was almost giving up seeing this film because of certain reviews which were not that good. To my amazement , the film turned up to be not good, but excellent. It shows people fighting for their lives, starving, getting to the point where many people loose faith and come close to being like animals. That is when you need a good leader which the Bielski brothers certainly were. And what good actors, Live Schreiber as Zus , what a performance, also Daniel Craig faultless as Tuvia. When you see all that killing, done by men (and women) trying to survive and also in some cases, revenge, you wonder how peaceful, good persons can change and become violent, when circumstances demand. And pray that those times will never happen to us. Spare us from being the Chosen People, says the Rabbi, overcome by anguish in a touching scene. But it is through suffering and faith that these people defy their destiny. My mother and father left Bielorus before the war. But most of their close ones did not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film surely merits the two stars.if you're brave enough to make a movie, you deserve one star. the second is for the pictures. and that's it.the movie sucked, in general and in detail. and we have noted down quite some of them.so, if you're not pulled off by the above and want to continue reading go ahead.first of all, the Bielski family were Polish, not Belorussian, Jews. and Polish Jews spoke Polish, not Russian. Bielski himself spoke poor Russian, he was quite fluent in Polish and Yiddish. so.. the question is... why do they make the characters in the movie talk Russian and write Polish? another thing is, if you make a movie and want to put something in a foreign language in it, make sure it's correct. just a little movie-makers hint. what was written in Polish on a label attached to the hanged farmer said "amant &#x17c;ydów", which translates roughly into, putting it nicely, "someone who enjoys Jews in a sexual way". the English translation said "Jew lover". well.. I'm quite sure they did not mean THAT kind of love here...the Bielski group never fought Germans. they were never a guerrilla. they lived in the forest alright, and fought mostly Russians. and Polish guerrillas. basically, they would fight anyone.so... Tewje Bielski is not a Robin Hood. nor would he ever give speeches like that about "freedom", "being chased like animals but not being animals" and all other sort of American rhetoric.btw, didn't he look just like Braveheart, on his white horse, talking to those tormented Jews? now... we are reaching a very complicated issue with the name Naliboki.in the movie Naliboki was the name of Bielski's camp. quite an unfortunate name as in reality it was not quite so.Naliboki was/is the name of a small Polish town that was allegedly massacred and burnt by Bielski's "troops". the truth is though, that the massacre was authored by a Soviet fighting group with the help of some local guerrillas, none of them being even related to Bielski. the blame was put on Bielski by the Soviets years later when investigation was drawn to explain war crimes in that region (many people today still believe the Bielski people are responsible for the massacre.) to include this in the movie might have made a really interesting plot line, instead we have a huge confusion.the Bielski forming his group and the Naliboki massacre took place during a war, quite uncomfortable for Poland, Soviets, Jews and everyone else Polish-Soviet. this conflict broke out round 1943 in the nowogródek area (a local little war inside the World War II, with no clear division between the "good guys" and the "bad guys".. that's a bit too complicated for Hollywood..).OK, but referring to the movie, apart from the fact the shots were good, it was historically inaccurate, interpreted in a wooden and iconic way... can't say much.waste of celluloid.I'd rather some movie makers didn't wipe their mouth with a "true story" label. if anything, it might have been "inspired by" with the source of inspiration left remotely behind.(pity you cannot paste links... I've got some really nice ones about the true story.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Is Impossible to Survive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1941, in Belorussia, the Jewish Bielski brothers succeed in escaping from the massacre of the German in their village where their parents were killed. They hide in the woods and sooner other runaway Jews join them. Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), the eldest brother, assumes the leadership of the survivors and plans a camp with tasks for everyone in the community; however, his brother Zus Bielski (Liev Schreiber) wants to fight against the Germans and does not agree with Tuvia's directions. Zus decides to join the Russian resistance that believes that Jews do not fight. While Tuvia welcomes any survivor in his camp with his two younger brothers and fight for food and ammunition, Zus finds anti- Semitism among the Russian partisans. "Defiance" is an excellent movie based on a true story that proves that nothing is impossible to survive. Of course, the plot is romanticized, but the merit of these Bielski brothers is undeniable. The direction of Edward Zwick (from "Blood Diamond") is outstanding, with the journey of a group of survivors that uses human characters in drama, romance and action in realistic scenes (the battle sequences are amazing). The landscapes are extremely beautiful, especially in the winter with the frozen forest. The cast is magnificent, and is difficult to highlight an individual performance. The beauty of the unknown Alexa Davalos is impressive. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Um Ato de Liberdade" ("An Act of Liberty")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defiance Tells an Important Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read more at http://FrameRate.blog.comWhen most people learn about World War II during their American History classes, they hear all about the major stories and the major players: D-Day, Eisenhower, the Holocaust, Hitler, Axis vs. Allies, Battle of the Bulge, but there are literally thousands of lesser-known stories from that era that many have not yet heard. It was one such obscure story that is the basis for the film Defiance, starring Daniel Craig.The film begins with a familiar theme -- Nazi soldiers rounding up Jews in Western Europe. The grainy, black-and-white style tells us that this is a true story. However, as events unfold, we realize that this isn't the Holocaust story that we're accustomed to seeing in films like Schindler's List. In fact, it's a story about hundreds of Jews who fight for survival as free men and women in the dense and expansive forests of Nazi-occupied Poland.Daniel Craig gives perhaps one of his best performances as Tuvia Bielski, the eldest of four Jewish brothers and the eventual leader of the Bielski partisans. Although the Bielski's and fellow Jews are forced to watch as their people are rounded up and killed by the Nazis, Tuvia wants to avoid becoming a group of vigilantes. The conflict arises from younger brother Zus (Liev Schreiber) who desperately wants to avenge the deaths of those he loved. Tuvia is conflicted by the knowledge that in extreme circumstances one must often take extreme measures in order to survive and protect others.Throughout the film tension is woven by utilizing a number of different methods, all of which make the movie much more compelling. First, as mentioned, is the conflict between fighting and surviving. Second, is the suspense created by the knowledge that the Nazis are closing in around them. Third is the conflict between the Bielskis and the local police who are loyal to the Nazis. Fourth is the inner struggles the Bielskis face when some of their own decide to cause disagreements and divisions. For those unfamiliar with the story, the fate of the Bielskis is constantly in doubt.The cinematography of the film is gray and muted, reflective of the somber tone of the subject matter. The musical score is reminiscent of John William's score in Schindler's List -- soft and sad with the cello and violin taking the melody. In some ways it feels that Defiance takes its visual cues from Schindler's List as well; there's something about the look of the movie that seems familiar. The battle scenes are similar in style to Saving Private Ryan, complete with the dazed, ringing-in-the-ears experience following a grenade that goes off too close to Tuvia. I would have appreciated a more unique perspective to the aesthetics of the film to coincide with the uniqueness of the story.In all, Defiance is an important story that needs to be heard. Daniel Craig leads a great cast of characters in an emotional journey of community, camaraderie, and hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fighting Jews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most WWII drama would have the Jews on the victim side, DEFIANCE is one that has The Jews level the playing field. It's a deep, emotional, and riveting tale a true story that deserves to be told. Director Edward Zwick (Glory, The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond) once again returns to? what he knows best by dealing with a group of underdogs, outnumbered but putting up a fight. DEFIANCE also proves that the blond James Bond, Daniel Craig, indeed has so much more to offer as an actor. This is the story of The Fighting Jews.The script is well-written, in my humble opinion. The way the story begins, what motivates the characters and the conflicts along the way. When brothers try to decide what happens next, there's bound to be clash, disagreements and temporary separation. I don't mean this to be bad but the story is about Jews who are walking into the wilderness, trying to stay alive. It sounds a lot like Exodus, and just like that book in the bible itself, DEFIANCE shows how tough it is to stick together. There's a group trying to discourage a number of people, some are complaining, some think it's best to go back to the ghetto, some start questioning the leader, and some decide to take power into his own hand and try to divide and conquer. Edward Zwick's direction makes sure the audience can see that the struggle they face is not just about running away from the Germans, but also the threats from within caused by frustration, fear and lack of good judgment. And just like his previous movies, it ain't a Zwick movie if you don't have a final ultimate battle at the end scene, between two opposing sides, in the middle of a vast field. Another amazing work on the original score by James Newton Howard that gives us an intense, pulse-pounding feeling during the battle and the sad, dramatic mood during their travel. The cinematography by Eduardo Serra beautifully captures the surrounding nature and displays how it takes its toll on the characters.The story is disturbingly profound and compelling. There's one lead theme that resounds throughout the entire movie "We may be hunted like animals, but we will not become animals". As the leader, Daniel Craig's character, Tuvia, keeps getting confronted by this. He tries to be an idealist, and his brother, Liev's Schreiber's character, Zus, thinks that kind of mindset would only invite threat and danger. But as the story progresses, Tuvia gradually realizes that they're in the middle of war and the lines between justice and humanity have become uncertain in these desperate times. A German officer is caught by the group and he just stands there as they beat the German to death. At one point he's even forced to kill one of his own. What separates us from animals? The ability to have remorse after we commit vengeance and do our violent bidding? Zus believes that Jews, Russians, whichever, are all the same when fighting a common enemy but he comes to terms with the fact that he will never escape the fact that he is a Jew and it's the only values he has left to hold on to, its what kept him from becoming less than a human being.Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell both give excellent performances and are just right for the role but we can agree that this move belongs to Daniel Craig. He seems to like playing a Jew who kicks ass. As I watch DEFIANCE, I'm reminded by his line from Munich, "Don't F*ck With The Jews" Years from now, he won't be remembered just as another James Bond, but also a talented actor who likes to take on challenging roles and complete them with the utmost respect. Craig in DEFIANCE shows a wide range of ability, you can see through his eyes the burdens of leadership, the not knowing what exactly to do but he's got all these people looking up to him. I wouldn't have thought Craig to be this versatile when I watched him in the movie Lara Croft: The Tomb Raider, years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was able to see this movie before it officially got out, and i was very impressed with this movie. I was dying to see Defiance because i'm a huge Jamie Bell fan, and the story seemed really interesting, but i was kind of worried cause Daniel Craig is not exactly one of my favorite actors, but he really impressed me. I think this is his best movie yet. And it's not just the acting, but i think the way they told this story is very efficient, and the sets were incredible. I think they truly stuck to the story of what really happened back then, and believe me, you will not be disappointed with this movie. Jamie Bell was wonderful as Asael (as usual), Liev Schreiber was great, and Daniel Craig was just as great. In my opinion, this movie is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie based on facts about resistance fighters in the Belarus forests</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting film about a bunch of Jews commanded by Bielski brothers taking the Belorussia forest to shelter from Nazi criminals.This is a true story , worth telling and stunningly directed in old-style by Edward Zwick. It's completely set on the woods which it does some claustrophobic. Splendid acting acting by all star cast. Nicely photographed by Eduardo Serra with a colorful palette. Emotive and sensible musical score by James Newton Howard. The picture is inspired on real events based on the novel titled ¨ Defiance : The Balski partisans ¨ , being well adapted by Clayton Frohman and Edward Zwick. The actual events are the following : The Bielski group's partisan ( three brothers finely performed by Daniel Craig,Liev Schriever, Jamie Bell) activities were aimed to hold the Jewish community together and fight against the Nazis and their collaborators, such as Belarusian volunteer policemen or local inhabitants who had betrayed or killed Jews. They also conducted sabotage missions. The Nazi regime offered a reward for assistance in the capture of Tuvia (Daniel Craig) Bielski, and in 1943, led major clearing operations against all partisan groups in the area. Some of these groups suffered major casualties, but the Bielski partisans fled safely to a more remote part of the forest, and continued to offer protection to the noncombatants among their band.The Bielski group would raid nearby villages and forcibly seize food ; on occasion peasants who refused to share their food with the partisans were the subject of violence and even murder. This caused hostility towards the partisans from peasants in the villages, though some would help the Jewish partisans.The Bielski partisans eventually became affiliated with Soviet organisations in the vicinity of the Naliboki Forest under Russian General ( in the movie Panchenko played by Ravil Isyanov). Several attempts by Soviet partisan commanders to absorb Bielski fighters into their units were resisted, such that the Jewish partisan group retained its integrity and remained under Tuvia Bielski's command. This allowed him to continue in his dedication to protect Jewish lives along with engaging in combat activity, but would also prove a problem later on. The Bielski partisan leaders split the group into two units, one named Ordzhonikidze, led by Zus (Liev Schreiber), and the other Kalinin, commanded by Tuvia (Daniel Craig). According to partisan documentation, Bielski fighters from both units killed a total of 381 enemy fighters, sometimes during joint actions with Soviet groups. 50 members of the group were killed. In the summer of 1944, when the Soviet counteroffensive began in Belarus and the area was taken over by the Soviets, the Kalinin unit, numbering 1,230 men, women and children, emerged from the forest and marched into Nowogrodek.Despite their previous collaboration with the Soviets, relations quickly worsened. The NKVD started interrogating the Bielski brothers about the rumours of loot they had reportedly collected during the war, and about their failure to "implement socialist ideals in the camp". Asael Bielski (Jamie Bell)was conscripted into the Soviet Red Army and fell in the Battle of Königsberg in 1945. The remaining brothers escaped Soviet-controlled lands, emigrating West. After the war, Tuvia Bielski returned to Poland, then emigrated to present-day Israel in 1945. Tuvia and Zus eventually settled in the United States. They operated a successful trucking business. When Tuvia died in 1987, he was buried in Long Island, NY, but a year later, at the urging of surviving partisans in Israel, he was exhumed and given a hero's funeral at the hillside graveyard in Jerusalem. His wife, Lilka (Alexa Davalos), was buried beside him in 2001. None of the Bielskis ever sought any recognition or reward for their actions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never written a review on The IMDb, but this movie has prompted me to write a review. Its pointless to go over where and how I saw this movie. It is sufficient to say that I saw it with high hopes. In my eyes, it was a huge failure and waste of time. There are few redeeming qualities in this film. The costumes look great, and there is an appropriate mixture of Russian and German weapons mixed into the camp as one would expect in a camp like this. The brothers power struggle is believable and compelling. There is a lot lacking however. I spent the whole film hoping and trying to find any signs of an enjoyable film. There were regrettably not many. The stereotypes of Russians, Germans, and Jews abound and detract from the plot which is never able to engage the viewer. The way the story is presented leaves the viewer no reason to be compelled, and the cliché moments in the film, that try to draw emotion, never achieve their purpose. The end of the movie is far too predictable and embarrassing. James Bond makes an appearance as savior of the Jews as he runs around killing a whole German tank division with their own gun, and being saved by his brother right when all seems lost. This movie is ridiculous, and I feel let down as I was hoping for something great the whole time I watched, but only got to see this poorly made and clichéd film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potentially Good Story But Unfocused Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tells the story of a lesser known aspect of World War 2 in Eastern Europe, about the Bielski brothers, Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. They were Belarussian Jews who were forced to hide out in the forests because Germans destroyed their village and massacred their families. There they end up leading more than a thousand other Jewish survivors to freedom. Their flight inevitably drew parallelisms to no less than the book of Exodus.I did not like the storytelling too much as it was too disjointed and episodic. The drama was not told in an emotionally involving way. There were scenes that show the Bielski group rob and kill German sympathizers. There was a scene where the Jews beat a captured German officer to death. There was scene where Tuvia led his band of Jews to cross a river. Then there was the climactic (bur unrealistic) scene where the Jews fight and win over a group of fully-armed Germans with a tank. Yet there seems to be no fluidity that bind these scenes together.The actors who played the Bielski brothers do not look like brothers at all. Daniel Craig, who played the idealistic eldest brother Tuvia, looked miscast to me in particular. He did not look like he belonged with the rest of the Jews he led. Liev Schrieber (as the more aggressive Zus) and Jamie Bell (as the young Asael) were more realistic and successful in their portrayal.Technically, the movie looked average and unrealistic. The art direction and make-up looked haphazard. The editing of the gun battles was erratic. Even the Oscar-nominated musical score was not really memorable. And the overall direction by Edward Zwick seemed without a unifying focus, wasting a potentially good storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring But Not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt that "Defiance" is a very inspiring movie. Set during the winter of 1941-42, just after Nazi Germany has attacked the Soviet Union, the movie follows the exploits of the 3 Bielski brothers, who watched their father be murdered by German troops and escape into the forest, only to end up becoming a rallying point and leaders for other displaced Jews. The movie portrays rivalries among the brothers themselves, rivalries within the group of Jews they're leading, difficulties in dealing with the Soviet troops, who should be their allies, as well as the hardships of dealing with hunger, cold and illness. Ultimately it leads to a pretty good climactic fight against Nazi troops. Yet, for all that I can't say it's great.I've seen better and more inspiring Holocaust-inspired movies: think "Schindler's List," "The Grey Zone," and even the fictional "Jakob the Liar." Although the last half hour or so, leading up to the confrontation with the Germans, was quite good, I thought the movie was inconsistent up to that point. It lacked flow, and failed completely to draw me in tightly to the story. If it's at all accurate (and I'm not at all familiar with the events on which it's supposed to be based) then it certainly is a story that deserves to be told, but in truth I can't give it higher than a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've registered here just to write that I'm amazed by some reviews pointing that Zwick was inaccurate or illiterate when making his film. And it's really amusing to read that 'partisans couldn't speak Russian because Naliboki was a Polish town'.Naliboki is a town in the very center of present Belarus. It's a point were cultures mixed. For many centuries everybody here mastered at least 3 languages, and elder Belski spoke 6 of them: Yiddish, Hebrew, Polish, Belarusian, Russian, German. It's not so impossible, I may assure you:)Actually, Russian is appropriate only in episodes when Zus Belski talks to a Soviet partisans' commander - that guy was from Moscow. I'm pretty sure, that in reality Jews talked to their neighbors in Yiddish and got answers in Polish or Belarusian. As for Belskies, they where the only Jewish family in their village, so they should master Slavic languages perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I'm not a religious type and know little of any details from the stories of the bible, the parallels this old-fashioned adventure story draws with Moses leading the chosen are unmistakable (although the events depicted here - based on fact, apparently - are on an undeniably smaller scale: instead of a parting of the Red Sea we get a wade through marshland).Such lofty aspirations leave Ed Zwick's film open to questions about the wisdom of such a decision at best, and ridicule at worst. Needless to say, it's best to take the film's claims of authenticity with a pinch of salt and perhaps to overlook the pretentiousness at its core.At the end of the day, Defiance is an old-fashioned war film that could easily have been made back in the forties or fifties. The story has been told a thousand times in a thousand different forms, and its' familiarity means the long running time becomes something of a chore. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber give a good account of themselves as the brothers who find themselves leading a band of Jewish refugees from the Nazis, but the complexities of their relationship are only touched upon, meaning that key moments such as Zus's decision to join the Russian partisans seem to come out of the blue, with no accumulation of incidents to justify his choice.Most other characters, other than Jamie Bell as the youngest brother, are genre stereotypes: the Jewish teacher, the Jewish intellectual, the stern Russian commander, etc, which lends the entire thing a 'by the numbers' feel that means the audience is never as involved in the refugee's plight as they ought to be. The film has its moments, and often looks beautiful, but you'll watch the end credits with the feeling that you've seen it all before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lies and Incompetence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: A trio of brothers in Nazi-occupied Belorussia hide in the woods to try and save their fellow Jews whilst fighting the Nazis.Since the Second World War there has always been a certain amount of controversy amongst Jews over the near-total lack of resistance by the Jews to the Holocaust. Many great writers, amongst whom I particularly recommend Vassily Grossman, have tried to work out why the Jews (mostly) didn't fight back. Now comes DEFIANCE which tries to give us heroic Jewish partisans who protect their people and strike out at the Nazis whilst making the sort of speeches about freedom that American films inevitably make, regardless of period or suitability.Unfortunately the film is a lie, which rather undermines its message. In reality the brothers collaborated with the Soviets during the joint Soviet-Nazi invasion of Poland. Understandably their neighbours loathed them for this so when the Nazis came the Bielskis were attacked and driven into the forest. There they set up a camp which gradually attracted more and more refugee Jews. Far from fighting the Nazis and attacking tanks, as the film depicts, they spent most of the war trying to survive. Which meant banditry as they attacked and robbed local villages. Not only that but they joined up with the Soviets again - one of the brothers might even have entered into the NKVD - and betrayed Polish nationalist (anti-Nazi, anti-Soviet) partisans. They even massacred a whole village of Poles on one occasion, even killing the women and children. So, not exactly the heroic freedom fighters the film depicts.Of course the film is also terribly made so that doesn't matter too much. Whilst the script is mere fiction the direction is terrible. Moments that ought to be shocking, such as the discovery of a mass grave, are completely lacking in horror or sensitivity. The usual clichés - white horses, re-enactors with overly-clean uniforms, an ambush threatened when the enemy stop and one of them begins to urinate on the exact bush a partisan is hiding behind - are ticked off one by one. Despite costing several tens of millions of dollars the whole thing looks cheap. The film never achieves the horror, the immediacy or the reality of the partisan lifestyle. Nor is there any feeling of what eking out survival in the forest is really like. It doesn't exactly help either that two of the three leads, Daniel Craig and Jamie Bell, both look more like Nazis than the bad guys. The whole thing carries on in a wholly predictable manner to its obvious and unsatisfying conclusion. Watch COME AND SEE instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a lot better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defiance (2008) tells the story of the Bielski brothers who constructed a community of their own in the Belarussian forests during the Second World War and fought against Nazi Germans in the process. The film is based on a true story which I'm not very familiar with but I'm sure the Hollywood studios have had their hand in the mix because the finished story here has a very overly "heroic" theme in it and the story feels very one-sided and "simplified for the masses". There's multiple scenes which try to show different sides to the story and the events at hand and try to throw some shades of gray into the otherwise black and white way of seeing the world but all those scenes suffer from a heavy underlining and they only scratch the surface of the issues that should have been explored more deeply - like the tension between the campers, the nature of the Nazi soldiers, the nature of the Jews etc. This all ends up to the fact that the story told here is a very shallow one and feels through-out very "Hollywood-ish".It's no surprise that the story feels so shallow: Edward Zwick's (director, co-writer) isn't the most gifted man working in Hollywood. He seems to do the same movie over and over again; The Last Samurai (2003), Blood Diamond (2006) and Defiance feel very much the same when it comes down to the theme and nature of the stories and the films. The films even have the same gritty look that admittedly works.The cinematography, editing and the visual look (with sets, wardrobe etc.) are the film's strongest sides. Everything looks appropriate and the editing grabs you along for the ride. Edward knows how to make interesting looking Hollywood films, I just wish he would give as much attention to the story and the dialog as he gives to the visuals.Because the dialog and acting (along with the story) were the things I had the most issues with. The dialog is horrible: why, oh why did they decide to make the characters speak bad English with a heavy "East European" -accent? Why not make them speak English right or make the whole film with the other languages and put some subtitles on it? I mean, they speak horrible and barely understandable English to each other &#x2013; does the accent bring some value to the film? Does it make the film feel more original or what's the point? Or were they just hiding their lacking writing skills by producing simple and horrible sounding dialog? At least it's a nice way to get a way with it...Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber as the Bielski bros. make the best they can with the bad dialog written for them and they manage to do a decent job with it, the rest of the cast doesn't really deserve any praise.Defiance is a very mediocre and uninspiring film that lacks any real thought or emotion. It looks good but it doesn't have anything to say or comment on anything &#x2013; it just "is". The short action scenes aren't very interesting and the CGI used in them won't be bringing any awards home. The film relies heavily on drama and the interaction between the characters which all is ruined by the garbage they call dialog. Could have been a way better film. 2/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward Zwick Is Not A Skilled Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is little to nothing that distinguishes Defiance from every other WWII and Holocaust film I have ever seen. Less than that, in fact. It rips off greater films and offers nothing new to the table.But the performances in Defiance were worthy of attention. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber play a pair of brothers who have decided to not be part of the body count left in the wake of the Nazis' decimation. Their performances are strong and come from a pair of actors who have given a lot into their roles. And I would say that most of the actors in this film follow that, in spite of the little characterization given out of the screenplay written by Clayton Frohman and Edward Zwick. I refuse to believe that the story from which they based their screenplay had such poor character development. I wanted to know something about the characters who were fighting for their lives, but we got very little of that. And what we did get was unsatisfactory. This was a film that was far more interested in giving the "uplifting message" rather than giving audiences a decent story.And nothing shows that more than the extremely obvious similarities between this film and Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, two vastly superior films. There is even a moment during one of the battle scenes in which the commanding character has a bomb go off by his head and the film starts going in slow motion. That scene is almost a shot-by-shot rip off of Saving Private Ryan.The one part of the film that truly impressed me was the music. I loved the soundtrack of this film. The music was easily the best part of the movie, and I wish the rest had matched that. But it didn't. Director Edward Zwick is not a skilled director. When he is not stealing material from Steven Spielberg's films, he is taking inspirational speech scenes directly from Braveheart, even putting in the extra effort in allowing the commander to ride a horse during the speech, even though I'm pretty sure the character does not ride the horse for the rest of the picture.Does Defiance have anything to offer audiences? Not in the slightest. Are there qualities of this movie worthy of attention? Not really. Does this movie do anything to truly make itself its own film with its own story? Unsatisfactorily, no.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Amazing WWII Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this was a very pretty film in high-definition, probably because most of the shots were in beautiful forests. The colors and the details on all the trees was astounding.Secondly, the two lead performances were excellent. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber, who played Jewish brothers ("Tuvia and Zus Bielski," respectively) with different outlooks on how to survive and/or fight the Nazis, were riveting. It reminded me of "Munich," where you also hear two points of view on how to react to terrorists.The story offered a good mix of action, drama and even some romantic touches. In addition to the two male leads, the women in here were interesting, too.Although about two hours, 20 minutes in length, I was never bored. Only one short segment in the film - a battle scene with Nazis and a tank out in the middle of a forest - lacked credibility. Otherwise, there were no complaints. It was an amazing based-on-a-true story picture and well done with good production values.I wonder how many other amazing real-life WWII stories are still out there, that many of us don't know about?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defiance... And an Aryan will lead them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defiance: 4 out of 10: I have a soft spot for director Edward Zwick. I have a real soft spot for his Blood Diamond flick despite its pedestrian script and subconscious racism. In addition, The Last Samurai is another film of his that I loved despite its historical inaccuracies and bizarre lead casting. Defiance shares many of the same endemic faults that plagued those two films. I was not able to brush the faults off this time; I found them even more discordant as the film went on.Problem number one is Daniel Craig. He does not look like an Eastern Polish Jew. He looks like he misplaced his Oberstleutnant uniform at the Wehrmacht&#x2019;s cleaners. Even if you were able to accept Daniel Craig as some sort of Paul Newman style Jew who parachuted into Eastern Europe, only Helen Keller would buy him as Lev Schreiber&#x2019;s brother. A mutant dancing Australian is a more believable brother for Schreiber than Craig is.In fact, Craig and Schreiber seem to be in two different films and Schreiber is in the much better one. Schreiber seems to be in the here and now with a strong subtle performance that is the best thing in the film. Daniel Craig&#x2019;s performance is as shaky as his accent. He, of course, is forced to do things like give Braveheart speeches from the back of a white horse, so the fault is hardly his alone. And saying platitudes such as &#x201c;Our vengeance is to live" and "Every day of freedom is like an act of faith" while gazing at the camera with those, just give me an Oscar and I will go back to entertaining you, baby blues doesn't help his cause either.Problem number Two is best summarized by one of my favorite ladies I don't think we really need another film about the Holocaust, do we? It is like, how many have there been, you know. We get it. It was grim. Move on. No, I am doing it because I have noticed that if you do a film about the Holocaust you are guaranteed an Oscar ... That is why I am doing it. Schindler's bloody List. The Pianist. Oscars coming out of their arse. &#x2014; Kate Winslet (Winner of the 2008 Best Actress Oscar for Holocaust drama The Reader) in Extras, 2005Defiance is clearly Oscar bait. In one scene Daniel &#x201c;Moses&#x201d; Craig leads his people through the reeds and swamps and away from the forest (and inexplicably away from decent cover and fortifications) until a Rabbi collapses, sputters out "I almost lost my faith but you were sent by God to save us&#x201d; and then promptly dies... oy vey. It really is not that easy to make a mainstream Holocaust film, release it in December, and get no nominations* for Golden Globes or Oscars. Defiance is clearly trying too hard.The third problem is that a third rate cast of Fiddler on the Roof somehow showed up lost in the woods. Somebody call the Jewish stereotype prison, cause there has been a mass escape. Everyone is here. The nebbish intellectual who cannot hammer a nail, the passive Jews who are unwilling to fight, the greedy Jew more interested in money than his fellow man. Good lord, it is as if Leni Reisenthal&#x2019;s travelling troop of stereotypes showed up. Thank goodness, Daniel Craig is here to straighten them all out and lead them to the Promised Land. Yup blond blue eyed Daniel Craig&#x2026;. Yeah the movie has issues. *No nominations except, inexplicably, for its score; which at two hours of crying violins will test any ones nerves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bielski Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the II World War the Germans invaded the Belarussian soils, initiated there ultimate genocide, partly with the help of local civil servants. Jews are first to be stigmatised, thrown in throes into ghettos from which there is no return. The Bielski family of three peasant Jewish brothers: Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber) and Asael (Jamie Bell) are amongst the very few to withstand oppression forming their own brigade in the local forests - aimed at protecting and defending what is left of their kin. Soon become almost folkloric heroes - Jews who fight, not just let themselves be slaughtered by the Nazi forces.Based on historical figures the story is far from meticulous, instead taking vast creative liberties, which - knowing the true history - seems almost a waste of a good story. Some aspects are 'Hollywoodized', but thankfully the backbone remains strong and never backs away from confronting morality during total war with that during peace. The most striking moment in the movie involves Tuvia having to assert his commanding position in the brigade, else all he constructed would be at risk. Reaction must be brutal and relentless, but the reality justifies even cold-blooded murder of one of his own. Such aspects are touched throughout, when severe choices must be made, and the Bielski brothers are sure to make them, a far cry from the more clear-cut actions of Arthur Schindler.In Poland the movie received some criticism for omitting the darker side of Bielski actions, inclusive of fighting Polish freedom militia, but honestly I had no issue with this (the 'russicized' English accents of characters and poor grammar of the tidbits of Russian were much more detrimental), as the brigade was portrayed perfectly as a self-serving and brutal unit devoted to saving those whom they protect, irrespective of external pain they bring. "Defiance" ventures into grey areas of heroism, where the saviours are dabbled in blood and far from respectable, instead hateful, vengeful, but at the same time necessary. As the small group expands to a self-sustaining society living in the Belarussian woods, the stance of the brothers grows increasingly and justifiably uncompromising. Although the script attempts to whitewash the Bielskis by offering them lines such as "We will only take from those who can afford it", making them into Robin Hood's seemed to trivialise them, instead it would have been better served to follow the logic of survival needs. The feature could have also probably done better without the trivial inclusions of forced dramaturgy or a big getaway with Bielskis figthing tanks, instead staying with the bare basics...Nonetheless "Defiance" works best as a fiction, not as a recount of history. Here reading one of the monographes dedicated to the Bielski brothers would be better served.</fullReview>

Bad casting.The gaggle of Jews are so stereotyped it's embarrassing, bordering on offensive. The film tries to be emotional and deep by playing LOTS and LOTS of sad violin music in the forest !! Like a lot of American films on IMDb with big name Hollywood actors ,the masses rate them highly, a lot of people just generally have low levels of intelligence when it comes to films, music etc.., so they're easily satisfied by what APPEARS to be a deep, intelligent film.Films that actually do have amazing acting, writing, directing etc are rated low on IMDb!

		<shortDescription>Great Zwick film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Defiance" has similarities to the story told in "Schindler's List". At first glance, it seems that trying to recreate another story about the Holocaust showing the bitter side, but also more hopeful and courageous of WWII.A movie like that once made Spielberg in theory can never displease. However there are some few examples where the same subject as this is in Resistencia unnoticed, even criticized, as is the case with "The Grey Zone".In "Defiance", Zwick is able to portray the confusion and different ways of thinking and acting of those persecuted by the Nazis. It is not an easy task, because at times the story is shown with great simplicity, all of which would generate more than a movie. But history in part requires it. It takes some action, not only in the military sense, but in the plot. Disputes between brothers and between the members of the community are logical and decisive for the plot. The weight of the lead protagonist of a great mass of people is carried with difficulty and is not just impose his voice. His motivations are not clear in the film, because he certainly not really know.The Nazi regime offered a reward for assistance in the capture of Tuvia (Daniel Craig) Bielski, and in 1943, led major clearing operations against all partisan groups in the area. Some of these groups suffered major casualties, but the Bielski partisans fled safely to a more remote part of the forest, and continued to offer protection to the noncombatants among their band.The Bielski group would raid nearby villages and forcibly seize food ; on occasion peasants who refused to share their food with the partisans were the subject of violence and even murder. This caused hostility towards the partisans from peasants in the villages, though some would help the Jewish partisans.The Bielski partisans eventually became affiliated with Soviet organisations in the vicinity of the Naliboki Forest under Russian General ( in the movie Panchenko played by Ravil Isyanov). Several attempts by Soviet partisan commanders to absorb Bielski fighters into their units were resisted, such that the Jewish partisan group retained its integrity and remained under Tuvia Bielski's command. This allowed him to continue in his dedication to protect Jewish lives along with engaging in combat activity, but would also prove a problem later on. The Bielski partisan leaders split the group into two units, one named Ordzhonikidze, led by Zus (Liev Schreiber), and the other Kalinin, commanded by Tuvia (Daniel Craig). According to partisan documentation, Bielski fighters from both units killed a total of 381 enemy fighters, sometimes during joint actions with Soviet groups. 50 members of the group were killed. In the summer of 1944, when the Soviet counteroffensive began in Belarus and the area was taken over by the Soviets, the Kalinin unit, numbering 1,230 men, women and children, emerged from the forest and marched into Nowogrodek.Despite their previous collaboration with the Soviets, relations quickly worsened. The NKVD started interrogating the Bielski brothers about the rumours of loot they had reportedly collected during the war, and about their failure to "implement socialist ideals in the camp". Asael Bielski (Jamie Bell)was conscripted into the Soviet Red Army and fell in the Battle of Königsberg in 1945. The remaining brothers escaped Soviet-controlled lands, emigrating West. After the war, Tuvia Bielski returned to Poland, then emigrated to present-day Israel in 1945. Tuvia and Zus eventually settled in the United States.Definitely great film highly recommended and very entertaining, I think is one of the best of Zwick films, very good it not disappoint</fullReview>

It is not made like any other war movie nor any other action movie, but a film about survival which gives a really fresh new look on a war period which is over-glamourised in films for so long.Although this means a great lack of action and the usual casualties of war, all these are compensated by a bold testimony of their commitment to never stop being strong and stay alive for each other.Nevertheless, the plot could have been made much better. Some scenes are unnecessary and some could be improvised. Although there are scenes that are pretty solid and deliver strong messages that keep me glued on despite a slow pace. Individual performances are just right and satisfactory, everyone acted really well for their roles including Craig.I am glad to come across a film where some Jews, in WW2, died by natural death and not by the hands of the Germans. Probably the best reason why i don't hate this film ( In fact Schindler's List failed to impress me).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Dullest Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two hours plus of phony mock east European accents (like the ones from the TV series Mission Impossible made in the 60's set usually in a town called Plotnik, in a country called Brudny, where the team has to steal a plutonium warhead)are very trying. As everyone was a Pole- there was no Latvia,or Lithuania- and the foes were either Russian or German, it would have made more movie sense for the Westerners to speak in natural English accents, with only the baddies having accents- and no need for subtitles then- which would have made it easier on distribution as well as less painful to the ear. As the film goes now- every one has an accent for over two hours. whether they have to or not. Two: It is a worthy topic, having so far been ignored by film makers. But why is it so dull? the camera work is good, the film stock grading is OK, the editing a little perfunctory, the direction so-so, which means the casting and the script must be to blame. To have James Bond in the lead was to guarantee distribution- but there was no one else to have the eye rest easy. Liev Shreiber has that face that is made for difficult roles. Obviously talented, but somehow yes he showed there was tension between those who supported the Russians and those who didn't- but as a film....it's a different case. The other vignettes about Jewish stereotypes- put two intellectuals together and you get three opinions- the Rabbi, the school teacher, the man hungry woman, the comely lass, were just those. It's from a WELCOME TO ISRAEL KIBBUTZ pack for beginners. I found it irritating: just why, I have been thinking overnight, it's a combination of things, mainly they come under the heading just not good enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing waste of an interesting story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard an interesting interview w/ Zwick on NPR and thus, looked forward to this film. The reality was utterly disappointing. I couldn't believe how unconvincing and uninvolving it was. But I never was drawn into the story and few of the characters were compelling as they so easily could have been, were the script even a bit better. I watch a lot of foreign films, so I'm usually the last to say a film is boring b/c it's slow--instead, I'd say the poor script, uneven acting, and terrible casting is what did it in. I felt somehow cheated of my $10 when the credits rolled.Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell, who are both excellent actors, did well with what they were given--in fact, I would have found Schreiber more convincing in the lead role, and it's sad that he didn't get the role due to Daniel Craig's star power being so heavily counted on for the marketing of this film. Craig was, instead, a casting mistake in more ways than one: no WAY could he pass as Schreiber's brother--I know the real Tuvia was supposed to look more white than the others, but I've seen his real photo, and not only did he resemble his brothers--he didn't look even CLOSE to Aryan!) Still, in spite of their commendable efforts to make the often-cheesy script work, the poor choice to make the Jews from Poland and Belarus speak horribly-accented English while the Russians and Germans spoke their native languages was a disaster and hurt the actors' credibility--I thought that the rule of thumb is that you choose one or the other if you don't want to make your film come off as false.Worse, there was some spectacularly bad acting/lines--almost classic TLC/Hallmark movie stuff...i.e. cheesy choruses of "I'll go." "Me too!" I'll go." "I will also go." Or: "I have a belt." "Me too!" "I have a belt, too." "Take my belt!" The screenwriters also failed many opportunities to develop the other characters, which almost all came off as two-dimensional and sometimes even fake. All the story potential to create moving drama was wasted.The script stalled and meandered, and failed to make us invest more in the characters. Mediocre photography also didn't help. All this without the fact that there was a ton of tinkering done with the actual historical accounts of these events. The more controversial inaccuracies aside, I still think the melodramatizing and sensationalizing of the story really was a disservice to those who actually lived through it (regardless of whether the brothers were really womanizing bullies or not). Still, it seemed disingenuous to not say "inspired by a true story" in the beginning--instead, now there a ton of people who are taking this Hollywood version as a documentary. Could go on and on, but this was so disappointing on so many levels that there's no point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a perfect WWII film, but overall, a compelling one about bravery and determination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard about this movie earlier this year, while it was playing it theatres. I knew it was about the Holocaust, and that Daniel Craig played the lead role. Unlike many people, I like Craig's portrayal of James Bond, which was what introduced me to the actor. (I had previously seen him in the cheesy "A Kid in King Arthur's Court", but didn't know who he was.) I didn't see "Defiance" on the big screen, but it is now out in the DVD format. A copy of it caught my eye at the video store just yesterday, so I decided to rent it. Before I watched it, I knew it wasn't the most highly regarded film set during the Holocaust, and was criticized by some for historical inaccuracy (obviously), but after seeing it myself, I have to say I'm impressed.In World War II, as Jewish people in Eastern Europe are hunted down by the Nazis, the Bielski brothers manage to escape from a massacre. After they discover family members of theirs have been killed on their farm, they take refuge in the forest nearby. They meet other Jewish refugees there, who soon unite with them for protection. As time goes by, the number of refugees in the group increases, with people of all different ages, forming an entire community. They are lead by the two elder brothers, Tuvia and Zus Bielski, who disagree on what to do with them, leading to sibling rivalry. As Tuvia tries to help the people in the camp and make sure they follow his rules, they face struggle for survival as they face conflict amongst themselves, starvation, Nazis to fight off (especially when any of them find out where the refugees are), and harsh weather conditions when winter comes! Around the beginning, I was already intrigued, seeing some gripping scenes, such as the brothers finding family members slain on the farm. I wasn't that consistently intrigued by the entire film, it's not perfect, but I was by a lot of it. There was enough to leave me impressed. One thing I can praise this film for is its mostly strong script. There are some weak spots (including some of the romantic scenes), but most of the script is strong, with steady dialogue. Being a film about the Holocaust, you would obviously expect it to be dark and moving, which it often is. With the struggle and tragedies the people in the camp face, plus the bravery and determination, much of the film is touching, especially later on. There's also some nice cinematography here, with beautiful scenery, and I can't complain much about the acting. Most of the cast put on steady performances, including Daniel Craig, which I was expecting, knowing he was a good actor after seeing him play James Bond.As I said, this film has faced criticism for historical inaccuracy, but before I read any of this criticism, I knew from experience that it obviously existed. I think I've yet to see a film based on a true story that has never been criticized for inaccuracy. For that reason, although I'm no history buff, I don't expect movies like this to show all truth and no fiction. However, that doesn't mean I'm going to dismiss them all just because of that. Even if "Defiance" isn't that good for a history lesson, it's still a well made film. At the beginning, it does say, "A true story" in the text on the screen, and it would have been better if it said, "BASED ON a true story," instead. Still, while some people will complain about inaccuracy, and I have no problem with that, I have to praise this recent blockbuster for other aspects. Judging it merely as a film and not a biography, it's a good war drama. Not a perfect one, but a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, what idiot wrote the synopsis? There were *four* Bielski brothers who escaped into the woods and they were *all* eventually under arms: Tuvia, Zus (third eldest, in fact), Asael (second eldest) and *Aron*. Secondly, none of the Bielski's intentionally set off to save 1200+ Jews of East Poland and West Belarus. Their struggle was initially and understandably for their own survival after the slaughter of their parents. The "saving" of so many others began by accident and according to conscience, with considerable internal strife. And don't anyone kid themselves, lots of personal scores are settled in wartime. Thirdly, great liberties were taken with history in the Zwick/Frohman screenplay that does not do justice to the detailed facts of the real story of the Bielski otriad and their checkered history prior to and during WW2. The thuggishness of the older Bielski brothers is only very slightly alluded to in the film, under the heavy cover of the ends justifying the means. Regardless of whether or not the Bielski otriad was in anyway involved, the entire matter of the 1943 Naliboki massacre (by Russian partisans, at the very least) is completely omitted from the film. All done to bolster comparisons between Tuvia and Moses. All of that said, I found Defiance to be far more moving, suspenseful and entertaining than Valkyrie and Quantum of Solace combined. The performances by Craig, Schreiber, Bell and MacKay (who plays Aron) combine to deliver a fine piece of ensemble acting. The use of spoken Russian whenever the Bielski otriad dealt with Russian partisans was dramatically appropriate, in order to emphasize the other-ness of the Jewish partisans within the larger Russian resistance to the Nazi invasion/occupation. The use of Eastern European/Yiddish accented English (as a substitute for Yiddish accented Polish), within the Bielski otriad, invites the audience to sympathize, if not identify more, with them easily. These fighters and "malbushim" were thrust together to make history, by equal parts circumstance, choice and necessity. Which is how history is more usually made than by Great Man design. Written history emphasizes that the "success" of the Bielski otriad was rooted in the strategies of survivalism and guerrilla tactics that demanded maximizing evasion and minimizing direct contact and conflict with Nazi forces. The film takes great license with these major points in order to compress the life-and-death stakes of a *three+ year* ordeal into an 137 minute film. The fact that &gt;1200 were saved by the war's end remains undiminished by any of this. For some, this dramatic mish-mash will be unacceptable. For others, it may become an impetus to further study history. In any event, I was nearly moved to guy-tears, at several moments, for the emotional truth that the lead actors brought to their roles. There are many unspoken parallels between the racially segregated units of the US Army fighting in Europe during WW2 and this story, too, where black and brown (rather than Jew) were always more expendable than white. None of the romantic sub-plots offended me, either. See this film, talk about it and then go and try to learn something new from history, if you were moved. I have no sympathy for those who luxuriate in "Holocaust fatigue" and I have no patience with those who think only Jews can be the victims of "pogroms." What happened then is still happening today and what are any of us doing about that? History will judge us no less harshly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DEFIANCE and ZWICK way off base</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hearing Ed Zwick speak at a recent screening of DEFIANCE, it seems that he thinks he and his partner Clayton Frohman have created a masterpiece. Far from it. What they have done is ruin one of the best true stories ever to come out of World War II. Zwick's Hollywood-ized version of the Bielski Partisan unit is full of stereotypical characters (featuring of course the nebbishy Jewish intellectual, the young revolutionary, etc.) and a host of sugarcoated scenes that defy imagination. It's good to finally see a film about Jewish fighters, but aside from a few action sequences featuring Liev Schreiber, this film is more than lame ? it is an affront to all those brave Partisans, who lived through this nightmare.Viewers who are interested in seeing a true representation of what it was like to slog through the marches should rent the Russian film, COME &amp; SEE which presented this sequence in real time (this sequence is also on Youtube). In Zwick's version, a bunch of central casting extras calmly walk through the Belorussian marches as if they are happily on the Yellow Brick Road. The staginess of Zwick's film is almost laughable, were it not for the fact that this film depicts one of the most important historical chapters of the Partisan movement ? how one brave man, Tuvia Bielski managed to save over 1200 innocent men women and children in the forests of Belarussia. Will there be another movie coming out to present this story as it actually happened? Unlikely. Zwick has ruined for all time the chance for this story to told in a truthful way.Adding insult to injury, Zwick's comments on a recent BBC interview, equating the Partisans with the Palestinians, is shameful and disgraceful. Doesn't Zwick know that the "Palestinians" fought on the side of Hitler? Doesn't he know that the Arabs FOUGHT the Partisans and were part of the "Final Solution"? Doesn't he know that Moslem SS units were responsible for some of the most brutal atrocities carried out against the Jews? One would think Zwick would have done some research before making such despicable statements.Lets all hope Zwick doesn't get another chance to make another movie where he presents a distorted and sanitized view of historical events and then uses that as a platform to disgrace the very people his film supposedly honors.</fullReview>

When the WWII ended the Russians was running Poland and they were worse tyrants than the Germans ever were. Polish people doesn't like Russians at all. It's like making a movie about 9/11 and all Americans spoke a Arabic language...wonder what the American audience would feel about that? Probably not accepted and so shouldn't this be!!!!!

		<shortDescription>Favorite War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember turning on TV on a fine Saturday morning and started this movie at breakfast table and two hours later I got off my seat with a slight tears in my eyes. It is about three Jewish brothers defending their lives among with more than thousand by hiding them in the Belarusian forest. Trapped by Nazis and Russian Army and harsh winter, they got to choose between get killed like animals or die as humans, which meant living to the fullest and protecting each other until the last moment. In times of desperation when all the faith in humanity seems lost, these people still find hope for happiness, freedom and the meaning of life no matter what. There are many war films about battle and soldiers and people who have struggled. But the director Edward Zwick has showed us this time little more different than that by taking this incredible story and tells the audience about miracle of bravery, brotherhood and faith. As for the actors Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell did impressive performances for the roles of Bielski brothers, but criticized by their unconvincing Slavic accent. Throughout the film it will give you thrill and excitement of action scene, desperation alongside with joy and a pinch of humor. The memorable quote from movie says "Nothing is impossible, what we all have done is impossible". Just like it says you can do anything with faith and collaboration, not by miracle. So I am strongly advise this film for action and drama seekers, and hope they will learn something from the act of these noble but brave brothers.</fullReview>

The best thing about this film is that they resisted the temptation to turn this into an all out action film, because it really would have done the story a disservice. The dynamics between the characters is really intriguing and there isn't a dull moment. It's full of suspense, emotion and enough action to really give you your fill of pure action.

		<fullReview>After witnessing their Belarussian village being slaughtered in cold blood by Nazis a couple of Jews escape into a heavy forested area to consider how they can get their revenge. However, other Jewish refugees soon join them and it soon becomes apparent to these men that they have to rearrange their priorities from getting revenge to taking care of these desperate people. At least that is what the leader of the group named "Tuvia Bielski" (Daniel Craig) believes. His brother, "Zus Bielski" (Liev Schreiber) wants to take the fight to the Nazis and after awhile joins a brigade of Russian partisans to do exactly that. This movie captures the story of both of these brothers and the challenges that each of them have to face. Now rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that this was an intense movie which did an excellent job in displaying the courage and perseverance of this small band of Jewish people living in Eastern Europe during this particular time. Definitely a good and memorable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber are well cast in this war drama/thriller. They are very believable as eastern European tough guy brothers with a softer side.It is the story of the relationship between these brothers (there's also a third brother) that makes this movie work. It's set in the context of a dramatic but ultimately uplifting story of a group of Jews who hide out in the forests to avoid persecution during World War II.I was unsure quite how realistic the movie was. It is based on a true story but it is hard to believe so many people could build extensive structures in the forests without being discovered and get anywhere near enough food to eat, never mind going head to head with tanks in a firefight. It felt a little too good to be true. But it's hard to judge - it says it's a true story and who am I to argue.All in all this is a good war drama that sheds light on a story few of us will have heard of before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching this film all I knew was that it was a world war 2 film with Daniel Craig and Liv Schreiber in it and I was interested and I must say it was an enjoyable experience. This is the true story of two Jewish brothers attempting to survive from the Nazis while building a working civilization for the other refugees around them. Now the co-leads of Craig and Schreiber are both great and I truly believed in their performances and they were definitely the best parts of the film. However, the same cannot be said about the other characters in the film there isn't a true villain and all the love interests and allies are lacklustre and fail to impress among two great performances. Another performance is that of the story which is gripping as these people are relatable as we have all heard stories about the Jews in World war 2 and we can only imagine how it could have felt and with the setting the story is good throughout. The script is not the best as because of the accents being put on it is sometimes hard to understand some people which can hurt the viewing. The style is really good and when the battles take place they are pretty cool with a realistic gritty approach to them. However, a big negative is that the ending is so sudden and it just ends with you wanting more then what you got which leaves this is a good solid film but not an all time great like Schindlers list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Defiance is a biographical story of the Forest camp in Belurussia under which 1000 of Jews survived the relentless persecution by the Nazis. The story talks about the struggles and sacrifices of Bielski brothers to protect thousands of Jews under their watch.The shooting sequences in the film between Jews and Germans are exciting and terrifying at the same time. The bloodshed and injustices done to the Jews by Germans, as shown in the film, are downright inhumane and shocks the viewers. The setting of the forest marks the tone of danger that lurks around at every corner.Even though these incidents happened almost 70 years ago, they are absolutely relevant in modern day world where every minor community prefers dealing with injustices done to with the concept of "an eye to an eye". The movie presents how building up a new community with peaceful co-habitation could be a proper way to deal with religious persecution, rather than always seeking revenge, and becoming an animal in the process.The title of the movie is absolutely appropriate as the movie is about the struggles of Jews to survive. Their "Defiance" lies in their act of non-compliance to the death orders issued against them by Hitler's Germany.This is not just another movie about holocaust. This movie is more about human relations at the time of war and how connecting with others can help you survive.Defiance is definitely a must watch cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defying the human condition in times of crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as WW II/Holocaust movies go, Edward Zwick's Defiance is basically the Spartacus version of the bunch, as opposed to the likes of Schindler's List (which, if you want to further draw comparisons with Roman epics of old, has more overtones of Quo Vadis or The Robe, in which a man "in league with the enemy" opens his eyes to the shameful horrors inflicted on the minority and turns to their aid). The specific act of defiance this movie revolves around is mere survival in a world where the Jewish minority has been sentenced to death under the ruthless rule of the German Third Reich during the occupation of Poland. As their parents are murdered by the Nazis and their Polish lapdogs, the Bielski brothers retreat into the primordial woods hellbent on revenge. As they are confronted with growing numbers of Jewish refugees also seeking shelter in the forest, the brothers find themselves divided on which course of action to take as those in need of help name them their leaders in the struggle for basic survival. What will it be: vengeance at all costs, or the needs of the many over a personal vendetta? At the heart of the movie is the ideological conflict between the three brothers. The oldest, Tuvia (Daniel '007' Craig), unwittingly finds himself given command over this group, which soon numbers in the hundreds, and first and foremost aims to keep them safe as he feels it is his moral responsibility, like it or not, to do so. His younger brother, the hotheaded Zus (Liev Schreiber) instead feels attacking their persecutors and killing as many Germans as possible takes precedence, and as their rivalry deepens he leaves the camp to join local Soviet resistance cells to do just that. Their younger brothers, including Asael (Jamie Bell) opt to stick with Tuvia. As the forest community grows, so does the risk of being discovered, which soon leads to an all-out assault by the German forces which the refugees have to fight off with little means at their disposal, nor the help of Zus' band of partisans, who will not risk their lives to save Jews. Can Tuvia save "his" people from annihilation, or will the Bielski Jews be massacred despite all their efforts? Only a reconciliation of the brothers seems like it might stay their doom.Defiance proves a chilling war epic (albeit on a smaller budget that most, since this is a more confined movie in terms of characters and locations) making ample use of the assembled talent in front and behind of the camera. Not to mention appropriating the beautiful forest environment to such great effect that it's not hard to conceive of it as a character in itself: lush and warm in summer, but unforgiving and uncompromising in the cold Polish winter, which is as lethal as the human enemy. Against all odds, the community flourishes, but the fear of being rooted out and brutally killed persists. And Zwick doesn't flinch at showing that this new formed society is far from idyllic, as hunger, disease and most of all, basic human behavior, continue to threaten their survival.A story that focuses on the ordeals of man living with man through a period of intense crisis is incomplete if it wouldn't address the issue of man's darker side getting the better of him. Defiance too tells of the strong in the group exploiting the weak, taking their food, sexual integrity and if they resist, their lives. Tuvia soon rises to the occasion of exorcising such immoral behavior from his people by exacting 'zero tolerance' type punishment upon the perpetrators. The Bielksi Jews are not living in a democracy and freedom is still a rather abstract concept, but fortunately Tuvia accepts a role of the benevolent leader who generally has his people's best interest at heart, despite his continuing desire for vengeance. Meanwhile, even among his new brothers in arms, Zus is still an outsider because of his status as a Jew, despite being a formidable fighter. Defiance isn't afraid to admit that antisemitism wasn't limited to the Germans, as the Jews are shown to also suffer under the hands of their Polish neighbours, offering a less black and white view than simply stating 'Germans are bad and all others are good'. As the Germans exploit the Polish population, Poles exploit Jews and even among the refugees Jews are found exploiting other Jews. Tuvia's main act of defiance is rising above such base humanity for the greater good. It does at times make him feel overly saint like, but when he unhesitatingly shoots troublemakers amongst his own people, you know he's still as human as the rest of them.With Defiance, Zwick once again proves himself a certified craftsman of effective historical drama, the kind that encompasses a fine mix of solid acting, dynamic action and thematic value, but for some reason just doesn't stick with you as much as similar movies from better known directors tend to do. Defiance is unmistakably an excellent film, but not in the same league as similar entries in the Holocaust subgenre like Schindler's List or The Pianist, movies with which it cannot avoid comparison because of the subject matter. On the page it all should work, and when watching the movie it does, but afterwards Zwick's movies for some inexplicable reason just seem to slip from mind somehow. Likewise, even though his films have been awarded their fair share of Academy Award nominations, actual wins are few and far between. Nevertheless, upon viewing Defiance defies all sense of whatever shortcomings might plague Zwick's body of work to stand out despite their undeniable quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lesson in Sociology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By its very nature, Defiance is a movie that has an incredible story driving its narrative, so it seems as if it would be hard to "get it wrong" (in a sense). While Zwick tells the story of a community of Jews surviving the Belorussian wilderness in the midst of World War II fairly competently, there isn't much here that can't be found in other classics that deal with this particular time period.In fact, the most fascinating aspect of the film is watching a group of 3 expand into a self-sufficient society. Defiance (oddly enough) feels more like a case study of how individuals jockey for power when separated from just about all external influences. Sociologists will no doubt find it fascinating to watch two intellectuals isolate themselves from the collective whole and discuss politics, etc. while others act as bullies for things as simple as slightly larger portions of food than what the rest of the group receives. While this is all mildly thought- provoking, I didn't have an overwhelming sense that human will can triumph over any hardship as one might expect from such a plot. The film seemed trapped in a purgatory of sorts, hovering somewhere between a scientific analysis of how communities are started (and subsequently evolve) and what it means to be human and exercise control?I'm leaving that purposely ambiguous?in the face of daunting odds. There's nothing inherently wrong with exploring both of these, but, in the case of Defiance, it seemed like it was being stretched far too thin, and should've focused completely on one or the other.So, is this worth paying $10+ to see at a theater? No. Is it worth a rental? Yes, if for nothing more than to gain a little insight into what your sociology professor was trying to explain while you tried not to drool on your desk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two levels to this movie: On one level it is a Hollywood blockbuster, well made and well produced. Many will be interested in this.... But... Look a bit deeper BEFORE you see the movie and it will mean a lot more to you, and you will enjoy it a lot more. Do you enjoy the internet? Free speech? IMDb? Then this movie should mean more to you then the typical Hollywood blockbuster. THIS IS A TRUE STORY.... which makes me take this film 10x more seriously then I would a normal Hollywood blockbuster. I'm a Canadian 30-something and none of my family was involved in WW2, and I'm not Jewish. So I'm pretty much impartial. But I'm still fascinated by it, and very conscious of the sacrifices people paid so that I could post this review. I have enormous respect for those who paid for my freedoms. Enormous, indescribable respect. As should you. You think the world economy is bad, etc etc? Watch this and put things into perspective. If you're younger and don't really see WW2 as being relevant in your life: just wait. As you grow older you look further back to understand where you are coming from and how you ended up where you did. "If you know your history, then you would know where you're coming from." - BMThe first time I saw this film I wasn't terribly impressed - as far as Hollywood flicks go you can get more explosions and action in other films, I gave it about 7/10. What made me watch it again was when I saw a documentary on History Channel about the Bielski brothers. That really hit home and reminded me it wasn't just another flick. THIS WAS REAL. I had to watch it again before I realized: this deserves 9/10.That made me google them, and led me to the Wikipedia page for the Bielski Partisans. I *highly* recommend you see a doc or visit the Wikipedia page BEFORE you see this movie. It really makes you appreciate it more, and lets you know this movie is infinitely more important than The Transformers, etc etc. 20,000+ descendants are alive and well because of what these FOUR brothers did.In western culture, particularly with young people, we tend to think the U.S.A / U.K won the second world war for us. The truth is - the Russians and everyone on the Eastern front were what defeated the Nazis. Google it. This movie is a great example of how they did it, religion is irrelevant here. This is why "we" won the war and still exist to post reviews on websites. In an age where Lady Gaga and the likes are the most famous people on the planet... it really makes ya think... Who is a true hero? A legend? Who should be recorded in the history books for all time? Who among us has saved 1200 lives against all odds?Tuvia, Alexander ("Zus"), Asael, and Aron. Much respect to all veterans, east and west, from a younger person who enjoys his freedom. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame on the professional critics who had a down on this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had very mixed critical reviews when it was released. One wonders if the subject matter had more to do with their comments than the quality of the acting and film itself. Shame on those who fail to see the quality and the high standard of acting and storytelling in this film. Set in Belarus and telling the story of the Bielski Jewish partisans; survivors of the Nazi holocaust and operation Barbarossa, the film explores areas of history not often covered. It is a pleasant surprise to see Daniel Craig playing such a rounded and fully developed character. This isn't a film where the stars are supported by a collection of also ran actors. This is truly an ensemble piece, which stands or falls on the weakest performance. There isn't one, so why the lack lustre initial reviews from those so called 'professional' critics. The film makers set out to show an accurate portrayal of the story as possible based on the real life situations that happened. As is often the case, the real world by far exceeds any ugliness the imagination can dream up and this is shown in ample measure. This film definitely does not leave you with a warm fuzzy, content feeling at the end. It does, however, leave you feeling you've been a participant in something special. Something you'll remember for the rest of your life. This review has been written after the second viewing, with a full 2 years between showings. Why the delay in watching it a second, time if it's so good? A surfeit of something good can leave the palate jaded and I needed to be in the right place to view it again. This film is definitely an acquired taste, but if you've acquired it, then I hope you'll agree it's a gem, that should be judged on its merits, more than its financial returns at the box office. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally love Zwick's movies. His last, Blood Diamond, is one of my all time favorites, and I love the movies he has done with Denzel (Courage Under Fire, The Siege). He seems to mix the perfect amount of emotions, story and action to take a film forward.So it was with high expectations that I approached Defiance. I wouldn't say I was disappointed, but it definitely is not one of his best. The movie is based on the true story of the Bielski brothers, who escaped from the slaughter of Jews in Eastern Europe during WWII, into the Belarussian forests and their attempts to build a self sufficient village there for all the fleeing Jews, as well as their attempts to join the Russian fighters. Over there, through a mixture of compassion, understanding and force, they manage to survive for the years till the war was over.Daniel Craig is great as the older Bielski brother, who does not believe in violence unnecessarily, and who believes that we should not be like the ones who hunt us. His line "We may be hunted like animals, but we will not become animals", is a wonderful reflection of his views. Probably turning in an even better performance than him though is Liev Schreiber as the second Bielski brother who, unlike his brother, believes in using violence to achieve the means, and joins up with the Rusian fighters. The younger brother, played by Jamie Bell, also is convincing as the boy who matures into a man by the end of the movie.Apart from this, the cinematography is also breathtaking at times. while not one of his best, this movie keeps up Zwick's good record.</fullReview>

Even more cringe worthy was the scene in which Zus Bielski raids the Police station. All the Germans die on the first shot, but our hero takes several bullets to the chest and keeps on going. The next day all he has is a flimsy sling around his arm and looks none the worst for wear. He is talking with his brother as if he had only suffered a sprained muscle.The climatic scene with the tank is just ridiculous. First of all, it never happened in real life, but if you are going to include it, at least try to make it realistic, otherwise it degenerates into comedy... Three Stooges type of comedy.In the end the film reminded me of "Inglorious Basterds", it turned into a silly revisionist revenge fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking the much needed emotional and visceral punch to propel it off the screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oppression, human injustice, cruelty, war and rebellion are themes that director Edward Zwick is now more than at home with. With Defiance which sets about to combine most elements from the director's previous works into a somewhat epic, somewhat dramatised account of a true story from the second World War, Zwick strives for greatness yet never achieves anything as such. The problem isn't that Defiance is a bad movie by any means?no, the flaw inherent to much of Defiance's downfall is simply that it neglects to evoke the emotion and attention required of the viewer. It seems throughout that the director simply assumes rather than depicts his story's self-importance. Of course by its very nature, Defiance is a hearty tale built around the overwhelming good that can come of a collective passion for facing adversity with courage and virtue?yet Zwick instead of portraying anything remotely likened to these attributes instead submits a work that feels half-baked and lacking the much needed emotional and visceral punch to propel it off the screen where it unfortunately suffers from a distinct lack of focus on its greater parts. Indeed, while Zwick may be at home with such bitter ingredients of humanity's condition, one has to wonder whether he has gotten too comfortable to be able to truly express them on-screen.If there is one dominant highlight to Defiance however, it is not through the movie's most overt examples of struggle in the many over-the-top action sequences and gun fights, but simply though the drama that permits a grim shadow to overtake all other elements of the feature. As a result, Defiance often struggles to stay afloat in spite of its heavy-handed themes, yet when deeply involving in developing and allowing moments to envelop the viewer, the movie regains its sense of conviction even if it soon dissipates not long after. This focus on human survival and spirit often comes in the form of leader Tuvia Bielski's (Daniel Craig) legion of Jewish non-combatant refuges rescued from the oppression of Germany's invasion of Eastern Europe. While Craig himself is notably off-key here with many moments that border on jarringly appalling, the remainder of the cast more often than not manage to bring with them the sense of humanity and passion that the screenplay sadly lacks. Zwick, at times, neglects to fully capitalise on these attributes and instead shifts the direction of the movie towards more obvious forms of struggle, yet there remains a key motif present within the feature to keep it above water.The action scenes as they stand, despite their insistence on irksomely showing up at all the wrong times, are nevertheless solid and exactly what you would come to expect from director Zwick. Echoing his previous features which range from being overtly action-based to a much more Defiance¬-like "drama with action" stories, this outing for the film-maker pulls out all the stops in crafting somewhat exciting depictions of gunfights and air raids that never take things too far into the glamorised Hollywood domain. Remaining true to the script's realistic, gritty nature based upon actual events, Defiance will more than likely please those looking for a war movie with a little depth rather than vice versa?indeed, the excitement too often overshadows any emotions evoked by other segments within the movie, but only ever distractingly so.When the final credits roll, despite several moments of compelling character drama or action?despite the many stark and breath-taking images that Zwick inflicts upon you?despite such moments, Defiance can't quite escape the fact that it lacks any drive or momentum. The result is a feature that looks like its doing plenty, sounds like its saying a lot and moves exactly as such; but simply does not feel quite as invigorating. To say that Zwick's work here failed to compel me as much as it should have considering its premise and source material would be a grave understatement?Defiance tells an important, true-to-life account of a dark period in recent humanity's struggle to live with itself brimming with gritty realisations of these themes. Yet with a script that fails to give its performers anything of substantive quality to work with, an overlong, overbearing runtime and a barrage of undercooked characters and establishments of atmosphere or tone other than solid grey bleak abandonment; Defiance is too grim for its own good and eventually crumbles under the weight of its own ambition. For what should be an uplifting and revitalising tale steeped in pathos, Defiance is instead only sporadically engaging and lacking in the required heart or passion needed to truly convey the core of its own message.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it all bad "A-films" get a much better score than they deserve? It seems people are happy as long as it has a valid subject matter, high production values and big names, behind and in front of the camera. It is a disgrace this movie has a 7.4 score, although I'm certain it will drop gradually, as movies tend to have a initial high, and subsequently decreasing, score at IMDb. I guess it has something to do with expectations. Plus the fact that people who catches a flick early, loves to hype it. Well back to this movie. For me this was an overwhelmingly unconvincing experience, in terms of acting, dialogue and plot. The dialogue is cancerous with clichés. The amplifying factor for this is the dreaded use of English with heavy eastern-European accents, not only making them prone to weak pronunciation, but also to weak language, making it sound like they are not speaking their mother tongue.At some points, despite the serious subject matter, it all deteriorates into parody, as Liev Schreiber seemingly sustains more damage from banging his head into a tree a couple of times than from multiple gunshots to his body. The latter incident meant certain death I thought for sure, but the next day he had his arm in sling, and that was that! In a later scene, the Germans are right on their heels after an attack on their camp. However, they mysteriously choose to have a coffee break while our protagonist jews are pausing, pondering whether to cross a swamp. Besides being pompous in tone, the movies is filled with these inconsistencies, and in addition it is 2 hours and 15 minutes. I was surprised to see it was directed by Ed Swick, a prominent maker of historical war movies, when the credits rolled. All I can say on the positive side, was that it was prettily shot and the battle scenes were decent, but come on; that goes without saying. Making a good film takes more than production value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defying the odds...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defiance is a film that was so desperate to be made that it's surprising it already wasn't. The story follows a group of Belarusian Jews (inhabiting a now-Polish area) who survived World War II by hiding in the forest. Great underdog appeal exists in a picture like this, but not in Edward Zwick's presentation. His new movie is without direction. It never realizes what it wants to be. There are vast periods of survival drama, interrupted by violent sequences. The film quickly returns to its broodiness, leaving the audience with no feeling of satisfaction for either mood. Nechama Tec's book has been converted into a for-the-most-part accurate film adaptation that is as philistine as it is occasionally moving. Zwick's film leaves another director the opportunity direct a better movie.In 1941, Wehrmacht soldiers were moving through rural areas of Poland and Belorussia to capture remaining Jews. Unlucky persons were killed, or worse, relocated to death camps. Some people survived capture and created living communities in surrounding forests. The Bielski brothers, four young men of one of those hamlets, came to lead the group. The Bielski Partisans saved approximately 1,200 Jewish persons and left behind a lengthy genetic history. The Bielskis also collaborated with Soviet forces on occasion. Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig) was leader of the forest inhabitants, while his brother Zus (Liev Schreiber) worked with the Soviet patrol. Zus eventually left the Soviets and returned to Tuvia's group, which survived until the end of the war.Defiance is an odd movie. It tries to be a war picture when it shouldn't be. Majority of the screen time is spent constructing temporary shelters and organizing community projects. Wikipedia states that the Bielski Partisans created their own village, complete with hospital, school, and gathering area. In the movie, they build many things but always continue moving. I never got the feeling that they were settled. Later shots depict a pre-constructed village while they wait out a winter period. Watching a bunch of starving people survive in the woods wasn't enough for Universal to agree to this project. Many firefight sequences are added to create a "war movie" label for home viewing sales. We don't get our expected big battle scene until the very end. I was tired of watching by that point. Zwick would have been better served to reduce the running time and focus on one aspect over the other. A direct biopic of Zus would work for a war movie, while a Diary of Anne Frank style would be preferable for Tuvia's part. Zwick focuses on both for mutual diluted effect.The screenplay inadequately fumbles to the goal line. Much of it is surprisingly insincere. The Bielskis speak a garbled Eastern European English which lacks a specifically Polish, Belorussian or Yiddish accent. I have worked with several people from these areas in my collegian student group and none sound like that. This discrepancy isn't the most egregious, though. Both Tuvia and Zus can communicate with the Soviets, which was impossible. An intellectual type even declares "I wish the Young Socialist Club could see me now, I haven't read a book for months!" He's been in the brigade for several months when he says this. I can't imagine anyone living in constant fear of death cheerily affecting such speech. Gags like that one are spliced frequently to relive the tedium of nothing happening. I wish Zwick would have invented Nazi attacks, or at least made Tuvia's experience more suspenseful. Female characters need only to be protected and lack strong will to survive. Tuvia reluctantly agrees to allow them the use of firearms. One scene near the end shows female militia slowing a Nazi advance. Aside from that, there need be no women in this movie.Daniel Craig had an unlucky stint in 2008. Both of his Hollywood films were busts. Quantum of Solace is too overwhelming and Defiance is too underwhelming. I left a screening of the latter feeling like I had watched a bad documentary. Bad documentaries use subject to invoke response in audiences without presenting useful information or insight. Defiance, through virtue of its story, demands our sympathy or occasional terror without earning the privilege of such an expectation. The Bielskis saved millions of future Jews from extinction and are deserving of a better motion picture than this one.** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupendously manipulative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Zwick continues giving backhanded Hollywood compliments to oppressed minorities in the "Defiance", headlined by the newly minted A-list presence in Daniel Craig as a blond-haired, blue-eyed saviour to hunted Jews in 1941 Belarus. Just as in "Glory", "The Last Samurai" and most egregiously in "Blood Diamond," Zwick finds little but potent ways of insulting his through a veil of good intentions and it doesn't show signs of stopping here. But surprisingly, Zwick manages to create a grim world here based on true events and characters ? making it more than a little affecting ? set in the claustrophobic forests, brought down to earth with swirling ideas about the price of survival in a time hardly worth living in.For all its over-the-top pitches, it is stupendously manipulative in how much effective pathos it wrings out of its leading men. It revolves around a dynamic of quiet anger and deep convictions to what four brothers believe should be the best way to lead their people into the brighter light that they know has to shine one of these days. The eldest, Tuvia Bielski (Craig) advocates an agrarian society that depends on a more defensive approach of elusive subsistence of growing, stealing and rationing food. His two youngest siblings, Asael Bielski (Jamie Bell) and Aron Bielski (George MacKay) join this form of resistance. However, Zus Bielski (Liev Schreiber) ? by far the most appealing character ? chooses to fight back with the help of the scheming remnant Soviet Army, at times even letting his desire for continued vengeance obscure the idea of his identity in a period when that's all that is needed to be exterminated.At its most melancholic, "Defiance" asks questions of the deep paradoxes in being Jewish. It questions, quite relevantly, the necessity of killing in order to survive ? a raid on Nazis is juxtaposed with a joyous wedding of young Jews ? and the expendability of present humanity to preserve future generations. But for its entire story's intrinsic worth, Zwick does bring a sledgehammer approach to most of the proceedings. When Nazis or Jews aren't getting gunned down, the silence is filled with rousing speeches on valour in the face of adversity, romantic gazes and religious iconography (courtesy of an old rabbi) of Moses/Tuvia leading his people towards the Promised Land. It does draw away the idea of victimisation and fatality of a Nazi period film but doesn't do very much to create a lasting intent of realism, just the pursuit of idealism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking through the reviews on this site and seeing so many people rate Defiance as a 10 out of 10 or give it a high rating truly confuses me. I almost want to sit through it again and try to find exactly what everyone saw in it that I didn't but there is nothing on this earth that could make me sit through that movie again. It was hard enough the first time, I wouldn't make it through a second viewing. Defiance is truly one of the worse films I have seen. I went into it with an open mind, it was a movie that I really wanted to see. I don't think I have ever been so disappointed. This movie could have been amazing, it should have been amazing but it lacks everything. Where to start? The script was poor, horrific even. It was full of 'heroic' speeches that failed to inspire and half the time didn't have any impact at all. The acting was mediocre. I really do like Daniel Craig but this was a poor outing for him. People have said numerous times how great he is in this movie but how is that possible when he doesn't seem to have the faintest idea where his character comes from. His accent goes from Russian, to German, to posh English every five seconds and it is really, really distracting. All in all Liev Schreiber gives a good account of himself and is the saving grace of this movie. Unlike Craig his accent is spot on and he really adds grit to his role but is not given enough screen time to really make an impact. The rest of the characters were dull, predictable and clichéd. The women were weak and given nothing to do apart from die, gossip about men and lay around naked with Daniel Craig. The rest looked like they walked off the set of every other WW2 movie that featured the Holocaust. There was a villain, a scholar, a wise teacher. Generally these characters added nothing to the movie at all. The only thing they seemed to do was stand around shivering eating apples. (I would love to know the amount of apples consumed during the making of this movie because at least half of the time that is all you see) Or try and be heroic and fight the Nazis by...blowing themselves up. (accidently)Some of the cinematography was nice but far to much screen time was taken up by a close up of Daniel Craig looking either perplexed or...perplexed. Half the time no one seemed to know what to do or what was happening and the truth of the matter is nothing much did happen at all. There was a story here but it was told poorly and was over-run with macho speeches (one off the back of a white stallion in the vain of Braveheart, add in Craigs ever changing accent and the scene is hard to take seriously)I got the feeling that you were supposed to chose between the warring brothers (Craig &amp; Schreiber) but the complete lack of back story makes the task impossible. I think this film was such a waste of a good story. If it had been told properly it could have been amazing and touching instead it left me cold and bored. I couldn't wait for it to end. Some people on this site and others have said that people rate this film poorly because they 'cannot handle' the subject matter. I think this is untrue. I rate this film badly because it was awful and because the subject matter deserved so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of a band of Jews surviving the Nazis in the forests of Eastern Europe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set during the German occupation of Eastern Poland/Belorussia this film tells the story of a group of Jews who evaded the Nazis and local collaborators and survived in the vast birch forests. From here they would emerge to find food and attack the Nazis. The group forms when the Bielski brothers' father is killed; they decide to head into the forest rather than await the same fate. A small group of fellow survivors follow them but that number keeps rising. Initially they are poorly armed but with each raid against the enemy they become better and better armed.As time passes tensions rise within the group; Tuvia Bielski believes they must stay in the forest looking after all of the survivors but his brother Zus believes that those who can fight should attack the Germans whenever possible rather than just when it is absolutely necessary. Eventually Zus and those who think like him leave to fight with Soviet forces. This isn't the end of the troubles; Tuvia must also deal with those who disagree with his edict that everybody gets equal rations no matter what their contribution to the society. Inevitably they are eventually found and must run again, taking everybody with them.I must admit that before watching this film I had not heard about the events depicted; even if the 'true events' depicted in the film were somewhat modified to make a more exciting story it does at least make one aware that over a thousand Jews survived in the forests. The film tells the story at a steady pace and includes plenty of action that keeps things interesting. It isn't like a conventional war film though; time is spent showing how the people survive, not just concentrating on the fighters; it is very much about the community in the forest. The cast does a solid job; most notably Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber who play Tuvia and Zus? those in minor roles are almost as important though as collectively they make the society believable rather than just a collection of characters. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film; it might not be as true as it claims but it at least inspired me to read a little about event I knew nothing of before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Defiance is a well meaning but bloated film that wants to depicts Jews more than just as passive victims in eastern Europe during World War 2.Based on true facts of the Bielski brothers, Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig) is almost Moses like as he leads a band of Jews in the forest of Belarus to survival. He take in fleeing Jews, builds a society with rules of fairness so they do not live like animals. Fight any advancing militia and stave off hunger and disease.His quick tempered brother Zus (Liev Schreiber) wants to take the fight to the Nazis and the collaborators and has little time to help fleeing Jews to survive. He sides with the Russians even though he knows that they too are anti semites.Director Edward Zwick has to keep this two narrative strands going but the film is too disjointed and trite. The third brother Asael (Jamie Bell) is wasted as the one who has choose between his brothers and falls in love with one of the beautiful girls in the woods which causes friction with a rival who throws a challenge to Tuvia's authority.The film is hackneyed, dreary and not even that interesting. The actors speak Russian and then shift to English with heavy accents. The film needed a lightness of touch and maybe even some humour to counterbalance the grimness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Breed of War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What with all the stories told from every faction of WWII and how everybody trounced those pesky Nazi Germans, things can get a bit formulaic! Defiance is a war era drama that takes a different stance, in fact it takes two; standing with one foot in the campgrounds of the Russian Partisans and the other in the camps of the Jews who dared to escape into the woods of Belorussia and Poland to survive the Holocaust.It sports some finely crafted drama, though not perfect. It just does the best with what it has and thankfully it has authenticity and great acting on its side, despite some shortcomings and incidences of overstepping the mark.Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber play the two older brothers of a slain Jewish Belorussian family who flee with their younger siblings into the woods, chased not only by Nazis but the police forces of their own communities who have sided with the enemy.One brother goes on to lead the growing number of escaping Jews while the other - ostracised after rising tensions - joins the Partisans.The story is sometimes sporadic in its delivery of drama and incidence, meaning that one theme is sometimes forgotten for the sake of a bit of action. Don't get me wrong, some of the action is superbly done, but I felt that there were some rushed scenes.While all very well executed, I feel that Defiance suffered an occasional conflict in direction and style, but most viewers might not even notice this.Craig and Schreiber's Russian is spot on and at times even seems playfully competitive, which adds much needed chemistry to such an ambitious tale of family. Jamie Bell is also on form.Overall a fine effort, even though I felt it might actually have had more impact were it half an hour shorter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Defiance was based on a true story written by Nechama Tec. The Bielski Otriad and the brotherhood are somewhat a tale of heroes saving their race from the holocaust and ghettoes.It is a film about anti-Semitism and racism. It's about survivor. It's about helping each other and not hate each other. It's about defending against ruthless evil.The Operation Barbarossa in this film is just small part of it. The Bielski Otriad has helped 1,200 Jews to survive.Liev Schreiber puts up a thick European accent which sounds very convincing. Although I know his family background came from Europe but it is rarely seen and heard of him putting himself to act as Zus. Daniel Craig will always remind us about James Bond. But he's not my preferred James Bond at all. He certainly carries the role of a loving brother and does not make hasty decisions.</fullReview>

Yet it IS a true story, an amazing story, showing the best and worst of humanity.

In this film he proves his depth as a quality actor (for any ever doubted he "had it"). Gripping and taut throughout, with a realistic, gritty film style that increases its intensity, this is a well-directed, well-edited, well-acted, well-filmed movie that keeps you riveted to the very end - and shocks you with what it shows. Yet it does have a certain satisfying redemption at the end.A story well told that needs to be told. And a movie that's worth seeing more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will take my cue from one of the reviews on this board by a man who clearly knows his history and say that "Defiance" was inspired by a true story. Apparently it's not totally accurate. Very few historical films are, because the writers have to take so much dramatic license.The film stars Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber as the two oldest Bielski brothers, who are Polish Jews (although I think in the film they're Russians). Zus (Schreiber) and his little brother (Asael) watch in hiding as the Nazis go through West Belarus. They run to their parents' home, only to find them dead and the youngest brother Aaron (George MacKay) hiding. They all go into the Lipiczanska Forest and reconnect with the oldest, Tuvia (Daniel Craig). They know the forest very well.Gradually their numbers grow as they find other Jews hiding. They have to steal food from farms, and when they kill Nazis who attack them, they steal their guns. They also blew up trains, with the aim of saving Jews. Twelve thousand of them survive, living in the forest for over two years.Apparently during war crimes hearings, the Russians tried to blame the Bielski group for involvement in a massacre of Polish civilians conducted in Nalibok. However, investigation into the event turned up no evidence at all that the Bielskis were involved.The group had to move from time to time but finally were able to set up a more robust and stable community.Forgetting the inaccuracies and just looking at it as a story, it's a powerful one with tremendous acting by Craig, Schreiber, and the other actors. Directed by Edward Zwick, it moves at a good pace and is beautifully photographed. Though one can't really get the feeling of what it must have been like to leave your home and live in the woods, you were able to see that it was a tremendous hardship.Very good film, a story of strength, hope, and survival.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>heroic view of the Bielski bothers story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Defiance' tells about one of the lesser known episodes of World War II in which a group of Polish Jews saved themselves from the ghettos and the executions by the German occupiers and their local collaborators and formed a partisans unit in the forests of Belarus. They were led by the Bielski brothers and succeeded to hide more than one thousand of people in the forests, to fight against the German occupiers, and also to form a community that survived the harsh weather and natural conditions in the woods, the fights with the enemies, and also the sometimes tense relations with other non-Jewish partisan groups and with the local population. The story was told in the last decade in several books and historic studies, some revealing not only the heroic story but also some more controversial aspects.The film directed by Edward Zwick focuses on the first year in the three that the group spent in the forests, the year that the group was formed, and the first winter that they had to survive in the woods. It's a story of heroism and survival, of revenge and resilience. Two of the three brothers (originally they were four) are in the center of the story - Tuvia, the leader (Daniel Craig) and Zus the fighter (Liev Schreiber) who at some point joins the Soviet partisans. Both give very credible performances, their dilemma between personal revenge and saving lives, and their conflicts in the ways the group is to be led are well described. Heroism, faith, will to survive and to keep the human dimensions of life are the main motivations of the characters and they come strong on screen. Besides good acting, authenticity and attention to the details in film making are other visible qualities of this movie, together with fluent story telling. The only questionable aspect is the one related to the language - the Jewish characters speak English, they turn sometimes to Russian when speaking with the Soviet partisans and to the local population (was not this supposed to be rather Polish?) in a mix and with switches that are not clear at all and lack authenticity. I am not sure what the better solution would have been, this may be the best an American production can do without losing the American audiences for whom big screen movies must be mostly or fully spoken in English, I guess.'Defiance' belongs to a genre which does not have too many films in its records, the one that deals with the Jewish Resistance during World War II, representing Jews not only as victims but also fighting back, defending themselves and sometimes taking revenge on their murderers and oppressors. The other illustrious example is Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds' which was produced and released around the same time, which was a declared work of fiction. Defiance openly advertises being inspired by true events, and it succeeds to present a credible and in some moments moving picture of the few and the brave who had the courage to resist. There is no hint in the film itself or warning in the text introduction or epilogue about the controversies related to the darker aspects of the story, and this is maybe the principal minus of this production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During WW2, the Bielski family led a group of Russian Jews into the woods in an effort to save as many people as possible. Daniel Craig is excellent as the leader Tuvia, who is maybe not smart, but is street wise and tough. His brother Zus, played by Liv Schreiber, is bigger, tougher, but more of a joker. He's also more of a pure fighter. There are 2 other Bielski younger sons as well.The movie constantly keeps you guessing what will happen next - will the Germans find them. If they find them, what happens. How can so many people survive with no food or shelter. The theme of the movie is to show you that some Jews fought back and did not passively go to their deaths. You can feel the anger of how many deaths they had to deal with when they get their hands on Germans. There is a love interest or two, but those seem to play minor roles. It's mostly all about survival, and brother vs brother, and how the whole Bielski family handles the issues. You should check out the special features interviews with relatives of the real people. Makes you realize that perhaps your troubles pale in comparison to what the survivors had to endure.Defiance is well acted, captivating, and well choreographed. Don't miss this terrific movie. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Were Defiant ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the Bielski Brothers who helped 1,000 Jewish people during the holocaust.The true story is a sad one describing how the survivors survived the obstacles they found around themselves.It is the story of the building of community relationships while hiding deep in the forests of eastern Europe. As is the case with any such situation, there is tension and division. Daniel Craig is one brother who wants to stay with the group while his brother joined the Russian army in defense of their Motherland against Nazi Germany.We have Jewish people of all various groups. In fact,Liev Schriber, the militant of the brothers, makes mention of the fact that the wealthier Jews among them had looked down on the poorer ones.Everyone was assigned a specific task within the community. With fantastic cinematography, the picture will be well remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful movie, one of the best Holocaust ones out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defiance really defeats the stereotype of the weak, intellectual Jews not putting up a fight in Europe during the Holocaust. The brothers come from a humble background, and yet they're responsible for over 1,000 people's lives, they become leaders, and, well, defy the Nazis. Daniel Craig, Jamie Bell and Mia Wasikowska really portray their characters in this movie, and it can't be easy acting out characters in a situation as complex as that. Especially Wasikowska; I don't think she and Bell get enough recognition for this movie. The scenery and the music is beautiful, and so are the speeches and phrases said throughout the movie. And it gets extra stars for the fact that this is a story about real people, not some Hollywood idea. Sure, they glamorized it quite a bit, but at the end of the movie you really feel a sense of humanity and happiness towards the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too uninteresting to make an impact on any level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It probably makes me look like a bad person, since this movie is based on a true story and all but I seriously couldn't care less for this movie or anything that happened in it, to any of its character.I think the movie its biggest flaw is in its storytelling. It fails to make an impact on any emotional level, which causes me to not care for anything- or anyone in it. It on paper seems like a great and fascinating story, that besides has plenty of originally to it as well but the eventual movie is just, I'm sorry to say, very uninteresting to watch.There is just never any real sense of danger in this movie. Sure, we know that the Jews had to hide and if the Nazi's found them, they probably would had all ended up dead but you don't ever feel like that could happen in this movie. It's because there really is no clear visible 'villain' present in the movie. The movie only tells the story completely from the Jewish side and doesn't feature any real German characters at all. Just a bunch of extra's, who's only purpose is to die. Besides, there just is never any real sense of fear and desperation. With all respect but it almost seemed as if the Jews were having a summer camp in the woods, complete with self-build cabins, campfires and yes, even a party (I'm not even kidding), only set in the winterly cold of Belarus. it never feels like any of their lives is in real danger and the character's also surely don't act that way. Occasionally they start nagging about food, while debating whether they should fight or not, while at the same time still finding time to fall in love each other. It's as if the movie itself was having an hard time deciding what it wanted to be; a good, realistic, heartfelt WW II drama, or an overblown and sentimental, more mainstream, Hollywood drama, with all of the usual clichés.I don't mean to come down so hard on this movie, since it really isn't a bad one but it's just that it's such wasted potential, that does far too much wrong to leave an impact, on any level.I can really fall in love with an Edward Zwick movie, no matter how overblown and over-dramatic some of them can get at times but as is the case with (too) many of his movies, sometimes he's just overdoing it. This is also the case with this movie. It feels to me as if it wanted to desperately to be a big, dramatic story about survival but somewhere in its progress forgot about its main story and emotions and got sidetracked far too often and far too easily. Most of the stuff and characters in this movie just aren't really interesting, no matter how close to the truth it was or not, due to the way the movie, its story and its characters are all progressing. Guess that somewhere deep down there is still a great and meaningful movie, that unfortunately remains hidden all of the time.Not even the presence of lots of big name actors can really help to movie. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber can't really make their characters seem more interesting than they were on paper, so I wouldn't blame them for the fact that their characters and all of the movie its emotions and developments aren't really working out as intended.Again, it's not an horrible movie or one that I hated watching, it's just a big waste of, what seems to be in its core, a great, interesting and fascinating story. Instead now it's a movie that doesn't make an impact and it's one that I will probably easily forget about.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes the most fascinating stories don't transfer too well onto the silver screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War II films seem to have grown far and few between in this day and age, it seems. I suppose "Band of Brothers" and "The Pacific" might have stolen the genre's thunder in film and transferred it to television. But I honestly wish there were more World War II films because in these modern times I'm sure it would be possible to cook up something new and interesting within the genre. Then again, maybe a lackluster piece of work like Defiance is all Hollywood can really come up with and that's why the genre has slowed down so considerably. Defiance is, as far as I know, the most recent big budget film about World War II. It's a much different perspective, however, as it details the Bielski Partisans, a group of Jewish rebels who hid from Nazi's in the Belarussian forests in Eastern Europe. The film chronicles the hardships this group had to face and turmoil they had to endure against the Nazis and even each other. If this were a great movie it would be a moving and heartwrenching story about friendship, love, courage, and endurance. Sadly, it's not a great film.What's unfortunate is that Defiance tells a fascinating story that has been lost amongst the more popular stories that have come out of this time period. But to think that was a group of almost 1000 Jews living in the forest, fending for and protecting themselves is astounding. When you consider the true story it is empowering, incredible, and inspiring. But this film waters down that story to such a straightforward and easy piece of dramatic cliché that you aren't nearly as fascinated by the profound bravery of these people. The film is unnecessarily slow at points and it drags on with subplots that seem less and less important as the film goes on. The film boils down to a whole lot of nothing. It just seems like a bunch of people standing around in the woods waiting for something to happen, occasionally throwing in a predictable twist to the story. There are some good moments in this film but not enough to keep the energy and passion of it up. I don't even want to say that this is a poorly made film, it is just not all that interesting when it really should have been.Even more unfortunate is the dullness of the characters. The two main players are Tuvia and Zus Bielski, played by Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber respectively. Putting these two men in the historical perspective of this tale makes them incredible. They are the brothers who establish this refuge for the Jews and, despite having their flaws, are true heroes of the time period. The translation of these two heroic gentlemen to the film isn't so great. They are very dull characters that don't peak any interest in me whatsoever. Craig and Schreiber are very good in their roles, but the characters are just poorly fleshed out. They aren't particularly interesting and at some parts they aren't even likable. It's not like they aren't allowed to do questionable things just because they are heroes, but there are long stretches of the film where I just didn't care for either of them.The film does a poor job at establishing their true heroism and doesn't give us a chance to experience the struggle of discerning whether or not we should love these characters. They are either annoying or they're not. And when they're not, they're very boring. I really didn't feel any emotional connection to either of them or the film in general until the very end when we get to see real pictures of the men and are able to absorb the gravity of what they did in reality, and just how brave that was. In the context of the movie, however, they just can't hold their own on an emotional level, thus boring me and leaving me with an empty and underwhelmed feeling in the pit of my stomach.It's a shame to see a story with such potential go to waste. This film had a lot of things to do right if it wanted to tell this story in the most fascinating and moving way possible, but it missed the mark on all of them. It's just not an impressive film on any level. It's not awful but it is not something I would watch again because it just does nothing for my emotions. I felt nothing but boredom during this film which runs at two hours and twenty minutes, which is painfully long when the film doesn't go anywhere. Visually it is shot well, acted well, lit well, costumed well, and scored well. But its the story that should have driven this film to be incredibly moving and glorious, but the story fails to accomplish anything worth mentioning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Defiance is one of the best WW2 movies I have ever seen. Its a remarkable real life story of the Bielski Brothers and their struggle during the Second World War. How they not only manages to keep themselves alive but another 1000 Jews by hiding in the forest.The movie starts with the 4 Bielski Brothers struggle and soon they aid more and more Jews people and help them survive. At first these four brothers wanted to kill Nazis to take revenge of their family's killing but soon they realize that best way to defeat Nazis us by staying alive.Its a remarkable piece of cinema about real live heroes. The story will touch your heart. How these 4 brothers gives hope to thousands of Jews people. While watching movie, you will come to know about the extreme conditions these people overcame to survive. Since its based on real live events, watching this movie becomes even more enjoyable experience.Mr James Bond - Daniel Craig has played the role of Tuvia Bielski, the eldest of four brothers and the leader of the group. With this movie Daniel Craig has proved that he a very good actor. Not for once in the movie you will feel this is James Bond. The intensity in his eyes is remarkable.The remaining cast has also performed very well in the movie. The movie has perfectly managed to showcase the struggle of Jews and their condition in Europe during the WW2. Its a fantastic movie that you surely gonna enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the true story of 4 brothers; Tuvia(Daniel Craig, Alexander(Liev Schreiber), Assael(Jamie Bell) and Aron(George McKay)Bielski who took to the the forest near their home village to escape the Nazis. Eventually their small group grew to over 1200 refugee Jews.In the beginning, Alexander(nick-named Zus) and his younger brother Assael witness the destruction of their small village. They rush home to find the rest of the family murdered except for the youngest Aron, who is hiding under some floor boards in a closet. Zus, as portrayed by Liev Schreiber, appears to be a deep emotional man with a pragmatic side. About two days later, they meet up with Tuvia, the oldest. The first refugees that are brought to their small hovel are brought by Aron. They are an old man and his two granddaughters. The youngest dies in the old man's arms. This is the moment that we first see the diametrically opposed view the 2 eldest brothers have of the definition of revenge. Tuvia believes that the best revenge is to "live" and create as normal lives as possible. Zus, on the hand, with several of his friends go to join the Russian Partisans to fight.In the end, both brothers can see were they were wrong and where they let their pride rule the day.I was disappointed with Daniel Craig's performance. I've seen him in other movies where the performance was much better. As far as I'm concerned Liev Schreiber stole the show followed by Jamie Bell.Would I recommend this movie? Without a doubt, but the the subject matter may be incredibly disturbing too some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waaaaaay too slow for me.....poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only ever seen Daniel Craig in one other film - the disappointing Munich - and wanted to see what the star fuss was about here with this one. The answer? Nothing. He wasn't bad here by no means - but the film let him down and by some mad counter-balancing act, he let the film down too. I must also admit to disliking Liev Schreiber as an actor but here he was more than good. In fact, I'll so far as to say if he had the lead then maybe the film would have been more enjoyable. Craig just didn't seem to fit. He looked exactly like he was - an actor playing a part. His hair was too perfect, his frame did not look like it missed too many meals, his eyes too pretty-boy for a hardened leader living rough in the woods. Schreiber on the other hand looked like a man born to live in the forest and had the ruthlessness in him to kill anything that dared get in his way.The storyline involves the desperate attempts of Jews retreating to the forest to escape the certain death from the Germans. Because it is also a true story - then the signs should be good. But the dull, slow-pacing, episodic way that Zwick tells the story is enough to bore you to tears. Also the ending is a trifle insulting to be honest. Remember this guy also made The Last Samarai - another slow, poor-ending film.The story centers on the 3 brothers who are the leaders of this group of Jewish survivours - Craig, Screiber and Jamie Bell. But Bell gets pushed into the background and hardly has anything to do here until a brief flurry near the end. The remainder of the group are for me - two dimensional and stereotypical to really care about. And some parts of the movie are downright ridiculous. In an attack on a German Outpost - Schreiber's character receives multiple gunshots to his body (in a poorly edited scene by the way). To me I felt sure this meant certain death, but the next day he had his arm in sling, and that was that! HE HAD BEEN SHOT SEVERAL TIMES AT CLOSE RANGE IN THE CHEST and without any medical supervision he not only survives, but looks stronger than ever. How is that possible? Even Arnie's Terminator would have at least flinched a couple of times at this assault.In the end the film was waaaaaaay too slow, not engaging enough and despite some strong performances by some of the cast, some nice photography along the way - it just doesn't gel. The false Jewish accents coupled with the polish and Russian dialog - hinders rather than helps. Poor. 5/10.</fullReview>

The most amusing is lack of Polish partisans on Polish land, ridiculous, not to mention complete lack of Polish language. Over 70% of intelligence collected during 2 world war by British on German front was from Polish Intelligence, best in the world. These Jews were collaborated with NKWD, and they committed crimes against local Polish population. Yes, it is best to ignore that little fact in the movie, so the whole world can see how brave Bielski were. Hard to find movies that show what really happened in reality on eastern front as it is to difficult to get funding about real partisans heros.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard of the Bielski brothers after watching 'Who Do You Think You Are?' which is a British TV programme in which celebrities trace their family tree. The Bielskis saved the ancestors of one of them, so when I saw there was a movie to be made about them I was very interested.Craig and Schrieber put in stunning performances in the lead roles. I have to say though that for once I cannot pick any single actor out as a weak performer. This movie has wall to wall quality. They may not all be household names but they stood well besides the two main stars.The cinematography has just the right tonal quality to be gritty and atmospheric. It's not all bright colours and crystal clear and this draws you even more into the world of Nazi occupied Belorussia. The camera angles and framing all work perfectly in sync with superb editing to make this a visual tour-de-force.The scripting is almost spot-on; only one 'you're welcome' which as a Brit I spotted immediately as an Americanism. However I can forgive this because - and THANK YOU EVERY ACTOR for your efforts - all the accents were (to my uncultured ear at least) close enough to Belorussian for me to relax - there's nothing that spoils a movie more for me than lazy actors just using their normal voices when they are supposed to be another nationality.The scenery, wardrobe and other supporting departments were flawless and all served to support a cast who - and I will say it again - did a wonderful job of bringing the lives and achievements of these unsung heroes to the attention of a mass audience.I wish I could give more than 10.</fullReview>

If you've seen any number of recent world war two films you've seen something similar (I'm convinced that director Zwick stole bits of how he filmed this from the great Russian film Come and See).Indeed it seemed to me that any characters other than those played by Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber were from the Second world War Stack Character Bureau. This isn't a bad film its just a very much run of the mill, I've been here before sort of one. (I have to say that I'm kind of boggled by the way that Zwick's films have been heralded as great. To be sure he's pulling to be the Stanley Kramer of our time by taking on "issues" in his films but at the same time I'm left to ponder if its the issues people are loving rather than the film. I personally think that he's better film maker when he just tells a story like in Legends of the Fall rather than in films like Courage Under Fire, Glory, Blood Diamond and The Siege)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bielski Partisans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1941 Belorussia, fleeing from the invading Nazi forces, the Bielski brothers seek refuge out in the vast forest. As more survivors find there way into the trees, the Bielski's help to form a new community that manages to thrive in spite of the overwhelming odds against them surviving. But the brothers have different ideals, is refuge to be their main goal? Or should they be striking out against the Nazi oppressors?Defiance is adapted from the novel Defiance: The Bielski Partisans, written by Dr. Nechama Tec. It's a stirringly emotional story that most definitely needed to be told, however the factual content of this adaptation has been called into question by many internet reviewers. It's not my particular want to delve too deep into it as I'm really only interested in the film as an experience, what isn't in doubt is that these were real people, and these incidents happened, their legacy lives on and hooray to that I say.Defiance as a film relies more on its story than its actual people to deliver the goods, something director Edward Zwick has often been guilty of before. Not that that is a bad thing here, for the story is required to be the main character of the piece, but for sure it feels like holes are dotted throughout the 136 minute running time, justifiable revenge leanings are jettisoned in favour of the usual alternative community draw backs. All the trade marks are in here as Zwick crams them in by the reel, divided aspirations, weight of leadership, romance, jealousy and fractions within the camp, so sadly the film wrongly feels a touch shallow and not fully formed, we have as it were, seen it all before.However, on the plus side, Defiance is not found wanting for emotional fortitude, it has it in abundance, and not the kind to make the picture sink under the weight of it all, it also has some excellently handled action sequences, something that Zwick is most definitely undervalued for. The acting is solid and totally watchable, Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and the impressive Jamie Bell play the three fighting Bielski brothers, but here lays an itch of sorts. Two Englishmen and an American playing these Eastern European characters begs one to think what the film would have been like if the leads had been played by Eastern Europeans? For I'm sure it would have had added earthy impact. Good support comes from Alexa Davalos and the ever reliable Tomas Arana, while Zwick photographer Eduardo Serra expertly brings the forest refuge vividly to life.So all in all we are left with a film that's problems are very evident, and really this piece feels like its focus was to educate above all else. But whilst it may not be to everyones entertainment tastes, it's one hell of a story that demands to be seen by as many people as possible. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ed Zwick delivers a professional, worthy and slightly self-important film that is OK but doesn't have enough to be anything special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I believe I have mentioned before, my flat gives me a regular serving of bus-side posters in my face and it was here that I saw the poster for Defiance. I had also read some promo pieces and generally I was looking forward to it. Before I got to see it I had had my enthusiasm tempered a bit by looking at the poster closer and seeing "from the maker of Last Samurai and Legends of the Fall" on there ? not the best films to list if you trying to draw me in because, although he is generally a good Hollywood director, Ed Zwick's involvement countered some of what I had been told about this film ? the memories of Last Samurai are still raw with me! Before I get into my opinion on this film, let me just say that it is unmistakably an Edward Zwick film. Perhaps I could not have picked it out as such blind but once you know it is impossible not to recognise it for what it is. I say this because Defiance is delivered with great sweep, battle sequences are "important" rather than intense, sets and costumes are impeccable, the cinematography good but not that inventive and ultimately the whole project has an air of being worthy. It was the case with Last Samurai but the thing with that was, among other issues, it just didn't convince that it deserved that "worthy" air, at least with Defiance there seemed to be more potential for it being deserving of this.Foruntately Defiance is a much better film than Last Samurai and it is a shame that it is just not as good as it should have been. I will leave the debate over the accuracy of the film to the message board users but shall merely say that if you rely on Hollywood films for your historical facts then you have problems that extent beyond this film. No, to me this is a story, not a matter of record and I did not watch the film concerned with where liberties were being taken (as they ALWAYS are taken). The rough thread of the film follows the three Bielski brothers as they lead a group of Jewish survivors into the dense forest to try and survive. The conflict comes where Zus and Tuvia clash on the amount of fighting they should do versus the amount of surviving. The film has elements of both. Almost without question Zwick is most comfortable with the fighting and the dying as both feed into his presentation of things as important, moving and worthy. This gives us plenty of battle sequences that do carry some emotion even if they feel air-brushed to a certain degree. This alone makes the film an engaging enough affair but for me it wasn't enough to make it something special.The main way it could have impacted me more was to have been less glossy and a lot rawer and gritty. This is a film about desperate survival and fighting against the odds but only once or twice did it get ugly. Tuvia's aim is to avoid becoming animals but of course conditions mean the group will be pushed right to that limit, but yet we only see that a couple of times and each of these are delivered simply and filmed with characters looking away. Again this comes back to the "worthy" presentation because it feels like the film avoids this material for fear of painting the survivors in a bad light. I appreciated these moments for what they brought to the film but wanted them to be part of the story, no, part of the characters as this would have made the film realer, more urgent and more engaging. Instead we get battles of quite moving loss, heroic sacrifice and worthy looks, very worthy looks.Indeed it is a credit to the main actors that, even though a big slice of their time is spent looking "worthy" and they don't have a lot in the way of character development outside of the broad sweep. Craig and Schreiber both deliver solid turns in the way the film needs. OK they do not have a lot of depth or complexity for the majority of the time but they find it when they can and do a good job otherwise. Bell has a bit more emotion and range to his character but again the script allows him to do what he does. These three carry the film and, although we have other characters, too many of them are simply drawn for the sake of filling the roles they fill.Defiance is not a bad film though, indeed it is quite engaging and quite good. The problem is that it is all too glossy and worthy, wearing the latter a bit too heavily and losing the human drama as a result. The cast don't have as much to work with as a result and rely on presence and doing the basics and turn in good performances as a result. It certainly doesn't deserve all the Oscar chat it is getting and, although it is not a bad film, it is only ever an OK one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With so many Hollywood movies, it is the overpowering production values that give them a sense of phony artificiality - a kind of connecting the dots for the popcorn munchers.So it is with DEFIANCE. Excellent locations, solid cinema-photography, convincing costuming and makeup, etc. Many Hollywood movies are ruined by the perceived need to include box office stars rather than genuine actors. To its credit, DEFIANCE rose above this.BUT!! Hollywood just cannot escape the strictures of covering all bases in plot evolution. Hence the clichés that abound, and the boring predictability, that separate the viewer from any emotional involvement. In DEFIANCE, we even had the cavalry arriving in the nick of time.For gritty realism of Nazis in Bylorussia, watch COME AND SEE: a real movie, by a real director, from a country that makes real movies.</fullReview>

Accused of Their Own despicable atrocities trying to Survive deplorable conditions in the Wilderness, the Bielski Resistance is Currently in Heated Dispute about Their Actual Fighting and Activities.Depending on what Source You seek out there will be an Enormous Amount of Partisanship and Opinions. The Film takes the Positive Nuggets Uncovered in the frustrating ability to Pin-Down the Accuracy of such a Tumultuous and Tragic Era of Human Suffering.Putting Aside the Historical Truth (if there is such a thing) and Reviewing the Film as a Film, an Attempt at an Enlightening Entertainment, it is a rather Well-Made, Interesting, and Inspiring Movie.The Director Edward Zwick is not Shy about using Modern Movie Flourishes of Action, varying Film-Speed and Camera Hi-Jinx to Heighten the already Dramatic War Battles. He uses this to accelerate the pulse.Also, with the Over-Use of Violins pulling the Heartstrings, Zwick spares no amount of Hollywood Ness to make the Movie Watchable amongst the Truly Depressing Suffering.Overall, Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber, along with Jamie Bell make this a Well-Acted, Controversial Film, that is Worth a Watch. But to find out just what Really Happened might be as Frustrating as the Filmmakers Pretensions and in the Final Analysis only Guilty of what most of History is, "...a set of lies agreed upon."

		<fullReview>Before I give my criticism, here are the good things: 1) costumes are good. so are all the props. 2) camera work is good 3) as a generic movie, it's not bad Now to the things that to me, make this movie a piece of crap. ABOUT 80% OF THE STORY ARE LIES! And while I don't mind Hollywood fiction, this is going beyond that. The Bielski brothers in the movie are given credit for AT LEAST twice as much as they actually did. AND the crimes they committed are never mentioned. To me, as a Pole, this is unacceptable. Germans are shown in WW II movies as the bad guys.. killing, abusing, torturing etc. Yet in this case, the "heroes" weren't that much different. The bielski brothers sided with soviets and abused and persecuted the Polish people. They helped the soviet military and police hunt down, capture and execute almost 200 of polish resistance fighters from the A.K. (Armia Krajowa - National Army) who fought for free, independent Poland against BOTH the soviets and Germans. They took part in AT LEAST 2 documented civilian purges, and raided the victim's belongings and homes afterwards. Yes, they did help other Jews. But they did it by committing war crimes and numerous other atrocities on the Polish civilians and the underground freedom fighters who only wanted their nation free and unbound by foreign occupants. In that aspect this movie is AN ABSOLUTE LIE, spreading false information and made up facts, romanticizing criminals and abusing the memory of the people who died by their hand and as a result of their actions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potentially Good Story Gets Watered Down Badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on factual events, "Defiance" tells the story of three Jewish brothers from Poland, who succeeded in usurping the Nazis as they hideout from them in the deep forests along with other Jewish refugees as they settle into the Belarusian forests along with other Jewish recruits as they hide and prepare to defend themselves against the Nazis or any other anti-Semite groups wanting to have them terminated. Better known as the Bielski Partisans was defined as the most largest and successful Jewish factions who stood up against Nazi rulings and held their own in succession. It was quite peculiar though that when the filmmakers led by director Edward Zwick arrived on the scenes, they were surprised to discover that the local residents currently living have forgotten about such a tale and even more baffling was that there were were no Jewish people living there. Zwick leads his audience to explore how they survived, how they organized themselves, how their ethics were questioned and how their anecdotes can be narrated by melodrama. I will have to say that "Defiance" has all the essential tools to fit the criteria of a deeply emotional WWII Holocaust story. However, I felt a bit disconnected with the story mainly because the emphasis was more focused on the characters within the group as opposed how they're going to take down the Nazis. The Nazis were the prominent threat to the Jewish refugees like in the 2004 film "The Village". Do the Nazis have to be the primary narrative for this film to work? Not necessarily, but the film gets bogged down when personal conflicts, issues and romantic interludes that at times feels more like a reality show, that just lacks the vital substance that the far superior "Schindler's List" had to offer. It just feels more like a WWII survival story with some sporadic moments of Nazi in pursuit of finding these resistors and destroying the foundations they created. The action outside the surface of the trailers are also very meagre. The survival story here can depict any kind of period of time. In our darkest hours into our future, we may have to hideout in forests to survive. It would be grand if we had someone like the Bielski brothers there to help us if needed. They were farmers who were lethal, resourceful and adept at fighting skills and just great people to lead through difficult situations. The Bielski brothers are oldest one Tuvia (Daniel Craig), the middle one Zus (Liev Schreiber) and the second-youngest one Asael (Jamie Bell) and the youngest one Aron (George McKay). After escaping possible genocide from the Nazis, the brothers retreat into the forest. They're followed by other Jewish people in the surrounding area hiding out and resisting execution as well while the news of their hideout causes an outrage as the Nazis come looking for them. Tuvia the true leader here declares that all Jewish people must hide, even those not fit for fighting. Zus, the enforcer would rather kill Nazis than save the Jewish. The contrasting concepts between both brothers rings true today in Gaza between helping our kind while hurting theirs. The refugee ensemble play pivotal roles in means to survive out here in the wilderness. They learn to feed their families by robbing food, establishing a health clinic for the sick, building a court and even a tanning salon of all things. Sure romance becomes commonplace everywhere, but in a movie that has tension building up to your ears, it really doesn't have a place here in this movie and some are just so implausibly too warm for a film of this magnitude. Craig and Schreiber play their respected roles convincingly and their contrary ways of war versus peace almost gets pretty personal until Zus gives up hope and joins up with the Russian partisans who hate the Jewish just as much as the Nazis. The most interesting character outside the Bielski brothers is an incompetent middle-aged man named Shimon Haretz (Allen Corduner) wants in on the group as they ask what he is known for. Appearing to be in intellect, but his skills have so significance to the partisans, but he's still welcomed to stay. At the time the refugees were predominately cultivators and peasants, while others were handy craftsmen, artists and labourers. If I was in their position what good would I be to them? In many ways there are more Shimon Hartetz's than actual warriors settling there. The best an possibly the most nuanced performance comes from Liev Schreiber. That's because Zus Bielski has his sights set on the real reason they're hiding in the first place. To kill as many Nazis before they strike at them. Daniel Craig is still good Tuvia, as the more peaceful leader, but he's more occupied in being like a mayor and organizing laws and community planning which is necessary, but not logical. So as a Nazi looks by, he notices that the Bielskis had turned their refugee camp into a booming village in the wilderness. As time goes on, it becomes more dire as Nazis and other Anti-Semites were coming from Germany, Russia and Poland. The obey by Soviet forces but can't be hoodwinked. Their efforts succeeded and to this many Jewish people would have never been born had it not been for the Bielski brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story, not so great characterizations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fantastic true story is given a Hollywood treatment and cardboard cutout characters with questionable accents by the actors make this an unsatisfying film. It's difficult to get emotionally invested in archetypal characters spouting generic dialogue and these one dimensional people never make the stakes feel high enough to care about their fate. Edward Zwick who usually has a strong visual style, flatly directs this picture which looks more suited for television than on the big screen. His screenplay feels like the cliff notes version of Defiance: The Bielski Partisans, punched up with stereotypical hero speak, stereotypical jerk characters whose fate is sealed the moment they act like a jerk and action sequences that feel designed to get the film funded and belong in another film. Watching this group of survivors squabble and deal with the deadly elements of winter is usually undermined by poor acting and atrocious dialogue - never helped by off screen shouts of some variation of 'it's dangerous' 'we have no food!' 'we can't make it across that river.' Defiance wastes a spectacular true story and is a generic, by the numbers film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"He is a Jew?", asks a little boy now living in the woods amongst the Jews in the Polist forests. A valid question, as Daniel Craig stands out more by not fitting in. I'll blame that on the director and producer. But, where Craig is miscast, Liev Schreiber rules. His character reflects the antithesis of the stereotypical Jew we see hiding behind the leaders. Jews fighting back in some way feels nobler, than what we had in non-fighting, non-working intellectuals who couldn't find masculine in the books they were reading. We have one good offering of "Godfather-esque" editing when one of the brothers wed while another among a Russian brigade attacks a German convey in the snow. Great use of context, if the Russian attack was more vivid and the woods ceremony wan't so out of "Fiddler On The Roof". Our ending seems as improbable as Craig playing Moses, but since some of this actually happened, it was worth the first watch, but not the second.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I saw this movie last week I have felt a renewed determination to face whatever has to be done in life with hope instead of worry and complaint. Remembering these brave brothers' effort to survive in the Byelorussian woods has given me renewed strength.I saw this compelling film at Touro College in New York City, where a special guest, appearing afterward to answer questions, was Zvi Bielsky, real-life son of the character played by Liev Schreiber.Fiercely attractive in different ways, both Schreiber and Daniel Craig were perfectly cast as tough-guy brothers whose parents were killed in the early years of WWII. Rather than falling into the victim role, they fled to the forests they knew so well. And rather than fend only for themselves, they came to harbor 1,200 other Jews and join with the albeit anti-Semitic Russians nearby to fight or kill whatever German soldiers they could get.Life in the woods was brutal and the refugees had to relocate several times, often finding themselves targeted by far better-armed soldiers on the ground and in the air. Despite my great admiration for the film, it clearly simplified and romanticized the brothers' story. Their struggles were so grueling that is was somewhat unsatisfying to read an epilogue note stating their time in the woods went on some two years after the movie ends. It left the impression that merely because two hours had gone by, the movie was slapped with a perfunctory conclusion. Zvi Bielsky attempted to clarify a number of questions that arose in the epilogue. He said that the third-youngest brother joined the Russian war effort to demonstrate that Jews were not afraid. Although the two older brothers, who eventually settled in New York, never sought publicity for their story, Mr. Bielsky suggested that their efforts eventually garnered fame after years of word-of-mouth. He also noted that his father and uncle operated with dozens of bodyguards each, defending a perimeter of sorts in the woods, while the community they were protecting hid much farther in toward the forest interior.It should be no surprise that there's a lot of suffering and brutality in this movie. But each of the brother's love affairs is depicted with originality and the scenes of snow drifting through the forest were mesmerizing. A truly memorable and moving experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fine acting performances help compensate for average production values in this WWII tale of Jewish partisans living in the forest in Belorussia while the Holocaust is unfolding. The three Beilski brothers disagree on just about everything, except the need to survive. Zus (Liev Schreiber) is the hothead, harbouring simmering jealousy at his brother's leadership role. Tuvia (an immense Daniel Craig) is that reluctant leader, taking care of the elderly and sick through a winter in a forest because his conscience won't let him do otherwise. Asael is the younger brother stuck in the middle, unsure which of his brothers to follow. Played by Jamie Bell, this is the first role I have seen him in where he did not bring to mind Billy Elliot. Language-wise the film is a muddle, the actors sometimes speaking in foreign tongues and at other times heavily-accented English. If the switch is meant to signal something, it was lost on me. The female characters serve mostly to create conflict among the men, or highlight their vulnerability. But the film on the whole convinces and holds your attention. It builds nicely at the end when the Bielski group seem to be pinned in an unwinnable situation. On the whole the film avoids sentimentalizing, especially in one funeral scene where the oratory by the rabbi succinctly captures the suffering of the Jews in WWII. Not a great film by any means, but better than I expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the strength of this, THE LAST SAMURAI and BLOOD DIAMOND, Edward Zwick is currently one of the best directors working in Hollywood. He's able to tell little-known stories in an exciting, dramatic and well-paced way and DEFIANCE is no exception.It's the little-told story of Jewish refugees hiding out in the woods in WW2-era Eastern Europe, desperately trying to avoid the Nazis and at the same time coping with survival outdoors in the harsh winter landscape. The story is well-filmed throughout and full of moving scenes. The casting is exceptional: Liev Schreiber, who before now I've only seen in inconsequential work, excels as the brother turn between his duties and his self-belief; Daniel Craig makes for an embittered, fragile hero, a far cry from his man-of-muscle Bond, and Jamie Bell goes from strength to strength.The film goes through all of the situations you'd expect from a WW2 epic: there are pitched battles, shoot-outs and long stretches of tension in which the refugees attempt to keep away from the prying eyes of the invading Nazis. There are betrayals and moments of inspiration; hope and despair; the film is so enthralling because it becomes a story of the human condition, with almost every emotion playing out at some point before our eyes. Although the film is often dark and gritty, at the same time it raises hope in the viewer in its depiction of dauntless courage. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When an event such as the Holocaust occurs, it gives us a little comfort when we think that there was at least something going on to counter the bastards that were doing this. The resistance movement meant that the Jews weren't going off to slaughter without a by-your-leave. This movie gives us a glimpse at such a group as they survive one day to the next, having to establish a harsh community with harsh rules to continue to survive. It is the rules that are at the center of this as two strong-willed men attempt to lead the rebels. We get to see what it would be like to deal with the psyches of the oppressed, facing a religious dilemma on one hand and dealing with a survival instinct. For some reason, this movie doesn't have the spark it could have. I think one reason is the enemy is not developed enough. They are the usually ambiguous entity that we have grown to hate. They are themselves cannon fodder and so by dehumanizing them, we also take a great deal of the tension out of the film. Moral ambiguity needs to be center stage. While it's a decent movie, it doesn't stand out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is about a group of Jewish brothers who help a community of Jews against the Germans in WWII. Being interested in WWII, myself, it was good to look at it from a different angle, and not the massive bloody scenes the usual WWII movies are about.Both Daniel Craig, and Liev Schreiber deliver a terrific performance as two of the Bielski brothers. I enjoyed watching them work as they fight against the Germans and sickness.Since the movie talks about a true story, it really makes you want to put yourself in their shoes, and how great that group of combatants actually was.However, the movie is way too long with some scenes that are, also, way too long; and sometimes it just gets boring and made me want to multitask. In addition, some of the secondary characters' acting wasn't so great and made me chuckle.In the end, I don't see a reason why you shouldn't watch this movie.</fullReview>

Does it really matter? This much has been established; a band of 1,200 people hid out in the Russian forest for four years. They set up a community with a hospital and other institutions that enabled them to survive the war while loosing only about 50 of their number. The film, with unflinching clarity, shows the choices people must make in order to survive the onslaught of a deadly and ruthless enemy. Thanks to their example and many like them, in the future, Jews will be harder to kill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies based on true stories have a big advantage. We are already believing what we watch without asking ourselves if the story is believable. But in fairness, Defiance is totally believable and not once will you say "I don't believe that!". It's a very good film. I'm always on the look-out for stupid errors in continuity or bad directing, but I couldn't see any here. Maybe because I was busy watching, but I don't think there were any to notice. The director managed to make all his characters 'real' and the story was dull enough for short periods to be totally true to life. Even Daniel Craig, who is not in my best 100 actors list, did very well and seemed to relish the role. In fact all the acting was high quality and the set (a real forest) was stunning and very atmospheric. The story is strong and inspiring. Very much a case of 'good' winning through. But embedded in the dialogues are many aspects of family disputes, social pressures, animal instincts, blind loyalty, and emotional trauma. Watch it. It's worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How true is this "true story"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others have commented, "Defiance" is filled with clichés, but how many original moments can one expect in another movie about Jews who survived the Holocaust, in this case by hiding in a forest in Belarus, stealing food from nearby farms and killing Nazis in order to keep alive? The story of the Bielski brothers is said to be true, and I have no reason to doubt that it is. But the incidents shown? The individual details? The character of the four brothers? The personalities of the men and women whom the Bielskis saved? I have no idea. All I can say for sure is that this movie is effective and that it is well acted, especially by Daniel Craig as Tuvia, whose main interest is saving refugees, by Liev Schreiber as Zus, whose main interest is killing Germans, by Jamie Bell as the third and most sensitive of the brothers. Among the women, serious impressions are also made by Alexa Davalos as Tuvia's lover (and later his real life wife if the film's end notes are to be believed) and Iben Hjejle as Bella who marries the third brother (Jamie Bell's character) in the forest. According again to the end notes, a thousand of these refugees survived in the forest for nearly four years, and many of their descendants are alive today. The movie is inspiring and I could handle the clichés because clichés are often representations of reality, and the reality of the Holocaust produced millions of events that were not very different from one another. Different people died or survived, of course, but survival in the woods occurred in several places, and I'd guess the experiences of those who survived in those circumstances were more alike than different.</fullReview>

Daniel Craig (supposedly a from a rural area in Belorussia) wears a fancy Swiss watch made somewhere in the 1990s). The subtitles of what is being said in Russian are not always accurate. Where the subtitles say that the local police get 500 rubles for every Jew they deliver the speaker is actually saying that you get a year's release from taxes. First, it is weird to hear a Belorussian peasant rejoice at being living tax-free for a year, and also, Germans did not pay in Rubles but in Reichsmarks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward Zwick is a unique director and respected in Hollywood. He is known for making action films, but action films with a conscious and a social message. His previous films have often have a theme of oppressed people, like Glory, a American Civil War film about the first all-Black unit in the Union army, The Siege, about Islamophobia and how Muslims are rounded up into camps by the American army (and that was before 9/11) and Blood Diamond was able the illegal diamond trade, the evil actions of RUF and how Africa is ignored by the rest of the world. With Defiance Zwick was able to attach an talented cast to a film about Jewish fighters during the Second World War.Starting in 1941, Belorussia has been conquered by the Nazi Germany and the SS and local Belorussian police start rounding up and killing Jews. The Bielski brothers, Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Live Schreiber), Asael (Jamie Bell) and Aron (George MacKay) are lucky to survive and escape into Bia&#x142;owie&#x17c;a Forest. In the forest more Jewish survivors find them and they start to form a camp. Tuvia, Zus and Asael star to raid the Germans and the collaborators and the Jews become a small guerrilla force. But Tuvia and Zus disagree on their approach, Tuvia wanting to be diplomatic with the locals and Zus wanted the group to be more aggressive and fight the Germans. Tuvia continues to lead the group as a collective and Zus leads to join Soviet Partisans where he had to face anti-Semitic attitudes within their ranks.Zwick is a good director, he knows how to film an action scene and he made a fast paced film. This is not quite the Saving Private Ryan style of action, but he does show being shot is still bloody. The fighting in this film is often close quarters, not big scale battles and he simply focused on the Bielskis. The Germans were simply made as the empty from afar. This was not an in depth look into the Holocaust, simply about surviving and avoiding be captured. But this is not a film about fighting the Germans, it is more about how would you survive in the woods as a commune.Historical what the Bielskis achieved militarily was a footnote, but as a story of survival and the impact it had on a community and human lives it is important. Some areas could have been explored more, like more about Anti-Semitism within the Soviet Union and show the complex people with the local politics, national politics and international relations. When Germany did invade the Soviet Union, a lot of people did welcome them as liberators from Stalin's regime, unfortunately the Nazis were just as bad.One of the weird things about Defiance is that the characters speak in English with Russian accents, but sometimes spoke in Russian. It made no real sense to have both: either have the characters speak in Russian/Belarusian or in English, not both. It was a bit of a misstep for Zwick.Zwick employed Eduardo Serra as his cinematography, a skilled man working on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Unbreakable. With Defiance he used a grey filler which added to bleakness what it would have been like living in the woods and having to live of the wilds and be like bandits But the drawback was that it was hard to see anything during an action sequence at night. James Newton Howard also added a sad, violin based score, which was similar to Schindler's List: I would not be surprised that Howard was influenced by that film.I personally would not have made the actors of the film use Russian accents, but if is acceptable in this film. Craig is a great actor, but his Russian accent was not the best it could have been. He did give a good performance and so did Bell, but it was Schreiber who was the best performer. He was more confident with the accent and I could easily believe that he was a more hot headed man who wanted to fight. He is also a big guy which you would not want to get on the wrong side of him. Plus the film also featured Mia Wasikowska before she became famous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awe-inspiring tale of survival...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been lurking in my DVD collection for quite a while now, and so I thought it was a bit overdue a viewing. Finding myself at a loose end on a Sunday afternoon afforded the ideal opportunity. At two hours eleven minutes it's a pretty long film, which probably explains why it has remained unwatched for so long. But enough of this, you want to hear about the film. The setting is Belarus in the early 1940's. The German army has invaded and is beginning it's persecution of the Jews in the region? oh, and by the way, it's based on a true story.After their parents are killed, three brothers, Tuvia, Zus and Asael Bielski, seek refuge in the forests near their home. They are soon joined by other survivors and it's soon apparent that, as the oldest, Tuvia must take charge. The brothers are not the most law-abiding citizens and find their skills at smuggling are soon to be very useful. After finding out who was responsible for his parents' murder, Tuvia exacts revenge on a local policeman and his family. As more and more survivors join the group tension mounts between Tuvia and Zus as they differ on how they should proceed. This culminates in a fight and Zus leaving to join the local brigade of the Red Army. Eventually the camp is discovered by the police and they are forced to move and, as winter approaches, life becomes very tough for the survivors. They now number in the hundreds and Asael meets a girl and marries her. They survive the winter only to discover that the Germans intend to sweep through the forest and take, or kill anyone they find. Zus is ordered by the Russian commander to retreat, leaving the Jews at the mercy of the approaching Nazis. And on that knife-edge, I'll leave my short synopsis.This is a pretty well made film with some nice action sequences interspersing the drama. Decent performances all round particularly from Daniel Craig as Tuvia, Liev Schreiber as Zus and Jamie Bell as Asael. All three stood out and put in really good performances. I should also give honourable mentions to Alexa Davalos as Lilka Ticktin, Allan Corduner as Shimon Haretz, Mark Feuerstein as Isaac Malbin and Tomas Arana as Ben Zion Gulkowitz.As I mentioned at the beginning, it's a pretty long film, and, despite this, I felt the filmmakers were still trying to fit too much in. It is a fascinating and awe inspiring story that deserves to be told, but I just felt it could have been done better. So, over all, it's a pretty good film that doesn't quite reach the standard set by the likes of Schindler's List, but still a worthy effort. Recommended if you can spare the 2 hours, 11 minutes.My score: 7.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the movie Defiance, directed by Edward Zwick, Jewish brothers in Nazi occupied Europe, escape into the Belarusian forest. In their journey through the forest, they run into Russian resistance fighters. These Jewish and Russian forces endeavor to build secret villages in the forest holding around a thousand non-combatant Jews. There are two leaders ruling the secret Jews, Tuvia and Zus Bielski. Very strong leaders, they do a well job building and moving their villages as German forces catch on their trail. Zus ends up running into the Russian resistance fighters and ends up joining their group. As Tuvia gets caught in heavy German resistance, his lost brother comes out from the woods to help defeat the Germans as they rejoin together.During this time in history, the Holocaust was occurring and the Germans were after the Jewish. The horrific things that were occurring in the concentration camps absolutely terrified the Jewish population to the point to were they would to anything to escape the Germans. What the Germans attempted to do better in the concentration camps was, to put it all together, wipe out the entire Jewish race. It is clear why all these Jewish refuges did anything and everything to escape persecution.The technique the resistant Jewish and Russian forces used were simple: establish a settlement in the middle of the woods while having a strong civilian militia. By building these villages off of main German routes, it allowed the resistant forces to get good position. When German forces found out about these secret societies, they went on pursuit. The resistant forces would have to move, and move fast at that to deeper parts of the woods traveling miles. Once losing contact with the German forces, they would all get to work on building their new village. Everyone worked-- no excuses. The winters were extremely tough and if everyone did not do their part in the community, the village would suffer extremely. Food was rationed; therefore there was hardly enough to for the whole village. After the winter, the process started all over again. This movie really interested me because it was based on a true story. Everything that was going on during that time period was one of the most horrific acts of violence this planet has ever seen. For these Jewish escapes, it was a matter of life or death with every chance they took. To be able to live through the harsh weather of the winters was unbelievable. I took strength, community, dedication, and hope to survive on the run from the Germans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been a sucker for real life stories. Favoring them over plots written by an out of work actors over a cup of coffee at a local Sturbucks. I read the book "The Bielski Brothers" by Peter Duffy a few years ago I thought it was a great soaring story. Then, I saw the movie "Defiance" last night, and I didn't know whether to give it 7 or 10. The movie did portray the story as I remembered reading it. It rang true in my mind, and in my gut. It had the same feel as the written word, and it evoked identical feelings in my heart ? and for that, an accurate adaptation of the book, I have to give it 10. However, the movie is not a blockbuster hit. What might have worked great in a book ? keeping reader in suspense throughout the few nights it takes to read it, did not work in the movie. The silver screen is missing the silver lining - there is no climax in the movie. The action does not built up slowly to a pivotal point, but rather the tension is static from the very beginning to the very end (just like I remember it from the book and like it probably would have been in real life). If you are looking forward to watching a true story being told, than you will be very pleased with "Defiance". But if you believe that the truth and reality could have (or should have) been sacrificed in order to accomplish a better movie, than you might walk away unfulfilled. Never-the-less, to me, it was a great story to read, and a grate story to watch, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the WWII period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defiance is a moderately interesting but not very satisfactory movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always thought that the cinema was not designed for bringing us History lessons.As much as "based on actual events" a movie can be,I think it is a mistake to look for genuine veracity on a product which was mainly created for entertaining the spectators and making profits to its studio,distributors,etc.The best we can expect on a "based on a true story" movie is a semblance of anecdotes which respects the true events with some manipulation on the narrative for making the story more interesting (two examples which come to my mind at the moment are The Right Stuff and Valkyrie).I would not consider the film Defiance to be part of that group,because although it makes a good effort to show us a fascinating (not to mention controversial) historical event,I think the screenplay should have been better structured and the subjects it pretends to deal with should have been more deepened.Director Edward Zwick has pretty much experience on the war cinema,as his filmography has covered conflicts like the North American Civil War (Glory),the First Persian Gulf War (Courage Under Fire),the Japanese Rebellion from 19th century (The Last Samurai) and even an hypothetical urban guerrilla in the streets of New York (The Siege).So,there is no reason to be surprised on the tense and well filmed battle sequences from Defiance.Meanwhile,Daniel Craig,Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell bring excellent performances.However,the screenplay (co-written by Zwick and Clayton Frohman) lacks of focus and intensity.The first half hour is efficient,but after that,the story starts to rumble trying to find (without success) a narrative road which connects to the various angles from the story.So,the impression I had is that Zwick and Frohman did not know if they had to focus on the romantic ties from the refugees,on the conflict between the three main characters or if everything is a filler to pass the time on the moments we do not see battles against the Nazis.The result is diffuse and a bit boring on various moments,so I was near to loose the interest.I do not know if the movie should have been shorter and omit so many details which do not add to the story too much or being longer in order to examine every single aspect on detail.However,I think Defiance deserves a slight recommendation because of the excellent performances and competent direction.On its most basic shape,Defiance is a very modest combination of the Jewish heroism from Schindler's List (but far from reaching that emotional impact) and the insurgent action from Black Book (but without the energy and enthusiasm from its screenplay).In summary,I found Defiance to be moderately interesting in general,but not very satisfactory on the whole.Rating : 6.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, more cheerful way to commemorate holocaust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defiance, as its name suggests, is an inspirational, heroic story meant to convey the fighting side of an oppressed race whose mere existence was severely threatened. For the most part, Hollywood had in the past only revealed the depressing side of Holocaust with graphic killing of Jews, cramped ghetto streets, concentration camps, extreme hunger, futility of trying, despair, etc. Defiance is different from all of them for it is a story of promise, a story of hope, that not only exhibits courage and perseverance but also portrays love, ethnic bonding, and personal sacrifice for the general good. The small community the Bielskys have built in the woods reminds me of Captain John Smith, who successfully held on to the survival of Jamestown back in early 1600s. Tuvia Bielsky and Smith shared a similar philosophy: people have to work in order to be part of the community. This movie thus blends modernity with raw human instincts; it recreates a settlement scene that shows all aspects of human beings. It brings out the best of people as they share an identity and the common interest of survival; but it also brings out the worst, as greed and pride were evoked by desperation and lack of self-control.It teaches the importance of community, the inexorable wholesomeness of family, and sacrifice for the sake of others. On top of all that, it is a true family story that contains crucial pieces of history for us all to remember and celebrate-humans'ability to overcome adversity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly underachieving for such a unique storytelling opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only a matter of time before WWII/Holocaust drama and Edward Zwick found each other. "Defiance" is the perfect little-known underdog war story that perfectly fits Zwick's ("Glory," "The Last Samurai," "Blood Diamond") tastes. Historical war drama with a heavy action slant as per usual, "Defiance" has all the elements that anyone who's enjoyed Zwick's past work is looking for: lush cinematography, gripping action and a strong leading male role played by an elite actor. At the same time, for a Holocaust story that hasn't already received the silver screen treatment (a rarity these days it seems), "Defiance" seems like it's been done before and doesn't fully extend its audience the extraordinary experience its unique premise suggest it capable of.For a different take on the Holocaust, "Defiance" follows the true story of a band of Jews who averted capture in Belarussia but were forced to hide out in its forests. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber play Tuvya and Zus Bielski, two daring, able-bodied and rather vengeful brothers who lead the group of nearly 1,000 Jews.The plot's most unlike the other Holocaust films in that it doesn't require pity and horror from its audience in order to become emotionally attached. That attachment is not as strong compared to these other films, but in this film, the Jews are largely in charge of their destiny. Craig's character has no less of a self-awarded license to kill than James Bond does when it comes to the liberties he takes killing German soldiers. At times it almost becomes tough watching Craig and Schreiber blowing Nazi brains out, and the whole revenge factor with the Holocaust is somewhat uncomfortable. I welcomed this feeling, but the script doesn't pray on our challenge stomaching some of its images and just lets them fizzle out before they can turn into something deep. The characters never become as troubled as we are by what they do, which really holds "Defiance" back.The neatest part of the script by Zwick and Clayton Frohman is its old testament imagery. The story of the Jewish people has sadly been about constantly escaping persecution and the way the film tries to reawaken the images of Exodus and running from the Egyptians and crossing the Red Sea really puts this film in a greater context of Jewish history. It's not about the tragedy of the Holocaust itself, it eludes to being a lot more. Still, there's more to be desired on this front too -- it's not exactly made integral to the story being told.There's a lot to enjoy about Zwick's film as there always is with him, even though the story underachieves more than many of his other films have. The action is exciting and modern without detracting from the historical context and the forest is captured beautifully on camera. If only it had been written in a way that would've gripped its audience with tender, intimate scenes revealing character instead of speeches about fighting. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HK Neo Reviews: Defiance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tagline: A heartfelt story of survival and human courage? Review by Neo: Daniel Craig has always been noted as a character actor, just a glimpse of what the layers he added to the recent James Bond franchise, and it requires no more quotation. In this film, Craig carries the film on both of his shoulders and that extremely humane feel about him, allows the audience to understand and feel for the situation the characters are surviving within. It is easily an achievement whenever a filmmaker takes the audience on a journey and the ability to capture our attention right from the word goes, is not to be understated. For the Jews, living through the Hitler era was really all about fighting for survival and even the opportunity to actually attempt to survive requires immense degree of luck. What this film is able to express is the underlying human spirit, human emotions and it should be noted about the difficulties of creating a Utopian world and the importance of leadership in order to survive.The movie goes like this, Daniel Craig and his brothers are in the middle of an German Nazi invasion which led to the death of the rest of their family. From there the journey of survival in the forest begins and each day, there are more and more survivors joining the forces in the forest. Until eventually a village of people, women, children and men and as there is no such thing as a Utopian world, things goes nasty both internally and externally.Directed by Edward Zwick (the person behind the gritty Blood Diamond), it is probably safe to say that Zwick rarely puts a foot wrong and the way he focused on the building of the village, as well as the blossoming romance between Alexa Davalos (The Mist) and Daniel Craig is both believable and a joy to endure. The final sequence is just almost pitch perfect, by the time the film ends, it is impossible for any reasonable warm-blooded human beings to not feel for the situations, and perhaps a real triumph of raw human courage and persistent An inspirational story, based on a true story and it is not since Saving Private Ryan that a World War I or II epic have worked so seamlessly well.Daniel Craig is one heck of a good actor, his ability to draw the audience to focus on him is a special ability. It is that ability that allows the audience to relate and look into the depth of the conflicted character that he is trying to portray. Craig is a leader and his steer presence is crucial to the survival all everyone. Craig made the audience believe that if he was to disappear, the whole Utopian world they have soar to survival will be in shattering pieces of death and blood. His chemistry with the beautiful and stunningly hot, Alexa Davalos is an item to enjoy and embrace. Not to mention, his brotherly love between him and Liev Schreiber is another example of perfect casting. Not to forget, the much missed Jamie Bell (from Billy Elliot fame) shows maturity since those days and certainly a performance worthy of the potential he have displayed since childhood. As mentioned before, Alexa completes the movie with some much needed eye candy and some steady and reliable acting potential to add to the pros. Likewise, his brother (played by Liev Schreiber) fits in his role as one with strong values, ego, cold, yet loving character perfectly and certainly is an asset to the film.All in all, Defiance has all the makings and workings of a great movie. With pitch perfect casting, believable storyline, interesting historical backdrop, entertaining gun fights and chase sequence and finishing off with an emotional punch. It is needless to say that this film comes highly recommended and most probably one of the better movies of 2008. A satisfying film that works, characters that audience can relate to, director of Blood Diamond have continued his streak of good film making. Since I will never lose something without fighting hard for it, Defiance works for me and perhaps will do the same for you as well ? (Neo 2009) I rate it 9/10- www.thehkneo.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful movie with hope and faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts with the murder of jews in World War II in Germany. The family of Bielski brothers is murdered and they run into the nearby woods to save them-selves. They soon realize that there are many a Jewish families who have been wandering in the woods just like them. Tuvia Bielski becomes the savior of the jews and struggles to save the jews with the help of his brothers not just from the Nazis but also from hunger, cold and in-fighting among his fellow jews with the fragile support from the Red army. It is one of those rare action movies with a great depiction of history and human faith. The movie is a salute to the Bielski brothers who saved the lives of nearly 1200 jews without expecting anything in return.Even though it sounds to be yet another world war movie but really stands out in its own way. It is a must watch for history enthusiasts and people looking out for a good action movie with a good dose drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Excellence and Brilliance of Defiance -- my continuing dilemma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have probably seen every Holocaust film known to man. Based on a true story, Defiance it is about a group of Jews in Beylorus who actually lived in the forest in 1941 for 2 years trying to evade capture by the Nazis and the Nazis often Polish and other helpers. It is thrilling, captivating, gut wrenching and the truth of it makes it all the more so. It has a bit of a positive end although you would NOT think so leading up to it, of course.The Holocaust is MY yardstick for all that I believe and it is the heart of my feeling about the Jewish people. It is MORE much more than about religious belief of which I have little but it is its moral, survival, ethical, political essence that grabs me. It pierces my heart like nothing else can. It is why I used to hold Israel to a higher standard because we are a people whose history has been saturated with sadness and onslaught. We have been plagued, hunted, tortured, crushed and slaughtered during the past 2000 years and ultimately the object of the greatest mass murder humanity has ever seen bar none. It has EVERYTHING to teach and yet it has NOTHING to teach as man does what he does again and again and again all over the world.Every time I see another film about the Holocaust I wax staggered by the ENORMITY of it. My eyes do not want to believe what I see and I go to bed feeling guilty that I sleep warm, am fed well and have survived in comfort. I am chilled by the fact that had all my grandparents stayed where they were they could have been among those Jews who ran through the forest in spring, summer, winter and fall just to survive and IF they did not they would have been killed in concentration camps. It is a testament to man's yearning to survive and be free and it extends to all people everywhere. It is again when I dissect the politics that is Israel I can see WHY the Jewish heart is so brutal in determination never to let that happen again AND YET I cannot understand HOW in VIEW of what happened some can run roughshod over those sometimes innocent next door. THAT is my cerebral conundrum with which I cannot come to terms.We all look at life through our own lens but the Jewish life is, in my opinion, like no other. Suffering is NOT limited to the Jew, certainly, but a Jewish life throughout the centuries could never find a home and could simply never just be. The Holocaust MUST be a ruler -- a moral prism -- by which everyone measures his capacity for good and evil and what behavior is permissible and what is not. It is MY eternal dilemma of conscience. I recommend this film if you haven't seen it because it gives life to the meaning of the ultimate catastrophe in ways which no other film I can remember has. It should have universal meaning for us all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on real brothers saving Jews in Nazi Germany.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bielski brothers were real, Jews in Germany, who defied the Nazi regime to live in the forest for several years during WW2 and developing a community that continually grew. There is a good DVD extra which shows some of the modern day ancestors of these survivors.We enjoyed the movie, it is a worthwhile story and the acting is superb. It DOES require lots of patience at times with its running time of over 2 hours.Daniel Craig stars as Tuvia Bielski who becomes the leader of the forest community. Liev Schreiber plays his brother Zus Bielski, and initially they are at odds with each other. Zus is more militant, wants to hunt down and kill all the Germans he can, while Tuvia is more of a peace maker. So Zus and several others actually go away to join the fighting with a Russian band.Jamie Bell is good as the younger, third brother, Asael Bielski. Alexa Davalos is good as Lilka Ticktin who eventually becomes bonded with Tuvia.There are no big surprises here, just a solid movie about the hunted Jews building a forest community and surviving in the forest during the war. If they had been in concentration camps instead they likely would all have been killed.</fullReview>

He pulls off the Russian character of Tuvia very well, the execution of the dramatic scenes work well, and the direction is superb. This is one of the misjudged epics this year, because this should have been one of the top grossing movies, but sadly some overrated nonsense had to take over people at some point.After Downfall (Der Untergang) this is a war epic that is a must see. There are a few underrated performances from the guy who played Billy Elliot, and he deserves some credit because I really haven't seen him in anything after Billy Elliot so he did well.Definitely Recommend it, as not many good war movies like this, with such quality actors and direction, are made any more 8 out of 10 as a movie but as a war movie, compared with others it is a 9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another great Daniel Craig film! It should be enjoyed by most avid film watchers, especially persons who have an interest in some of the less talked about holocaust survival attempts that occurred outside of Germany during the Second World War. This particular piece has a little something for everyone; fear, love, war, and most importantly passion. The filming was absolutely wonderful in every sense both during action and scenic shots. In terms of acting, my favourite performance comes from Liev Schreiber as he portrays the character of Zus Bielski with a passionate fervour. As a side note, if you enjoy this film (especially the genre) take a look at "Archangel" and "Fatherland". These are two adaptations of Robert Harris books that fall into the alternate historical fiction category. Daniel Craig appears in the former.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the height of WW2, four Jewish brothers (Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell and George MacKay) and hide deep in the Belarussian forest to evade the Nazis that have murdered their parents and countless others. Other persecuted Jews join them in their struggle to keep their freedom and fight against Nazism. This is the basic premise of 'Defiance', an interesting, entertaining movie that, while too long, is alternately action-packed and quietly moving. It's primarily about their struggle for freedom, but its also a study of the relationships between brothers and group dynamics. Craig of course is a sturdy leading man, even if he doesn't quite convince at times in his role. I thought Liev Schreiber outdid 007 himself in the 'he-man' role-- once Schreiber gets the machine gun in his hands, you know they're going to be safe. Jamie Bell also looks to have a promising future. The main problem with the film is it's weak pacing and often sluggish writing. Craig's inspiring speeches feel very written and the film just ebbs along at times without anything happening. The female love interests are very underwritten. However, the performances across the board are good and the cinematography (beautiful winter scenes) and score are excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Band of Bielski brothers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Zwick (the man who gave us Glory and The Last Samurai) now gives us yet another slice of historical drama. This time around it's the story of the Bielski brothers, surviving members of a Jewish family in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe who escape into an expansive woodland and then start setting up camp. As more and more survivors join them the brothers realise that they now, for better or worse, lead a fully-fledged community. As tense as things already are, they are not helped by power struggles, the constant threat of discovery and run-ins with Russian resistance fighters who do not want anything to make matters worse in their own running battle.Daniel Craig, Jamie Bell and Liev Schreiber star as the brothers and all do well with their different dramatic moments, they also do reasonably well with the accents but it was obviously a commercial decision to cast them as their very presence does detract somewhat from the sense of realism that the movie endeavours to have. But what's done is done.As for the storyline of the film itself, things tend to get even more gripping during the smaller moments of tension and uncertainty rather than during any major Nazi-dodging scenes. The power struggle between, mainly, Craig and Schreiber is well played out and you can sense it as a powder-keg waiting to explode. There are also a few moments that pose interesting moral dilemmas about how justifiable the actions of certain people are when forced to do anything to survive. And with the way the Jews were treated by the Nazis it will come as no surprise to see many characters struggle with their moral compass when they finally have a chance to turn the tables: in a scene that immediately brings to mind the final moments from Animal Farm (the George Orwell version, NOT that other one . . . you mucky devil).Solid, if not fantastic, is what you can say about this movie in every aspect. The direction, the acting, the script, etc. Everything is solid. Solid enough, hopefully, to make you delve a little further into the true story it is based on and to find out more about a period of history in which the human spirit really surpassed anything we thought it could deal with.See this if you like: The Pianist, Schindler's List, Valkyrie.</fullReview>

The two brothers' plan of defiance ? avenging the deaths of the many as many as they can - ? is unoriginal, and so are their different opinions on how to resist the enemy. Nevertheless "Defiance" is a well-done historical flick in which you realize you're watching something manipulated for dramatic purposes. Concept is reinforced by all the violins that play Jewish music to arouse the appropriate emotions, so everything results in an emotional piece that hits the target. I liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is not worth more than 4 stars.Why people in here have given it so much, I don't understand.The movie sucked, in general and in detail. and we have noted down quite some of them.so, if you're not pulled off by the above and want to continue reading go ahead.first of all, the Bielski family were Polish, not Belorussian, Jews. and Polish Jews spoke Polish, not Russian. Bielski himself spoke poor Russian, he was quite fluent in Polish and Yiddish. so.. the question is... why do they make the characters in the movie talk Russian and write Polish? another thing is, if you make a movie and want to put something in a foreign language in it, make sure it's correct. just a little movie-makers hint. what was written in Polish on a label attached to the hanged farmer said "amant &#x17c;ydów", which translates roughly into, putting it nicely, "someone who enjoys Jews in a sexual way". the English translation said "Jew lover". well.. I'm quite sure they did not mean THAT kind of love here...the Bielski group never fought Germans. they were never a guerrilla. they lived in the forest alright, and fought mostly Russians. and Polish guerrillas. basically, they would fight anyone.so... Tewje Bielski is not a Robin Hood. nor would he ever give speeches like that about "freedom", "being chased like animals but not being animals" and all other sort of American rhetoric.BTW, didn't he look just like Braveheart, on his white horse, talking to those tormented Jews? now... we are reaching a very complicated issue with the name Naliboki.in the movie Naliboki was the name of Bielski's camp. quite an unfortunate name as in reality it was not quite so.Naliboki was/is the name of a small Polish town that was allegedly massacred and burnt by Bielski's "troops". the truth is though, that the massacre was authored by a Soviet fighting group with the help of some local guerrillas, none of them being even related to Bielski. the blame was put on Bielski by the Soviets years later when investigation was drawn to explain war crimes in that region (many people today still believe the Bielski people are responsible for the massacre.) to include this in the movie might have made a really interesting plot line, instead we have a huge confusion.the Bielski forming his group and the Naliboki massacre took place during a war, quite uncomfortable for Poland, Soviets, Jews and everyone else Polish-Soviet. this conflict broke out round 1943 in the nowogródek area (a local little war inside the World War II, with no clear division between the "good guys" and the "bad guys".. that's a bit too complicated for Hollywood..).OK, but referring to the movie, apart from the fact the shots were good, it was historically inaccurate, interpreted in a wooden and iconic way... can't say much.waste of celluloid.I'd rather some movie makers didn't wipe their mouth with a "true story" label. if anything, it might have been "inspired by" with the source of inspiration left remotely behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History Can Be Stranger (And Grander) Than Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hidden amongst the multiple film histories that litter the movies, occasionally you'll find a gem of a story that surprises the hell out of you. And DEFIANCE is definitely one of those. Based on the real-life story of the Bielski brothers who helped hide and save over 1,000 Jews from the Nazi death camps, this story is told in an unflinching narrative with brutal acts alongside those of extreme courage.We often hear that reality can be stranger (and grander) than fiction, and here this holds doubly true. For not only did the Bielski brothers do this amazing ordeal, they also didn't ask for any recognition, reward, or medals. They married and immigrated after WW II ended and decided to live out quiet lives in their little corners of the world (with the exception of one brother who was conscripted into the Soviet army and died in battle).But fate has a strange way of finding heroes, and this time was no exception. A documentary in 2006 entitled The Bielski Brothers: Jerusalem in the Woods was aired on the History Channel, and two books about them can easily be found, too. As word of what they'd done passed down through generations of survivors (now numbering in the tens of thousands), Hollywood took notice and sought out their history. Not having to embellish much (if at all) this incredible story, a screenplay was rapidly approved, director Ed Zwick (BLOOD DIAMOND) attached, and the rest is ...well ...history.Daniel Craig (QUANTUM OF SOLACE) takes the lead role as brother Tuvia, a man with a military past and Jewish roots. When his parents and friends are killed by Nazi hunters and sympathizers, Tuvia and brothers Zus (Liev Schreiber, THE PAINTED VEIL), Asael (Jamie Bell, KING KONG, 2005), and young Aron (George MacKay) head into the woods for safety. But vengeance versus fear drives what will come next. Tuvia kills his parents' murderers and then ducks deeper into the forests around Belarus. And with him comes other Jews fleeing the Nazi slaughters. Playing a game of hide-and-seek with their tormentors, The Bielski brothers and their followers didn't just cower in fear, but stood up and launched occasional attacks against the German troops. But their greatest victory was surviving and thriving in their forest hideouts. By wars end, they had not only survived, but multiplied and thrived.Fascinating.To this day, I often wonder if Hitler is turning over in his grave over this. I think he is. And what a wonderful form of revenge that is. Not because it took some violence on the Jews part to achieve it, but because violence wasn't their primary goal. It was survival. Surviving "The Final Solution" was the one thing Hitler most certainly wouldn't have wanted. And not only did the Bielski brothers and their followers achieve it, they added to their numbers. Sweet revenge! Daniel Craig does a superb job as Tuvia, including a very believable accent. As does Liev Schreiber as his embittered brother Zus. In fact, I can't think of a single actor/actress that didn't live up to their part in this film. It was a gem to find amongst the forest of other movies out there.</fullReview>

Usually "based on true events" can mean anything really but this one doesn't stray far from the facts, and it doesn't need to. Had it been just another contrived piece of eye candy it would be worthless, but the fact that so much of it actually happened makes it, in my opinion one of the best WWII movies i am aware of. I have read some unfavourable reviews and cant for the life of me figure out what these people are talking about. See the movie, if you like compelling story, good actors at their best, exciting action, and above all, the truth; you will love defiance. My only beef is the actors look nothing like their real life counterparts (all the main characters are real). oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is Daniel Craig's finest performance..The film starts out very slowly telling the story of the main characters but picks up speed very quickly after that with numerous battles with the Germany's with amazing effects and explosion.This film is also very deep with the story if the characters being very well written and played by the actors.The film becomes slightly repetitive after a while but if you can survive that it is a very good solid film...This film isn't quite the adrenaline rush of other war films but it has a much more complex story line that makes up for any loss of action.A Must see!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting film about fascinating, little known story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very interesting film about the real life story of the Bielski brothers, who after barely escaping the massacre of their family by the Germans in Belorussia during World War II, moved to the nearby forest and formed a Jewish militia. Soon many more refugees join in (including women, children and elderly people) and the group reached the low thousands. With some aid from the Soviets, they successfully survived the war and even fought back in a number of occasions the German attacks (though apparently they did not engage in combat in real life as much as it appears in the film, very wisely, given the disproportion of forces between the two sides). Daniel Craig is a perfect in the role of Tuvia Bielski, who as the elder of the brothers was the commander of the militias. Much of the humor in the movie is the contrast between the tough guy nature of the two elder Bielski brothers and the far more intellectual demeanor of the rest of the group, most of them urban professional types who for the first time in their life have to learn how to survive in the forest. Though the film is somewhat conventional in its narrative, it is nevertheless both fascinating and beguiling. The beautiful, haunting forest where they hid is another attraction to the movie (the film was shot in Lithuania, next door to Belorussia where the action took place). It is somewhat surprising this story was never brought to the screen in sixty something years (this probably have to do with the low profile that the Bielski brothers choose for themselves after the war as well as for the fact that their alliance with the Red Army made their saga somewhat politically uncomfortable during the Cold War).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparing this to Shindler's List doesn't do it justice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In fact, this may be the most impressive work from director Edward Zwick. The usual Zwick movies tend to play the big scale and go over-dramatic here and there. Movies like The Last Samuri, Blood Diamond and Legends of the Fall all suffer because they are sometimes a bit overdone and sounded phony. Don't get me wrong; he is really a good director in his favorite genre--warfare. Glory is still the best US civil war movie to date with glorious performances. In my opinion, Defiance comes very close in terms of performances. However, what made it stood out is its honesty.Honestly, this movie doesn't portray big-time heroes like Tom Cruise's Nathan Algren or dramatic moments that wrench your guts like in Legends of the Fall. There's no Brad Pitt goes Rambo or Diccaprio goes Commandos. Neither are there lifting long shots with main characters crying on their killed loved ones. Everything was shot in a more tranquilized, restrained style, although not rendering the whole movie in ultra-realism, still delivered a totally different WW2 movie that's worth a nod. There are virtually no very obvious dramatic turns in this character/plot-driven storyline. All characters have their ego or responsibilities and these things don't change as cheap miracles like other movies. Most impressive achievement is that the director managed to keep the audiences on the edge of their conscience and compassion for 2 hours and still entertained, bringing in positive messages. It's a good movie that tells us the greatest events/moments were usually off the screen, and a group of desperate, weak, sick and lost people can work out their miracle out of the darkest war. The last moments were very inspiring with the true mini-biographies of main characters.Defiance is almost not biased or overdone, which gave it another quality, which allowed you to view this movie in many perspectives. The scene in which the angry Jews beat the German prisoner to death is a good example of character-development and real history reflection. You can definitely interpret it in many different ways.Like the other Zwick movies, Defiance was made with great artistic values. Camera works fantastically in the jungle. The changing seasons and the wild defined the movie's desperate undertone. Not to mention the haunting music that is nominated for Oscar. I really like seeing a good director like Zwick taking notes from other great filmmakers and surpasses himself. Way to go, Mr. Edward!.Defiance is a great movie, and for all great movies' sake, don't try to compare it with Shindler's List or Pianist. It's good enough on its own. And, I still don't understand why people formed an expectation that it's trying to make an artistic breakthrough like Shindler. After all, this is just about some very ordinary Jews trying to survive.8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie about survival and humanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie last night and have to say that overall, I was pleased. This isn't Zwick's best, but I'm certain it's one of his best.The story centers on the Bielski brothers that struggle to survive from the Nazi's persecution and against all odds achieve to live in the forest with many of other Jew survivors that they helped to escape from German hands.I'm not going to say it all, because in reality, the movie itself talks about survival, and of course, the director handles us some pretty good action scenes of his trademark during the entire movie. Daniel Craig possibly gives us one of his best performances in his entire career, as well as Liev Schreiber that personifies brilliantly the cold Zus Bielski.The languages' alternating idea was pretty interesting and gave a lot more of realism to the movie.The tape is a powerful, realistic peace of history and teaches a lesson of survival and human cooperation. However, I think it was way underrated by the public and somehow forgotten. Shame, because it's a great movie recommended to all WWII and History lovers - 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many a movie has been made about the Third Reich, and it has been fulfilling how each one looks at a specific topic within the Reich. Such is the case with Edward Zwick's "Defiance". The movie focuses on Tuvia (Daniel Craig) and Zus Bielski (Liev Schreiber), Jewish brothers who established a secret camp in the forest in Nazi-occupied Poland (the region where the movie is set is now part of Belarus). In avoiding the German army, the brothers align themselves with the Soviet army, who also looked down on Jews.Most important is the fact that, in the midst of the horror surrounding them, all of the people in the camp find a way to maintain their hope, and the viewer strongly feels for them. The coming of winter seems to represent the near despair overcoming some of the people, but the coming of spring represents their renewed hope.I should say that this movie is not "Schindler's List". Not even close. But even what it lacks is more than made up for by the acting and cinematography. I recommend it.Also starring Jamie Bell ("Billy Elliott"), George MacKay, Alexa Davalos, Mia Wasikowska, Iben Hjejle and Jodhi May ("A World Apart").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another based on a true story World War II film. This over two hour long epic was filmed in Lithuania and the scenery is actually beautiful in a rustic way. The feel of the movie is authentic enough, but I'm not one to argue the historic details. Daniel Craig plays Tuvia Bielski, a every man's man that has the right stuff to be a hero. Family, honor and staying alive are things that make ordinary men do daring things. Tuvia and his brother Zus(Liev Schreiber) take up the Jewish cause and turn farmers, bookkeepers and watch makers into freedom fighters versus the Germans in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe. The brothers and their ever growing number of war refugees build a small community in the Belarus woods and actually join up with a Russian regiment in order to have the man power to survive the raiding Nazi forces. Inspirational and full of war action.Other cast members: Alexa Davaloe, Mark Feuerstein, Jamie Bell, Jodie May and George MacKay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This motto serves to sum the feelings of the Bielski brothers as they escape the horrors of the Nazi extermination of Jews in 1941. Adapted from Dr. Nechama Tec's book DEFIANCE: THE BIELSKI PARTISANS by director Edward Zwick and Clayton Frohman this film is as much about family devotion as it is about extended family. It is a touching story of survival under the most impossible conditions and a story of heroism that is far too unknown among even scholars of the WW II period. Set in 1941 DEFIANCE introduces four brothers of the Bielski family (the parents have been victims of the Nazi Final Solution in Belorussia) - the compassionate brother Tuvia (Daniel Craig), angry and reactive brother Zus (Liev Schreiber), and the younger brothers Asael (Jamie Bell) and Aron (George McKay). In response to the war the brothers find refuge in the forest where gradually they encounter other Jews hiding from the Nazis and through thoughtful and clever means form an ever enlarging community where their extended family is fed and cared for and prepared with weapons stolen from the Nazis to defend their existence and protect them from being placed in the death camps. The film is a series of encounters with the enemy but it is also a very touching collection of stories of survival in the wilderness by such concepts as allowing men to have 'forest wives', pitting the religious teachings of a professor Haretz (Allan Corduner) and the pure intellectualism of writer Isaac Malbin (Mark Feurstein), and other interludes of interpersonal coping with tragedy. The cast is a fine one with Liev Schreiber the most convincing, but with a fine new role type for Daniel Craig. There is an odd mixture of accents from each of the actors - each trying to imitate the Russian sound. But in the end the viewer is left with a sense of respect and even awe at the courage and discipline of outcasts surviving a hideous nightmare, simply by staying alive. Grady Harp</fullReview>

It has many clichés, like in only one example, 2 of the brothers have a big fight &amp; drift apart for part of movie, BUT at a climatic moment they are back together. Also just to titillate the paying customers,we have a tasteful nude love scene.The brothers are played by Daniel Craig, Liev Schrieber &amp; Jamie Bell. They are good,the entire cast is good,BUT with so many accents,it was hard to know what language they really'were speaking.

		<shortDescription>Defiance A Very Well Made Important World War 2 Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defiance is a very well made important World War 2 movie thats based on a true story. I wont say too much about it plot wise because Defiance is one of those movies thats better if you see it without knowing too much about what the film is about. Director Edward Zwick the man behind films like Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, and Courage Under Fire does a great job of bringing this true story to the big screen because it deserves to be told. The movie is about four Jewish brothers who escape into the Belarussian forest in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe where they and about 1,000 other Jewish people must work together as a community if they want to survive. Daniel Craig, Liev Shrieber, and Jamie Bell are very good in their roles as three of the four brothers. They speak with accents and are believable as these three Jewish men. The rest of the cast are solid in their roles portraying people who have lost everything and are now on the run from the Nazi's hunting them. Well done. The location for the forest where they build their village was a perfect choice and mostly everything in this film works. The action/battle sequences are well paced and very realistic. The pacing between the action was a little slow at times but the rest of the movie definitely made up for its one flaw. If you're a fan of war movies than you can't go wrong with Defiance. It's an excellent movie based on a true story with exceptional performances by it's three lead actors. Go see it. You can't go wrong with this film. It's entertaining and the movie tells an important story of survival against all odds that definitely deserves to be told.</fullReview>

The scenes featuring the growing divide between the two brothers over the direction their resistance should take are among the best in the film.Often violent, occasionally heart-warming and constantly bleak, this film is recommended viewing.

		<shortDescription>Some Good Action Sequences mixed w/ bad Writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defiance is a mixed bag. It features some fairly exhilarating action sequences but too much 1-liner sitcom-ish banter with fairly standard characters in a well over 2 hour movie. One-liners have little place in a holocaust movie and yet here they are littered all over the place waxing as provocative. And there seems to be some fairly standard clichés. Humor is not witty - and supposed accents come and go. Probably the worst sequence is a particularly tasteless cut of angry Jewish refugees angry mobbing a German soldier - over-the-top and excessive. Some of the character interaction is decent as between the brothers, and the finale action scene if unrealistic is fun to watch. All-and-all the movie needed better editing and pacing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Defiance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first thoughts about the film, was of Ken Loach's The Wind That Shakes The Barley, the Palme d'Or winner in 2006. Similarly, Defiance has brothers leading a rag-tag group of Jewish refugees in guerrilla warfare and a quest for survival, where being alive everyday means a middle finger to the Third Reich during WWII, and organizing themselves to become a tightly knitted community where, like their Russian neighbours, everyone has an equal role to play to get rewarded with equal food. And with two lion-hearted brothers at the helm, sooner or later the sibling rivalry will rear its ugly head, and differing political ideals will see them part ways.Dramatized from a true story, you can sense the kind of films that Edward Zwick selects. From Glory to the much maligned Siege, from The Last Samurai to Blood Diamonds, it's almost always the battle against an oppressive regime, where the underdogs hold out to tell their tale another day. It's a battle within oneself to do what one perceives as the right thing, nevermind about the extremely limited resources, or the weather coming to wreck havoc, and the challenge to hold a community of strangers together working toward a common goal.Set in Belarus during the German invasion of WWII, David Craig plays Tuvia Bielski, who is akin to the Moses of the day by the community he shields and looks after, because they move in exodus from point to point within the forest to escape detection and get out of harm's way. The religious metaphors here are inevitably strong, and plays a major part given that God's chosen people are questioning their persecution, one point even praying to denounce that birthright so that they could no longer need to suffer under the hands of man, and the weather. Craig's role here is 10 times better than his Bland Bond from Quantum of Solace, and has more personality here to showcase his acting chops.Liev Schreiber holds his own as the brother Zus Bielski, who subscribes to the mantra of an eye for an eye, preferring the rough and tumble of being an aggressor rather than to cower, believing that the best defense is still an offense, wanting to bring the war back to the Nazis. He also prefers not to accept anymore refugees that they can handle, as their group get sought out by hundreds on sheer reputation alone. So herein they clash, and he throws his weight behind their Russian neighbours in their resistance effort. Schreiber here has a more action-oriented role, but has enough screen presence to not get overshadowed by Craig's star power.And rounding up the brothers is Jamie Bell's Asael Bielski, and if Tuvia's the Moses, then here's Joshua, the young man who shows his mettle during a critical scene in a flight for survival. Supporting the brothers' screen presence are a whole host of characters ranging from their individual lady love (yes, there's always time for a morale boosting wedding), and the bantering of two intellectuals played by Allan Corduner and Mark Feuerstein over chess games, allowing fleeting discussions into whether support from the Russians is the lesser of two evils. There's also time given to community politics, and the selfishness of man, always trying to snook established practices for self-benefit at the detriment of the community, especially one whose members are weak to fend for themselves.There aren't many uplifting moments in the movie, as there's always more problems they encounter before any semblance of light at the end of their tunnel. Production values are excellent, and unlike the much talked about lack of accents in Bryan Singer's Valkyrie, this one does have everyone speaking in their East European accent in order to maintain some level of authenticity. You'd know what to expect from an Edward Zwick film, and this one doesn't stray too much from that established expectation. For WWII war-movie junkies, this film should also be in your shortlist of must-watchs.</fullReview>

The film was somewhat informative, and I don't feel that it deserves the controversy that surrounds it. In fact I didn't even think that the Moses thing was too petentious, if you see what Tuvia Bielski accomplished.Believe it or not, this really isn't an action film, just a family drama with action sequences. Those sequences were well done, although sometimes, two groups shooting at each other gets a little tedious. It has some great scenes, including one with a captured SS officer, which was really interesting.All in all, an intense drama with some cool action, even if it changes facts a bit...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Zwick's nor 2008's best but overall good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Zwick is one of my favorite directors because he captures stories brilliantly whether it is about the 54th Massachusetts in "Glory" or an American in Japan with "The Last Samurai." With "Defiance" he captures a story that I had never heard of during WWII but it makes it interesting. His movies always border on the issues of morals, survival, and emotional melodrama, yet I felt somewhat detached to this film. The acting was good, particularly on Liev Schreiber's part who is absolutely fearless. Daniel Craig also pulls in the best performance of his career. The contrast between the two characters is great to watch. Schreiber's character is driven by vengeance and tactics while Craig's character is more about trying to keep things organized and a strong believer in discipline. The other actors are all right, making good characters, but for some reason I did not care for them as much as I did with the previously mentioned films above by Edward Zwick. I did not feel moved by the movie more or less cried. James Newton Howard's score added some oomph to the film in emotion, but music can only go so far. The movie also kind of developed a stereotype of the Nazis as evil, invaders that "we do not speak of" that must be avoided in the forest like in Shyamalan's "The Village". I was also surprised that this received the R rating. Most of Zwick's films are R rated and for good reasons but this was rather tame. I don't deny the high body count though. I guess it got the rating over Schreiber's occasional f-bombs. Anyway, "Defiance" is a good film that explores a unique story that maintained my interest for all 2 hours and 17 minutes. It has exceptional performances and some promising action sequences/shootouts, but it does not hold up as one of Zwick's nor 2008's best movies. My rating: *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just gotten back from seeing this movie. I knew it was loosely based on a true story, but I see from the other comments on this discussion that it isn't a faithful telling of that story. The number of movies with just that flaw, from Lord of the Rings to The Longest Day, is pretty extensive. The point is, it isn't attempting to be a documentary.Be that as it may, it is an amazing movie. If you take the movie on it's own terms, and in it's own context, it is exceptional. Craig and Schreiber are outstanding, showing the push-pull dynamics of two strong personalities that just happen to be brothers. While most of the other actors are not familiar to me, I thought they brought an wonderful reality to the story. The women had strong roles, not just the helpless appendages they are in some movies of this type. They might start out that way, but in the effort to survive, they take on stronger and stronger roles.The oldest brother, played by Craig, has a past...that is hinted at by his old teacher who ends up in the camp. He's a bit of an enigma at the first, showing both an almost heartless ruthlessness, and squeamishness too. He doesn't want to become an animal, but realizes that there is a balance between strength and morality. The different relationships are very interesting, and psychologically, at least, are very valid.So I guess I could summarize it by saying, if you are looking for absolute truthfulness, read a book or see a documentary. If you are looking for a realistic take on what makes intolerance and war hell, but not without it's redeeming side, see this movie.</fullReview>

Director Edward Zwick delivered after Blood Diamond another great job. Defiance was well packed with drama, suspense and wonderful pictures from the Russian woods. This true story explains the audience very well that nothing is impossible when we believe in something. Daniel Craigs delivered a solid performance and his messages very clear. Liev Schreiber was excellent in his role as the great warrior.

		<fullReview>From director Edward Zwick (Glory, Blood Diamond), I knew the critics didn't approve fully with this second world war drama based on a true story, but I was going to see it no matter what. Set in Poland, three Jewish brother: Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber) and Asael Bielski (Jamie Bell) have escaped capture by the Germans, and as they hide in the woods, they are joined by many other Jewish people. They are now finding all the food and weapons they can forage to survive in the forest. The only rules are that everyone sticks together, everyone gets the same rations, and no women must get pregnant. This is extraordinary story of survival in the most unlikely of environments, it ultimately grew to a total of 1,200 Jews living in the forest for another two years. Also starring Alexa Davalos as Lilka Ticktin, Allan Corduner as Shamon Haretz, Mark Feuerstein as Isaac Malbin, Tomas Arana as Ben Zion Gulkowitz, Jodhi May as Tamara Skidelsky, Kate Fahy as Riva Reich, Iddo Goldberg as Yitzchak Shulman and George MacKay as Aron Bielski. Craig makes a good lead with his Polish accent, Shreiber and Bell have their moments as his brother too, it is a good story with some eye-catching scenes. I can't really see why the critics give this film two out of five stars, I mean I guess I've seen some of the material in some other war films, but so what? It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Original Score for James Newton Howard. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Defiance is a story that absolutely shatters your heart if you're not being careful. Unfortunately it didn't with me but that had nothing to do with the movie. It had to do with the teenagers sitting behind me. I mean, really. Is it so hard to not make stupid comments and to not kick the back of my chair? I almost did a Wolverine and yelled and screamed and killed them. Sadly I didn't. Anyway back to the movie. It was beautiful, although a little slow in paces. If they'd picked up the pace it might have been an even better movie.I also wish some of the characters were a little bit better realised because Defiance doesn't really use them to their full potential in places. Some particularly fantastic moments of sadness and anguish which echoed the holocaust were in the movie. Sadly, at one point I wanted to cry when Zus found out about his dead wife and child but I couldn't because I was irritated at the people behind me calling him 'Emo' But the emotion conveyed by Liev Schrieber in that particular scene was amazing, you felt for him. And it brought back the realistic idea of what the Holocaust was, of what it did. The consequences, the heroism, the resistance, all of these add up to the defiance that these solders portrayed for their religion and I was amazed to find out how many lives they saved during their time.A very nice comment on a true story which gives a new light on the Jews in Russia during World War II.</fullReview>

I've read and heard a lot of reviews about choppy editing/directing/and so forth, but I didn't see that at all. I felt the story flowed very well on several levels, both on historical level and the character level. Daniel Craig, Liev Shreiber, and Jamie Bell each played their character with sincerity and humanity, drawing you in to each of their stories. Jamie Bell's performance really stood out to me, a quiet but strong light. Go see this movie without a critics outlook and I think you will find something very special in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zwick's best film; extraordinary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defiance succeeds where most Holocaust films crash and burn. In most films of this nature, they try to force tragedy down the viewer's throat by depicting everything cinematically so you can say "Oh, look how well they shot that scene with the the four Nazis raping and killing that girl". It has a habit of coming off as exploitative to me, instead of just depicting the true events. They put so much effort into showing just how awful everything was, and as a result it feels artificial. I personally don't think a film can ever depict a real life tragedy as despicable as that, and Defiance succeeds because it doesn't try to. Zwick puts the focus onto the characters and their experience, instead of attempting to show the overall brutality of the event. He makes it a character film instead of a Holocaust one.On the surface, this is a relatively simple story of men rising up and protecting people who were in trouble. But at it's heart, there is much more. As I said, it's definitely a character drama and most of the film focuses on the relationships between these people in crisis. Each of the three main brothers (there is a fourth brother who doesn't get much attention) get a significant amount of screen time and their own individual stories of love, tragedy and emotional extremes. Tuvia (Daniel Craig) is the oldest brother and as a result he takes the position as the leader of the group. Craig portrays him wonderfully as a flawed hero, rising to protect so many people but being unable to handle the pressure that comes with it when he's saved them all but now has no idea what to do with them. Zus (Liev Schreiber) is a brute of a man who wants to help these people, but is more focused on getting revenge for the loss of his family. Asael (Jamie Bell) is a boy who develops into a young, experienced man over the course of the film.At it's core, Defiance is a story of three men who rise up out of their tragic circumstances to become something more than just Jews who persevered. They became heroes because they survived while helping others to do the same. But no hero is perfect and that's where the film really drew me in. The drama that was stirred up between these men, whether they were fighting against the Nazis, against the people they saved, or even against each other, absolutely fascinated me. Tuvia has to live with the pressure of trying to provide a decent state of living for all of the people he saved. About halfway through the film, Zus lets his need for violent revenge get in the way of what is truly important and he leaves the woodland society the Bielskis built to go and fight for a group of Russians who are busy killing Nazis. And Asael's transformation is actually what fascinated me the most. In the beginning he is too overwhelmed with sadness to be of much help to anyone, but as Tuvia gets sicker and sicker near the end, Asael rises up and becomes a leader for the group in the time when they need a leader the most. He becomes what Tuvia was in the beginning to these people; a shining light in a time of unimaginable darkness.The characters definitely make this film the brilliant work that it is, and that is in no small part thanks to the actors who portray them. Daniel Craig finally has the chance to lead a big, widely seen epic like this, thanks to his fantastic work as the new James Bond. And he doesn't take his new status lightly, seen here in a tremendous performance. He brings so much quiet pain to Tuvia throughout the film, but he is most impressive when he lets the rage building inside him out into the open. He is mostly seen as a peaceful person who just wants to protect people, but when he lets that aggression out he is truly terrifying. Liev Schreiber's performance is the exact opposite. Although he doesn't express it in a theatric manner, for most of the film his Zus is looking for blood. It's in those quiet moments, like a relationship with a woman they saved or his breakdown after learning that his wife and child are dead, that his performance is the most impressive and is why he was the highlight of the cast. Jamie Bell is one of the best young actors working today and he proves that again with what I believe is his best performance yet. Of course they aren't the only actors in the project and everyone else, from their three love interests to all of the other unique characters living in the society they built, gives solid supporting work.Being a Zwick epic, Defiance is not only filled with layered, tragic characters but also contains a bounty of massively entertaining, beautifully orchestrated action scenes. The technical aspects, from the cinematography and score down to the sound and costume design, are all tremendous and come together to create a believable, authentic setting for these characters to make this emotional journey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>surviving the holocaust in slick Hollywood style with occasional power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want some part of the world or little story of historical significance blown up to heights of melodrama and typical performance heights that emphasize gobs of emoting in some difficult (but conventional) situations, Edward Zwick is your man. He's not a bad filmmaker, and if anything he's very suited to tell this sort of feel-good/sort-of-feel-bad movie about Jews who band together in the woods to survive with hundreds of other local Polish Jews. The bond between the three brothers in the story (Daniel Craig, Liev Schrieber, Jamie Bell) is one of the more fascinating parts of the picture, as are the actors performances to greater or lessor degrees. Their varying methods and ways of going about the business of survival and revenge are the most significant thing to keep track of: one, Craig, wants to keep this community of Jewish refugees together and keep out of vengeance, another, Schreiber, wants only to get Nazi blood, and another, Bell, falls for the nice girl and becomes a leader later on in the film.Significant because, frankly, it's one of the only things in the picture that comes across with conviction and certainty that doesn't feel like a checklist (save, of course, for that "twist" ending where Zus comes to the aide of Tuvia that has been done in more movies than I can think of, however minorly rousing it is). Because we're in this Bielski resistance camp for the bulk of the picture the drama focuses on little things, little occurrences and strife and the power games between other members in the group (or one member) as opposed to what the film appears to be in the trailer as a riveting action movie. The sad thing is whenever there's action, with a couple of exceptions like a simple revenge killing early in the story by Tuvia, it's filmed in that dreadful whiplash framework where the camera is going up and around and it's all in this cheesy slow-motion; it's either that or the now oft-used since Saving Private Ryan "seeing-things-in-slow-motion-while-thirty-seconds-deaf" moment with Tuvia. What drama there is around this should be more riveting but comes down to details that don't have ultimately much bearing on the plot (such as a pregnancy), when it should be squarely about the bare-bones nature of survival in the woods in the winter. There's some of that, which is all well and good, but not enough, and certainly not with the kind of daring that these real people being depicted deserve.Some terrific performances, as usual in a Zwick production (the kind that are begging for recognition at awards season but never really get to the top of the pops), and some bits that made me feel happy (i.e. the woman confronted by the wolf). It's also too long, too one note and an ending that feels too easily of the up-note. Defiance is another in a stretch of holocaust/WW2 set films that have been (un)intentionally flooding theaters recently, from indie (Adam Resurrected) to big-budget Hollywood (Valkyrie). This is neither the best nor the worst; I imagine those wanting a lesser dosage of Craig as a bad-ass Jew after his much better turn in Munich may look here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel Craig was (in my opinion) an extremely poor choice to replace Sean Connery as the new James Bond. In this film he is perfect. Excellent and convincing in his role as Tuvia Bielski, the true story of a band of Polish Jews who defied and beat the Nazis in their determination to survive. They saved 1200 lives. They now have 10,000 descendants. The Bielski brothers lived and came to America after the war.Sustained my interest and was suspenseful and unpredictable throughout. Entirely believable. I have read the book with a full account of their heroic actions, and I find the film accurate. (If the director and producer took slight liberties for the purpose of telling the story, I have no complaints or criticism of their decisions. Artists are allowed poetic licence for exactly that purpose.) I highly recommend this well done movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward Zwick. Master of the politically correct action film. From The Last Samurai, to The Siege, to Glory, to Blood Diamond, Zwick continues to masterfully blend riveting entertainment with lush cultural backdrops, history and deep societal issues. Having already tackled nearly every other conflict such as The American Civil War, the African conflict, battles of ancient Asia and modern day terrorist scenarios we are now brought into WWII.Movies set in the second world war are numerous, as are those centered around the struggles of the Jewish population at the hand of the Nazi's. But when you infuse a common plot device with a moving true story, impeccable direction, an incredibly tense but character driven narrative and anchor the former with three fantastic performances you get something worth seeking out.Defiance tells the true (to what extent I am unsure) story of the Bielski brothers, a band of rough, sometimes brutal smugglers who flee into the Belarussian forest after the Nazi extermination begins. Struck with mounting losses of close family and friends the three eldest brothers played by Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell (as Tuvia, Zus and Asael respectively) band, reluctantly, with other refugees of the massacres and begin to form a small village deep within the forest. As the Nazi's push deeper, the Bielski's are forced to confront both enemy soldiers and each other as the situation becomes increasingly desperate.Although peppered with extraordinarily choreographed battle sequences, the true bulk of what makes defiance such a success is the interactions between the brothers, chiefly Tuvia and Zus. The struggles between their bond as kin and their desires to be leaders is fully realized and expertly portrayed. Craig, Schreiber and Bell are all excellent nicely holding their Russian accents throughout the film and all pull off a great sense of chemistry with the three women they respectively meet over their years of hiding. The Bielski's are all deeply flawed individuals; at times brutal and callous but rise to the occasion and display warmth and humanity when their followers need it most. The refugees' struggles never feels false either, as the deadly winter months, sickness and internal conflict is completely visceral.If there is any fault to be found it would be with the familiar story of Jews in a struggle, but as I motioned it is still a compelling tale. There are moments that sag, and perhaps a few too many scenes with Zus and Tuvia duking it out, but they are all minor quibbles that are quickly forgotten. This war epic brings the human factor that is lost in many bug budget war epics like Windtalkers and avoids the soapy melodrama of films like Pearl harbour and it is that which makes Defiance both inspiring and resonant.Read all my review at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard but worthy Holocaust drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By necessity, one must focus on the survivors if one wishes to create a workable film about the Holocaust. For its only through the eyes and ears of the survivors (and their tales of suffering) that we can appreciate the enormity, the scope of what occurred to the victims of the Holocaust. Paradoxically, the tales of the survivors are nothing more than anomalies?which may give the wrong impression to the uninformed that the Holocaust was an ennobling event?that these tales of survival were somehow the rule rather than the exception.Defiance is one such anomalous tale. Some critics have likened it to a critique of Jewish passivity?that the overwhelming majority of Jews went to their deaths without putting up a fight. And certainly that reputation is reinforced in 'Defiance' as the protagonists, Tuvia and Zus Bielski, stand out as Jewish outsiders who aren't afraid to fight the Nazis as opposed to the majority of the Jewish 'intellectuals', mostly freshly minted refugees from the ghetto, who end up as part of the Bielski 'community' within the Byelorussian forest.But there is an excellent scene in Defiance, where Tuvia sneaks into the ghetto and confronts the head of the Jewish committee there, that demonstrates that the average Jew was not passive?simply bewildered and overwhelmed. Can you really blame the head of the Jewish committee when he doesn't believe Tuvia's tales of genocide? He says, 'yes, we've heard these stories, but who can really believe them?' Reports of atrocities reached the United States during the War but they were not really appreciated until the actual newsreel photos of truckloads of emaciated bodies were seen being bulldozed into ditches at Bergen-Belsen after the war was over.The opening scenes of 'Defiance' are testament to the brutally swift nature of the Nazi genocide. In most cases, there was simply no time to think about resisting (or escaping). The Nazis came in, along with the help of the local authorities in the occupied territories and murdered the Jews in the blink of an eye. We see this very effectively illustrated in 'Defiance' after the Bielskis find their parents murdered on the family farm.One of the picture's strengths is that it also illustrates the role of the local collaborators who assisted the Nazis. In a dazzlingly effective scene, Tuvia takes revenge by shooting the local police chief and his sons after they've murdered his parents. The collaborators aren't seen as monsters?quite the contrary, in a humanized portrait, the police chief begs for his life and insists he was forced to act at the bidding of his superiors in the Nazi occupation force (in an earlier scene, the police chief comes to a farm looking for one of the Bielski brothers who hides in a barn after attacking a group of Nazis--here the police chief is much more crass and arrogant--but still all too human!).Nonetheless, Zwick, the film's director, should have had another scene involving the collaborators to balance out the 'sympathetic' portrait. The truth of the matter was that there were other of these local collaborators who were outright sadists, capable of incomprehensible, monstrous acts of brutality. Similarly, Zwick shows us a group of Jews in the forest who end up savagely beating a captured German soldier to death (despite his cries that he has a wife and children). While such acts of revenge did occur, it's hard to appreciate the context for their actions (it would have been better if Zwick had actually shown the Bielski parents, for example, being murdered and not merely the aftermath).A good deal of 'Defiance' explores the conflict between the two brothers. Tuvia is the pragmatic one who comes to accept his role as a new 'Moses', leading his beleaguered group of 'intellectuals' to safety through the forest. At first he has only contempt for his fellow Jews who he regards as cowardly and passive. But as time passes, they earn his respect as they all become more proactive. Zus, on the other hand, wants to take direct action against the Nazis and joins the Soviet partisans as one of their fighters. I thought that the characterization of the Russians was one of the strongest parts of the movies. They are depicted sympathetically?shown both for their courage and brutality (Zus eventually leaves the partisans after he can no longer tolerate their anti-semitic stance).A good part of 'Defiance' is taken up showing life in the forest camp. The characterizations are a mixed bag. Some of the characters are standard 'types' (the debate between the 'intellectual' vs. the 'spiritual' Jew is one such example). There are some good scenes depicting the malnourishment that the community had to endure along with a few obligatory romances. One scene I had a hard time believing was when Tuvia kills one of the food hunters who insists that his group gets extra portions of rations. Did that really happen? I'm not sure but it made for good drama.I like Daniel Craig in this role a lot more than as James Bond; he gives a solid performance as an unlikely savior for his people. And Lev Schreiber is excellent as the tough as nails partisan who eventually reunites with his brother after a fractured relationship.Defiance's final scene focuses on the community battling and defeating a large group of Nazi soldiers backed up by a tank. I'm told that this is what actually happened but the way the whole thing is staged seemed a little hard to believe. Nonetheless, Defiance is a film that will keep you absorbed from the opening credits. As a little known history lesson, it does its job. And certainly it was a worthy project to commemorate the deeds of the heroic Bielski brothers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on true story, Defiance is 1941 drama tells the story of 3 Jew Brothers of Poland, who narrowly escape certain death at the hand of Nazis, vowed to take revenge of their near &amp; dear ones by bringing together their fellow men. It's their aim of life to fight back to the force who is trying to exterminate their race. Survival is their big problem among rough woods, indifferent weather, crisis of food &amp; medicine but they have the biggest weapon with them- Courage. The film is a nice tribute to Jew spirit who fought their struggle with all odds &amp; made history of their race. The film is made by Edward Zwick, who gave films like 'Blood Diamond' &amp; 'The Last Samurai'. Zwick knows very well how to combine action with intense drama &amp; he has maintained justice to it in this film also. One thing I like about Zwick is that he never glorify the action. The action always remained a demand of script in his films. The movie is shot almost in the dense surrounding forest maintaining both engaging action &amp; tense drama between Germans &amp; Jews. The film also portrayed the strength of community bonding under the critical period. It's well made film but the problem with the film is- It does not rise above in theme, plot &amp; screenplay &amp; gave you the feeling of seen it all. Besides the film also fumbles in grip in the later half part. The first time I've seen Daniel Craig in such an intense leading character (shedding his 007 image far behind) with balancing his character at his best. Although the character he played remains inconsistent, he gave it his fair trial. He's finely supported by Liev Schreiber as his high tempered brother who took the side with Russian army.No harm in watching once.Ratings-7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defying the odds?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw the trailer for this movie I was sold.The story takes place during WW2 in which three Polish brothers Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), Zus (Leiv Schreiber) and Asael (Jamie Bell) escape the Nazi invasion of Poland by escaping to the vast forest of Belarus, along with various other escapees they meet along the way.The opening scenes of the movie were very uncomfortable to watch - they were in black and white and looked as if it were original footage from the 40's. I am to lazy to research whether or not it was, but they were effective as seeing prisoners getting shot at close range by the Nazi soldiers was very unsettling.After this we jump straight into the movie with Zus heading home with Asael only to find their parents killed and they escape to the forest with another younger brother and meet up with Tuvia. Here is where they decide to hide.Zus and Tuvia disagree about the growing number of refugees joining their group, which is growing at a rapid pace and eventually Zus leaves the Bielski group and joins the Russian Army who are stationed nearby.The three main characters are all very well cast. Jamie Bell is fine as the younger brother caught between his two older brothers while Craig and Schreiber play well against each other. Schreiber is actually the best actor in the whole movie - you actually would not be surprised if his character defeated the entire Nazi party on his own. This bodes extremely well for Wolverine which is released in May 2009!! The supporting cast unfortunately are not worth mentioning at all. They are all predicable bit players that lack complete originality. The old intellectual and the young intellectual who bicker constantly until a respectable friendship grows, the pretty girl, the feisty girl, the jerk, the pregnant one, the one who risks his life to save the main character etc, etc, etc.The Russian army made a few appearances and were the usual crazy, furry hat wearing, vodka drinking Russians that are usually portrayed in film. The most annoying thing about the Russian army is that they all spoke in Russian, a sure sign that a movie has a misguided view of its own brilliance, while the rest of the cast spoke in an Eastern European accents.The movie did play as very serious and rightly so but there was some brotherly bonding moments which added a few minutes of light hearted relief to proceedings.One scene that did not play well at all was Tuvia giving his "going into battle outnumbered but we shall be victorious" speech on a pure white horse to a group of terrified weaponless villagers. The scene is very overused and here is was very out of place and ridiculously cheesy.The action when it appeared was quite brutal but it did not overshadow the story of the people living in Bielskis camp which was the main focus of the movie. The community struggling through the winter and their increasing desperation for food were uncomfortable to watch.I would give it an 7/10. It just lacked that extra special something that puts it up there with the great war movies. A good effort though in telling the untold story of a family that saved more Jewish refugees during WW2 that Schindler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Defiance is a good adaptation of a little known story of Jewish brothers hiding out in the Belorussian forests fighting Nazi's and their collaborators. All the whole, they save the lives of escaping Jews. Starring Daniel Craig (taking a break in between Bond films), Liev Schreiber (so good to see him in something more substantial than Wolverine where he clearly looked like he hated that experience) and Jamie Bell as the fighting Bielski brothers.It's not a great film, as it is fairly predictable at spots and Daniel Craig generally playing one emotion for the majority of the film. It is effective and it is nice to see a film about the Jews in World War 2 who are not just lambs for slaughter for a change. I did enjoy seeing the struggles of the fugitive Jews to retain their humanity while hiding out in the forests. Edward Zwick does well in his direction. I give Defiance 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique WWII Drama Well Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a compelling film about a group of WWII Jewish refugees hiding out in the forests of Nazi occupied Poland (present day Belarus). The group, lead by Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), evade the Nazis and do battle with Polish villagers and police, while foraging for food, guns, and medical supplies. While it's true that many of the action sequences were embellished and the Bielski brothers weren't exactly model citizens, the inspiration for the story is beyond dispute: a group of Jewish refugees facing certain death choose to flee into the forests of Belarus, where many of them manage to survive the war. How they are able to survive in the midst of Nazi, Soviet, and Polish partisans trying their best to kill them is what makes this movie work. It was clear in the movie that the Poles were every bit as eager to murder the Jews as their Nazi occupiers. These Jews fought back. This is a different type of Holocaust film, and one whose story needed to be told. Considering the hundreds of WWII movies dealing with the Holocaust, where the mostly docile and unsuspecting Jewish prisoners were uniformly murdered by the Nazi war machine, it was good to see a film where the Jews fought off the Nazis &amp; their willing executioners (i.e. - the Poles) and managed to survive in the end. I would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in WWII history, particularly with regard to partisan resistance to the Nazis and their collaborators.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We will have our revenge by staying alive" urges Tuvia Bielski(Daniel Craig) to his brothers. That embodies the whole essence of this wonderfully scripted War epic. The Four brothers and their defiance which spread like a wildfire and gave a whole bunch of fellow jews the will to survive against all odds, was wonderfully narrated.Daniel Craig as Tuvia was rugged, stern and inexplicably the most vital USP of the movie. Not that the movie is without flaws. There were a lot of stark resemblances to war epics of the past. And Tuvia's rising to the leader of the pack was not with enough backing. Liev Schreiber as Zus Bielski did a creditable job. But for me the third brother Aseal played by Jamie Bell gave a steller performance. The plot was intriguing most of the times but meandered at snails pace at a few occasions.A little more of passion and substance from the other characters would have proved a lot more beneficiary in supporting the claim of it being an epic war movie. The rest of the cast just gets in and out of the plot leaving a gaping hole which quite propitiously aided in bringing out the brother-bond wonderfully. On the whole I would say that the movie is superfluous submission of respect to those to fought bravely against the Nazi's. But is it a Real Life Story??? Thats for you to watch and tell. Anyways I had my doubts !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And live they did. 'Defiance' is the latest work from Ed Zwick, telling the story of the Bielski brothers, who valiantly stood up against the anti-Semitism of the Nazis. A compelling story that has been brought to the public eye, and may well have faded away if not for this big-screen adaptation. Although not Zwick's greatest motion picture to date, it is up there as a powerhouse period piece. The cinematography and soundtrack that beat through the film are astounding. However the true achievement must go to the acting. Jamie Bell, clearly maturing as an actor, gives a strong, albeit smaller, turn. Daniel Craig is also brilliant, taking on the main role as Tuvia Bielski with a fluidness that seems to come to him naturally. But here Liev Schreiber's performance clearly stands out as the best, without doubt worthy of an Oscar nomination, very much a display from the talented actor that must be seen. 'Defiance' leaves the viewer with the sadness of the truth, as with any movie telling the story of the holocaust, but also instils a feeling of hope against adversity. It remains clear that as a filmmaker, Ed Zwick can do no wrong.</fullReview>

They reluctantly become responsible for an ever-growing band of displaced Jews who will simply perish at the hands of the Nazis if not assisted. It is a horrific, beautiful, heartwarming tale that has viewers cringing from the opening scene. In addition to a good script and decent acting, the cinematography is amazing, and some of the scenes are truly memorable. One scene that comes to mind is after the capture of a wayward Nazi scout. He is brought into the 'village' in the woods, and is dealt with in a brutal fashion reflecting the fear, outrage, and hatred of the Jews toward their Nazi tormentors. While violent, this scene is handled with a thoughtful sensitivity. Don't miss this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to an early showing of Defiance last night. I went into the movie with your normal expectations: didn't look bad, didn't look awesome, but looked like it would probably be a pretty good movie. But I left the theater amazed at how brilliant this movie was. Basically the character Daniel Craig plays helps the escaping Jewish people start a community in the woods and teaches them to fight when necessary. They own the crap out of the Nazis. You really feel for every character in this film through all of their struggles, their loss, their hope. As many may think, this is not a war movie. The movie is shown entirely from the viewpoint of the Jewish people. You see the Nazis for about 2 seconds before they get shot each time, but nothing more. This movie is about emotion, not fighting. In fact, one of the main messages you get from the movie is that the people shown made sure they did not become the animals that the Nazis were. They learned that they're revenge was not to kill back, but to live. The acting was phenomenal, the action scenes were great and well paced, and it wasn't boring at all. This movie was fantastic and I highly recommend it for anyone. No matter what type of movie you enjoy, you will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Survival of the Jewish!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What director Edward Zwick did for African-Americans during the American Civil in his movie "Glory," he does for Jewish refugees in his World War II combat epic "Defiance." Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Bell play three heroic Jewish brothers who fled from Nazi-held Poland into the Belarussian forest, marched hundreds of Jews into the wilderness, built a camp, and hid them from Hitler's murderous troops. Naturally, the Brothers Bielski clashed among themselves, and Zus (Live Schreiber) went off and fought with the Soviets, while Tuvia acted like Moses and provided food, water, and camaraderie for these exiled Jews. Unfortunately, no matter how stirring the combat scenes are, "Defiance" is a conventional World War II movie that benefits immeasurably from a true story. Zwick and "Under Fire" scenarist Clayton Frohman adapted Nechama Tec's non-fictional account "Defiance: The Bielski Partisans." After Zus joins the Soviets, he discovers the latent anti-Semitism within the ranks. Meantime, Tuvia learns about the price of leadership. He has to orchestrate the large population that he conceals in the wood and feed them. Tuvia orders that the women be trained to handle firearms. He dispatches food patrols and monitors the Nazis, but disputes break out when the fighters who found the food insist on having greater shares. The problem with "Defiance" is that Zwick relies on clichés galore when this compelling narrative could have sacrificed most of the clichés. The logistics of trooping around these Jewish refugees are colossal. At one point, a Jewish man tells them that they cannot do the impossible, and Asael Bielski reminds them that they have already done the impossible. The combat scenes are staged vividly by Zwick and lenser Eduardo Serra. World War II fanatics will enjoy this above-average yarn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This opened to mixed reviews and allegations that's a heavily sugar coated version of history . Even the allegations about allegations seemed steeped in controversy with an article in The Guardian about DEFIANCE being booed in Poland leading to the Polish embassy in Britain releasing a statement saying no such incident had taken place . Again like more than a few films recently especially ones featuring the topic of war you have to remember that the important word in the phrase " based on a true story" is "based" and not "true" True to form DEFIANCE does seem somewhat clichéd and a Hollywood interpretation of history . Two Jewish brothers Zus and Tuvia escape Nazi genocide and flee in to the Belarussian forests and while Zus wants to instinctively kill Germans for murdering his family Tuvia wants to keep a more humane ideal of using the forests as a sanctuary for Jewish refugees . There's a good story in there somewhere and DEFIANCE is a good film in parts but I've never been keen on Edward Zwick as a director . Zwick seems unable to tell a streamlined focused story and throws constant clichés at the audience perhaps romantic clichés being the most noticeable and intrusive ones . Oh and if you think that's intrusive every time there's an emotional scene there's eith a diagetic or non diagetic violin playing in the background . Perhaps worst of all is the unintentional feeling that the characters quite enjoy living in a forest because living in a city will see them murdered . " More mouths to feed ...but more bodies to keep us warm " Are you telling me that Hitler bloke has done you a big favour . Undoubtedly not but that's the impression the film gives . As it stands the Soviet masterpiece COME AND SEE set during in the same era and location tells a similar story much , much better</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will begin this short and useful review by telling you that historical movies haters should get themselves out of here. I saw this film one year ago and it's a "mild" story about what happened in Poland.This is a movie that can waste you precious time and leave you with a good impression.The acting is I think , extraordinary , only the plot leaves you with some unanswered questions.The ending is an unexpected one and leaves you with a sweet taste of liberty and courage , but don't try being a hero.I thought it was a end to end drama , and as I said before , it's a very well done movie.easy 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film once you got into it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was one of those films where the directors, producers and everyone involved had to make a choice of how the actors would speak. Now I'm very open minded when it comes to these choices as you want the audience to be able to relate well to the actors in question whilst at the same time, you want them to really re-live the situation the people in question were in.Because of this, I found this film very difficult to get into. After the first 20 minutes, I was just beginning to come to grips with the accent but it didn't help that it seemed that all the actors were speaking extremely quickly and quietly. Maybe this is just my own personal opinion but it seemed that you had to seriously concentrate on the speech which, I found, seriously halted my ability to hold onto the plot.The message is inspiring and the fact that this film is based on a true story is remarkable but only after you get to grips with what the actors are actually saying. Because of that it's only 7 stars from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Acting By The Entire Cast, Good Atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the better roles I have seen for Daniel Craig (the latest James Bond). In fact, I see great support for Craig by the entire cast. The location shooting in Lithuania gives the film a feel of realism and it is obvious some extreme care was taken in shooting this film. The atmosphere created by the Eastern Europe locations is a definite plus here.The main minus is that even though this is based upon a true story, the story has been Hollywoodized a bit. Though not as skewed as Valkerie, some liberties have been taken with the history. I find this the only minus though not an extreme minus like Valkerie because this films makes a lot more effort towards realism.The action sequences are more numerous, and better done. There is lot of interaction between the cast members and more real life type situations in Defiance, where Valkerie is a sort of stagnant film where the characters are more emotionless card board cutouts. While I don't say this is a must see, it is a breath of fresh air seeing an acting Daniel Craig compared with the last Bond film where he had no script in Quantum of Solace to work with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I came for the accent attempts and stayed for the storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had been keen to see this since release, so I could learn about this amazing story and also see Daniel Craig and Liev Screiber talk in a German accent for 2 hours."Defiance" is the amazing true story of 3 brothers who aim to provide protection for fellow Jews from the Nazis trying to capture them and force them into concentration camps. The group starts small in the forest but eventually word spreads and they soon have a small army in their hands. Eventually they become a community and form tight bonds, but the cold, uncertainty and frequent struggles just to feed people causes plenty of struggles. As time passes on, the challenges mount and their leader (Craig) faces leadership challenges and excruciating decisions.An inspiring, amazing story of one of the greatest stories of the second world war. Not overly gripping as a movie, but obviously not too much creative license was taken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great scene but too many "Gunther's!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most poignant moment for me in this movie was the lynching of the young German in the forest. As per movie tradition we all expected warm fuzzy compassion from the mob, I mean he had a wife and kids, yet when they could find none in their hearts and executed justice, who of us could find fault with them? And the fact that not a word was spoken by their commander spoke volumes. THAT for me was a telling scene. In the light of the recent Scotland decision to show compassion for Al Megrahi and release him on "compassionate" grounds, maybe Mr Kenny Mcaskill should reflect on that scene and feel the pain of the mob. On a slightly negative note, there were too many sound clips of the word 'Gunther' being used whenever the Germans were around. It was irritating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really captures what it was like to take a stand against the Nazis in WW2. All of the emotions are there - hate, anger, disbelief that friends and neighbors turn on you. Revenge, brother against brother, hope, love, the will to be free. Sacrifice, hardship, death.Some tear this movie down because of the accents or lack thereof. It doesn't matter because this is not a history film, it is an inspirational film based on truth. Are there clichés in this film? Yes. Is it the best movie ever that shows the hardships of the Jews in WW2? No. But it is different in that it shows how a small group of determined, often afraid, average people made a stand and in the end, a difference. The movie shows the enormous burden of one man who has to be the leader of these strangers.********Possible Spoiler****************** It also shows that even the best intended people (Daniel Craig) will take revenge and when pushed enough, will fight for his beliefs. And that these ordinary people, when given a chance, will sometimes revert to savagery. I think this is a well balanced voice of a very important time in our history. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all the questions about "mistakes"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally not a bad movie, but I'm curious why people are so hypersensitive on the "mistakes" in the movie. There are complaints about Russian accents of the Jews, among other things, because the movie was set in Poland. Well, the part of Poland in which the movie was set (the area just west of Minsk...a city that was 40% Jewish at the start of WWII, by the way) only converted back to Polish control in the 1920s, it had been under Russian control for almost 150 years and had gone from majority Polish to majority Russian during that time. Rather than having got the accents wrong as some have suggested....just maybe the writers got it right? Geez, it seems as if everyone with computer and an internet connection has become an expert on Eastern European migration patterns and political geography.</fullReview>

Its not brainless by any means, the movie has a profound and compelling story. From a visual point of view, the movie looks absolutely beautiful. From the authentic weaponry and uniforms to the rich and colorful Lithuanian locations, Defiance may fall flat during some points throughout the film; as with every other black and white war movies that's been released,I think it is an enjoyable film and in its entirety, Defiance is an overwhelming movie that doesn't glamorize the war but shows the intense reality behind it all.4 Weeks ago in Kiev,Ukraine,a friend let me Hold and "Cock/Prime" one of those Machine Guns, Identical to those that were used in that film,they are Heavy and take some "Cocking",Not for Boys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jews Suffering Courageously (again).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's those Holocaust days of WW2 (again), so here comes yet another movie to remind modern Germans how beastly their grandparents were. And as the people they're being beastly to are Jews, then there's still no choice for the square-headed ones but to endure their flagellation with fortitude.Based on a true story, as they say (which is often a devious way of countering incipient criticism), Daniel Craig and Leiv Schreiber play Jewish brothers who lead a small group of survivors into the wild forests of eastern Europe when the great slaughter starts. By degrees, word gets around, and more fugitive Jews keep turning up. It's a sort of 'Schindler's List', but without the list. Lots of mouths to feed means lots of foraging, and inevitably attacks on (and from) Germans. After many hardships and privations, they triumph. That's about it really.Young Jamie Bell also features as a junior sibling, but he was such a huge hit as our ballet-dancing miner's son that I kept expecting him to turn up in tutu 'n' tights - which is probably asking too much of a refugee partisan.This is just a set-piece wartime drama. All of the usual elements are addressed. Script, acting, directing, editing &amp; camera-work are all by-the-numbers. Dunno how closely it follows the truth as I've never heard this story before. Can't imagine it leaving any lasting impressions anywhere, not unless you're a descendant of those who took part in the original conflict anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few home truths form a native Russian...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film must be good, but, being Russian and having lived in Belorussia for many years, I really couldn't concentrate because of the poor Russian and equally poor acting of most so-called "Russian" cast members which were driving me up the wall. I had the impression that, with a couple of exceptions, the producers just cast a bunch of second-generation Brighton-Beach immigrants with no acting experience whatsoever because whatever poor accented Russian they could manage was as unnatural and forced as a middle-grade drama society production.To say nothing of the fact that the film is set in Belorussia, and Belorussians have a very specific accent when they speak Russian, but the only Russian accent I heard in this film was Brighton Beach American! Ditto for whoever wrote the Russian dialogs for the film: for the most part those were the most ungrammatical and stilted lines, impossible in colloquial Russian speech. Some of them were literal translations from English that made no sense in Russian: apparently, producers had insisted on literal translation of original English dialogs (which, as every translator knows, is a recipe for disaster).I mean, is it really so difficult to hire a native Russian script writer and a few professional Belorussian movie actors to play actual Belorussians? Why hire second-generation immigrants who can't even speak their parents' native language any more, let alone act, and present it to the world as Russian acting and Russian speech? I repeat, the film is probably very good but I hated every minute of it because the "Russian" side of it was the ugliest mess I've ever seen on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie isn't exactly historically correct according to some of the "experts" commenting on this board, and while the movie is uncomfortable to watch at times it overcomes whatever limitations one might choose to pick on by exploring the subject matter which is what desperate people will do to survive. I can't say the movie is a pleasure to watch, it is nerve racking and distressing much of the time, but overall it is a great movie. The amazing thing is many of these people did live and survive in a time and place where survival was not to be expected. The other, very moving, fact was the almost religious acceptance of persecution...but you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean. I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another holocaust movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inspirational story of family, honour and vengeance is told through 'Defiance'. Set in Poland, 1941 amidst the invasion of the Nazi's, with Jew's being massacred by the thousands, Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell star as the Belski brothers who manage to take refuge in a surrounding Forrest where they begin a enduring struggle for survival. As word of their refuge spreads, others come to join them for freedom.Director Edward Zwick presents a riposte to the many holocaust films of Jews as long-suffering passive victims with a true story where they strong heroes. 'Defiance', however, gets caught between depicting facts and including Hollywood clichés, where unfortunately the latter dominates. There are strong performances all round, despite a script of largely proclamations, with Craig putting in a credible performance as the reluctant leader of the group, challenged by Schreiber, with his contrasting views of survival and ideas of revenge. Bell is also able to offer a decent supporting role, showing a positive transition from the naive youngest brother into a stronger adult. While the story of the Belski brother's is amazing, 'Defiance' offers an engaging, if somewhat overstretched, adaptation that does not leave the afterthought it set out to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>popcorn movie, meaning okay but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time I've noticed other people who've posted comments that have had the same general opinion about a movie.Good but not great.On to the review: Acting - The acting was generally pretty good. I believed in the East European accents that most of the actors faked. Daniel and Liv are very good actors and they held there own. But in my opinion it was the script and the direction that made the lines the actors spoke seem, forced.It was sorta hard to care about or in other words become emotionally invested with the actors.Everything else was mediocre e.g. Direction, DP, editing, etc.For me, I truly believe the WWII Nazi, concentration camp, killing Jews, theme has been sooooo overplayed in America to the point its cliché'. Plus on top of that cliché is another cliché, the stealing from the rich to give to the poor Robin Hood cliché'.I will say that the movie was good at exploring the morality of people who are hunted by the Nazi's. Many times in the movie the debate of ,"whom should we steal from to survive," came up, and this was good for the story.I like Daniel Craig and that was the main reason for me seeing the movie. I gave it 6 stars, for a good story, for actors I wanted to see, for the moral twists and turns. I gave it bad marks for its cheese factor and obvious clichés'.Its simply an okay/sorta good movie but it certainly its not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story that needed to be told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells a story of the Second World War so remarkable that it is amazing that most people - me included - previously had no knowledge of it, even though it featured in a 400-plus page book by Holocaust scholar Nechama Tec published in 1993 - the main source material for the movie co-written, produced and directed by Edward Zwick and co-produced by Tec's son Roland. We are so used to Holocaust movies depicting the passivity of the Jews as quintessential victims - Roman Polanski's "The Pianist" on the Warsaw ghetto uprising was a notable exception - but this film narrates the astonishing tale of how a set of four brothers - Tuvia (Daniel Craig), "Zus" (Liev Schreiber), Asael (Jamie Bell) and Aron Bielski - led a group of partisan who fought the Germans and managed to rescue around 1,200 Jews from certain death.The real location of the forest that was their home for more than two years was near Nowogródek (Navahrudak), an area that at the beginning of the Second World War belonged to Poland, but in September 1939 was seized by the Soviet Union and today is Belarus. The realistic location shooting for the film was actually in Lithuania, where 90% of the Jews were murdered, and there has been impressive attention to detail in the creation of the underground zemlyankas (dugouts) and the clothing and weaponry of the Bielski otriad (partisan detachment). Also the tough decisions which the leaders of the group had to take and some of the brutal actions that the partisans carried out are not missed out. So, in spite of being a little stilted at times, this is both an honourable ans effective piece of film-making that tells a little-known story in a manner which manages to be both informative and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this movie is allegedly based on a true story, this is what this movie "teaches" about being a Jewish partisan in World War Two: 1. it was a great opportunity to improve your social life, even to get married; 2. Jewish civilians were better soldiers than their German counterparts in the Wehrmacht; 3. Escaping from a Jewish ghetto was easy, just crawl through the hole in the wall while the guards are not looking; 4. it was a great time to learn how to play chess; 5. intellectuals were frowned upon; 6. Jews from time to time went around shooting up towns; 7. Jewish women looked great when cooking food for total strangers in the middle of a forest; 8. sometimes Jewish partisans thought about returning to the ghetto where it seemed safer; 9. Jewish partisans were able to destroy tanks and defeat heavily armed paramilitary troops; 10. Jews were able to walk through miles and miles of swamps without any ill effects. 11. Collaborators were paid 500 rubles for every Jew they turned over to the Germans. Hooray for the movies! Now reality. This movie is excellent escapist fare that may make one feel better about being Jewish. The mere mention World War Two congers up images of Jews being arrested, deported and murdered by the score, by the hundreds, by the thousands, by the tens of thousands, by the hundreds of thousands and by the millions in facilities that were constructed specifically to systematically carry out a state sponsored policy of genocide. Fighting back was not an option. The victims were unarmed and defenseless civilians, a substantial number consisting of pregnant women, the frail elderly and infirmed and small children, including newborn babies. These were the enemies that the Germans had vowed to eradicate. These were the enemies that the German Wehrmacht fought against. And in every country occupied by the Germans, local inhabitants assisted the Germans in prosecuting their policy of genocide. As a work of fiction, movies have license to take liberties with the facts. But when a movie, such as this one, asserts that it is based on a true story, then the movie warrants further scrutiny regarding the veracity of the story and in this case the story seems to be a romanticized account of events that have been schmaltzed up to make the movie more appealing. This movie is certainly worth watching but with this disclaimer: it's a movie, not a documentary. True, some Jews did fight back, such as in Warsaw, and some did organize themselves into partisan groups and when they had the opportunity trounced the Germans, but sustained resistance as independent fighting groups did not happen because it could not. Newborn babies do not make effective soldiers. Jews fighting against the Germans? That's pure Hollywood. It sounds good, looks good, feels good, but is it history?The problem was not with the Jews, it was the Germans. What the Germans did under Adolf Hitler was insane and the question is not why did the Jews not fight back, but rather in what fantasy world were the Germans operating under to want them to fight the Jews?Making a movie about Jews fighting back? Okay, what about this: a movie about the Germans in Hamburg fighting back as Hamburg is being pulverized then burnt by the British and the Americans. The point being, yeah maybe one or two Germans fired guns at the bombers and may have even scored a hit or two, but it was NO CONTEST! Or what about the "Battle of Cologne" in May 1942 when the British demolished the ENTIRE CITY! Okay, maybe the Germans managed to knock down one or two bombers, but again NO CONTEST! Why always show the Jews being mistreated? Show what happened to the Germans under their Fuehrer who they wholeheartedly supported. While Jews were scrounging for survival in a forest, Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Dusseldorf, and scores of other cities were being systematically destroyed, yet the Germans failed to get rid of Hitler. What were they thinking? Indeed, were they even thinking?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an intern from the Netherlands, I'm taking full advantage of the fact that movies are out sooner here then in the Netherlands. I've seen a lot of movies so far, this one being the last one I saw. And I must say, It was Excellent. People were clapping at the end, I'd say it's no more then logic. Edward Zwick definitely left his calling card with this one. Well I guess he already did with Blood Diamond and the Last Samurai.The movie is about 3 Jewish brothers that flee into the Belorussian woods after their father and others in their village get brutally executed by the Nazi's. In the woods, they meet other Jews fleeing from the Nazi's. Together they start building a camp in the woods, hidden from the Nazi's, hoping that some day, they don't have to run anymore and can fight back. For once, a WOII movie that doesn't give you the feeling that it's all about a bunch of American Rambo's that slaughter Germans left and right. This one gives an honest view of both sides. Losing faith and loved ones and the side of Jews, and the agony some traitors and Germans have by doing their horrible job for the fuhrer. Of course the Germans are the bad guys, but in this movie you can see that evil is not only on the German side. I would also like to say that Daniel Craig is a great actor. I didn't know what to think about James Bond being in a WOII movie, but he took his role perfectly. Compliments also for Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell. I give this movie a 10/10, maybe I'm a little too enthusiastic about it, but I have never seen anyone applaud during/after a movie. And they were right about this one. See it!! You won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time of the movie's release, much attention was being paid to Slumdog Millionaire's illumination of the relationships between brothers. Yet this movie has quite insightful -- and realistic -- things to say about families and brotherhood. The movie does not denigrate the actions of other Jews during the war, as some reviews have suggested, but instead calls attention to truly heroic actions and to human decency. While not without flaws, a fine movie. The acting is mostly good; there are some trite moments but these are balanced by truly moving ones. The movie does not portray Jews solely as victims nor solely as touching or saintly martyrs. And in these times, it is especially welcome to see heroes and the rebuilding of civil society in a period of terrible stress and crisis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are an Ed Zwick fan like me then you will like this. I don't think this film is perfect like I wanted it to be but there is some really good stuff here that makes it a definite recommendation. Since it is an Ed Zwick movie it is very well shot. The acting is mostly strong. I am a Daniel Craig fan and I think he is good but could have been given more to do. Like there is a scene where he kills some Nazis who gave aways his parents, and later he says how he regretted it and is unsatisfied. That was never really followed up to, like there is a seen where the survivors beat a nazi to death while claiming revenge and his character did nothing to stop it yet knowing that they wont be satisfied or feel like they have had justice, so him letting them do that didn't feel quite right with his character. He is good though but I wish they could have followed up on that. Liev Schreiber to me stole the show, he was well developed and his motives were always clear. Jaimie Bell was good but I thought he was under developed because you never really get an insight on if they should take action or retreat like Craig's character thinks. Also Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber's characters families were killed and it seemed like they forgot about it 5 minutes later and just fell in love with other woman right after. It kind of hurt there characters to me. So I think the movie is a little messy and did not follow up on ideas it started. I don't know if it was the editing or the script but I felt like there were a bunch of scenes missing. Its a good solid movie though and I think it is an important story that should be heard about and talked about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tells a moving story, and there is some beautiful photography in it, especially scenes of the forest in the winter. It didn't hold me, however, and I could live a very happy life without ever seeing it again.Why? I think it needed a much better script, to begin with. I have no idea how this story could have been better structured, but it should have been structured. It shouldn't simply have wondered from incident to incident, as it did.The major characters should also have been better developed, to get us more involved.The violin solos were probably not a good idea. They kept reminding me of Schindler's List - as did various other things in this movie, in particular the closing script - and that does this movie no favors. Schindler's List, one of the most remarkable - not to mention most moving - movies I have ever seen (and seen and seen), is the masterpiece it is because it is well-structured, well-written, pretty much well-everything. This movie does itself no favors by evoking comparisons, as it falls way short in every respect.In short, not a bad movie, but one that does not immortalize its subject matter, as for example Schindler's List most certainly does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Old Fashioned War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be easy to pick holes in this picture. Based upon a true story, it tells the tale of the Bielski brothers who flee WW Two German persecution in Belarussia to take refuge in the forests. There is so much to draw upon, that it is inevitable that some issues are shown in shorthand, some glossed over, and some ignored altogether. But as a straight forwards Action/Adventure story, it succeeds admirably.Daniel Craig dominates the film as Tuvia Bielski and does a fine job. Stoic, rugged and with a passable local accent, he carries off portraying the dilemmas of his role as leader, and that of Action Hero, with some aplomb. Inevitably there are times when things teeter on the brink of a Sherwood forest, "Robin Hood" ,pastiche, and the tone and violin playing veer into, "Schindlers List", territory. But the essence of events; ordinary, disparate, diverse people with a common bond as Jews being forced to flee Genocide by living a subsistence existence in the wild forests is well told.Intriguingly, the ethics and morality of their position bedevils them in the same way that the contemporary Gaza Crisis bedevils modern day Israel. Tuvia slays the Policeman and sons who killed his family in cold blood, but opts for a survival strategy for his camp rather than that of raiding outpost. On one occasion they spare the lives of an informant and Policemen who stumble across their camp, compromising its existence rather than indulging in further slaughter. Yet later captured Germans are beaten to death by an exhausted and embittered camp.His brother Zus leaves with some others to join Soviet Partisans to follow a more aggressive Resistance. Fascinating sub- texts are flirted with; the anti-Semitism of the Soviet Partisans themselves, the hopeless position of villagers pressed by the Germans, Partisans AND Bielski, the "forest wives" morality of the refugees versus a "no-babies" policy, the class ?conflicts within the refugees themselves and the invidious position of the local Police Force.The beautiful forest, and noble cause of the Jews creates a Romantic air about the film where on the whole heroism and good triumph, and the Nazis and their sympathisers are shot. As is customary in the genre, women are for decoration only. Gritty realism and the raw underbelly of what life must really have been like understandably take a back seat. Yet this does not diminish the tale, and taken at face value, it is a compelling 137 minutes of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phenomenally inspirational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about three brothers leading a group of Jews to hide in the forest to escape from Germans in the World War II.Much of "Defiance" is about how the group of Jews with diverse backgrounds live together and survive the formidable hardships of the times. Not only are they being hunted by the Germans, but also faced with the lack of food and supplies. In such desperate situations, a leader is needed. Tuvia Bielski's leadership is convincing. He maintains order, sustains hope and morale during even the bleakest times. His character is convincingly portrayed by Daniel Craig. His brotherly connection with Zus is also touching, as evidenced by the ending scene.Many people describe "Defiance" as a war film, but I interpret it as a celebration of mankind's determination to stay alive. Their struggle to stay alive is phenomenally inspirational.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know nothing of the history of this part of world war 2, What i do know is a truly awful film when i endure one, and this was truly awful. In the past i would have walked out but now i try to stick it out. The acting was wooden, the costumes looked like they had just been delivered from wardrobe and the Germans looked like they had just arrived from Hogans heroes. I think had i listened carefully i could have heard the director shout action. The fight scenes were totally unbelievable, i mean when a tank fires a round at you , more than just a little bit of earth flying up is not what happens. And whats all this about riding round on a white horse?? And the luvvie duvvie log cabin fireside scene ?? I thought these guys were freezing to death?? And all the Germans just falling over when they get shot?? Implausible, and just by putting based on a true story doesn't mean we have to swallow this rubbish!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hath not a Jew cojones?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the fringes of what is now Belarus in World War II after their family was slaughtered by Nazis and Polish collaborators in December 1941, the Jewish Bielski brothers fled to the forest and hid out there to fight Germans and the collaborators and save fellow Jews. Gradually many joined them from the ghetto in nearby Navahrudak, a town just seized from Poland by the Soviets. The tough, feisty Bielskis took in everyone, including the 'malbushim,' handicapped or weak ones not able fight. When the Germans were defeated in the summer of 1944, there were 1200 Jewish forest survivors that had been saved by the "Bielski Brigade." This puts the Bielskis on a level with Oscar Schindler. But their story isn't as well known. Nor, as it turns out, is this movie as powerful as Spielberg's 'Schindler's List. ''Defiance' has intense moments, a few of which are as sweet and plaintive as something out of Italian neo-realism, but the effort as a whole is conventional, unsubtle, and unmemorable. What a pity. All those good actors; all that slogging through cold water; all those scenes in the snow of people wearing gloves with the fingers out.We've had a spate of year's end WWII movies with Europeans incongruously talking English: 'Valkyrie,' manned by Brits but with Tom Cruise at the helm; 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas', where the Nazis all have plummy English accents; 'The Reader', where Winslett and Fiennes sound more Teutonic than the authentically German David Kross and Bruno Ganz. This time actors talk English with fake Eastern European accents but have whole conversations in Russian. These are compromises that, despite lingering resistance to subtitles, seem more and more retro and naive.As Joshua Rothkopf points out, 'Defiance' is a far cry from "Holocaust hand-wringing" like 'Reader' and 'Striped Pajamas.' It's an example of the new "Hebrews-kicking-ass sub-genre" like Spielberg's 'Munich.' 'Defiance,' Rothkopf says, "is history made over into wish-fulfillment psychodrama, into 'Exodus.'" This is seen in the casting of high-profile bad-ass Daniel Craig as Tuvia Bielski, the Brigade's leader, and the way his brother Zus (Lief Schrieber) dances around mowing down legions with a machine gun like the mad Israeli comrade in the 1982 Lebanon war described in 'Waltz with Bashir.' The timing seems unfortunate, with the slaughter of Palestinians by Jews in Gaza that just took place. Macho Jews we know about. What this movie may make you wonder is why more Jews didn't have these qualities when the Nazis were exterminating them.As Tuvia Craig gets to show a vulnerability his made-over version of 007 lacks. After a severe illness, Tuvia falters as leader and almost collapses. You can see why after twice playing Bond, Craig couldn't resist a role of more complex humanity. Tuvia's firebrand opponent is brother Zus (Schreiber), whose desire for retribution leads him to abandon the forest enclave to fight with Russian partisans for a long period. This is a reverse opportunity to get tough and physical, since he's famous for playing Hamlet on stage. Asael (Jamie Bell) is a younger, more innocent Bielski who provides a thread of shy romance when he and the pretty, plucky Chaya (Mia Wasikowska) gradually fall in love. Bell has a present-ness and purity that come through well in this role. Alas, the movie plays the crude trick of trying to use cross-cutting to contrast Asael's forest wedding to Chaya with a violent shootout elsewhere in which Zus jumps about. Too often the movie's style is ham-handed but this is one of the worst moments. There were four Bielski brothers. The youngest, Aron (George MacKay), too young to lead, is so traumatized by witnessing his parents' slaughter that he cannot even speak.Perhaps where the movie most shines is in little vignettes of the rescued ghetto Jews. Alexa Davalos graces the screen as Lilka Ticktin, the beautiful woman who pairs off with Tuvia and nurses him through his illness. A watchmaker is asked to fix a rifle trigger, does so in an instant and is told "you have a new job." "Everybody works," they're told. There are the intellectual 'luftmensch' types who know how to play chess and dispute metaphysics but have difficulty driving a nail. The rabbi and the young leftist are certainly appealing, but too perfect and even too cute. As I'm not alone in noting, this is a story told to undermine Jewish stereotypes that ends by reinforcing them.According to accounts, the refugee camp, which had to move from time to time, came to include a kitchen, mill, bakery, bathhouse, synagogue, medical clinic, and "a quarantine hut for those who suffered from infectious diseases such as typhus. Herds of cows supplied milk," according to a Widipedia entry. Though it does show the Bielskis stealing food from local farmers and raiding a military HQ to get antibiotics, the movie focuses only on the early months of the Bielski Brigade. It's overwhelmed by the effort to show Zus mowing down Nazis and confronting his Soviet comrades' anti-Semitism while also following the hideaways' complicated and exhausting struggle to survive the winter. The clumsy cross-cutting sequence that chops up Asael's wedding only underlines this dilemma.'Defiance 'is pulled down by schematic staging, telegraphed plot points and obtrusive background music. In a directorial career that now includes nine films Zwick has had some good moments. He didn't do all that badly with his 1986 David Mamet adaptation, 'About Last Night,' 'Glory' was a Civil War epic that put him on the map and helped make a big star of Denzel Washington. 'Legends of the Fall' and 'The Siege' are different kinds of mush, but Zwick showed in 'Blood Diamond,' his last outing, that he can turn a potential potboiler into a rip-snorting action film with more than a dash of political awareness. The Bielski's story is one that matters and needed telling. But it flounders in conventionality and seems overwhelmed by the contrasts in its principals' personalities and experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Zwick is one of the good guys, as it were. His films have often been really brilliant and under-appreciated works. Of late, he has been on top form, producing the excellent "Blood Diamond" and the exceptional "The Last Samurai". At the heart of both of these were interesting ideas, gripping stories and enthralling characters.With "Defiance", Zwick seems to have struck gold. He has found an extraordinary story about the Bielski brothers who, during the Holocaust, not only managed to evade capture by the S.S. but established a community for fugitive Jews in the woods of Belorussia.It is a great and inspiring tale, and yet Zwick manages to make a bit of a dud film out of it. This is made stranger still when you consider that he has three excellent central performances and a fine supporting cast who all prove to be very watchable, on top of a story which sounds like an absolute cracker. Appearances, of course, can be deceptive.To deal with the positives, this is a very well performed piece. Daniel Craig may be the lead but, despite another fine turn from Craig, this is Liev Schreiber's film. The latter's character is the more interesting of the two ? a brooding and angry man who struggles to control himself. Craig's character struggles to control others, but disappoints later on as he goes from being an interesting man through most of the film into a fairly dull hero by the end. There is also an impressive performance from Jamie Bell who has matured into a fine actor and manages to make the most of his screen time here.So, why doesn't it quite work? Despite doing a perfectly solid job in most areas, Zwick has fallen in love with his story a bit too much. The film simply lacks a bit of thrust. There are moments of interest but a lot of the over two hours of film is people sitting around in woods. This extraordinary piece of history needed more honing to become the superb piece of film that it could have been. There simply isn't anything of the brothers before the war and their characters lack some emotional depth. It is an example of film which never quite lives up to its potential.This is perfectly solid and has many positives, but strangely for an Ed Zwick film, the entertainment factor is quite low here. A great story this is, but it just doesn't quite make the sort of film that it perhaps should.3 Stars out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful reminder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jews have had a difficult time countering the opinion that they did not resist the Nazis enough, even in the face of Casablanca's hero, Victor Laslow, and the heroics of Escape from Sobibor, a challenge of conscience as all German guards had to be killed in order for 600 Jews to escape. Defiance needs to be added to the list of powerful reminders that Jews defied the Nazis in numbers and spirit.Daniel Craig, effacing any overt images of James Bond, plays Tuvia Bielski, leader of a rag-tag group of survivors in the Belarussian forest for years, and two other brothers (Liv Schreiber and Jamie Bell), who revenge the slaughter of their family and help hapless Jews by building a village. Although the encounters with the Germans tend to have the unreal simplicity of electronic games, the danger of living in the almost idealized forest is palpable, and the imminence of death is constant. An outbreak of typhus reminds us that this is no arbor romance out of Shakespeare. At times it seems director/writer Edward Zwick tries to make a thriller out of a true story, thereby doing almost an injustice to the horror of the history. My own taste now, after seeing two other Holocaust stories this fall?Boy in the Striped Pajamas and The Reader?leads me to like best the simple fiction of Pyjamas, which figuratively embodies all the contradictions of heroism and cowardice in a small family of Germans no less. None can compare with Night and Fog, Alain Resnais' unremitting visual reminiscence of the horror juxtaposed with contemporary shots of historic bucolic death camps.Defiance effectively relates the tumult and degradation of running from an enemy while entertaining with an almost Hollywood vision of a magical forest and enchanting visitors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Band of brothers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm well aware as I write this of the ironic timing of the release of this movie, celebrating the courage and will to live of a group of Belarussian Jews displaced by the Nazi purges of the Second World War at the same time as the state of Israel is being criticised by many areas of the international community for its air-strikes and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, which may in fact adversely affect its box-office potential.That said, this is a story worth telling, especially as I was largely unaware of active resistance by Jews against the monstrous juggernaut of the exterminating Nazis. The movie is hyper-realistic in delivery, the cinematography unstinting in its depiction of the general hand-to-mouth squalor which the travelling band of resistors had to endure, all gloomy greys and browns. No Speilbergian flashes of red here.The acting is generally good, if somewhat one-dimensional throughout, Daniel Craig having just the right stony-face disposition to depict stoically determined "leader" Tuvia Bielski and as you'd imagine after his 007 training, well up to the physical demands of the role. And yet, he does lack for me a defining spark of personality, which reduces the impact of his performance. The supporting roles are well played too by men and women alike, although it has to be said that there never were three brothers that looked less alike than Messrs Craig, Schreiber and Bell. The movie is of necessity unrelenting as it attempts to convey the day- to-day struggle and fears of discovery of the commune but does for me make too many concessions to Hollywood mores, with the timely insertion of "big scenes" you can see coming in advance, often clichéd, like the treatment of the renegade who challenges Craig's authority and particularly the pat ending where you just know that Brother Zus is going to come to a cavalry-type rescue of his brother before their inevitable reconciliation.There are some scenes which work better for their lack of sentimentality and predictability, none more so in the shocking scene where Craig allows the angry mob to tear apart a stray German they've captured and also the scene near the beginning where Craig exacts retribution on the traitorous collaborators responsible for the death of his parents. On both occasions, the viewer's sympathies are sufficiently and understandably manipulated to accept and dare I say it condone the barbarism of both acts.Some of my reservations though are unfair perhaps. If I disliked some aspects of the almost "buddy buddy" relationship of the brothers, the fact is that they were based on real-life brothers and I suppose one has to allow the director some latitude in inserting periodic action or even, (very briefly) romantic scenes as a sop to the entertainment demands of a big-budget movie.In conclusion though, I would have to say that all movies of this type I guess are in the shadow of "Schindler's List" and I was certainly less moved by this noble effort than I perhaps expected to be, certainly compared to Spielberg's monument. In fact if there's a "History Channel" documentary available for perusal on this subject (I know there'a a book) perhaps that would be the better way to appreciate the incredible courage of the Jewish resistance fighters depicted here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from true story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This move would be better to judge under one condition: It should be underlined that it does NOT show a true story! Historical facts are totally biased or false in that movie. Bielski brothers did not fought Germans at all. They concentrated on purely survival and scavenging supplies from villagers. The Bielski group would raid nearby villages and forcibly seize food; on occasion peasants who refused to share their food with the partisans were the subject of violence and murder. This caused hostility towards the partisans from peasants in the villages Story took place in pre war Poland. After Soviet invasion of Poland (1939), which was then allied with Nazi Germany under the Nazi-Soviet Pact, The Bielski family collaborated with the Soviets, which strained their relations with the local Poles, who saw the Soviets as occupier. The eldest brother Tuvia, who had served in the Polish Army from 1927 to 1929, rising to the rank of corporal. However The Bielski Jews, fighting on the Soviet side, took part in clashes between Polish and Soviet forces. Notably they took part in the treacherous disarmament of Polish partisans by the Soviets on 1 December 1943. Please note that Soviets were also seen as oppressor at that time on Poilsh soil. Some of the members of the Bielski partisans (but not the Bielski brothers themselves) have been accused of war crimes on the neighbouring population, particularly for involvement in the 1943 Naliboki massacre of 128 people, committed by Soviet partisans. The Polish Institute of National Remembrance has been investigating the massacre since the early 2000s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sanitised, far too righteous experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Zwick's "Defiance" is a toothless historical drama with noble intentions of being epic in its moving and poignant story mechanics, but only succeeds in leaving the spectator in a state of inanition. Naturally, Eduardo Serra creates a memorable landscape in his direction of photography, but this becomes redundant since the movie is character-driven rather than laden in symbolic scenery. This would be all adequate if it were not for the terrible reality that these characters, completely sincere in their manner, are puppets in the flat sensationalist tone of the collective whole. When you have a war movie limited in action and suspense, you better find a group of actors who can convince as outlawed Jews.Read the full review at: - - http://www.sightforallseasons.co.nr/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review:Defiance is a some what mis-shaped and indecent world war 2 drama that really doesn't do itself any justice. A film which is directed by Ed (Blood Diamond) Zwick usually is worth the watch for, but all Defiance does is give you a bad feel of urgency waiting to be told and directed professionally.The cast which includes Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell should prepare audiences for a well acted and boldly moving film that one wouldn't want to leave the cinema to quickly to miss. Unfortunately their performances and bonding chemistry on-screen goes down a bad and rough path that ends up with the audience feeling deprived and persuaded into watch 2 hours and 17 minutes of ill-treated acting.The pacing is definitely an issue which further spirals the film down into the mud. Zwick knows how to direct, but the pacing that we saw in Blood Diamond or The Last Samurai is completely the opposite to in Defiance.Verdict:Zwicks failure as a director gives a taste for a failing film that doesn't characterise the characters efficiently nor the story properly. Instead your felt like it's all second hand.</fullReview>

Just look at the comments and IMDb - almost all write about "true story"...Unfortunately, the movie tells lies about the real situation in the Bielarus and in the Novogrod region. It is a fact, that Bielsky created a camp for Jews in the forests and over 1200 people were saved. On the other hand, his squad never fought with Germans. They wanted to survive, nothing more. That is why they frequently attacked the Polish villages and killed a lot of people, including women and children. They were murderers and rapists!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love some of Edward Zwicks earlier movies. 'Glory', 'The Last Samurai' and 'Blood Diamond' - all terrific! But what happened here? Although based on actual events, 'Defiance' is riddled with clichés. At one point - after one from the supporting cast suddenly starts coughing in the movie - my wife who was sitting next to me said: "Rest assure that he will die within the next 20 minutes, like all the other people in Hollywood movies who suddenly starts coughing." 15 minutes later, there he was, dying on the ground, in one of the movies many cheesy scenes, which I suppose were to evoke some sort of feelings or sympathy from the audience.But it does not work. Mainly because Zwick tries to tick as many boxes on his chart as possible. It wants to be both drama, action, love and part documentary. Too much.It's like watching a Hallmark TV version of both 'Robin Hood' and 'Schinders List' at once.If you end up bored by a story, which on paper and in reality is and was anything but, the storyteller is to blame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been so many movies made about the Holocaust and WW2 in general that most of the stories are being retold over and over. Sometimes a great one comes along as with Polanski's The Pianist, directed by a man who was actually in the Krakow getto and lived through it. Defiance on the other hand comes across like a TV movie of the week full of second rate acting and bad dialog. Liev Schreiber is hammy and overacting his way through this and Daniel Craig is all over the place and comes off kind of strange. Of course we have all seen the typical Jews who somehow go from normal every day people to helpless hapless morons who can't even wipe their own noses. One of my biggest pet peeves is the language. Why would a group of people all from the same area all go from subtitles to English and back over and over again. I know that some Jews in this area spoke Yiddish, but not all did and it would be assumed that they did all know Russian.All in all an OK movie but OK movies should be about romance or comedy not something as serious as this. The ending is laughable - RAMBO JEWS from Hell! Plus the history is wrong in a lot of places and Ampicillin was not used until 1961.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Movie About Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2nd World War themed movies are very difficult to discuss with everyone because people wants to know if it is a great movie, if it is accurate or even if it has great explosions and something like that. And moviegoers always selects their favorites. Classics like "Stalag 17" and "The Bridge on the River Kwai" or more recent "Saving Private Ryan" and "The Thin Red Line". The director Edward Zwick placed us in several different battlefields in several different periods of history like the American Civil War in "Glory", the First World War in "Legends of the fall", and a samurai war in "The Last Samurai". In "Defiance" he finally get to the Second World War. But instead of concentrate the story in shots and explosions he preferred to tell the true story of three Jewish brothers and their attempt to fight against the Germans and save other Jews. The result is a incredible movie but people doesn't seem to understand its grandiosity.In 1941, in Belorussia, the Bielski brothers finally succeed escaping the Germans hiding themselves in a forest. Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber), Asael (Jamie Bell) and a younger brother are the Bielski brothers. Their parents were killed and now they're doing everything they can to stay alive. But other Polish Jewish families are appearing and the brothers helps them, provides food, security and a place to stay in the middle of the forest hiding themselves of the Nazists. Zus is a rebel soul and he wants to fights against Germans and so along with a few friends and their brothers they started to plot against the Nazists, getting a revenge of everything that was happening with the Jews at the time. Many things happens, Zus and Tuvia fights against each other because Zus still wants to fight against the enemies and Tuvia wants to help his people. They went on different directions: Zus joins with the soviets fighting the Germans and Tuvia and Asael help everybody that comes to them. This is a story about union, it's about hope in desperate times, it's about fight against your worst enemy and show to him that you're not defeated, that you can participate in the defiance and show that you're danger too. It's about suffering and resistance. And heroism in a certain way. The evolution of a people who were always educated to be servant as possible and the way they change this situation. OK, it might not be a sad story like "Schindler's List" or a war movie filled with action like "Enemy at the Gates" but it still is a great movie in both departments, dramatic and action. It might not be accurate (although it's based on true events) but at least it's entertaining. The battlefield scenes are very well filmed, and edited in a brilliant work, there's no "shaky camera" in here. Why action and war movies have to follow this tendency of the shaky camera? It is supposed to people see the movie and not try to discover what's happening with the cameraman. That's why I enjoyed "Defiance". Zwick is a great director and he knows how to handle with a scene. The first fight against the Germans, when the brothers ambush an jeep, is fantastic, with great tension. James Newton Howard score was great (nominated for an Oscar), specially towards the end of the movie.The actors trio was good. Jamie Bell is always a pleasure to see, every work he does he plays marvelously well (although he has less screen time than the other actors); Liev Schreiber is great as the nervous brother, very impressive; and Daniel Craig does a good job, sometimes over acts, sometimes he really finds the way of his character. "Defiance" also features Mark Feuerstein ("What Women Want") and Mark Margolis ("Requiem for a Dream") in small roles. I say give this movie a chance.

		<shortDescription>Excellent, Powerful Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the better World War Two movies released this decade. The Academy definitely overlooked this film. No, this is not Slumdog but it's close enough. I read some of the negative comments and the commenters must have been robots or they did not see this film.This is based on a true story. Basically, three Jewish brothers escape from the Germans to live in a forest with limited supplies and food. They end up making alliances with the Russian army.The acting is excellent. Daniel Craig, Liev Schrieber, Jamie Bell, they were all great! All the extras did a great job as well.The one thing that was not overlooked by the Academy is the music. James Newton Howard is a very good composer. Powerful music, indeed.Edward Zwick is a great director despite what everyone says about him. I seen Blood Diamond and The Last Samurai. This film is on par with those films or even better.Overall, this is a powerful film that should not be forgotten. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good film with good characters and well written script. Hollywood films are made to entertain us not to educate us. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber are two of the best actors in the film industry right now I wish them both all the luck to get more great parts in great films. Edward Zwick is putting together a great body of work like Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, and Legends of the Fall. There are some films that I have not seen that I will now put on my list for future viewing. I am a fan of great directors and when I find one I like to see all their work to see how they have progressed thru out the years. Books are a whole different media than films, so books will always have more info and story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of the Bielski brothers who fled to the forest's of Bela-Russia when their little farming town was attacked by Anti-Semites during the Nazi invasion of that region. Using their knowledge of the woods they find an area deep within the forest where they eventually settle. Realising that leaving the forest would mean certain death, they eventually build a small settlement and plan to stay there until the war is over.Word soon spreads amongst Jewish refugees that the Bielski's offer protection from Nazis to any Jew, with the result that eventually there are hundreds of Jews running into the forest to join them.True to their word they never turned away any Jew.The movie centres around the disagreement between the two older Bielski's, who have different points of view on what is the best way to lead and protect their fellow Jews. Tuvia (Daniel Craig) would rather "save 10 Jews than kill one Nazi", whereas his brother Zeus believes that attack is the best form of defence.As the Nazi's eventually find out where the settlement is and begin to attack, the question is now whether to run and hide or to stand and fight. In the balance of the Beilski's decisions hangs the lives of 1500 people, including the life of their two younger brothers. What decision is best? This move is an epic tale, masterfully filmed and superbly acted. It is a triumph on par with Schinlder's List and Life is Beautiful. There is enough suspense and drama to keep you on the edge of your seat, fragmented with small scenes of humour and love in just the right places.The story itself is a testament to the strength of the human spirit at the centre of history's darkest hour.The finest film this decade. The finest holocaust movie since Schindler's List.A MUST SEE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't mess with us Jews. Really. Don't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I've said before, notwithstanding the unique straits of those who were rounded up in the Holocaust, we Jews have no particular innate streak of meek subservience, as this film amply proves. Even in the scene where the weakened crowd subsisting in the forest to hide from the Nazis and their henchmen kick and beat the stray German soldier to death, I realized it was right and proper, even though your first impulse is to think Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), their leader, is going to step in and stop it. But he doesn't, recognizing that their murderous rage is a just revenge for the ruthless brutalization of their loved ones at the Germans' hands. I must say, I disagreed with Roger Ebert's view that Craig's character is flat while his brother's, played by Liev Schreiber, is nuanced and evolutionary--he has it exactly backwards. It is Craig who gets to play the role where the requirements of leadership impose the toughest choices--choices he often wrestles with and resists, growing more resolute and decisive only when forced to; sometimes not soon enough. Directed by Ed Zwick of "The Last Samurai," "30something" and "My So-Called Life."</fullReview>

I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in human nature and the history buffs. How this story was never told until now is unbelievable.

		<shortDescription>A "true" story worth telling, but not told well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is actually a refreshing departure from most films in its genre, because it bravely shows jews the way so many of them are: extremely selfish, centric, argumentative, resistant to do physical labor and very quick to blame anything and everything for their troubles, most of which stem from their unwillingness to assimilate.Of course, not all Jewish folks are that way, not by a long shot, but you never forget the ones that are. This movie is about a group of jews who live in the woods to survive the genocide of WWII. Most of their difficulties arise from the fact that most of them (not all) are unwilling to do anything besides complain bewilderedly about their predicament and wonder who will take care of them.James Bond is in this movie, playing a jew who's more than willing to work with his hands, fight and kill. I loved that!Typical of a Hollywood movie, despite all their deprivations, surviving a Russian Winter with almost no food, filthy and sick, when Spring time comes, the lead characters don't look like they've missed a meal, haircut or Berverly Hills dentist appointment.(If you want to see an method actor really suffering for his role, check out Christian Bale in The Mechanic.)The film is missing Hollywood's seeming requisite homosexual content, you know, at least one same-sex relationship to remind us all that "there's nothing wrong with that."Defiance has a few minutes of excitement, most mostly repeats scene after scene of arguments.A skilled film maker would have taken this story and made a good, 1-hour docudrama out of it. Sadly, this film milks it a 2-hour "Schindler goes camping" rip off.Defiance comes up short.</fullReview>

As to the comments by some of the people as to the story not being true, none of these are proved and are merely allegations not supported by anything. In fact while Polish Institute of National Remembrance did investigate these events, no findings were published exactly for this reason - no evidence of Bielski brother's involvement...People lets please keep prejudice out of the comments.</fullReview>

As Tuvia Bielski though he's incredible. The vengeance scenes were perfect and the conflict between brothers was very real. The best actor by far was Liev Schrieber and I agree with others he should get the Oscar for best supporting actor. The fact that this was a true story is just amazing and gives you some context on why Israelis have a survival angst.

They in fact went to Israel, fought in the Israeli War of Independence and only left for the USA in the late 50's. Why was it felt necessary not to mention this crucially important point about their lives and wars?? Is this anti-Zionist Israel bashing as usual?? It was an important part of their lives and should have been mentioned. Not to have done so is mis-information and racist!!

		<fullReview>This film is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. As some Yahoo said on here, their is a lot of historic inaccuracies in this film, pertaining to the Penicillin raid, in one scene, yes this drug was developed in 1929 so it was in use at this time. People also spoke Russian, Polish, Ukrainian in some instances as well, as they were displaced and moved by "Mother Russia", to be used as farmers, or in the trades. One of the most interesting things about this film, is when they were talking English they were actually talking Polish, and when they were talking Russian, they were talking Russian. The Russian "Red Army" was also another interesting insert into the story. In the film as well, they had something to say about the treatment of Jews by the Russians, they were not all good, and many of the troops in the Red Army despised the Jewish population as not being Russian, or pure Russian. Enough about the background of the history of the story.These men and women who numbered about 1200 (including babies) was amazing, this was after the settlement of the forests by the Bielski partisans. As one Jewish proverb says "If you save one life you are indebted to it", this was a major undertaking. Can a group of people survive against all odds. Watch this film, so that we don't go down the same path again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>inspiring if a bit fast &amp; loose with history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very moved by this movie even while I noted many departures from fact, which were obviously done in order to make more dramatic fiction. (Usually I go to historical movies first and then go out and read about what really happened. In this case, I read Peter Duffy's "The Bielski Brothers" before I saw this movie, which is based on Nechama Tec's "Defiance," which is also one of Duffy's sources.) This true story is too little known. It can stand to be Hollywoodized if that means it will at least be told. Just as "Valkyrie" reminds us that not every German joined in Hitler's orgy of inhumanity, this movie reminds us that not every intended victim of Hitler's program of extermination went quietly. (Indeed, even those who were put into ghettos or taken to death camps did not always go quietly and they did not necessarily give up.) This movie is about one of several groups of Jews who responded to the Nazi threat by going on the offensive and becoming warriors. (Aside from the above-mentioned books about the Bielskis, there is now another book about Jewish guerrillas in Eastern Europe, "Until Our Last Breath" by Michael Bart.) One thing that comes out in this movie that is historically accurate is that the Bielski group took in women, the elderly and children?non-combatants who others would not have taken because they might hinder the fighting mission of a partisan group. Tuvia is quoted in the books as saying he would rather rescue one old Jewish woman than kill ten German soldiers. The movie doesn't have him say that, but it shows him doing it. As Peter Duffy notes, the Bielski brothers saved more Jews than Schindler of "Schindler's List" fame.Some facts are played fast and loose with. Whereas only Tuvia is portrayed in the movie as riding a horse, actually, the other brothers rode horses, too.The gentile farmer who helps the Bielskis is perhaps supposed to be a composite of those who helped them, but there was a real farmer who actually did more than his share of helping, and he survived the war. (Indeed, it is rather amazing that the Nazis were so slow to realize that he was running an underground railroad for escapees from the ghettos and that even after they finally caught on, they never caught him.) The filmmakers' choice is to concentrate on 1941-1942 when the Bileski group formed; however, they have added some events from 1943 such as the move from the Lipichanska forest to the Naliboki forest and the trek through the swamp within the Naliboki. The battle with the tank unit at the end did not happen. The whole point of the trek through the swamp was to reach a place that could hardly be reached by a tank. But I understand that this sequence was made up in order to juice up the action. (I am afraid that I have seen worse dramatic betrayals of the facts.)Thus they have gained more action and drama while avoiding the complication of showing the later increasing control over the Bielski group by the Soviets, who divided the group and gave each of the three brothers a different posting (which was OK with Zus but not with Asael). One of the consequences of the filmmakers collapsing the time line is that it makes it seem as if the Bileski group was already in the Naliboki forest in 1942, which it was not. The Bielskis have been accused of participation in the May 1943 massacre of the town of Naliboki?in some people's minds, as if they alone planned and executed the attack. In fact, at the time of the massacre?which was led by non-Jewish Soviet partisans who were probably following directives from Moscow?Tuvia Bielski and the bulk of his group, consisting mostly of non-combatants, were some 40 kilometers away from the town of Naliboki in one of the smaller forests between the Lipichanska and Noliboki forests, busily moving from one forest to another to evade the Germans. They would not reach the Naliboki forest until the month following the massacre.One dramatic weakness that I have to complain about is the short shrift given to the Asael Bielski character (Jamie Bell). Viewers will be surprised to learn that he was older than Zus, not younger. Moreover, he is kind of a nebbish in this movie, eventually forced to shoehorn himself into a leadership role. The real Asael was well-organized and rather tough, sharing some of the strengths and flaws of each of his brothers, Tuvia (Daniel Craig) and Zus (Liev Shreiber). The characters of these latter brothers dominate this movie, with Tuvia embodying all of the leadership traits and Zus all of the tough guy traits. For example, it was really Asael not Zus who disobeyed Red Army orders and left his post to rejoin Tuvia. (In real life a Soviet partisan officer ordered the execution of Asael for this desertion.) Tuvia and Zus become exaggerated types while poor Asael becomes an empty suit. Aron Bielski, whom I believe is still alive, will not recognize his brother Asael in this portrayal, while he might recognize the characters of Tuvia and Zus only as more or less approximating their real life counterparts.</fullReview>

I'm not worried about the historical facts, which I am sure are dreadfully inaccurate.

The holocaust film genre is becoming an annual event, no different nor better then the annual holiday films released in December. Pity that the talent of top actors and cinematographers was wasted on what could have been a good story, if the director, producer and editor had had the guts to make their own style instead of just plagiarizing you know who.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We should have killed the milkman ? Defiance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Edward Zwick's newest wartime epic?the man is a pro at them ever since Glory?titled Defiance we get the unthinkable. Here is a ragtag group of Belarusian Jews running for their lives and hiding in the forest; pulled together into a community of survival by three brothers with the name Bielski. Say what you will about the Americans or the Brits or any other trained army that came in to fight against the tyranny and brutality of Hitler and his SS, these men and women, these intellectuals and poor working class people are true heroes. Looking at the person next to them, knowing it was they whom they fought for, these escapees of the slaughtered masses decided to stand up against evil, to take their lives in their own hands. The Bielskis had no formal training other than the will to not become animals like the Germans so desperately tried to make them. They fought for humanity and made their own survival each day their revenge.We are thrust into the story right from the get-go. Zus and Asael Bielski are out when they hear the SS on their capturing/murdering assignment. Rushing home, they soon discover the dead bodies of their father and neighbors. Inside their barn, hidden under wooden slats, lies their youngest brother Aron, shaken and muted from the atrocities he had witnessed, but he is alive and the brothers are thankful for that. The three go into the woods, a terrain they know well, a forest refuge the Germans know nothing about, and are stumbled upon the next day by eldest sibling Tuvia. It soon becomes a mission of survival, of finding food and weapons to stay safe and to protect the numerous refugees that eventually come their way. Tuvia knows that there is not enough food for everyone, but he can't turn his back on his own people, to send them to the ghettos for what was inevitably death. However, he and second oldest Zus soon take different sides on how to save their lives. Both men have a bloodlust for revenge?retribution for what happened to their family, but also for what has happened to their people?yet while one reconciles those feelings into survival, the other wants aggressive intervention, to fight on the front lines with the Russians and take out as many Germans as he can.This dynamic helps to add another layer to the tale besides just a Jewish versus Nazi opposition. Although they are on the same side, Daniel Craig's Tuvia is a realist knowing that revenge won't bring any of the dead back. He is too preoccupied with keeping the hundreds now under his care safe and alive and hidden from the enemy. Liev Schreiber's Zus, on-the-other-hand, cannot forget his need to destroy those men that destroyed his life. Some say that he cannot turn into them, he can't become a monster, but he may be correct in countering with the statement that he won't, yet that doesn't mean he can't kill like them. A father, a wife, a child ? all taken from him by the Germans; you can't help but understand his point of view and want him to get whatever retribution he can. Because honestly, every German he kills means one less that can hurt the people his brother is now trying to protect.When there aren't Germans to fight there are greedy members of their own camp to put down. At one point Tuvia falls ill for a spell and it appears as though his power and platform of equality is in jeopardy. A hungry soldier attempts a coup, twice, and takes the usually understanding Bielski brother to his breaking point. Asael told him the first time that Zus would have stopped the dissenter without hesitation. It may take Tuvia longer to reach that mindset, throwing forgiveness out the window, but he is not afraid to. Along with this strife in the Otriad camp comes the anti-Semitism in the Russian Partisan camp, men fighting alongside one another, Zus being their strongest fighter, yet the Jews still get beaten up when using a Russian's latrine. Zus joined them to fight for their cause, for his cause, but even amongst allies he cannot escape the bigotry and racism that has brought their continent into such turmoil.Zwick knows how to shoot true stories in a way to capture interest. While he may not be flashy or stylish, he composes some solid films that help teach a little lesser-known history while also telling a story worth watching. There are a couple moments of beauty; a nicely edited sequence in the fluttering snow, juxtaposing Asael's wedding with an ambush by the Partisans for instance, (ruined only slightly by the heavy-handed score), but for the most part everything is shot in an economy of plot, showing what is necessary to continue the tale to its conclusion. The real strength here is in the casting. Many roles are inspired choices indeed. Jamie Bell goes through a transformation from scared and sad boy who's life is turned upside-down to a man fit to lead an army, one that can inspire even his older brother, a man who has been leading them all since the beginning. And as for Craig and Schreiber, it is a total mismatch of the usual roles they get. Whereas Craig generally plays the Bond-types, unsentimental killers with a stone face, Schreiber is most known for his intellectual, even-keeled characters. With Defiance, though, they defy those types and play what any other director would have had the other do. It is an interesting choice that definitely pays off, for both shine here and carry the film successfully on their shoulders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollowing the Holocaust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Zwick, like Steven Spielberg, constantly mistakes "history" for "serious art". His new film, "Defiance" (aka "Jews Strike Back"), centres on a small group of Jewish rebels who mobilised and fought against the Nazis during WW2, wreaking divine justice on Hitler's henchmen like a gang of Yiddish superheroes. While the film fails as both action movie and historical piece, it is mildly interesting in the way it aligns itself with Hollywood's current trend of re-branding and repackaging the Jew.Over the past 6 years, the portrayal of Jews in cinema has drastically changed. With films like "Munich", "Defiance", "Don't Mess with the Zohan" and "Inglorious Bastards", we're seeing the Jewish identity shift from feeble, perpetual victims (the bespectacled scholarly Jew) to technocratic ministers of death (vengeful warriors of God). It's like a weird shift from New Testament to Old Testament values.This growing empowerment itself reflects Israel's national switch from victims to oppressors. Gaza, a middle Eastern version of the Warsaw ghetto, is now a calculated experiment in provocation. When you squeeze one million Palestinians into a walled space, stifle their access to water, electricity, food and medical treatment, destroy their livelihoods, mock and debase them regularly, don't act surprised when they turn hostile.But of course hostility is what you want. With the emergence of violence you can then play the role of victim, bringing out your helicopter gunships, your tanks and missiles and beating the battered remains of Palestinian infrastructure into non-existence. With no infrastructure, no education, no social services or amenities, you can then further deny the existence of a Palestinian Government. Afterall, how can you have a government when there is nothing to govern? And so the rag-tag Palestinian leaders are labelled "terrorists", an act which permanently shuts down all hope of political exchange, freeing Israel to "claim" yet more and more land, expanding outward in the name of, not God, but Hegemony.Even if one ignores Israel's role in US politics and in its actual and attempted maneuvers in various Middle Eastern countries (Lebanon, Iran etc), it is clear that Israel has become a force to be reckoned with. It is now armed with the deadliest, most technologically advanced military in the region, and so is perhaps finally comfortable enough to flex its muscles. Today's archetypal Jew, cinema or otherwise, answers to no one and defiantly does as pleases.This change, though, has been taking place over a number of decades. Israel never had any intention of allowing a sovereign Palestinian state on its borders. It had no intention of allowing it in 1948 when it grabbed 24 per cent more land than what it was allotted legally, had no intention of allowing it throughout the massacres and ploys of the 1950s, had no intention of allowing two states when it conquered the remaining 22 per cent of historic Palestine in 1967 (and reinterpreted UN Security Council Resolutions to its own liking), had no intention of acknowledging Palestinian national rights at the United Nations in 1974, and had no intention of working toward a two-state solution in 1978 or 1982 when it invaded, fire-bombed, blasted and bulldozed Beirut (so that it might annex the West Bank without hassle).Couple that with Israel's deliberate support of Hamas (so that it might undermine the strength of the more secular-nationalist factions), and you have a country which has slowly been casting aside the role of victim. The result: Hollywood's "new Jew", vengeful, deadly, armed and mad as hell.And of course, Daniel Craig, the blonde haired, blue eyed James Bond of "Munich", will personify this sexy new Jew. Hollywood has always had an aversion to the fact that most Jews in the region are dark skinned.And so the core problem with Zwick's "Defiance" is that in reversing the historical stereotype of Jewish passivity, the film ends up affirming them. "Defiance" implies that only if more Jews had been tough warriors and fought against the Nazis, then more Jews would have survived. This has the unintentional effect of making the timidity of the Jews, rather than the barbarity of the Nazis, the centre of the Holocaust. Like the heroes of the film, the Jewish ideal is now that of the survivor who not only stands up to victimization, but takes the fight back to those who deny his power. "Defiance" celebrates strong men (who in real life sought no glory) at the expense of those whose inability to fight back was NOT a moral failure but a fact of history. This trivialises the Holocaust, and paints a wholly untruthful picture.4/10 ? There have been a glut of Holocaust movies recently ("The Counterfeiters", "The Reader", "Valkyrie", "Good", "The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas" and Paul Schrader's weird "Adam Resurrected"). Why is this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big plot problems but otherwise an enjoyable film. Why Ampicillin????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. It showed how 4 brothers helped to save the lives of hundreds of Jews in World War 2 Belorussia / Poland. I thought it was excellently acted and directed, but a little more attention to the details would have helped. I don't know all the history of these partisan groups, but I thought even though the film was clearly showing the Bielskis to be the heroes, it did make references to their revenge and brutality, showing this group were no innocent Robin Hood style characters (nor would you expect anyone who had witnessed the Nazi treatment of their people to be only full of love and kindness.) My problem with the plot is the supposed use of Ampicillin. This antibiotic gets a fairly big role in the film (for a medicine,) with the main character's survival linked to it and the Russian partisans being blamed for not sharing their supplies with the Jews. Unfortunately Ampicillin was not invented until 1961. Even the earliest forms of penicillin were in the very beginnings of production at this stage. By June 1942, there was only enough penicillin in the world to treat 10 patients, and almost all of this was in America. While I appreciate not many people would know this, it doesn't take 10 minutes to find out online, or by asking any doctor. Even I would have told them, for a small fee! Joking aside, it would have made the whole film feel much more accurate if they'd done a tiny bit more research while writing the script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Connor Macgregor Reviews...DefianceDefiance wasn't really a film i was expecting to be quite close to my heart...but boy it is and it is quite possibly one of my favourite films of 2009.Yeah it was out in January 2009.After leaving the cinema these and i am not joking were my first words after the first film "I haven't been impressed by a film since The Dark Knight" and i wasn't joking.This film was heartwarming,powerful and informative at the same time.It tells a very sad but hopeful story about how 3 brothers are thrown together in a physical and emotional battle of survival.You can feel the emotion inside these characters and you want them to survive,you want them to overcome the odds and have a hopeful ending of their lives.This film really does make you learn and feel for these struggling characters in a race for a new happy life outside the darkness and bowels of Nazi Germany.The directing is pretty good and i do like some of the sequences that Edward Zwick directed.He also does very good action sequences too as well as powerful emotional scenes with Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber.Now of course this is based on a real story so this isn't some fictional war film.The story is powerful and once again I'm saying emotional.The script is very well written with many clever words and the use of Judaism in the script.It never leaves the screen and that is a good thing.Star of the film goes to Daniel Craig but Liev was close behind.I however wished Jamie Bell got a bigger part,he needs more screen time and i think he could have had a big opportunity in this film to get more time on the screen.In Conclusion Defiance is one of the best war films i have seen in years.Its up their with all the great war films like The Great Escape and Saving Private Ryan.76% - B+ - A Very Good Film - ***.5 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Power Story of Survival. "The Strong Will Take Care of the Weak"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tend to be a "loved it of not" type of movie viewer. It is hard for me to pick apart I movie I enjoyed enough to deduct points, and keep myself from rewarding good films with less than a 10. Such is the case with "Defiance". This film delivers on all of the important parts of film making. For my taste it all begins with story telling. A film can have everything else, yet be a failure in my eyes if there is not good story telling. I can forgive a low budget film if it tells a good story. "Defiance" tells a great story and then delivers on all other levels of film making. This is a heroic film about a small group of survivors overcoming the horror of war by banding together and helping each other survive. I too have brothers, of whom I am the eldest, and like the brothers Bielski, if forced to war, we would stick by each other's side in the fight for survival of good. "Defiance" takes the time to develop characters you can care about and then goes on to tell a compelling story about how a small group of people who were targeted as undeserving of life according to Nazi philosophy survive and keep their humanity intact until the war was finally over. The performances by the entire cast are convincing. The Cinematography was beautiful and the editing was effective both in scenes of conflict and scenes of tenderness. This film does require attention span as it starts slow, especially for viewers accustomed to high paced action, but if you take the patience to involve yourself in the film you will be rewarded with a great viewing experience that will reconfirm your belief that it is always possible to overcome adversity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot say enough wonderful things about this film. It was so moving, so beautiful, and simply unforgettable. I am thankful to Edward Zwick for making it. This is a gripping, incredible true story of bravery and responsibility, as well as human failings and flaws. I can hardly wait to see it again. It is a must-see. I have seen most everything released in 2008 and it is one of my top picks, no doubt.This is the kind of film that should be required viewing for all high school students (along with the Pianist, Valkyrie, and some others). I hope it will be one day.The actors and script are first-rate. The story is inspiring and simply unforgettable. I hope there are many, many awards for this film. I think, even if the Academy is short-sighted enough to ignore it, that it will go down in history as one of the greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Germans or should I say Nazis of WWII were correctly shown in "Defiance" and portrayed as a heartless, ruthless war machine, as in many of it's black and white predecessors, because that's what they were. You can't sugarcoat cowards horrors. Movies can hardly touch or grasp their actual or complete horrible scope. Movies such as this open a viewers eyes to a time when humans turned the world into a graveyard. Even the most profound of these movies, won't dare or come close to opening the door to what "actually" occurred. Before you make a comment such as you did, take some time to actually think about what you are saying!</fullReview>

It's as if some have forgotten what the word inspired means, I really recommend people to go and see this film and view it as a film and not a documentary.Daniel Craig plays and excellent part as Tuvia Bielski. Liev Schreiber (Zus Bielski) and Jamie Bell (Asael Bielski) also played an equally excellent supporting roll.Although, I must admit I was left wanting more at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not think of one solitary thing to say negatively about this movie.First and foremost the acting was superb. Though this was a true story it had everything going for it. It was a movie of perseverance,revenge, hope, sibling rivalry, survival, battle. You name it this movie had it all. I got a lesson in history and I did not know about the fugitive Russians . This movie more than covered that and with effectiveness revealed a case of true sibling rivalry and without spoiling the movie .... It was a story of family love and common goals and blood being thicker than water. Just a very enjoyable, hopeful, uplifting movie about Jewish fugitives and to a lesser extent Russian fugitives, living a nomadic life , setting kibbutz like camp, at any areas they felt safe , while always looking out for danger.It goes without saying this occurred at the height of the Nazi regime. Its a great discussion movie and as tough as their conditions were it was still better than being in a concentration camp. The relative conformity of the group helped in many ways to overcome even the most dire of circumstances. Just an excellent film and I can not believe it was only nominated for one Oscar .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not one that lists war movies on their list of favorite movie genres. I went with a friend who really wanted to see it and I liked it more than she did. Things I considered brilliant were the film opening and ending; the musical score; overall cinematography; the quick edits back and forth between forest community life and war scenes.I felt Daniel Craig &amp; Liev Schreiber did an outstanding job with the accents and actually speaking Russian. Sure, their natural accents showed up for a few brief seconds but their efforts deserve recognition as opposed to Tom Cruise who couldn't pull off an accent in Valkyrie.Jamie Bell's performance brought me to tears. Whether or not this storyline is 100% accurate should not be a major factor in determining the validity of the film. There are no doubt hundreds of stories of bravery and survival surrounding the Holocaust that no one will ever read about but Defiance is an excellent depiction of this horrible event in the worlds history that should never be forgotten. I only saw the first hour of Valkyrie this week because the projectors film broke, but I honestly did not care and have no interest in seeing the rest of the film. In my opinion Defiance bests Valkyrie in every possible way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real story about Bilski brothers is pretty interesting, but producer shouldn't create Their own fake story. If they say that it's "based on a true story", They can't show Bilski as a hero, whose gang is guilty of murdering 120 innocent villagers in Naliboki. Maybe producers will make another movie (of course "based on a true story") about smart and sensitive painter Adolf Hitler? In producer's world, he would be shown as a nazi victim. You can read more about Bilski brothers in internet. If still you wanna go to cinema to watch it, remember that you will show disdain to all Bilski's victims. Institute of National Remembrance in Poland has already started an investigation about Naliboki massacre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In defiance of stereotypes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie KNOCKED UP, five Jew friends trying to score in a night club talk about the credibility of Jews being raised by one man: "If any of us is gonna score tonight, it's because of Eric Bana in MUNICH." Soon they'll be talking the same way about Daniel Craig in DEFIANCE...1941: during World War II, three Jewish brothers in German-occupied Poland lead a band of Jewish rebels and refugees in fleeing the Holocaust and fighting back against Ze Chermans.From a book by Nechama Tec, Defiance: The Bielski Partisans, Edward Zwick directs DEFIANCE, following the Bielski brothers, Tuvia (Daniel Craig) and Zus (Liev Schreiber), as they lead over 1,000 refugees to safety in the Belarussian forests. Jamie Bell plays their younger brother, Asael.It's Based On a True Story. But seriously - who cares? Besides the descendants of those refugees. Haven't we exhausted the compelling "true stories" from World War II? We're into a generation of viewers whose knowledge of WWII comes from the History Channel and boring school teachers; they're more familiar with al Qaeda, Iraq and maybe the 1990 Gulf War. To this younger generation, The Berlin Wall was something that Reagan told Mr. Gorbachev to tear down. How uninterested can they possibly be in the tribulations of a few Jews in 1941 Europe? Well, I guess that's why Daniel Craig is so hot. To draw in the target audience of 19 year old girls. Who will be followed by 21 year old boys.Best thing about DEFIANCE is its ruthlessness. Tuvia mercilessly - and very satisfactorily - executes the Germans who killed his parents. Yet he tells brother Zus "We must not become like them." I guess he means they must not take joy in their killings, as they both seek out and execute all the Jewish traitors to their cause. Revenge is sweet, poison and all.It is great to see Jews fighting back for once in a war movie. Up to now, the image of the war Jew has been Auschwitz victims, sunken faces, long woolen overcoats, crumpled hats, queuing for gas chambers. DEFIANCE gives us sexyboys with machine guns, muscles and mojo. Not whining about their constant persecution or their bad gout. No lawyers and bignoses and funny hat wearers, but warriors leading a bunch of lawyers and bignoses and funny hat wearers. Not mournfully sitting around for God to deliver them, bellyaching prophecies of a chosen one who would bring balance to the Force (as a large contingent do, cowering hidden in the city, led by Mark Margolis).The Bielski brothers are movers and shakers who deliver all these stereotypes out of the defeated city, build a forest community, ally with Russian resistance fighters, cut down troublemakers in their midst, and mow down Germans with guns blazing.DEFIANCE suffers for being too far removed from our sensibilities. I guess a patriotic Jew would find it inspirational, but it is just one basic idea stretched over two hours: furtively hide, shoot Germans, furtively hide, shoot Germans, furtively hide, shoot Germans... okay, two basic ideas.If Jesus had been this badass, we'd all be speaking Aramaic...--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A profound failure for all involved, especially director Edward Zwick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I never thought that I would ever mention Edward Zwick's name and the word "boring" into one sentence. Since "Glory" I always looked forward to the next film by this director. Yes, his films are of a varied quality, but they were always highly entertaining (Legends of the fall, Blood diamond), sometimes even thought provoking (Glory, The siege, Courage under fire). Going into a Zwick film I'm expecting something bold, big, pathetic (in a great cinematic way), great set pieces, fine music and fine camera-work...something that carries me away into the movie.So what happened here? This film has an interesting premise, but the execution is a very long and very slow and very uninvolving bore. Cardboard characters, villains that look so obviously bad it's nearly laughable, bad staged action sequences and not an ounce of suspense. The fact that this is based on a true story makes the failure even more disappointing. And one more thing I never saw in any other Zwick film: This one looks cheap, to put it mildly. It looks TV-cheap, the sets, the one and only tank, the handful of German soldiers... Hey Ed, you made the spectacular, great on all levels "Glory", also a true story, also more of a drama than a war movie. Everything that works in "Glory" fails in "Defiance". I hope this is one misstep and that your next movie will have all the qualities I like so much in your films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of my favorite movies of 2008. Although I don't quite agree with the tag line that it was "Daniel Craig's Best Performance to date" (that would be Casino Royale) I do believe he gave a quite masterful performance. So did Liev Shrieber, and especially Jamie Bell and all of the other supporting cast members. I even like the acting by the young actor George MacKay who played Aron Bielski. I will keep this in my personal collection for the rest of my life. The length was great some times movies just aren't long enough these days. I will watch it again and again.It is a great World War II film. I recommend it to all. 10/10!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War II and the Jews --- All Over Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defiance, like dozens of other movies over the past 4 decades, tells about World War II with it's focus squarely on the Jews, the Jews and nothing but the Jews. In fact it's the 12th World War II movie this year to focus on the Jews("Valkyrie" was the exception). Thus Hollywood has successfully re-written history to allow two generations to believe the war was primarily about the Jews. Taint so, McGee; and this distortion is not only a monstrous lie but takes away from both the real heroes of the war and the real victims of Nazi Germany.What about the invasions of Austria, Poland, Czechoslavakia, France. Can Hollywood even spell Czechoslavakia? What about the fire rocketing of London? What about the destruction of 20 thousand buildings in 20 minutes, Hitler's gift to Rotterdam? The list goes on. And yet we haven't seen the end of Hollywood's spin job for 2009: "The Reader" is getting the must-see spin for the Oscars.As for "Defiance" except for the propaganda spin it's a pretty good movie. A good story, and this time having a few Jews fighting back (like they do in Israel these days, God bless 'em) rather than relying on Americans, Brits and others. Daniel Craig does a very good job here and can redeem himself after being stuck in the most stupid James Bond movie ever made. The Lithuanian locations add to the mix. I'd say a solid 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that when the 007, the future Victor Creed and the director of Glory, Last Samurai AND Blood Diamond appear on the credits for an upcoming movie you can pencil in two hours of my weekend. Defiance is exactly what you expect it is a harsh, exact, and honest look at how the three Beluski brothers saved over 1200 Jews in the black forest during the World War II. That is the ENTIRE war mind you. The performances are all stellar notably Jamie Bell, Liev Schriber and Alexa Davalos. Bell and Davalos come of age without you even noticing it as they fall in line behind their leader Daniel Craig (playing the oldest brother) who channels his inner Bond by detaching himself from the situation when need by in order to accomplish the greater good. Schriber deserves Best Supporting Actor consideration (for the nomination only because HEATH has it wrapped up). Here he plays a man haunted by violence and murder and cares not about his morality but choose instead to dominate his NAZI nemesis by killing as many as possible. On top of playing a complex character hes a bad ass and a half here. The conditions are harsh and depicted as so. Some may say it is hard to connect with the story because there is not any emotional depth at hand. They are right. It is not complex stuff, we follow around men and women who are simply trying to survive extraordinary times. The fact that they succeed and fail (not to mention THIS REALLY HAPPENED) is connection enough.</fullReview>

The three movies have been visually very good with Blood Diamond begin the best among the three which showed the reality can be very much cruel to other people...The life of Solomon Vandy are worth spending the tears with Archer being taking our breat away...Last Samurai was very well picturized and the beauty of Japan was entirely awesome through out the film....The script too was good with Ken Watanabe (Mr.Kasumoto) outclassing Tom Cruise when it came to acting....I did watch Glory after seeing the above two movies and that's why didn't enjoy the movie much and which may be due to the clichés present in the Blood Diamond and Last Samurai.Coming to Defiance I felt disappointed that the movie never turned me on...It was Liev Schreiber (Zus Belski) did the best part in the movie and Daniel Craig did disappoint and so as Edward Zwick...I have to say the movie didn't rise to the standard of the most underrated director of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>defiance dares to bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the last ten years I have walked out of only two films before they have ended. Blood Diamond and Defiance, both weightless (but heavy going), both making a hash of a terrific plot, both Zwick. Vy ver de actors in Defiance have to talk in zis stupid manner? Doubly stupid was the fact that the same actors also spoke in excellently learned Russian. There was no justification for the assumed middle European twang unless it was the assumed school of acting that carried most of the performances. The whole thing smacked of a latter day Sunday tea-time BBC TV offering. What could have saved it? A lighter touch perhaps, a sense of humor now and then always points up the tragedy. Even in the depths of despair the human animal will usually find a little fun. In the Ghetto there was theater, in the London Underground stations there was music hall during air raids. It would have been nice to hear some laughter in the forest, if only to prevent me from wondering if the film set was respecting the environment. The director is perhaps trying to make a reputation dealing with tough and meaningful topics when he may be better advised to deal with Disney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't trust the history books, as I don't trust the reality of facts in an autobiographical book, maybe even more. So goes with movies. Just a day before watching Defiance, I discussed with a friend about whether Lenin was killed by Stalin or not. It's just a story that you can interpret very widely. Even history books interpret - we can take the creation of city Rome by Romus and Remulus. This movie gave me another of those interpretations - how true is it, I don't know, but the message in the beginning "A true story" made me watch this while trying to think how it could really have happened.I live not far from the location used in a film. There were nothing but Jews in bigger cities of my country, and now there are barely any left. I believe Defiance gives Jews justice. I understand now, that as any other people, they didn't want to fight, but when angry or furious, they did. They fought they are different, but they certainly weren't. I want to underline that Jews are just as any other people. They do not differ from regular village person more than a black man differs from white. Edward Zwick depicted Jews that want revenge, can unite for better good, but can still be selfish in those beautiful forests.I loved the way film is directed - camera movement, strong personalities, hidden messages, and it was even long! In conclusion, I was startled by the point that Defiance is the first movie I have seen this year, it is informative, intellectual and still differs from other war movies. And we have lots and lots of those.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From a visual point of view, this was beautiful to watch, thanks to the Lithuanian locations, sets, actors and wardrobe. The life experience of the main characters was depicted in a dark yet still somewhat sanitized way, and I think the film was fairly success in that respect with regards to immersing the viewer in this (allegedly true) story which beggars belief at times.However, there were some misguided attempts at light relief which fell flat, and as with most war-set stories the opposing sides were depicted as far too black and white, with the Germans portrayed as brutal, faceless killing machines. If you can overlook that simplistic bias and a few other flaws, it's a very enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Defiance retells a true story from World War II, whereby the three Bielski brothers take responsibility for the welfare of a large number of Jewish refugees by hiding them in the extensive forests in Belorussia.Think Robin Hood meets Schindler's List.This film is worthy, but never exacts the same grip on you that Schindler's List did. Perhaps this is due to the forest locations which, while often very beautiful, feel very claustrophobic and hem the movie in. The story merits a more expansive canvas.The cast are all excellent, particularly Liev Schreiber who shows rather more range than one is accustomed to seeing from him.I felt my attention begin to think about wandering at around the two thirds mark - there were some soap opera elements which felt a little out of place. And I felt somewhat dissatisfied at never knowing some of the specifics/nuts and bolts of what, after all, was something of a challenging situation - how many people were there all told? How did they organise food preparation? What sort of area was involved? What weapons did they have and where did they get them (Tuvia fails to take weapons from the policeman's house early on, for example). I felt the movie needed more of this and less of Azael making eyes at Chaya etc.But I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from seeing it - it's a worthwhile movie, and holds your interest (mostly), I was just left feeling that something was missing. But I can't put my finger on what it was.</fullReview>

Now besides the horrible acting, retarded action scenes, and dear lord, the music, wowwwww, its hard to believe this made it to theaters. Now lets get things straight though, I don't blame Daniel Craig for this horrible film, or for that matter the other actors, No, I soley blame one man, the director of this film, Mr Edward Zwick. Edward Zwick is whats wrong with Hollywood, not only does he butcher history but his films are garbage. Think about it, The Last Samurai, I am Sam, Blood Diamond! All of these films are poorly made and the scripts seem like they were written in a weekend. Ex. (Tom cruise sends all the Samurais to fight, and whos the only person who survives, Tom Cruise, I mean wow, who writes this garbage)" Zwick puts ridiculous actions scenes and very unrealistic dialogue in all his so called "historical" films and Defiance is no different. It was incredibly far fetched and the hole movie was filmed in a bleak snowy woods with irritating violin music playing. Save yourself the time and money and go see something else, I mean honestly even Valkyrie was better then this and that wasn't even good.</fullReview>

The full horror of war and fight for survival against a barbarous enemy and deadly weather elements is well portrayed in this film. The scenery is awesome. My only criticism is that it was a bit slow in places. If you looking for an all action war film, this is not it, however there is action, but its the telling of hardship and endurance of a race of people another race sought to extinguish.

Like many Jews (see "Tough Jews" by Rich Cohen) he romanticizes the Jewish gangster connections of earlier generations of Jewish immigrants, and sees in them the protagonists that the victims of the Holocaust weren't.Fair enough, or, should I say, not fair at all, since I do not share the view that the civilian Jews of Europe were passive because they could not defeat or evade the German military and local death squads. Why is this relevant to "Defiance?" Because Zwick let his bias affect what he chose to portray in the historical drama of "Defiance." There is a brief shot of the bodies left behind of the mass killings of Jews in what was then Russia in 1941 (long forgotten in the East until Yevvtushenko's "Babi Yar" of 1961). I think that one of the reasons (more below) that "Defiance" is not nearly as powerful as "Schindler's List" is that Zwick was unwilling to portray the grotesque drama of the massacres that happened in Byelorussia in 1941 because, to him, it made Jews look like victims. It's all referred to off-screen. "Schindler's List" punches you in the stomach with the vivid depiction of the concentration camps and crematoria -- historical truths -- and it makes Schindler's story of saving his workers into an epic. So could "Defiance" have been. Maybe the Bielieskis' story is not as heroic as Schindler's, but I don't think so. Theirs is probably more so (though different of course -- Schindler wasn't facing a direct murderous threat). If Zwick had put his movie in the proper historical framework (I'm not talking about gratuitous violence, which would, anyway, be hard to achieve given the reality of what the Germans did to civilians) the story of the Bieleskis saving 1200 Jews would have had some of the impact of Schindler's story of saving the Jewish workers on his list.My second critique is poor character development of the Daniel Craig character. Yes, he's aggrieved over what degree of vengeful violence against the Germans is necessary or appropriate. He starts off an aggressive killer and then pulls back, becoming (aided by the prolonged bout of typhus) quite passive. We can call the Craig character "complex" or "conflicted," but there is very little context to explain him. Schreiber's character is perhaps more "on the nose," but it is understandable, both to us and to Schreiber, who does a good job with it. Craig's character, to me, is a series of events, not a character.The joining theme of these ideas is the problem of historical cinema when you want to get the benefit of "based on a true story," at the front of your film. We know this is a very, very broad term. Clint Eastwood left out the killer's mother, who was totally involved in the action in reality, when he dramatized, "The Changeling." Did Schreiber and his colleagues show up at the very last second and disarm a German tank when Craig was the only one left standing to defend the Jews? Unlikely. So Zwick messed with the military history, as is necessary in a Hollywood movie. But did he feel constrained by the true characters of the brothers? Or, worse, did he feel constrained as to what he could make of those characters because of the need to portray them as heroic? I would argue the opposite. Zwick described the brothers as "sexually predacious" in his NYT article. But, in the movie, they appear to be pretty much gentlemen (Schreiber leaving his "forest wife" to join with the Red Army isn't much of a mark against him). If the characters had been more vivid, including more negative, I think their "heroism" would have been more dramatic.So, I've seen A Christmas Tale (overrated), Benajmin Button (awful) and Slumdog Millionaire (overrated) and am still waiting for holiday magic. From Milk? Gran Torino? Here's to hope! (a good thing, maybe the best of things).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent WWII film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>since 1990 4 films have been made about WWII worth mentioning in my book: Schindlers List, Saving Private Ryan, The Pianist, and Defiance. this movie rocked me to my core emotionally. an excellent story with performances to match. Daniel Craig delivers a breakout performance that will have people remembering him not just as James Bond. Liev Schrieber does in front of the camera, what he did behind it for Everything Is Illuminated, absorb an audience with a top of the line job. Jamie Bell shows the world that his performance in Mister Foe was not a fluke and that he is surely one of the best up and coming actors of this generation. finally Edward Zwick delivers what is, in my opinion, his best film ever, and certainly his best since Glory. this film was one of my favorite films of 2008 and definitely should be in heavy contention this award season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defiance Movie Review from The Massie Twins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Edward Zwick likes his epic war films full of tragedy and thick accents. With Defiance he's chosen a seldom explored true story of Jewish rebels fighting back against their Nazi aggressors in the Belarusian forest; but even with the stage set for heart-wrenching drama and tragic wartime attrition, the film can't quite manage enough emotionally engaging pathos for its band of oddly anti-heroic protagonists.After escaping Nazi-occupied Poland during the onset of World War II, three Jewish brothers, Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber), and Asael Bielski (Jamie Bell) flee to the Belarusian forest where they encounter several other refugees. After numerous casualties from hasty attacks on German soldiers, Tuvia decides that revenge be substituted for survival and begins constructing a village in the forest to shelter his comrades and the growing influx of Jews fleeing Poland. Zus, opposed to Tuvia's more peaceful tactics, opts to join Russian partisans operating nearby, but fate and a common enemy will find their paths crossing once again.Defiance certainly feels like an Edward Zwick film, full of heavy dramatic action, sweeping epic conflicts and historical significance. But like his other political and war driven films (Blood Diamond and The Last Samurai) Defiance falls short of being something truly special due to a lack of investment with the characters. The settings, costumes, cinematography and acting are all first rate, but the development of lead roles and even supporting characters leaves something to be desired, especially when the end of the film abruptly rolls around and great revelations or emotional moments are curiously absent.Defiance is a lesser known chapter from the melting pot of World War II movies and gains points for bringing to our attentions the horrors and triumphs of a band of survivors who achieved the impossible. But like the middle part of a trilogy, the film is paced and concludes anticlimactically like a piece of a much larger plot - one that must struggle to get to the action, and then loses steam as it heads toward the inevitable afterward events summaries. Without tearjerker moments and characters that don't push enough emotional buttons, Defiance is a film that is likely to remain as obscure as its subject matter - a historically powerful chapter that could have been better represented.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrenching True Story of Impossiblity (NB: I make mention of Schindlers List as a parallel not a comparison)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies?whats the point? Why are we so intrigued by watching a story brought to us by someone else's imagination? Many people have there many reasons but let me tell you what is my ultimate raison d'?tre, I watch this type of artistry because once in a while there comes a movie that reminds us that the world is much bigger than we are, reminds us that what we take for granted today was given to us for the price of someone's life. A movie that deepens your appreciation for freedom. Attenborough's Gandhi did it, Spielberg's Schindler's List did it, and now we have Zwick's Defiance.I have my own little genre that i like to classify these movies in, i like to call it the "conscious" genre. Because we all at some point need to feel the guilt of our ignorance, so that we can always remember history so it does not repeat itself. Daniel Craig is at his best here, really sinking into his character so as to reflect the human being that Tuvia Bielski was. His accent was good, but i noticed that the English accent did come through a little bit especially when he raised his voice (that why it gets a 9), hardly noticeable, but i look for these type of things. The settings were breathtaking, which is a trademark of Ed Zwick's work (the harsh African continent in Blood Diamond and the lush Japanese vistas of the Last Samurai). I especially enjoyed the light snow floating about like burnt ash during his brothers wedding, this has been done before, but what made this relevant was the conveyance that winter was upon them, and although they were partaking in a joyous celebration, the hardest stretch of their survival was still to come. The editing was superb, showing us what the exiled eldest brother was enduring while the the rescued people struggled for food.This movie also highlighted how human beings evolve when their very foundation are ripped from beneath us...forget fighting against Germans, how does anyone win when we start fighting amongst ourselves. The contradictory manner in which Tuvia deals with this matter is one you will debate with yourself. You got to watch this, if you are a person lacking compassion, and even if you are deserving of it. I really hope Craig gets a nom for this one. But like we saw Dicaprio and Cruise overlooked for their respective roles, i wont hold my breath. I left this movie captivated, enthralled and symphatetic.My favorite line in the movie..."We not good for drinking with, fighting with, what are Jews good for...we are only good for dying"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story but lacks real focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defiance is a good effort - not as good as Katyn which tells a different story of a massacre and was released this year - to tell a tale worth the telling.It suffers from being too long and under-directed in places but it has a good cast and sense of purpose.It is best in the action scenes and maintains a sense of story elsewhere - it is a worthwhile watch, but I must agree with other critics here who comment that it looks too made for TV there is very little camera action excepting straight story -telling and the film is entirely linear and lacks a directorial cohesion and vision that would have lifted the excellent story to another plane.Overall, definitely worth viewing, but lacks greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Defiance, it made me realize the importance of family and sacrifice. When I watched the trailer, I knew that this movie was gonna be good but I had no idea that it was gonna turn out like this. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber were just outstanding as the Bielski brothers and so was Jamie Bell who has a bright future as an actor. The brothers acted so good that I thought that this was real life and not a movie(I had to check myself on that). Anyways, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys long, but great action and important morals in a movie to see this and you will not be disappointed, I can guarantee that. Defiance Part 2 Maybe, you never know?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial concoction - Failed attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bad movie despite a different story. The audience is deceived and forced into tears by haunting melodramatic music. Looks like the director's view of a holocaust movie is one where the audience is sent home sobbing.Too much drama with clichéd, inciting, commercial, and confusing dialogs that simply don't make any rational or logical sense, and are sprinkled rather generously all over to create sensation. Sometimes its also ridiculous to hear malformed English dialogs with Russian accent, the film would have probably been better off in native Russian with English subtitles.In the end its simply boring, long, and artificial - doesn't click. The only thing thats good about this movie is a different (true) story about the holocaust in which the Jews actually fight back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting much more from this movie. I'm polish so the holocaust subject is quite familiar for me, but after first CD I felt a little bit bored. I was missing some spectacular war scenes... Comparing to Pianist or Schindler's list this one is terrible. There are much better titles out there. Before I watched it I heard some rumors of how spectacular this movie spouse to be but it's not :( My proposition for you readers of this is that you can save your money and watch it at home, than you won't be disappointed. I'm sure the movie will be intoduced as a big historical production with Daniel Craig but once more this movie is a no go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie at a special screening the other day and I was really disappointed by Edward Zwick's effort, the man who had directed classics like The Last Samurai, Glory and Legends of the Fall. The movie is based on a played out genre about surviving the atrocities of the Second World War with often annoying weeping violins being heard in the background in every emotionally charged scene. The direction was below par something that you would not expect from a man of Zwick's background. The acting including Daniel Craig's was a big disappointing to say the least. Although the movie claims to be based on a true story the plot was far fetched often lacking historical accuracies. The script was devoid of substance and continuity. All in all Zwick's effort to remind movie goers of the Jewish suffering fails miserably. One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Thank God I didn't pay for the ticket! 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to a preview screening last night, and admittedly rather overdid the free booze, but found myself slightly disappointed by the film. Bits of it were beautifully shot, but not all, and overall I found that it was all rather diluted. But the story was rather glossed over, and I found myself not really caring all that much about the characters. However, it was well acted. Daniel Craig's accent only slipped a couple of times. I have to say that I find Zwick's films usually well made but too didactic but this one had little or no message. Maybe I need to mull it over a bit more. Parts of it were certainly moving, and there were people in tears around me, but it lacked the gritty uncomfortable realism of Schindler's List, and was all tied up a little too easily. The script is pretty good, but you do not get a real sense of suffering or fear of the Jews being forced to hide out in the woods for all that time. Worth watching, but not amazing. Ho hum. Maybe I expect too much from these things. I should get some more coffee.</fullReview>
