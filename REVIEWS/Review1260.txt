		<fullReview>I have to say I would probably not call myself one of these. i have seen some "Game of Thrones", but it's never appealed to me as much as some of my favorite current shows. This one here is basically a collection of 7 snippets, each 100-150 seconds long, in which the actors from the show tell us a bit about the characters. It's nice that always the actor who plays the characters get something to say. However, there is really nothing too deep about these comments. It's not particularly under the surface and everybody who enjoys the show will probably already know anyway what they are telling. Nonetheless, it's a solid little collection and there are some nice scenes featured too, some scenes that are most telling when it comes to summarizing certain characters. I recommend it to fans of the show, but they have bought the DVD anyway if they watch this one.</fullReview>
