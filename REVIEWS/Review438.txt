		<shortDescription>Entertaining For Kids &amp; Adults .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While trying to bury his acorn, Scrat accidentally activates an abandoned alien ship that takes him into deep space, where he unwittingly sends several asteroids en route to a collision with Earth.Meanwhile, Manny is worried about the upcoming marriage between Peaches and her fiancé, Julian, while Diego and his wife Shira want to start a family but their fierce appearance tend to scare kids, and Sid is dumped by his girlfriend, Francine, just as he is about to propose to her. During Manny and Ellie's wedding anniversary party, some of the asteroids strike the place and the herd barely escape with their lives. Meanwhile, at the underground cavern, Buck returns a dinosaur egg back to its rightful owner after it was stolen from a trio of Dromaeosaurs led by their father Gavin, only to discover an ancient stone pillar, which he takes to the surface, where he meets Manny and the others.Buck explains to the herd that according to the pillar, the asteroids had caused several extinctions in the past and with a massive one still incoming, he claims that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones, as according to its engravings, they always fall at the same place. However, the three Dromaeosaurs, having listened their conversation, decide to stop them, believing that they could be safe from the impact, as they can fly, thus not only getting their revenge on Buck, but also killing all mammals and securing domination over Earth for their species.As the herd travels to the crash site, they discover that the asteroids have electro-magnetic properties, thus if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit, they could attract the main asteroid as well and prevent it from falling on Earth. After facing several obstacles and the interference of the Dromaeosaurs, the herd arrives at "Geotopia", a community of animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago, where Sid meets Brooke, a female ground sloth who falls in love with him. However, Shangri Llama, the leader of Geotopia, refuses to cooperate with Buck's plan to send the city's crystals into space in order to prevent the imminent impact, as they are the key to the residents' longevity, until Sid unwillingly destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the stones to present Brooke with, making all the Geotopians grow old up to their real ages, including Brooke herself.Once Brooke convinces the Geotopians that preventing the asteroid's fall is more important than their lost youth, they and the herd help with Buck's plan, which is to fill up a geyser with the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away, but the Dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene, until one of them, realizing that they will not survive as well if the asteroid falls, convinces the others to also help. The plan works, and the asteroid is pulled back into space. The herd then departs back home, including Sid, who parts ways from Brooke, but just after they leave, an asteroid piece falls inside a hot spring, giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Sid's granny, who stayed behind with them regain their youth. After the herd returns, Peaches and Julian celebrate their wedding, Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before, and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid.In the film's epilogue, Scrat keeps struggling to control the alien ship until it crashes on Mars, destroying all life on the planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My youngest would watch a movie so many times you would start to quote it in your sleep. But when the film is as great at the Ice Age movies, you don't mind. I was concerned that this one could not be as hilarious as the others and I am so glad I was worried for nothing. Until now "Dawn of the Dinosaurs" was our family's go to Ice Age movie, but this one is even better... and I didn't think that was possible. In addition to having lots of silly laughs for the kids, there is a ton of great humor - great clean humor - just for adult belly laughs. And an actual plot, which some kids movies tend to forget. It has such a strong, positive, family message. Every member of our family agrees that this is one to own, each of us for different reasons. So here is a huge thumbs up from our gang, ages 7 to 42.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fifth Ice Age installment to come out in theatres, Blue Sky Studios has once again made me love this franchise. After the cute yet sometimes cringe-worthy Secret Life Of Pets and the good yet slightly overrated Finding Dory, I was expecting another typical average everyday kids movie, but what I got was a really funny family flick full of laughs for all ages. The whole theater was in stitches from how much they were laughing and giggling! The animation is amazing, from the photorealistic textures of the animals to the colorful backgrounds full of purplish vibe, and it makes great use of 3D effects, with countless gimmicks being thrown towards the audience and a fantastic sense of space in almost every shot of the movie. The voice actors are all energetic and they fit their characters perfectly, with Simon Pegg and Chris Wedge's priceless comedic performances. Overall, Ice Age: Collision Course is the only animated film worth seeing this year other than Zootopia, with everything you could possibly want from an animated family comedy. And by the way- Scrat is again the most hilarious portion of an already hilarious film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie but no more sequels please.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched the movie today.The movie is quite emotional at the ending and the jokes are pretty funny that makes me laughed out loud. However, I was shocked by the box office and the critical response of the movie.The movie had already in cinemas for a week but only grossed for 200 million dollars, and the critical response is quite negative, the movie have only scored 'B+' from the 'A+' to 'F' scale, according to Wikipedia. It is proof that the audiences have already get bored from the series as they thought that the movie makers of this series are only wanted to make more money so that they just keep on making more sequels of the movie.Until then, they have been made of total four sequels in fourteen years. I personally not a very big fan of the animation movies, but Ice Age is one of my favorite movie of all time and me childhood for unknown reason. But starting from Ice Age : Continental Drift, I felt that the series is starting to off course that it just like to make a massive money grab, which I am not very appreciate. But however, Ice Age : Collision Course gave the series a come back-to-life chance, the movie is hilarious and have some touching scenes that with a lot of ups and downs in it.This movie would sure make you have a great day at the cinema. But also, I hope that there won't be more sequels after Ice Age : Collision Course in the future. Otherwise, the critical response would be even more worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Conclusion To The Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, after Ice Age:Continental Drift 4 years ago, i thought they would end it there because that by far was the best one. When i discovered they were making a new one, i was unsure about it. How times have changed.Its great to see Manny and Ellie trying to stop Peaches and her new boyfriend from leaving them, whilst Sid tries to find true love after 15 years of trying. Diego and Shira are trying to settle in after thinking how scary they are. And Scrat is just Scrat, doing all sort nonsense like destroying life on Mars, nearly ending the world and a lot more. But I was extremely pleased to hear that Buck, who has not been seen since Dawn of the Dinosaurs, was back and better than ever. Sadly Louis, played by Josh Gad, didn't return. R.I.P.Still thanks to the new recruits such as Adam Devine as Julian and Jessie J as Sids long-lost love Brooke, I got to see a massive treat. Lots of humour and too good to be real, thank you for ending in style Ice Age producers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't too impressed by the trailer, but I'm a sucker for 3D animation, so I went anyway. I'm glad I did because this is a fun, funny movie which had the audience laughing out loud in places. The plot is exciting as our gang makes its way towards the place where the asteroid is to strike, in a bid to ward it off. Simon Pegg playing the weasel, who leads the pack, is really good. His British accent somehow suited the character! The sloth has a major role this time and is totally engaging. The animation is excellent, making full use of the 3D effects, which is nice, since that's the reason I went to the cinema to see it in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin this review, let me state that I have IBS. For those of you who do not know, IBS stands for Irritable bowel syndrome. This diagnosis causes me to have very impulsive, and often inexcusable bathroom troubles.On to the review. I have to just say, wow. Ice Age: Collision Course, being the 5th installment of this animated franchise, is still as good as it gets while Blue Sky has a say in it. Sure, some people may say that the last thing a franchise does is launch its characters into space before its torn apart, but Blue Sky has once again found a way to picture its beloved Cg characters in a fresh, and beautiful light.The animation was as beautiful as ever, the fur seems to be better facilitated- simulated and cached with each film, and of course, being in space, Blue Sky had the opportunity to take its effect simulations to outside of the planet, itself.The work that Blue Sky put into this film, in my opinion, may have even been too beautiful. I got a bit too excited and had to run to the bathroom about 2/3 into the animation, causing me to miss a pivotal moment. If there was one problem with my experience watching the new Ice Age, its that I had to watch it with Irritable Bowel Syndrome.-Henry</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome back, Buck! Fun, heartwarming adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This series is a firm favourite, due to its lovable characters, great animation and sense of fun. Simon Pegg makes a welcome return as the swashbuckling Buck, stealing every scene he's in. Scrat has new misadventures in space; while the Herd race against time to save the Earth. There are new villains and love interests introduced, plus other creatures, but the film never feels overcrowded. (Unlike in The Pirate Adventure.) Diego is left on the sidelines, but will hopefully have a bigger role if they make a 6th instalment. I love the humour and the heartwarming moments. Perhaps the next step is to re-introduce Roshan (the baby from the original).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Funny Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really improved on the previous one. It set a great bar for the humour for the foremost, as me and the audience I was with were rolling around in laughter. And that's what really made the movie for me. It was just hilarious. The characters were still as memorable and funny as ever, the new additions were a delight and the crazy plot made it all the more perfect popcorn flick. I especially think young children ages 5 to 10 will love it, and you'd have to be a complete grump not to get even one laugh from the film when they're throwing jokes out left, right and center. Truly just a fun film. Left me feeling happy and exhilarated after the watch. I won't give any spoilers, just know this film had a much more complex plot than all the previous with many different story lines going on at once. I also think each character got the chance to shine in this one, which had been lacking in the previous two installments. But comedy wise, I actually think this could be smarter and funnier in it's humour to Secret Life Of Pets, which was really funny too- but more sight gags. Take your kids to see it if you want a fun film to pass the time, and remember to make a collision at the cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very funny and entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's one of the funniest animated movie that i've ever watched.I was laughing throughout the whole movie.Scrat was the most cute and likable character who did the most comedy once again. He was still on hunt to hold onto his beloved acorn and while doing so he almost destroys the whole world. Space adventures of scrat were just hilariously funny. Sid was still in search for his true love while ellie and manny were having family issues with her daughter and her boyfriend.Buck again appears in this sequeal which was really a surprise element.I'd rate it as the best sequel of the ice age. I was worried that this one could not be as hilarious as others were but after watching it i am so glad that i was worried for nothing. The 3d effects were awesome as one could expect from blue sky. Since that the only reason i went cinema to watch it and it was really worth the money. I'd strongly recommend this movie to all animated movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . created when the genii it has conjured to Rule the Free World, America's President-Elect Trump, spent all his National Convention time prattling about Doom and Gloom, forgetting to outline any Practical Solutions to the Apocalyptic Picture that he painted. Fox's ICE AGE: COLLISION COURSE neatly plugs this hole in planning out the World's Future. When the Convention ended Thursday night, the World wondered HOW the U.S. could fix its infrastructure, solve Global Warming, cure Zika, pay Social Security and Medicare to hordes of aging Baby Boomers, increase Military spending, finance a Great Wall of Canada to balance the one that Mexico's paying for in order to avoid Continental Imbalance\Fracturing, help poor Americans to defend themselves with government-provided Gun Stamps, put people on Mars, get doctors to do for free what ObamaCare is doing, and keep China in its place. Fortunately, on Friday COLLISION COURSE showed us that the Trumpsters will accomplish all of this and more through Magic Crystals, Unicorns, and Fountains of Youth. After seeing COLLISION COURSE, I feel that all of us can rest easy now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK sequel. Very Standard, everything you love about Ice Age, if you love it. (and nothing more).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we go again! Milking everything you got out of a franchise. They say this is the final chapter of Ice Age, but we'll see how much money it makes to be sure.Nothing overly imaginative about the film as the tribe attempt to survive a big rock about to hit Earth.It was filled with good jokes that made me laugh hard throughout. It better with comedians like Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary and Simon Pegg, voicing the main charters. Although, four sequels made for too many main characters for any of the all-star cast to fully shine .The animation was good, but nothing new stood out (I hear it only takes eight mouths to do these movies)but I really like the character design. Plus it's worth seeing for some great 3D images.But the film works best if you are a huge fan of the ones before it(especially if your a fan of Scat, the saber tooth squirrel who has particularly created the entire universe in an effort to get that nut) . Without having that connection, it's a bit bland.http://cinemagardens.com/?p=78</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and laughs for the kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ice Age: Collision Course is the fifth instalment in one of the longest animated franchises of all time. Kids will definitely enjoy this humour-filled film, but the adults will be less amused by the stereotypical animated comedy. It's not perfect, but it's definitely a great end to the Ice Age series.There's no way to start an Ice Age film without our favourite squirrel, Scrat. In his attempts to hide his acorn, he ends up in a flying saucer and then space, setting off a chain of events that send an asteroid hurtling towards Earth.On Earth, each character is having a host of problems, a tradition to the start of every Ice Age movie. Of course, all these petty matters are turned awry when a meteor shower comes pouring down from the heavens. But that's just the beginning; a huge asteroid as big as the one that wiped out the dinosaurs is speeding towards the planet.And so starts off a series of events in the gang's quest to somehow stop the huge asteroid from colliding with Earth and wiping out life as we know it. The return of Buck from Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was a great choice. As he did in Ice Age 3, he's back at the front of the pack leading the way to stopping the asteroid. His lunatics and plain insanity are funny, bound to garner laughs from everyone.The antagonists of this story, a trio of flying dinosaurs, are fairly weak in their influence and overall ''scariness''. While they are a little threatening in the short amount of screen time they receive, they lack a certain menacing feel to them, only supported by how quickly they turn to the ''good side'' by the end. Considering how good a job was done on making Captain Gutt, from Ice Age 4: Continental Drift, scary, this trio could have done with some work.The story of Sid falling in love with Brooke, a new character, is also fairly abysmal, more so than that of Diego and Shira in the previous movie. It's unrealistic; they propose for marriage only after 12 minutes! Clearly this hastiness is part of the joke, but this is still an evident attempt by the writers to cram more into the film. Even so, it's great to see Sid find the love of his life...finally!The Shangri Llama, which featured in the trailer, falls completely flat, barely making any screen time in the film. He's supposedly meant to save the entire pack from the asteroid. But when he does make an appearance, he's a whingey, demanding character that if anything does a better job at antagonising than the three dinosaurs.One of the more obvious underlying themes of the story features Manny and his typical over-protectiveness over Peaches, who has just gotten engaged with her fiancé Julian, another new character. The morals of trust are explored, even if a little too quickly, between Manny and his to-be son-in-law Julian, along with faith between Manny and Ellie, and their daughter Peaches.The biggest (and possibly only) improvement on Ice Age 1 is the high quality animation, which is obviously a given considering the 15-year gap between the films.Starting off with 3 main protagonists in Ice Age 1, this film now has almost ten. This brings with it less screen time for some characters. As was the case with the antagonists and the Shangri Llama, Diego saw barely any time in the limelight. The writers attempt to create a story of how Diego, alongside Shira, want to have children but can't due to how scary they appear to kids, but again this story completely dissolves away.Perhaps this is the biggest problem with Ice Age 5; there's quite a lot going on. It's not that it is hard to follow, more so that not enough time can be spent exploring the most important themes, which is partially the problem in all the other Ice Age sequels. Ice Age 1 found this delicate balance, however with the addition of so many characters since, this clearly became difficult.Ice Age 5 is a film the entire family can enjoy, but it's definitely more suited towards the younger children. This film is not perfect, not even close to reaching the quality of Pixar films, but considering it is the 4th sequel that's understandable. In the end, it's just another Ice Age movie, and you're bound to enjoy this one if you've enjoyed any of the other sequels. It has humour, romance and moralistic themes, and is a film that's enough to entertain the family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining but unnecessary sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ice Age: Collision Course continues with the adventures of Manny(Ray Romano), Diego(Denis Leary) &amp; Sid(John Leguizamo). When Earth is about to be bombarded by a meteor shower, it is up to Manny, Diego, Sid &amp; the rest of the herd, to save themselves &amp; prevent the end of the world. They take the help of their old friend, Buck(Simon Pegg). Ice Age: Collision Course is a fun film. Kids will love it. However, adults will only find it mildly entertaining. Personally, I feel that the Ice Age franchise should have ended with the fourth movie. Ice Age(2002), Ice Age: The Meltdown(2006), Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs(2009) &amp; Ice Age: Continental Drift(2012) are all great movies. Ice Age: Continental Drift(2012) has a perfect ending &amp; there was absolutely no need to make further sequels. Blue Sky Studios decided to make one more Ice Age movie. This film is not boring at all. However, I am a fan of the Ice Age movies and, I am slightly disappointed with this film. There is not as much humor in this movie, as there is in previous installments. There are funny scenes but, there are not as many of them, as I would have liked. There are a slew of new characters. Some of them are welcome additions but, some of them are not. Due to the fact that there are too many characters, some of our favorite characters get sidelined. These are the movie's flaws. The animation is great. The 3D is impressive. The voice acting is amazing. Ray Romano is awesome as Manny. John Leguizamo is outstanding as Sid. Denis Leary is brilliant as Diego. Simon Pegg is spectacular as Buck. Queen Latifah is good as Ellie. Keke Palmer is superb as Peaches. Adam Devine is endearing as Julian. Wanda Sykes is hilarious as Granny. Seann William Scott &amp; Josh Peck are funny as Crash &amp; Eddie, respectively. Nick Offerman, Max Greenfield &amp; Stephanie Beatriz are adequate as Gavin, Roger &amp; Gertie, respectively. Jennifer Lopez is effective as Shira. Jesse Tyler Ferguson &amp; Jessie J are impressive as Shangri Llama &amp; Brooke, respectively. Chris Wedge is hysterical as Scrat. Ice Age: Collision Course is worth a watch. However, watch it with low expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT!!!!The buds are back in town! Woo Ho, the gangs all here, Romano, Latifah, Leary, Leguizamo, even that annoying little rat guy. So the story is, our bros are out stuck taking a collision course in school. The ice bros all neglect class when Sid finds a turtle eating it's own feces, and bets the others he won't lick it. Ray Romano goes to class and learns all about the dangers of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases. Al Gore has a surprise role as Professor Snail Gore, which is Al Gore green screened into the movie wearing a snail themed shirt. he and Leary the cat thing get into a HUGE scuffle and Leary ends up ending Gore's life. In order to do right in the universe, the gang gets in a time machine and each wear a costume made out of Gore's skin, to appear as him for presidential duties in the 90's. Then its pretty great how it ties together when Romano the mammoth spreads his knowledge and eventually reveals his identity as Actor Ray Romano doing voice over for an animated movie. "I got a pretty fat paycheck actually, It's no Pixar but, what're you gonna do, right?" It was a truly splendid affair. every cast member was great. Sid did a funny thing when he almost smothers the infant trying to get a free Nutter-butter candy. and the rat guy, he p's me off. get the dang nut you dope. quit wasting my damn time. all in all great, would love an "exterminated" cut where they remove the rat scenes, make me sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ice Age: Collision Course" is surprisingly entertaining ? especially for the fifth installment in the franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the release of Blue Sky Studios' "Ice Age: Collision Course" (PG, 1:34), the "Ice Age" series of movies has become the 13th highest grossing film franchise to date and, as IMDb.com tells it, "the first computer animated theatrical franchise to feature five installments." A closer look reveals some even more interesting facts about the franchise. Each of the previous four films got equal or lower ratings as compared to the previous film (according to Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and CinemaScore), but each earned MORE money than its predecessor (except for the fourth one, in regards to North America). The films get ideas from each other (with the third and fifth inspired by the museum scene in the first) and also spawn spin-off short films (two of which became Oscar nominees) and television specials.Beyond all that, over the 14 years between the first film (2002's "Ice Age") and this fifth installment in 2016, directors have come and gone (with some overlap), with the core voice cast remaining remarkably consistent, while each film also added new characters. The original movie's four main voice actors (Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary and Chris Wedge) have appeared in all five films, three others (Queen Latifah, Seann William Scott and Josh Peck) have appeared in all but the first film and over 30 voice actors (with many big names in the mix) worked on either one or two of these movies. Putting it another way, "Ice Age: Collision Course" features seven actors who have voiced characters in four or all five of the "Ice Age" movies and four others are back for seconds ? and what a talented cast they form! "Ice Age: Collision Course" takes place four years after the action in the previous film ? the same amount of time between the release of the films ? just like the actual time and story time gaps between all the "Ice Age" films. As the fifth edition opens, the cute, accident-prone, acorn-loving saber tooth squirrel, Scrat (Wedge), finds a flying saucer encased in ice, but accidentally (in pursuit of that acorn, of course), breaks the ship free and flies it into outer space ? with disastrous results for our solar system (as you may have seen in the animated short "Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe" which preceded 2015's theatrical showings of "The Peanuts Movie"). Scrat's misadventures in space inadvertently send a large asteroid hurtling towards earth, unbeknownst to the relatively carefree prehistoric mammals living below.The Herd (as the main characters in the franchise are called) are, for the moment, all oblivious to their impending doom and doing their best to live their lives as happily as possible. Peaches (Keke Palmer), the daughter of wooly mammoths Manny and Ellie (Romano and Latifah), is making plans for her marriage to fellow mammoth Julian (Adam DeVine). Manny is having a hard time warming up to the eager-to-please Julian (who calls his future father-in-law "Dad Bro") and both Manny and Ellie are struggling with the idea of "losing" their only child. It also happens to be Manny and Ellie's anniversary and Manny (who has forgotten) allows Ellie to believe that a well-timed meteor shower is his gift to her.That celestial event, however, turns out to be the opening salvo in what could mean the extinction of all life on earth. The resourceful and smarter-than-he-looks one-eyed weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg) discovers and interprets an ancient prophecy carved in stone which reveals that a huge asteroid is coming ? and what previous asteroids have done to the earth. With the help of an even smarter weasel named Neil deBuck Weasel (Neil deGrasse Tyson), Buck hatches a plan that might actually save the world, but he's going to need the help of the rest of The Herd. Besides Manny and his family, others that get involved include saber tooth tiger couple Diego (Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez), lisping lovelorn ground sloth Sid (Leguizamo) and even the irreverent comical opossums Crash &amp; Eddie (Scott and Peck).As they work to carry out their mission, The Herd makes new friends ? and new enemies. Living at the location where Buck says the big asteroid is going to strike is a hippy community that includes a pretty sloth named Brooke (Jesse J), a fearless rabbit called Teddy (Michael Strahan) and a pair of "minicorns" named Bubbles and Misty (Lilly Singh), all of whom are led by a self-centered guru called Shangri Llama (Jesse Tyler Ferguson). Meanwhile, three flying dinosaurs (Nick Offerman, Stephanie Beatriz and Max Greenfield) don't think it's such a bad thing for all the mammals to perish (thinking that the dinosaurs will be able to simply soar above the destruction)? and Scrat is still in space? chasing that acorn."Ice Age: Collision Course" is surprisingly entertaining ? especially for the fifth installment in the franchise. The animation takes full advantage of the latest CGI technology and it looks great (although I'm not sure that it's worth it to pay extra for the 3D glasses). The returning characters feel as fresh as ever and the new characters blend in beautifully with The Herd ? not to mention that the voice cast may be one of the best assembled for a single animated feature. What's more, this movie actually has a plot! The film's story, themes, script and jokes are likely to entertain kids and adults alike. "Ice Age: Collision Course" is very amusing ? and fun for the whole family! "A-"</fullReview>

(8/10)The news characters are so cool and relax like Julian, Brooke and Shangri-Llama. The dinos birds family, adorable and nice like roger , funny and a little creepy like Gertie and Gavin. The returning character buck was very good but he must to makes a lots hilarious things in this film. (8/10)The music soundtracks composed by John Debney the jungle book's composer his work is super not prodigious but super. (7/10).The humor, was good but not enough hilarious like in Ice Age 3 by examples (7/10).anyway it was a very good film animation not super but a very good. ^^ thank you for your work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Collision of Kiddy Fun and Bland Plots:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels, sequels, sequels! It seems that the only thing that Hollywood wants to make is a sequel these days, at least in the animation world. And what franchise is a better example of this than Ice Age. Years ago, the idiotic animal cast warmed our hearts with an adventure that was fun, funny, and cute. Over a decade later, the adventure still continues, but it has now crossed over into the ridiculous zone (especially with the last movie Continental Drift). Nevertheless, we have the fifth installment dropped onto our laps and yours truly is back into the theater to give you some insight. Let's get started.The GOOD ? Same cute feeling to it ? Voice Acting is just as good as always ? Science behind the magic ? Return of BuckNo surprise, Ice Age remains cute to appeal to the target audience of families. Manny (Ray Romano) and his crew continue to stumble, bash, and insult each other in a manner that is kid friendly and semi-entertaining. Your little ones will be laughing in high-pitched delight as Sid is smacked, Scrat is consistently punished, and insults fly through the air in some ridiculous screaming manner. Yep despite the new gags, it certainly feels like an Ice Age Movie. And when the comedy dries down to a trickle, there are those touching moments, well there are those heart warming, morale filled sequences that will make you say Awwwww. While the dialogue and storyboard have certainly set the groundwork for the silliness, it is the voice acting that brings it to life. For this reviewer, John Leguizamo (Sid) was my leading voice as he delivers consistently stupidity and forlorn through the movie. Ray Romano's sarcasm and timing help support this, but Manny's role has been reduced ever since the birth of his daughter. As for the rest of the cast, well they do their parts justice, despite the limited characters they play, but not enough to call props on (more on that later). The exception to this is Neil deGrasse Tyson (Buck). Once more Tyson brings energy, whit and well-timed delivery that we loved in the third installment. Buck is just as chaotic as you remember, which often leads to action and genius wrapping into a product that continues to be impressive. And in this installment, Buck brings a lot of scientific principal, some realistic and others purely a stretch of imagination, that can at least stimulate some thoughts. It's an engaging character one I hope to see in the inevitable sequel to come. The BAD: ? The characters are not balanced ? Crossed into kiddie zone way too much ? Rushed story with pointless bad guysThe biggest thing I had an issue with, was how disproportionate the characters were in this movie. It's no surprise that as the cast continues to expand, there is less time for each character to make a worthy contribution. Ice Age has officially hit that road focusing again on the Mammoths and Scrat and forgoing most of the other characters. Sure Sid and Buck get their fair share, but the other characters are reduced to only a few lines of dialogue and nothing more (I'm talking about your character Jennifer Lopez). Such unbalanced character emphasis is a flaw for me and like many of the characters we need to move on from them rather than pointlessly include them. As mentioned earlier, the movie is family fun, but each installment continues to go deeper into the kiddie pool. Crash and Eddy have been reduced to very stupid humor that involves mindless banter and getting into fights. Manny's filter has been set to full power as his adult jokes have been reduced to just straight up bitterness. Even Sid has managed to dumb down his comedy so that is kid friendly. Wanda Sykes' edge that we got in the fourth film had flare and sassiness, but they limited that role so much in this installment. Therefore, the adult spectacle of the first Ice Age continues to be lost with each continued sequel. Finally, we address the villains of the movie. The new cast members in the film have great voice work, when they are actually on the screen. However, the raptor birds of this movie have little danger, edge, or even threat compared to the natural disaster careening towards Earth. In the first few movies, the villains that were hunting our crew had bite, edge, and terror. These villains were just sad, and another medium for comedic ploys. Throw in a rather rushed and blunt tale with a hastily concluded ending and you only get further lack of suspense. The VERDICTIce Age: Collision Course is certainly continuing the trend we've seen in the series. While it is certainly kiddie, it is still somewhat entertaining and funny, and not the worst of the five movies. However, it still is not anything like the first Ice Age and the studio should think about dropping it to Netflix for the future instead of polling it in theaters. Therefore you can guess it probably isn't worth a trip to the theater, and certainly not in 3-D. As a result, my scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 6.5-7.0 Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Collision Course" Exceeds The Low Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The prehistoric animals most successful in the animation films return to the movie theaters for fifth time, now, the end of the world is their great concern."Collision Course" is titled the last adventure of the franchise most recalcitrant in the animated world - with reference to revenue at the box office -. What started as a emotional and poignant incident more than one decade ago, has evolved admirably, but not always with satisfactory results. The fifth installment opens with a shameful but entertaining prologue focused on the endless mishaps that suffer our saber-toothed squirrel, Scrat (Chris Wedge), mishaps that leading him to outer space, seemingly, a safe place, however, Scrat continues his battle causing a chaotic clash of worlds, projecting millions of purple meteors to planet Earth, endangering the life of all animals.Indisputably, Scrat is Blue Sky's emblem, what is Buzz Lightyear or Nemo for Pixar. Regardless of the frequency of his appearances, he always maintains his crazy and stimulating essence in each act, and without him, it would not be possible more films in the saga. Screenwriters and writers have discovered the rough gem that was hidden since 2002, a small and irritating animal, focusing on each plot twist as a consequence of the facts carried out by the squirrel, one point in favor. "Ice Age" still has future and even with Pixar ("Finding Dory") and Illumination ("The Secret Life of Pets") on the look-out, Many, Diego and Sid have high possibilities to continue with the winning streak at the box office, at least, that seems.The fate of prehistoric mammals has been relatively good, and it seems that everyone (with exceptions) live in pairs. Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) face the rapid maturity of their daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer), who is in a kind of relationship with Julian (Adam Devine). A sub-plot anything original and very predictable, since Julian did not get along with Manny, but yes he got along with others, unleashing the envy and jealous of the mammoth, and if there is someone so naive, it has a happy ending. Nothing new!. Diego (Denis Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez), the saber-tooth tigers, get supporting roles and their characteristics fades for a moment, besides, the screenwriters give clues of a possible litter between these two tigers in one scene, something that continues leading it astray. They should perhaps rethink the spin-offs about a character in specific, for not to damage to generational characters. Sid (John Leguizamo) is still in an emotional imbalance, something by what we love him, much of the comedy is centered in this cute animal that will continue producing loud laughs for the rest of our lives. The opossums, Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) remain comical objects used for the humor of the film. Buck (Simon Pegg), the star of "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs" is infuriating, cumbersome and rough, his jokes and eccentricities did not entertain children nor adults, a character who has to be eliminated immediately. Despite this, he's who predicts the catastrophe, and he's who attracts new, humiliating and poor villains, more filler unnecessary to the story.With the seriousness of a cataclysm and so witty characters, Mike Thurmeier and Galen T. Chu recreate a balance between comedy and drama, unbalancing briefly because of Buck. It still is space for moments unique and even memorable, but in a epoch in where is difficult find interesting proposals, "Collision Course" comes off well rid, despite its reused plot. The teachings are also present, the acceptance of a father to the maturity of his daughter, a young's independence, over-protection errors and family work are some of the lessons that the movie wants to assert.Soundscapes doesn't reach the visual spectacle that has been regenerated with the passing years, however, it achieves the ambitions proposed. Purple's tonality of the shooting stars , the textures of reptiles and mammals, effects in the sky, the brightness of Geotopia and more details open a privileged place to position itself as a nice addition to the animated world. New characters are insufficient and none manages to deliver what they promised, so it leaves on a slope to the likely next sequel. We want to continue to seeing what it is capable of providing that ice age that once shook us, those mammals, who still do not deserve to die out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could this be the last Ice Age movie ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I went to see this(the preview) in the cinemas as I have seen all 4 of the previous films,and since I am a huge animated buff I treated my younger brother to it and my mom who likes some animated films. Ice Age: Collision Course is the 5th installment(and maybe the final Ice Age film of the series who knows right)and this time Scratty the squirrel is up in space trying to get the acorn(once again)causing a meteor strike to arrive on Earth,causing mayhem for Mammy and his gang. They later team up with Buck(from Ice Age 3)and they stumble across the meteor which is magnetic,and they meet up with some engaging characters that are centuries old(one voiced by English singer Jessie J)who becomes a so called love interest to Sid. So will Mammy and the gang be able to save their place from destruction.Bottom line this was a pretty decent animated film. I was amazed how far the series has reached as the first two the animated was terrible and then the next few the animation got better. If you ask me I think this was a total cash cow in for Blue Sky Studios,it was unnecessary to release yet another Ice Age movie and who knows there might be another one coming in the next 7 odd years mark my words.Overall I thought it was good and my family all enjoyed it which was the main thing.7/10C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so I will be honest. Ice Age Collision Course wasn't really needed, and we could have lived without it, unless we were driving on a stupendous plane that would have thrilled us beyond limit like Pixar movies generally do. Despite the apparent, Ice Age: Collision Course still manages to pull it off, owing to their awesome sense of snappy humour and their fascinating CGI that makes everything appear stunning.PLOT OF ICE AGE COLLISION COURSE Ice Age Collision Course comes with a very banal plot. The implausibility of Ice Age keeps on degrading as we caper towards exploring new parts of the franchise. Maybe Blue Sky Studios have been milking its installments too much, so much that they are actually running out of material. No doubt there is always humour galore in their work, but at one point it becomes kind of pointless when there is nothing in their baggage and they still try to squeeze every bit to make jokes out of thin air.The plot of Ice Age Collision Course is something as dumb as Scrat messing around with the universe. That's what he does. He keeps showing up throughout the movie to accidentally mess with the fate of the planet. Things that avalanche therefrom aren't exactly what we were expecting. It toys with everything ? the story-line, the credibility, jokes, everything! BEST BITS TO REMEMBER Remember Buck? Well, the awesome weasel is here as well, and he is probably one of the best things about the movie. Simon Pegg returns to voice the one-eyed chap who will take you on a joyride to saving the planet. He is just the way we left him in the prequels. Totally loco! A side plot of Julian?Peaches story was an impending steer, which was quite thoughtful. It tried to give the story a perspective and a good direction. Granny returns once again with her incessant nagging which never bores you. Oh and we should never forget the true antihero of Ice Age franchise, Scrat who always brings hilarity to no matter what he does.THE FINAL VERDICT I say the humour is way better than what the Angry Birds movie came up with. If you liked that you are definitely going to love this. If you didn't, well, you are still going to like Ice Age Collision Course for its magnificent animation and rib-tickling humour.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll Ice You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ice Age: Collision Course is a good film with excellent animation, laugh-out-loud comedy and includes all your fun and favorite characters from the past movies. The film follows Manny (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), Diego (Denis Leary) and the rest of the Ice Age gang as they must divert an asteroid from flinging them into a new age called extinction. My favorite character in Ice Age: Collision Course is Scrat (Chris Wedge) who started out as a small character in the first Ice Age film and slowly became a fan favorite and the mascot of the franchise. Scrat lights up the screen every scene he is in. His brand of slapstick humor is more present here than in any other Ice Age film. I even kind of sympathize with this character because he goes through all this trouble just for an acorn. Another character I like is Buck. Simon Pegg's talent really shines in his voice over work here. Buck has a big personality and, just like Scrat, has some of the movie's most memorable laughs. He is in a lot of my favorite sequences. My favorite part of this film is when Buck tries to find a strategy to save the mammals from disaster. He seeks help from personalities in his mind including Neil deBuck Weasel. I'm a big fan of a television show Neil deGrasse Tyson did called Cosmos, so it was funny to see his foray into voice acting. This movie is a pleasant surprise considering this is the fifth film in the franchise. I thought by now the series had run dry, but this one excels on several fronts in terms of how it looks and how much it will make you laugh. I recommend you see this in 3D. It was cool seeing asteroids barreling towards me. The effects are very polished. The computer animation in this film excels and mixes lush backgrounds with great character design. The film has good comedy, most of the time. There are one or two scenes in this film that take the joke one step too far or where it is just plain gross. I give Ice Age: Collision Course an age rating of 5 to 18 because of some crude humor and sequences that could be scary to younger viewers. I give Ice Age: Collision Course 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Convoluted, cheesy, but there is just enough there for fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a cash grab, of that there is little doubt. Blue Sky Studios knows that they have a recognizable franchise, and in and effort to build off of a base that is accustomed to familiar characters, they have produced the weakest Ice Age film yet.The plot, while involving a litany of details and characters is quite simple. A meteor is plummeting towards earth and the characters must find a way to divert its trajectory. There is just enough for fans of the series to enjoy. Sid will still invoke a laugh because of his haplessness, there are some comical slapstick scenes, a good one- liner or two, and Scrat's insanity is energetic and comical. Furthermore, the reintroduction of Simon Pegg's un- hinged, yet hilarious, Buck is fun (the Dawn of the Dinosaurs was the second best Ice Age in my opinion).However, the plot, involving another trek, and the messages, while positive, are lacking the same heart and character of the past. The dichotomy between the original and this film is staggering. The animation is great, but the amount of characters this franchise now has, the array of plot devices, and the extremes that drive the narrative have weakened it to the point that this must be the last movie or else all self-respect for this franchise is utterly gone.Kids will love it, older kids and even adults that have enjoyed the adventures of these characters will find some scenes that are reminiscent of earlier movies. Yet, this film is mediocre at best and if someone never cared for Ice Age this movie will by no means make their opinion change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an Ice Age movie so keep your thinking process suspended for 1 and a half hours and you won't regret watching it. With every one of these installments, the characters get ridiculously humanized and the plot stupendously contrived. But even when such silliness comes all together, it certainly gives out some very funny moments for you and your family to enjoy. I have to say this again, the plot is extremely stupid! The CGI is amazing, the 3D does pay off and it sure will make your kids get high on colors. My favorite part was the scene with Neil DeGrasse Tyson and the Cosmos parody. And I'm sure you'll also enjoy the Scrat jokes a lot.But honestly, we've had enough, no more sequels....please!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roughly thirteen years on since the first Ice Age was released and the gang are still going strong. Manny, Sid and Diego, this one being the fifth in the feature length series and the longest, by only a few minutes. Supposedly the final in the franchise we see an expected happy ending instead of total extinction. It's the full film extension of Blue Sky Studio's short, Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe which was released last year, obviously starring Ice Age favourite Scrat, who intergalactically haphazardly arranges the planets in imaginative fashion whilst inadvertently thrusting an asteroid towards the Earth threatening all of it's existence, of course, all because of that elusive nut. Simon Pegg's Buck returns for more of a main role, leading the team to save the planet and is highly entertaining, more so than the rest of the pack. The story sidetracks a little more with Manny than Sid and Diego and there's quite a lot that goes on with an assortment of fresh characters including dino-birds and a spiritual spitting llama. There's an underlining message about excepting change and moving on, letting go and growing up which makes way for the subplot of Julian and Francine's relationship. It's seems family and marriage plays an important part of the story but not to the level to become boring of bogged down by it. John Debney composes the score this time round taking over from John Powell who has done quite a lot of animated features, like Rio, Happy Feet, Shrek and How To Train Your Dragon. Nothing really stood out from the score but the soundtrack, using Trevor Rabin's Armageddon theme tune was cheeky and Buck sings a clever twist of what I'm sure is Mozart's Marriage of Figaro. The animation is far superior than when you look back at the first Ice Age in 2002. It's come a long way since then and while I was watching Scrat move planets I was thinking this might be worth the extra to see in 3D. Incredible detail and the action flows superbly, especially Buck's scenes. It's fast paced I believe in hope to not lose the attention of the kids, it has a surefire script where characters literally bounce off one another creating enough comedy for everyone though it lacks the out loud laughter and some Sid silliness falls flat. It's above average, light entertainment for the whole family that is, for some part, visual stunning and fans of the series should enjoy it, but I doubt it'll be a film to end up on my shelf.

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a group of animals who need to work together to avoid a giant meteorite colliding with the Earth, which would cause the extinction of all animals.Just like the other "Ice Age" films, Scrat provides the most fun, but is also in the film the shortest. The plot is simple, but captivating and fun for children. The viewers in the cinema laughed a lot, and people also reacted loads to the rather scary moment when Scrat accidentally activated the hyper gravity in the spaceship which causes a series of accidents. The film is fun and lighthearted throughout. The beautiful world at the end of the film does look very beautiful too!

They say this is the final chapter of Ice Age, but we'll see how much money it makes to be sure.Nothing overly imaginative about the film as the tribe attempt to survive a big rock about to hit Earth.It was filled with good jokes that made me laugh hard throughout. It better with comedians like Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary and Simon Pegg, voicing the main charters. Although, four sequels made for too many main characters for any of the all-star cast to fully shine .The animation was good, but nothing new stood out (I hear it only takes eight mouths to do these movies)but I really like the character design. Plus it's worth seeing for some great 3D images.But the film works best if you are a huge fan of the ones before it(especially if your a fan of Scat, the saber tooth squirrel who has particularly created the entire universe in an effort to get that nut) . Without having that connection, it's a bit bland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that there will be people that will like this, I noticed this, but for me, I kind of wanted more. The story in this movie is pretty generic and cliché, especially impressing and bonding with the Father and a tip that happened earlier pops up. And even though the characters can get annoying, I really like Buck, Crash and Eddie, those characters are the best moments from this movie, Manny, Sid and Diego are really tolerable, but once again we have a guy who's still pretty stupid. The best thing about this movie is the animation, it looks like all the characters are popping with energy and the scenery looks really good, granted there may be a couple of problems especially when they attempt to do grossout, but it's really tolerable. But one issue about this movie is that granted, children may find scenes funny, but parents and adults would find the jokes very juvenile, unfortunately, since that's what animated movies are now, it gets boring at times. So this is just Okay, I have seen MUCH better animated movies, but if you are an Ice Age fan, check it out, you'll get some giggles, but if you want to judge as a movie, just try and have fun, I think that's what it's trying to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Next year, the "Ice Age" franchise will have its 15th anniversary and this year we get the fifth full feature installment to the successful series. Many issues have been dealt with, many new characters have entered the picture, so it was finally time to talk about a subject that was actually defining many many centuries ago: the extinction of animals. They took the path of the meteoroid explanation for this movie. On the one hand, you could say it is fitting because it is such an important subject, on the other you could say it is fairly uncreative that they have to go for the obvious, maybe due to the lack of new ideas. This is especially disappointing as no less than four writers and two directors worked on this movie. You could really expect a better script by such a number of people, but it seems that what they came up with for these 95 minutes here is an example of too many cooks spoiling the broth. The voice actors are the same names that you know from the previous films and new additions include Jesse Tyler Ferguson ("Modern Family") and Nick Offerman ("Parks and Recreation") for example.If you don't think the franchise has jumped the shark with previous film already, then you may think so after watching this fifth. I did not enjoy it. Of course, the meteoroid story could have been so much better because it was such a defining event, but even aside from that core plot idea, it is extremely underwhelming. The mammoth story line is one that, with the father-daughter relationship, is one that never becomes as touching or relevant as it attempts to be. The Sid scenes are never really that funny with his search for a wife. The saber tooth scenes feel completely irrelevant and their arguments about getting a child feels thrown in so randomly only to fill some more screen time. The only character who made smiley occasionally was Sid's grandmother and the worst is the ending indicates that she will not be back for a 6th movie, which means that one could be even more boring and less interesting. Buck is better than most of the rest in here, but also not good enough to make up for all the flaws. I never found Scrat funny, but this is just personal perception. Maybe his fans can appreciate his scenes.One of the biggest problems here was that I felt the characters never really interacted with each other. For example the male saber tooth only talks to the female and there are basically no scenes when these two interact with the mammoths which goes really against the idea of how they showed us their strong friendship in previous films. Or for example the four mammoths, after the introduction, share no conversations with other characters really. Everybody was for themselves and all this despite them being on a huge journey together. Every character had their own story and it shut out most of the others completely. Apart from that, I struggled with the antagonists, creatures that were birds with a touch of dragon who wanted to keep our heroes from preventing the apocalypse (due to the strangest theory, are children really that stupid enough to believe it?). They were fairly uninteresting and the monkey from film 4 made up for some flaws with the story four years ago, but here even the antagonists kinda suck. The plot-holes that scientists may see in the idea how Buck and the gang want to save everybody are not a problem at all. Unrealistic occurrences are not a problem in animated movies. I do not expect a scientific documentary. But I do expect to get entertained and put a smile on my lips on more than 2 or 3 occasions. This film did not succeed to that regard. I cannot recommend the watch and I hope if they ever make another, then that one will be improved once again. It seems like a real challenge though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am done with Ice Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really can't vote on this film because I haven't seen it yet. I intend on not seeing it as well. Ice Age used to be funny but has gone downhill after Ice Age: Continental Drift.How many movies are they going to milk out? The rumor is that if Collision Course is a success they will make another one. So let me see, success equals money which means more dough to make another film. Makes sense but eventually this franchise will bottom out soon enough. Remember when they stretched Shrek to four films? They stopped because they knew they were running out of ideas.One thing that really bothers me about these movies is the fact that someone is nobody until they have somebody. That is one of the unhealthiest things to preach to a young child watching this crap. Poor Sid doesn't have anybody to love him and all his friends do. I guess that makes him a loser. But wait, what this? He does find love after all in this film. A lot of people claim this is why this movie was made. I'm starting to think they are right. And of course we can't forget about Scrat who's been done to death with his acorn. Why don't they just give him a movie of his own?Another thing the Ice Age monopoly has been doing is pulling out every dirty joke in the book. They aren't funny anymore. Sex jokes and toilet humor is not funny when it's shoved down your throat in every animated film that is made. This is why I like movies like Zootopia and Big Hero 6 which didn't need that stuff to be a great film.Goodbye Ice Age films. The only decent ones I've seen are the first one and third one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many concepts bury an interesting premise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ice Age series has always been extremely varied in terms of quality. The original was fun but not overly interesting, The Meltdown, easily the best of the series was fun and engaging, Dawn of the Dinosaurs was fun enough to be a nice breezy little adventure, and Continental Drift was a messy pile of bad concepts. Collision Course however, feels like all of this.The premise is awesome, taking Ice Age into space, and I feel it could've been enough to make this film one of if not the best in the series, but it's buried under a pile of concepts that are taken directly from previous films, mostly Dawn of the Dinosaurs.Now, there's nothing wrong with paying homage to concepts from previous films in the series, but it's when you realise that that concept was done so much better in the last film that it starts to feel awkward. Another problem I have is the sheer number of main characters in this film, and this is from someone who loves having plenty of main characters in a film just to ramp up the fun, but the narrative is not substantial enough to support all of these characters as well as the absurd amount of concepts it wants to utilise.Try and balance a rock heading for the Earth, Scrat trying to fly a UFO, Peaches getting married to another mammoth and Manny trying to connect with him, Buck trying to face of a trio of dino-birds, a mysterious city that keeps you young forever, and trying to launch a magnetic rock into the sky, then add Manny, Diego, Sid, Ellie, Crash, Eddie, Shira, Granny, Peaches, Buck and Scrat to the equation, and try and make it work. You can't, simple as!It feels like a checklist of things they wanted to do before, then they realised this may be their last chance to use all of this so they gave the writers a list of things to include, and I can see that the writers tried their best, but it still didn't work.The direction feels very similar to that of Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Continental Drift, which was OK but usually just felt like throwing endless concepts at the screen trying to get it to work. This is the same, it's so padded finding the proper story under all of these concepts it near impossible.Also, what's happened to Manny? Ever since Peaches was born he's turned into a one-dimensional character who's always worried about his daughter, which I understand is probably what a father character in his position might be like, but I can't help but feel he was so much more interesting before Continental Drift.The humour is sometimes OK, but I don't feel that there's enough of it to hide the glaringly obvious problems this film contains. The writing is quite intelligent at times, and there are some good puns along the way, but the entire time I got this feeling of "been there and done that before, only it was better last time."There's not a single awesome memorable moment that springs to mind with this film. With 'The Meltdown' I'll always remember the rock scene because it was awesome, and with the original I'll always remember the ice slide scene because it was so fun, but there's nothing I really remember about this film and I've just finished watching it.Overall, Collision Course suffers from being a muddled mess of concepts that would've worked very well on their own but don't quite work with everything else that felt the need to cram into the story. You may say it's just for kids and as long as they have a laugh that's all that matters right?, yeah sure, but I'm not even sure that kids will enjoy it, it's just so dull.I'd say it's worth giving a try because there were times when I was laughing and enjoying myself, just not many, and if you're a long time fan of the Ice Age series, like me, then you may enjoy yourself, just don't expect too much.Would I like another sequel? Sure, provided they do some things differently this time. Let's go back to the original trio, leave Ellie, Crash, Eddie, and the others behind for once, let's just have a nice fun adventure without the emotional concepts and relationship drama that really doesn't belong there. That way, it'll just be about the fun and that's all we want.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of mammals must try and save the world and stop it from being destroyed by a huge meteor hurtling towards the earth.The third Ice Age film (Dawn Of The Dinosaurs) was actually fairly good and the fourth one (Continental Drift) was ,what I thought to be, an alright film when first released, but after a couple more viewings it isn't as good but is still bearable so I went into this film ,after seeing a few unfunny trailers, with quite a bit of trepidation but as usual I went in with an open mind. And I must admit I did laugh a few times in the first 15-20 minutes and it was fairly enjoyable. Then the plot went on and there were still one or two laughs just not as many. One of the standout problems that stops some opportunities for funny gags is that the film seems ,at times, to be too much like a cheesy American family based sit-com with certain side plot elements that have been seen hundreds of times in this sort of series and in many films over the years when the writers have run out of ideas. It does seem that at times the writers were trying to make this feature length or as near to the 90 minute mark as they possibly could just because of how much there is going on and how much seems to just be there to lengthen the time out and doesn't really have any relevance to the plot until the smallest possible detail where everything pieces together and only just makes sense and has some relevance and point apart from being there to make the film feature length. This leads me to many peoples recurring thoughts on the Ice Age series, Is it going to stop soon? Hopefully after this one and where it finishes they will leave it here. At a decent point that was watchable and provided some form of mild entertainment for just over 90 minutes.Yes it's fairly funny throughout and mildly entertaining but it does seem to lack quite a bit in the middle and a lot of the subplots have been seen before. Maybe Blue Sky should leave the Ice Age franchise alone now while it still has a couple of drops left in the river which seems to be rapidly running dry.*** &lt;-- Three Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Ice age is the best animated movie of all time, however, not a single sequel has come even close to being as good. The fourth one was the biggest offender, being one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And I wanted this to be worst, it was a disappointment. Its not as bad, Scratch was almost as funny as he was in the 2nd one, but for the rest, Manny cant get any worse than the previous one, Diego sucks, her girlfriend was useless, Sid was boring and the rest of the mammoths are really annoying. Im just tired of the F$%&amp;ing rats and they found a way to ruin Buck, the last good character this franchise created. However, I kept a smile during most of the movie, and I guess this would be a fun watch for kids, but F$&amp;K that. This is the worst movie of 2016 so far, but who cares, this thing already tripled its budget so please lets this franchise die, please, Im f$%&amp;ing tired.</fullReview>

In space it encounters the planets lined up like pool balls and knocks them into place? But the creature left earth so Earth is already in place?? Are you as confused as I am yet? Then back on Earth we have wedding preparations going on until an asteroid is hurtled to Earth by the UFO flying squirrel thing. Okay. I can go with that. But then we have a group of animals who aren't aging and some of whom are over 300 years old? Then they turn old again but at 300+ wouldn't the oldest of them just turn to dust? Then we go back and forth to the UFO where the gravity is turned up and things happen I don't want to spoil but then we head back to Earth but then Neil Degrasse Tyson turns up to talk to us briefly...and on and on the weirdness goes. I will say that my 4-year-old nephew enjoyed it which is what the movie is meant to do but it felt like I was watching two completely different movies.

		<shortDescription>Fifth trip to the frozen tundra.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ICE AGE franchise may have gone to the icy tundra one time too many. This trip is quite the calamity. Scrat (Chris Wedge), the squirrel, in pursuit of that great acorn finds himself in a flying saucer, packed in the frozen tundra, and accidentally puts the spacecraft on a trip out of the Earth's atmosphere and causing a series of cosmic mishaps that has space junk hurtling towards the icy planet.This dilemma has grouchy mastodon Manny (Ray Ramano) and his family and friends in "helter skelter" mode trying to divert doomsday. The speeding asteroid on its calculated path takes a demotion in Manny's priorities as his daughter announces her engagement. Multi-tasking and sometimes acrobatic shenanigans while trying to avoid the giant hunk of space junk will keep the younger audience glued to the screen. Adults may even find the collision course bearable. Sid (John Leguizamo), Diego (Denis Leary), Ellie (Queen Latifah) and the herd wonder as they wander leaving their frozen home in their quest of safety.Implausible or scientifically inaccurate; ICE AGE:COLLISION COURSE is cinematic fun. A host of familiar voices include: Jennifer Lopez, Simon Pegg, Keke Palmer, Sean William Scott, Wanda Sykes, Michael Strahan, Jessie J, Melissa Rauch, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Max Greenfield and Jess Tyler Ferguson.</fullReview>

There is no logic at all in any part of the scene (Not that I know of at least). I think its time to stop this series here.

		<shortDescription>Feels both tired and bloated- some fantastic animation though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having really enjoyed the first two 'Ice Age' films, the other three films in the franchise weren't as good. 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs' was still entertaining though, but while 'Continental Drift' had its great things (like Captain Gutt) it did feel like a sequel too far.If one thought that 'Continental Drift' was a sequel too far, while there are still good things here 'Collision Course' does feel like the writers were trying to keep things afloat by putting in as much mileage and material as possible but it all feels like a try-too-hard effort. 'Collision Course' is not a terrible film but this reviewer found it a huge disappointment.The best thing about 'Collision Course' is the animation, which is fantastic and the one thing that has improved greatly over-time. For me, especially in the space scenes with Scrat and with Buck it is the best-looking film in the franchise, there is so much eye-popping detail, the characters move easily and look more refined and one really cannot get enough of the vibrant, rich colours. The soundtrack is catchy, upbeat and whimsical, with an inspired riff on Figaro with Buck's playful re-introduction.While the laughs do not come consistently, there are definitely moments and they come from Scrat (especially the opening scene, which is the funniest scene in the film), who's had more inspired material but the facial expressions, physical comedy and the visuals in general help stop making Scrat too much of a tiresome one-joke character, and with Buck when re-introduced. The voice acting is still very good, the most enthusiastic coming from Simon Pegg. Scrat and Buck, making a welcome return, are scene-stealing characters, Diego is fun enough if not as showy or with as much to do and Ellie provides some sincerity and heart, her scene with Manny providing a rare note of realism to the film.However, 'Collision Course' suffers from being over-stuffed, over-complicated and bloated. Not just the story, which is pretty all-over-the-place, with too much that is rushed and like too much is going on with potentially great plot strands not being developed enough or given short shrift. The whole Manny trying to come to terms with his daughter planning to move away is completely lost amidst everything else and that could have brought some heart to the film, Sid's romance is rushed and painfully contrived and really there was really no need for the antagonists.But also the characters, it does feel like there are too many in the film, with too many of them also having barely any screen time, and the only really interesting ones are Buck, Scrat and Ellie. Diego isn't in it enough though does just fine when he's there and is still a lot of fun, and Manny is pretty dull. Sid is very annoying this time round, and as said the antagonists felt thrown in for the sake of "needing" obligatory" antagonists and were underwritten, non-threatening, barely interesting and basically completely unnecessary with their motivations dealt with in a very generic and self-aware way. The script has some witty moments, but is too hit-and-miss and stop-start, the laughs coming too far and between and the best moments don't come to the level of the franchise's very best moments.All in all, disappointing and definitely feels even more of a sequel too far than 'Continental Drift'. The animation is fantastic and there are definitely some good moments, but the tiredness of the material and the story bloating hurts it quite severely. 5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ice Age team appears to be out of ideas, at least that's how this new one feels.The plot is dreadfully contrived and over complicated for its target audience, which surely must be the five to ten year old demographic.In brief, there's an asteroid heading towards the Earth and it's up to the mammoth, the sloth, the ferret and the sabre tooth tigers to stop it. Even for a kids story, that's pretty ridiculous. Even the Scrat sequences have started to become pretty uninteresting.Having said all that, the old familiar faces are there and, whilst they might too be getting a tad tired, not all is lost. It still retains an air of charm inherited from the previous movies. That's about it though.If you have options, I'd spend the money elsewhere if I were you.

		<shortDescription>Dear Lord will the Ice Age franchise never melt down?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly can't remember the last time I felt this disappointingly angry from an animated movie, and I am afraid to say that this is not only the worst movie of the franchise but possibly one of the worst animated movies ever made. Now please don't me wrong I love animation and I'm not the kind of person who gives a flying toss about that old (not to mention stupid) prejudice where animated movies are only meant for children. If I may speak out I'd say that for the past years we've had quite many good animated movies that even adults and many different ages has praised for, but I can understand that some people will likely be flabbergasted when they see a movie like Ice Age Collision Course.I didn't have much expectations to see how this would have turned out, but seeing the trailers I already knew that this wasn't going to get anywhere to be a masterpiece or even a modern classic. Ice Age 5 is in my opinion basically the same kind of movie like its predecessors, in other words nothing new or anything interesting happens in this movie and that's pretty baffling to me. After 4 movies why couldn't they learn the mistakes from the previous movies? Now the first one wasn't so bad but not necessarily my favorite movie ever but still pretty good, while a certain thing I did not like from the first movie was how some of the characters were pretty unlikeable but later learned to be accepting each other. But in this movie the main characters are still being unlikeable jerks to each other, like for example everyone likes to ignore Sid, Manny being an overprotective father like the previous movie and many disgraceful humor which is something I really getting tired to witness in every Ice Age movie.As for Scrat, I'm starting to think that his scenes are not only getting more tiresome but are representing filler just for the sake to entertain the young children. I'm not against slapstick humor but I'd rather be watching the original Looney Tunes shorts instead of this forced and unimpressed humor.Another problem I had with this movie is that it doesn't seem to care about continuity anymore, like for example whatever happened to Peaches's little nice best friend Louis the Molehog? Remember him? Of course not because they had to ditch him for no reason (albeit he did have a cameo) and the sad thing is that he was the only likable and smart person in the fourth movie. And where the heck are the humans? Remember them from the first movie? It feels really weird to know that they no longer exist in this franchise when clearly they were one of the important keys on that movie.Like I said before, nothing new happens in this movie well maybe one thing (more about that later). But since this movie is so darn repetitive I believe one could simply sum up this and future Ice Age movies (God forbid they will happen) in short ways to know what to expect: First pointless Scart humor, some friends/family issues, then something bad happens and everyone freaks out, they try to find a new place to live or save someone, more annoying Scart humor, coming in trouble but saves afterwards, a minor conflict with forgettable one-time villains, everyone is saved and can live happy, then some more Scrat humor where he seems to finally get his acorn but messes up and screams obnoxiously.The only new thing that happened in this movie would probably be the character Brook, not only was she a pretty rushed and not very interesting character but her return at the end of the movie (I'd hate to sound like a heartless person but it was very cheesy) was basically a dumb Deux Ex Machina. I mean come on not even a Disney movie would stoop such low to make people happy at the end (ok maybe one movie but at least it wasn't cheesy but much well crafted). The only redeeming quality would be the animation which is admittedly pretty top-notch but that doesn't save the awfulness of the movie.Plus I know one thing people who thought this would be a bad movie told that the franchise is just getting weirder and weirder such as things that hasn't even been invented yet, well I'm afraid they right. They even put modern songs that never happened before in the franchise (ok maybe some few ones but the real ones wouldn't show up unexpectedly just like that) which was just ridiculous. The Ice Age franchise has really been jumping the shark on this one, which is why I won't be giving a chance to see if they make a 6th Ice Age movie. Just when Blue Sky Studios had to give us a well done movie like Peanuts it had to be another Ice Age movie. Although it may not be the most worst movie I've seen in my life but it is still worse than ridiculous. I recommend you to see Zootopia/Zootropolis or Kung Fu Panda 3 instead, and I bet Finding Dory (which I haven't seen yet but want to) will be a much better movie than this.1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible stereotypes - in animals?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, what can I say? Make a comet go away, save the day, nobody dies, happy ending (and maybe some slapstick jokes to cover up the very simple plot). I would understand if that would just be it with this Ice Age, but on top of the very boring story they throw in loads of characters to fill up even more screen time. A yoga llama (come on - don't try to be the nudist club in Zootopia) and a scared-vegan- dinosaur. Do I need to mention the other ones? Completely irrelevant, and all these characters and the bad plot makes it so boring. The jokes are based on stereotypical gender roles, and it almost feels vulgar for our current time. The male-mammoths saves the day while the others try to stay organised. A female can't be loved without a young look. The female remembers their wedding anniversary, the male is like "oooh no" and the female gets sad and angry. Wow.image It is easy to see that Ice Age: Collision Course tried very, very hard. Putting in vegan jokes, yoga jokes, poop-and-fart-jokes, but when every other scene is that, well - you simply get tired. When I get bored in cinemas, I always end up analysing the gender roles in movies. It was not a single joke made by a female character (except the grandma) and then think that every other scene is a bad joke. No space for females being hilarious, or hyper. Maybe the creators just know what hypersensitive is.It's a very beautiful film though. Everything feels intensely real, and the 3D is brilliant and mostly giving depth. I'd also like to point out that the body language of the animals definitely belonged in the same universe as the movie Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009).</fullReview>

This is everything i never want in a Ice Age sequel, the story is ridiculous and boring, the characters are very stupid and you don't care about them, the jokes are unfunny and the message is terrible, it doesn't connect with the plot. But the worst thing he did Blue Sky at this school is the Scrat character, not just what modernized, but they did a DAMN CHARACTER CARTOONIST. And instead of being the hero of the film and save the earth for bring destroyed, it becomes the supreme god of f*****g chaos, does not a d*** this character, his jokes are stupid and weird, and he has the lowest appearance in this sequel than the other sequels. I would give more importance to this character and know about his past, but we only know that Scrat makes one stupid joke. And Ice Age: Collision Course is the worst Ice Age sequel. If is there going to be a sixth movie, i will kill the new makers and writers, and this is not more then sheer stupidity of children and adults. I warn you, don't expect anything great or amazing about this sequel, you will ask for their your money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I would rather see a Scrat spin-off movie than having another Ice Age sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ice Age franchise, now roughly 15 years old, started with the journey of Manny, Sid and Diego rescuing a human infant back in 2002. Since then, these mammals have been subjected to a meltdown, a dinosaur invasion, and a continental drift. By then, you'd think it'd be best for the gang to resume their peaceful off-screen lives until their extinction, but no, Blue Sky Studios draws one last breath from its cash-cow franchise. Tagged as the fifth and "defining" chapter of the series, Ice Age: Collision Course, sadly, unlike good wine, does not age well. What was fun a decade ago is now quickly losing its appeal. While kids will still probably enjoy this, not everyone buys that mediocrity can be casually brushed off because it is intended for kids.Collision Course kicks off with a Scrat prologue, an extended cut of the short film, "Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe", released last year. The saber-toothed squirrel inadvertently starts a spaceship with his acorn, catapults himself to space and radically arranges the Milky Way in the process. This chain of cosmic events also sends a huge asteroid to earth. Down below, Manny (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo) and Diego (Denis Leary) must face this disaster while dealing with their own midlife problems. Meanwhile, Buck (Simon Pegg), who appeared in Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, returns and claims to know how to divert the huge asteroid away from earth. Joined by their family and friends, our mammal heroes embark on a perilous path to save the world from an impending meteor shower. Will this mark the end of the Ice age? One certainly hopes so.This sequel follows the same set-up as the previous films: a global catastrophe looms, but the characters are too preoccupied with their respective dramas that the gravity of the situation doesn't really stick. As if taken straight from a sitcom, Manny and his wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) are troubled because their daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) wants to move out with his annoyingly upbeat fiancé Julian (Adam Devine). Diego and his girlfriend Kira (Jennifer Lopez) are having some pre-parenthood issues. And Sid, well, Sid is just there, being pathetic, until they throw him a girlfriend.If there is one thing that has continually progressed in this franchise, it is the animation, which is, however, pretty much a given nowadays.Of course, Scrat and his Sisyphean quest for that elusive acorn remain to be the only selling point for me. For 15 years, I have been bewildered why he just won't eat that damn acorn already. Blue Sky Studios should have made a spin-off about his character rather than put out this sequel. If you've reached the point when you would rather watch a silent comedy for hours rather than invest in the main story, something is clearly wrong with the script.Ice Age: Collision Course fails to reinvent itself to sustain genuine excitement even from its loyal fanbase. With the number of characters jammed in this sequel, not much time is spent on exploring more important themes. Save for some Looney Tunes-esque sideshows, the storyline is running out of steam and is definitely not close to the quality of Pixar films. The harsh cold truth is this: the Ice Age franchise has run its course and exhausted its options, ultimately freezing itself from the hot stuff it once was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meltdown with asteroids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The is my review of Ice Age: Collision Course (spoiler free) ** (2/5)Cast: Ray Romano, John Laguizamo, Dennis Leary, Simon Pegg, Queen Latifah Plot: Manny (Romano), Diego (Leary), and Sid (Laguizamo) join up with Buck (Pegg) to fend off a meteor strike that would destroy the world.What the hell has this series come to? Back in 2002 this was an original animation that really hadn't been done before and it was amazing, not flawless and definitely not Oscar worthy except from being nominated but it was fun and it was a real good time. Back we didn't if there was going to be a series to it but here we are 14 years later and the Ice Age franchise now filled with five movies and no sign of Chris Saldanha (one of the original directors) but since Chris Saldahna became one of the directors for Despicable Me (2010) this series, which was still fun to watch at the time turned to pot and it just started getting worse from there. Now each new Ice Age introduced new characters only a few at first but the good things about them characters is they all had a funny story with them whether it be Ellie (Latifah), who thought she was part possum to the insane Buck (Pegg) when the series messes with Palaeontology and finally pirates when it messed with Geology, but again that was when the series was still coming up with original ideas and they were still fun to watch and to enjoy. However this still has its fun moments and still has an original idea but now it is beyond stupid and quite frankly gone too far away from the goodness that was the first one.The film starts off with the characters we love obviously having a game of turtle hockey but you shouldn't expect it to dwindle on that part because no matter how funny it may be, with the dialogue and the well jokes that try to be funny but really aren't, and as the film introduces new characters again this time there is no story about the characters it just carries on, and although this may be fun for kids to the adults will be wondering "what the hell are we watching?" and you'll be right to think that. This movie messes with astrophysics now all though you may be thinking that's a fun way to end the series it's just so wrong and fuzzy (Not just Sid's fur at one point) and as this carries one with its old-ish jokes that is really what this film is good for now. The story goes on of course with Scrat (Chris Wedge one of the original directors) who we know as being un-killable being just as hapless as he normally is and again you may laugh when he gets into all sorts of trouble, with the stories main aspect of getting a mysterious UFO the he has found and while he tries to make it work off it goes playing Pinball with the rest of the Solar System.However it seems that the writers just aren't trying anymore and though it still has fun moments with the endless bum jokes that may make kids squeal with delight as some of them are very funny. It just seems that the writers came up to a blank point and just made this one up as it went along; yes the series is now running on fart fumes. But what made this series good back in the day that only the older generation will remember is that it was funny and just endless fun this one is just stupid, and quite frankly an unfunny disastrous catastrophe. In conclusion if you want a happy ending of the series which we reached two films ago or so we thought, this one ends exactly the same as the previous one except much worse. In case you're wondering this one is set on the same island that the clan reached at the end of Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012). Finally at the end you can kiss your ice goodbye as this is the last in the series, it was fun well the first four films were, if you are an Ice Age fan and love the animation then maybe you should stick with the previous ones. Finally this proves that animations are only good the first few times or just one time in Pixar's case.VERDICT: Silly, stupid and quite frankly glad it's ended. Although this still has its fun moments that may make kids laugh this really has gone too far to really be fun anymore.4/10 hapless unfunny fifth instalment in a series that should have had really had four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ice Age: Collision course is guaranteed Ice Age movie. As in good as in bad too. Movie includes some nice wordplay and some realization too. On the other hand it feels so familiar, like you have seen it before. Ice Age: Collision Course is clearly targeted to younger audience, so it has way too much stupid hazzel. It might laugh for children, but more mature audience feels himself irritating. As before, movies best part is squirrels fooleries after his acorn. This time squirrel escapades in space and makes whole solar system mixed. This time we will find out, for example where Jupiter got it's red spot. Rest of the movie is just all the same again. Wondering around glacier, stupid jokes and childish hazzle dazzle.Movie looks great, colorful and rich. 3D works well as usually in these animation movies. After all I don't think the movie is a worth of a movie ticket, so it is better to watch from DVD. I don't think that release won't take for long. It is also surprising, that we see this movie a week earlier here in Europe than USA. This movie won't bring anything new to this movie series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ice Age Franchise got Shreked, Hard!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ice Age: Collision Course has extremely run it's course. What was once a respectable franchise with heartfelt moments and true originality has fallen victim to sequalitis time and time again. Like the Shrek franchise, Ice Age is heading in the same direction, to the back of the DVD cupboard. The Run Down: Manny, Diego and Sid (to an extent) are content with life. Manny has Ellie and Peaches, Diego has Shira and Sid has...well.... 'his boyish good looks' as he puts it. But all seems for naught unless they band together and stop an impending asteroid shower from destroying the earth. The All the bumper characters are back with the only positive coming from Simon Pegg's Buck who was sadly missing from the last outing. The rest are just here for stale laughs that are overtired and pointless. Crash and Eddie are as stupid as ever and Grannie was not funny the first time round so why but her back on the saddle for a second attempt. New addition like Brooke and Julian don't add anything that has not been seen and done in animation and film before. A common flaw in Blue Sky's attempt in capturing the first films shine is that it continuously seeks a story that requires the protagonists to go on 'a road trip'. All entries into this franchise has done this and it is just getting predictable and hard to find it fresh. The films message is not clever, original nor deep enough to truly resonate in the hearts of film goers like a Pixar film. These films can only use the power of love and friendship before these movie bleed into each other and feel like bad case of dejavu. One glimmer of hope that Blue Sky continue to nail on the head is it's animation, it's truly AAA quality and on par with Disney and Dreamworks efforts. But continual narrative problems and unfunny slapstick humour keep the Ice Age franchise from really deserving its status as the Highest Grossing Animated Franchise (based on the one property) of all time. The Ice Age franchise is constantly overshadowed by the likes of Toy Story and Kung Fu Panda as these franchise hit the ever crucial narrative mark. In conclusion: The 5th Instalment in the Ice Age franchise showcases a clear disconnect with modern animated features. What was once popular 15 years ago is now nothing more then a 90 minute childish film filled with exhausting slapstick humour, minus the humour. Ranking of the Ice Age Franchise out of ten1. Ice Age = 8 2. Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs = 7 3. Ice Age: The Meltdown = 6 4. Ice Age: Continental Drift = 4 5. Ice Age: Collision Course = 3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Next movie should be Ice Age: Extinction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ice age franchise has run its course. Now it is exhausted.Ice age 3 Dawn of the dinosaurs will always be the greatest of this series. That movie has a good story, interesting and lovable characters, great action, and humour. It takes the audience on an adventure of fun and discovery.However, the latest movie is mediocre at best. It has lost the magic that made the franchise great in the first place. It offers almost no thrills, even though it is a delight to see the return of Buck. The only scene that made me chuckle is Buck's "Let the mammals pass!" Everything else about this movie is so stale.The filmmakers do not even care about creating characters that the audience can care about. It is time to let this franchise die. Next movie should be about these mammals' extinction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Number five. Okay. There's no simpler way to put it than to say the franchise has officially run out of steam. These movies were interesting and fun a decade ago, but they aren't a good wine - time hasn't treated them well. Never before has the script felt so stunted, the characters so boring and the plot so thin.The story is simple - asteroid heading to earth, they have to divert it away. Well, the solution is stupider than pretty much everything else that happens in the series (and that's saying a lot!), flawed and inconsistent - wouldn't the asteroid's magnetism pull the remainders from earth, not the other way around? The side story of parenthood feels crow-barred in like hammering a piece of a different jigsaw into an incomplete puzzle (especially Diego's arc, which seemed like an afterthought because he didn't do anything else in the entire movie). The resolve of the family tension also felt underwhelming and clichéd.The dozen or so main characters we've now accumulated are so dull it's a struggle to keep your attention fixed on them. Manny now seems to have taken the lead role, but with Romano's insanely dreary voice it's a wonder the filmmakers didn't fall asleep during production. Sid's love worries are ludicrous and irritating, and Diego has nothing to do. Simon Pegg, voicing Buck, attempts to steal the limelight, but is also too irritating to enjoy. Once again, all the characters who should have depth and likability are cast into the tiny, but apparently more interesting, shadow of Scrat - whose acorn antics I could watch for hours, and are without a doubt the highlight of the 90 minutes!Sometimes you watch a movie and you laugh so much it hurts. Your cheeks are sore, there are tears all over your face, you can't breathe properly. Unfortunately Collision Course is so painfully humourless, the only thing that'll hurt is your mind as each gag bounces around the echo chamber of tumbleweed and cricket chirps. The opening sequence with Scrat is as good as it gets (and clearly was the foundation of their pitch to the studio), but even those moments get too far- fetched later in the film.BUT - great animation!So, it's a new low for the series that should have ended after number two. Not funny, boring characters, stupid story. Bring on #6!2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be the worst ice age movie of all, this series has been milking money out as far as possible, but now its just not funny or cute anymore..........just dumbed down husband-wife drama and really awful story-line, my guess after watching the movie is that the aimed audiences were 4-8years old, and some 8yo's too will also find this pretty boring to watch.There is nothing to really explain about the story-line because it just isn't funny and makes no sense whatsoever.Also the cringy dialogues this time come from everyone not just the sloth, it gets really really cringy with the dialogues midway through the movie, felt like the animals were Disney princesses wearing a disguise......if u have a 4-8 year old, take him/her to the theatre and headphones for yourself, so u can listen to some music or watch an episode of some good shows ur following, coz this will make u feel really uncomfortable otherwise and u might get this urge to leave the theatre.</fullReview>

This needless sequel has yet more of the same, only this time it is really very dull, the Squirrel in space gags are diverting enough, and the weasel at least keeps the boredom away but this is a very thin and stretched film indeed. As before the animation is very impressively done, but with so many great animated film's out there these day's do we really care any more about stunning visuals? Movie producer's must become more original, all across the industry these corporate franchise film's are killing the business like the mammals in this film the movie industry is walking into extinction unless new idea's are promoted the punter's i fear will stay in front of there x boxes or whatever passes for home entertainment these day's.

		<fullReview>Here's my review of #IceAge #CollisionCourse. Let this be the last one. How many more can we take of the same old excuse of presenting Manny in different stages of his life and just slap it with some kind of journey to either find underground dinosaurs or defeat some kind of cataclysmic event like asteroids destroying the earth. What's the next Ice Age movie about? The stage in Manny's life in his twilight years with his grandkids as they're all journey on once more to stop El Nino that's again caused by Scrat? Please don't tell Blue Sky Studios I said that, don't give them ideas.Scrat's in space and up to no acorn good again, his shenanigan this time causes cosmic events that threatens the ice age world. Meanwhile, Manny has to deal with his daughter's upcoming marriage to Julian, a mammoth that means well but he gets under Manny's skin, plus the thought of giving his daughter away is unbearable to any dad, much less Manny. All of a sudden space rocks start falling from the sky and the biggest one yet is about to hit earth. Sid, Manny Diego, Buck and the rest of the herd must leave their home and embark on yet another quest to stop the end of the world.By this time it's obvious that the actors involved with this project either don't have anything better to do or they're just doing it for the paycheck because as a film, "Ice Age: Collision Course" is a snoozer, I kid you not, I was at the press screening and I fell asleep twice. And there were times when I spent much of the time looking at my watch wondering when the film's end credit would roll just so I can tell which A-listers were part of the voice cast, turns out, there were plenty of them."Ice Age: Collision Course" has two or three exciting moments thanks to my favorite character, Buck, voiced by Simon Pegg, but for the most part, this film is more like "Ice Age: Has Run Its Course." Whatever it was that made the first "Ice Age" an Oscar nominee for best animated category, is now gone. This once adorable heartfelt friendship story has come to its end. All this latest installment essentially does is just exist. Nothing more, nothing less. But with any animated family film, you have to ask the question.. will the kids enjoy this one? Sure, I think so, I think they'll have a good laugh at it and why wouldn't they! So perhaps Fox should've released "Ice Age: Collision Course" straight to home video and let the daycare centers play it for their afternoon segments.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could they mess up this beautiful series?! It was my favorite animation, but it's not anymore. I'm really disappointed. The story was awful. Actually it's the worst story of Ice Age series! The dialogue are inappropriate and absurd. It's like Disney Channel series. I think that they made this animation for only teenagers. I don't understand what they were trying to do. I guess they're following teens who watched first movie, but it's not universal like first movie. There are some important topics about family. However these weren't handled well in the story. Processing of scenes is too shallow. I watched in Turkish, so the only good thing about this movie are our voice actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really REALLY wanted to like this movie. I love the Ice Age movies, but they haven't gotten better with time - only worse. And this is the worst of the worst. Save your money, save your time, and go hit yourself in the head with a hammer - trust me, it'll be more fun than watching this movie! The animation was nice but I have nothing else good to say about it. The story-line was lame, the actors just walked through their inane lines, and it all felt so tired, with trite jokes and forced dialogue. There was also no cohesiveness and part way into the movie a whole new bunch of characters sprang up and I kept wondering where they came from. The jokes were so lame that my husband and I actually turned to each other at the same time thinking "did they really just SAY that"? This movie was so horrid it had me squirming in my seat. I felt sad - so very sad that the movie makers couldn't tell the difference between a good sequel and a cheap rip-off. I also felt cheated, really cheated, that the writers/directors made caricatures out of such great characters. I think I laughed once or twice at Scrat - but how many times can you hear his silly sound effects or watch his eyes bulge and his tail fluff before even that becomes unfunny? This movie is an insult to anyone who likes the Ice Age movies and should have never been made. We did not subject ourselves to the full torture - we walked out about half way through this poor excuse for entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boring. The movie is boring. It's not just your everyday boring, it's so boring the family fallen asleep at the first QUARTER. Forced. Everything in it is forced. The jokes, the story-line, the family-drama,the characters. Senseless. Everything in it is just so far-fetched from everything, it is out of the "it's a cartoon" border and just drops this there and that, because why not. For the plot, and for advancing the plot, things are just there. Annoying. The characters and the drama is seriously annoying. I'm not going to spoil, but what the characters say and how they act, and things happen annoyingly and than there is a dumb unfunny joke to top that right away, or something falls at someone and that's the hit. I really think, this movie shouldn't have happened. It's bad. You are happy to get out of the chair and have a walk after it. You are just happy you don't have to watch it anymore.It's NOT family friendly. If you are parents, you wish you never had a kid, so you wouldn't have to watch THIS. It's that bad. Even worse, a lot of kid doesn't enjoy it, or just smiles. They don't really laugh, maybe a 2-3 yo when someone gets hit. The family drama makes it awkward to watch and forced. After a while a lot of sighs are heard. It's a cringe. The monologues are so awkward and not in a good way. In a "I feel shameful for watching this." kinda way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, Hate on me all you want supporters of this movie, I really do not care.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly the stupidest reviews on this site are on this movie. Plot summaries, terrible grammar and spelling, somehow getting lots and lots of people finding it helpful. Are people really that brain-dead? Is everyone here really just a 7 year old in disguise? I'm old enough to see through this stupidity, but somehow others aren't? People. This is the 5th Ice Age movie. You can tell that the people at Blue Sky have run out of ideas, but are being forced to make these because SOMEHOW these movies make a lot of money from outside the U.S. (which is where I'm from.) Come to think of it, maybe that's where all this positive stuff is coming from here, people from outside the states trying to justify a bad movie because over there it is revered as the Second Coming of Jesus. Well flashy little news flash for you people... it's not.The story is terrible, the writing is abysmal, and while the animation is nice, it feels wasted once you realize this is the 5TH ICE AGE MOVIE. All the great environments and colors stop looking good and start making you feel like they should have been used on something else.Let's talk about the characters. They all suck. My theory is that the only reason this movie exists is to give Sid a girlfriend, but even then Sid is unlikable as ever and I've actually completely forgotten the girlfriend's name. Other than those two, Manny is now a terrible excuse for a main character, and his family is even more useless than in Continental Drift. I didn't even think that was possible! Diego is now pointless, and his girlfriend he picked up in the last movie that was apparently important enough to warrant a return in this one... says maybe 3 lines? And maybe one of them contributes to the "plot". I already mentioned Sid, but to reiterate, the only reason this movie was made was to give him a girlfriend, despite Sid being a bad character even in the first movies. The new characters are just plot conveniences (or the aforementioned girlfriend of Sid). That one guy from the 3rd movie makes a return despite being absent the last movie and serving no purpose in the 3rd movie. The reason this paragraph is going on for as long as it is is because they added more and more characters as time went on, making it stupider and stupider. And Scratt, once the reason people people liked this series because of how funny he was, is no longer funny, and his charm has officially worn off.Before I get a ton of "I didn't find this helpful", 2 things. 1, did you not read the review? Are you really that stupid? Is there a running joke going on that I'm not aware of? Is that it? And 2, come on. This was helpful in every way possible, and you clearly don't know why. It talked about the plot, the characters, and the animation. But to you, "it wasn't helpful." Come on. Really?On one final note, I really hate it when people use the "It's just a kids movie", or the "The family loved it" excuse. The first one I've talked about before, so I'll make it brief: What, you mean kids of IQ 5 under? For kids of ages embryo to 1? That's what I thought. The second one... parents will get sick of the "humor" really fast. The kids won't know why, because they're at an age where fart jokes are still funny to them. Parents will despise it, kids will love it, but the parents make positive reviews on the kids behalf, completely destroying the concept of reviews. So stop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With 'Ice Age: Collision Course' we have arrived at the fifth installment 'Ice Age'franchise. Once again we join Manny, Diego and Sid on a journey this time their objective is to save the world from an incoming meteor that will decimate all life on earth. However despite it's cold setting 'Ice Age: Collision Course' is a hot mess.Once again Blue Sky Studios have created a visually good looking world. While it pales in comparison to Pixar's latest movie Finding Dory it still provides a rich world that allows a fun story to be told, however it is exactly here where the movie fails to deliver. The main characters we know and love from the earlier movies hardly get any screen time. Instead the movie shifts the focus to the many side characters and forces the main characters from the earlier movies into supporting roles. Sadly most of these characters just are not as like- able and because of this the impending danger of the meteorite seems small since the viewer won't care what happens to them. When the annoying possums Eddie and Crash are in every scene while main character Diego only says a handful of lines you know the movie has a problem.Other than the main story-line the movie is filled with unnecessary side stories such as the one where the mammoth Julian is trying to get his future father-in-law Manny to like him. Now if the movie was at least somewhat funny it would've gone down as a mediocre animation movie, but the problem with almost all of the jokes in the movie is that they feel extremely forced and are very predictable. Most of the times they are nothing more than simple fart-jokes.Now young children will probably have enough fun watching this movie, but for adults there really is nothing there and I feel really bad for the parents that will have to sit trough this one because their kid wants to see it.My rating: 2/10</fullReview>
