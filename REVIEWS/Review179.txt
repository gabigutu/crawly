		<shortDescription>Boy, was I surprised!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I am not from India, not even close. I am from Scandinavia. Before Lagaan I had never watched any Hindi movies of any kind. I know about 3 words from the hindi language. And I don't like musicals much. I viewed the movie on a DVD of rather poor quality compared to the state of the art DVDs I am used to. And I was told the movie lasted close to 4(!) hours... I figured this would be a complete waste of time... BOY was I wrong! This movie is completely the opposite! It is just amazing! Mr. Gowariker has selected an incredible cast with Aamir Khan in the lead. He makes an stunning performance as the village rebel, Bhuvan. He tries to unite the village in a struggle for life against the greedy Britons. The Britons exploit the villages by collecting lagaan (tax). This means that most of the harvest surplus is gone and there is just enough left for food for the farmers themselves. It's a classic war between "David", the native villagers of India, and "Goliath", the powerful and greedy Britons. But what makes it really interesting is that this war is fought in a Cricket arena. This is a challenge from the Britons, who are well known with Cricket, against the village, where most people have never laid eyes upon a cricket bat. If the villagers win, there will be no lagaan at all, for three years! And if the Britons win, they will collect triple lagaan, which will mean the end of the village. The stakes could not be higher!!I can't remember a movie being this thrilling and having so much life in it. And the music has a huge impact thanks to the great voices of Udit Narayan, Lata Mangeshkar etc. And the dancing is a chapter in itself! Few or none will leave this movie not remembering the song "Mitwa, sun Mitwa". It is a must see for everyone, inside and outside of India. And this movies has been totally righteously nominated for an Oscar too, and I wouldn't be surprised if it goes all the way to the top. It has my vote! It gets 10 out of 10 from me. Excellent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent and Overwhelming Fairytale ? An Oscar Deserving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1893, India was a colony of England. The starving native farmers had to pay an imposed tax to the British soldiers for the protection of their lands, delivering most of their harvest to the British Queen. In those years, the lands were very dry due to the lack of rain, and the inhabitants of Champaner decide to request to their Rajah Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to waive the taxes. While waiting for the Rajah, Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the beloved friend of Gauri (Gracy Singh), comments that the silly game of cricket was a stupid game, comparable to the Indian child game 'gilli-danda'. The nasty and arrogant Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), who had had a previous discussion with Bhuvan, listens to his comment and challenges Bhuvan to play a match against the British team, imposing the following condition: if the natives win the game, they would not need to pay Lagaan for the next three years. Otherwise, they would triplicate their payment in that year. Bhuvan accepts the bet despite of the opinion of his people. The sister of Captain Russell, Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley), finds the competition unfair to the Indians and decides to help Bhuvan and his friends, teaching them how to play cricket. This movie is a magnificent and overwhelming fairytale. It really deserved an Oscar nomination! The nice and well-directed story has wonderful songs and interpretations, romance, treason, dispute, drama, beautiful messages, outstanding choreography, being a stunning film indicated as family entertainment. The expensive Brazilian DVD is a shame, showing a total lack of respect of the 'Columbia Tristar Home Video' with the Brazilian costumers: the important songs do not have subtitles in Portuguese. I changed the option in the 'Menu' to 'English', and there were subtitles in English. At least in the opinion of the ridiculous Columbia representatives, Brazilians shall learn English first to understand the wonderful lyrics sang in Hindi. I feel really sorry for those who cannot understand English, since they will miss the meaning of these songs. It is amazing how 225 minutes running time passes so fast when you see such a marvelous movie. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Lagaan ? A Coragem de Um Povo' ('Lagaan ? The Courage of a People')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie not only opened my eyes to the beatuies of india but also the hearts of India. I fell in love with this movie at once and I feel very close to all of the characters I know them and feel for them. The dancing and singing made my heart pound and my heart overwhelmed by the matchless beauty and I was imagining myself following along with Gauri. I love this story and I could watch it daily and never tire of the beauty it holds. I have always loved indian people and the culture which they live, I am American and have never visited India,soon I will visit in person and dreams of going there will no longer tug at me . I hope to one day perform the dances as well as those in the movie. I really loved that in the movie the characters were faced with such hardship but somehow they were of cheer and sang together and lifted one anothers spirits.I love this movie some may tire of its length but I wish it would continue forever. I want to be a part of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic masterpiece that will take your breath away...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sony Entertainment's Lagaan is more an experience than a movie.Indian actor Aamir Khan's home production is a cinematic experience which highlights Indian cinema to the hilt, while weaving a tale set in Champaner during the time of the British Empire's presence which deals with Lagaan (the tax of the land) and a village's upheaval against its oppressors.The film revolves mainly around three characters namely Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), Gauri (debutante Gracey Singh) and Elizabeth (British actress Rachel Shelley), and deals with Bhuvan's spirited fight to defend what is his birthright, as he embroils the entire village into a magnitude of problems which inadvertently ends up being their only escape from the tyranny under which they reside. Gauri is the simple village girl who loyally stands behind the man she loves yet cannot profess her love to, while Elizabeth is the beautiful sister of the British Lieutenant and the complication who aids the village in their fight against injustice.The first half sets the scene beautifully, explaining what Lagaan is, introducing the characters and gradually pulling the audience into this period and place, literally taking the viewer into Champaner through cinematography which highlights the locales and sets which establish the standard of living. It makes you feel for the characters, believe in the villagers and draws you into the celluloid created world, while the second presents to you their turmoil, dawns on you what is at stake and whisks you away in a tornado of emotions and rising spirits.The opening scenes are more congruent to joining a conversation midway, as from the moment you are thrust into 1893's India, you gain footing and a sense of atmosphere, feeling at ease as the camera pans across its setting for the movie, drifting into the journey that will hold your attention for the duration of the film. Apart from familiarising the viewer with its characters, the first half also takes you back with its breathtakingly beautiful cinematography and fitting background score. The characters are established, the situation presented and relationships etched, with each scene rhythmically flowing from one to the other in a continuos motion.The second half is less involved in justifying its characters and aims more towards culminating the scene which has been set in the first. By this time you are already a part of this world and your emotions have already been stirred, now they are put to the test as the events which will determine the entire crux of the film begin and get the viewer involved.The romantic triangle between Bhuvan, Gauri and Elizabeth is expertly handled. The beauty of its predicament is that no one feels a loss by the end of the film, and director Ashutosh Gowariker beautifully justifies eternal love (but not necessarily requitted love) through drawing a comparison with the spiritual romance of the Hindu god Krishna and Radha. A delightfully delicately handled scene and situation gives birth to the foundation which will resolve the triangle in a manner leaving warmth in the viewer's heart.Aamir Khan is a revelation. His acting is superb and be it the conviction and fire in his eyes, the way he draws breaths from the air of the abode he calls home or even gulps at the atrocities he witnesses, he has become Bhuvan completely. His portrayal is such that it puts you inside Bhuvan's psyche and enables the viewer to understand the character from his demeanour alone. His piercing eyes stare sharply like razor blades, cutting through the camera and leave a haunting impression on an unsuspecting audience, drawing them more and more deeper into his world.Gracey Singh performs ably and is also an extremely graceful dancer, as particularly evident in the Radha Kaise Na Jale song. She acts with her eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, all of her and gives to the role of Gauri completely, giving a debut performance of high calibre.Rachel Shelley makes her presence felt like an ethereal spirit. Apart from looking stunning she adds to whichever frame she is in with panache and style. Her crossover to Indian cinema, or indeed to this film, is delicately handled and a feat to be applauded. To light a face like Shelley's in the same frame as the villagers without making one or the other look considerably darker or awkwardly paler, is a difficult task in itself. But the cinematography, the lighting and make up is such that the characters come alive as physical presences which complement each other, as do Aamir Khan and Rachel Shelley. Her interactions with Bhuvan and the villagers are intricately handled and executed wonderfully, and her inclusion in the O Rey Chori song is poetry on screen. To make a Western character dance in Indian cinema without causing a giggle from the audience or without it appearing unnatural is also something which needs to be handled with careful thought and the result is such that this song picturisation alone will invoke discussion on how beautifully it has been shot.Andrew Russell's boisterous character is brought to life by Paul Blackthorne, as he slides perfectly under the skin of a character that should reflect British pride and be menacing and hostile. He performs well and bounces off the supporting cast with utmost ease. The entire ensemble of supporting cast are deserved of mention, and particularly Raghuveer Yadav, who dynamically brings the character of Bhura across effectively and convincingly with edge.A R Rahman is the composer who has scored for many Indian and South Indian films, and this time too he does not betray his reputation of being a modern day Mozart. He literally teases then grabs you with his music, first resonating your veins, then breaths and finally allowing it to explode and burst through your body like an energy force, flowing in sync with your heartbeat. It's lilting melody, fresh sound and courageous allegros mesmerise and reflect the movie's emotions and spirit of hope. The songs are very well picturised and choreography is excellent, particularly Ghanan Ghanan, O Mitwa and O Rey Chori. The bhajan O Paalanhaare is bewitchingly lit and shot, injecting a spiritual vibe as candles' flickering flames hypnotise every viewer whose eyes dance to its command.The film belongs to Aamir and Ashutosh Gowariker all the way. Direction is superb and results in what is a true mark on Indian cinema, held together by Aamir's awe-inspiring performance.Lagaan is about hope, courage, fighting against injustice, the human spirit and about Indians. You enter the cinema to be entertained, and leave with a piece of cinematic history being firmly etched in your heart.Fuad Omar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect First Time Bollywood Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my first full-fledged trip into Bollywood and I couldn't have asked for a better entry. While there were some inconsistencies in sound, overall I loved the picture. Some of the songs and dances were breathtaking and emotionally charged. In particular the number where Bhuvan and the young boy are sitting on a hill and they're shrugging their shoulders, soon getting the village into the act. The other number where Bhuvan and Gauri re-enact the love of Krishna and Radha in exquisite dancing. Also there were many moments of stunning, breathtaking images, including the women of the village seated in the temple praying for salvation. Absolutely stunning. While I feel some judicious pruning could have trimmed the nearly 4 hour long version I watched (the DVD of which included an additional 17 minutes cut from this version) the picture did not seem nearly as long as it really was. Aamir Khan is such an instantly likable presence and Gracy Singh is simply irresistible as Gauri. Paul Blackthorne was a hilarious, old-school villain right out of a penny dreadful melodrama ? and I mean this as a compliment. Rachel Shelley's Elizabeth was a perfect blend of Victorian reserved beauty and free spirit and noble in her heartbreak. So many other performances ran the gamut from old school "b" stereotypical characters to some original ideas.The blending of melodrama (in its purest sense) true comedic moments (the hen keeper), self and enlightenment culminated in the scene where Bhuvan shocks the village by touching an untouchable; his stirring, heartfelt speech about brotherhood and putting away castes shaming the village into enlightenment.Some of the criticism leveled at Lagaan is (I believe) unduly harsh. This is a charming movie and a perfect introduction into the joys of Bollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just One Word: Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LAGAAN (4+ outta 5 stars) Years of subjugation and unfair taxation by the British Empire come to a head and the inhabitants of a small Indian farming community face off against their evil oppressors... in a cricket match??? This may seem like a ridiculous idea for a movie (and I won't even mention the fact that it's a musical) but this was the most exciting and wonderful movie I've seen in quite some time. Yes, it all comes down to a cricket match between the upper class British twits and the neophyte Indian farmers... and the movie is almost FOUR HOURS long... but, wow... what a movie this is! The slow building of trust and community among the usually-bickering villagers as they prepare for their ultimate battle is both fascinating and inspiring. It's like watching The Magnificent Seven or The Wild Bunch gathering together for a big showdown... only instead of shooting and killing... there's cricket! A cocky British Captain (Paul Blackthorne) makes a deal with the proud, young Bhuvan (Aamir Khan): he will give the entire region three years of no taxes if they can defeat the British cricket team... but if they lose they have to pay triple tax this year. Since there has been no rain all season and they can't even pay their regular taxes... this becomes a tense, do-or-die situation. Aamir Khan is terrific in the lead (he resembles a cross between Tony Curtis, Peter Sellers and Al Pacino). He is always believable, whether trying to inspire his fellow villagers or facing his English enemies in stony silence or wooing his the lovely Gauri (Gracy Singh) with song and dance. Great story! Great music! Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

Despite its closeness to the conventions, "Lagaan" proved to be a break-out film? Besides the graceful and enchanting attractions of the song-and-dance sequences, it has a plot carefully fashioned to a special kind of audience?audience who likes sports movies?

		<shortDescription>The Best Indian Movie of the Year 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I initially gave this movie a miss after I was totally disappointed by "Asoka". The latter was hugely advertised but I don't find it good at all.I finally saw "Lagaan" after a friend told me that this movie was actually good. And she was right. I borrowed the DVD from the library and had to see the movie in 2 sessions due to it's almost 4-hour-long running time. But it was worth it!The cricket game was captivating. I didn't know anything about cricket but before the movie ended, I felt that I almost understand the game!I'm not Indian and I seldom see Indian movie even though I love foreign movies, especially Japanese. But "Lagaan" is truly the best Indian movie I've ever seen, or at least the best of the year 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see for all Indian cricket fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially I was warned about the length of the movie-3hrs and 50 mins.But believe me, its worth it.There is a refreshing Indian-ness about the movie,which is welcome after a recent bout of Hollywood remakes in Hindi that have become such an eye-sore.The emotion that Indians share about cricket is effectively taken advantage of(the cricket match played between villagers of Champaner and the British officers which forms the climax ,extends to about an hour and a half).The best part of the movie is the characterization of the eleven players (villagers).Aamir Khan is at his best in this movie and Gracie Singh lives the role of Gauri.The acting talents of the British actors esp. that of the officer Captain Russel(played by Paul Blackthorne) is notable.There was never a boring moment in the film, the dialogues and songs' lyrics are very meaningful.And lastly I must appreciate the work behind the entire cricket sequence as it covers most of the aspects of the game and not to mention - match fixing,sledging,body line bowling ,making it gripping till the last ball! A must see for Indian cricket fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the theatre cheered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually the first ever film I have seen where the audience clapped cheered and booed effectively as if they were a part of the actual proceedings in the film. I heard someone say that they felt that they were really at a cricket match. I loved the movie even though admittedly at the time (surprising for an Indian) I didn't know cricket at all...I learned while watching it with the help of a friend but also found I didn't need to! It certainly renewed my interest and made mea cricket fan soon enough, the next match that year I watched with grave interest.About the fikm, the acting was good. Rachel Shelly and Paul Blackthorne were impressive and unlike in other Hindi films where they are usually clichéd versions of foreign characters, they were very drawn out believable characters. Aamir Khan was definitely the star attraction (obviously) as in any case it was 'his movie' but honestly he was very good, one of hsi best performances i'd personally say. Gauri was given very little to do in the movie but she did stand out in her own way. The supporting cast were all excellent in each of their roles, although some characters were a bit too starkly depicted. The British cast on the other hand had precious little to do except look foreboding.The setting in the Gujrati village and country was beautiful. The sets were historically accurate I've been told and the backdrop just right for the match and one would it imagine it fit into the time frame suggested. The costumes were also appropriate. I especially liked that scene where Elisabeth imagines Aamir in a suit, it worked because being who she is of course shed see him like that.)Some historians might nitpick on small points, but they were so minor that the rest of the story overshadowed these errors. At first I wondered whether foreign viewers would understand it what the unusual concept of musical numbers, but most seem to have understood the game of cricket (non cricket playing countries I mean) and the historical context as well and seem to have also taken the musical numbers in their stride.The only thing that got to me was the length of the movie. I really wish that they had done some serious editing, it just ran too long and the cricket match was too dragged out. It should have either focused more on the cricket match for the majority of the film, or reduced the footage of the rest of the film to balance it out. I saw many scenes that could have been edited out and were totally unnecessary.The songs were enjoyable and only one or two were unnecessary and could have been cut down or deleted entirely, like the 'Radha Kaise Na Jale' and the song where both girls sing. Honestly this movie was one Hindi movie that did not require many songs at all if at all. A background score maybe but not 6 songs. It got tedious and it gets on the nerves especially when you've been sitting in the theatre for 2 hours and you know that there is 1 more hour to go. Luckily people with DVDs will be able to fast forward!Although Predictable in places with characters being over-drawn or under-drawn and everyone knew the ending that was inevitable, ending, (it isn't much of a long shot at all) but we watched it for the thrill of it anyway.The overall effect the movie was so good that I fully believe that it deserved a nomination and I never say that about most Hindi movies. Even though it did not win I'm very proud of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1893. In a small farming community in India stands a British cantonment commanded by the cruel Captain Russell. When the Raja refuses to bow to his demands to eat meat he doubles the tax that the community must pay ? even though the lack of rain means the community can barely pay the normal rate. When the villagers beg for mercy Russell challenges them to a cricket match ? to win means the tax is waived, to lose means it is trebled. One man in the village, Bhuvan takes up the bet and must rally the village to learn the game and win at all costs.I was given this to watch because I had told someone at work that Bollywood movies are essentially a love story where the parents disapprove but it all gets sorted in a big dance number. So she gave me this to widen my knowledge. At first read of the plot I thought to myself `this is ?the air up there' with cricket' ? then I saw the 3? hour running time! But I said I'd watch it out of courtesy.However let me tell you that the time flew by really quickly. It only dragged occasionally but for most of the time I was really entertained by the plot and in some cases gripped by the drama. First of all ? I'm not a fan of cricket but this could really be any sport as that is not important to the story. The plot may be the old `underdog' chestnut but it is still very well done with lots of energy and lots of nice touches that take the chestnut and add just enough difference to it to make it seem fresh.This main plot also has various stories underneath. The main one being the romance between Bhuvan and Gauri which is complicated by the arrival of Elizabeth, who also falls for Bhuvan. This is well handled and is very involving ? although I don't really like Bollywood song and dance numbers very much, so these slowed proceedings a little for me. Although many of the songs are comic but also very well choreographed.The film is really helped by the constant interweaving of comedy in the form of the villagers' characters ? they fight, they fall down they argue etc ? but it is still amusing if not roaringly funny. However the focus on their plight is never lost ? the drama is kept running just below the surface at all times and the final hour is tense. Tense! A cricket match! I didn't expect it to be exciting but at times you are on the edge of your seat ? and it isn't as cliched a game as I'd expected it to be!It does have some flaws of course ? the film is a little heavy handed at first in making sure we know the British are bad, it is done too early and too quickly ? couldn't we have been led to that conclusion rather than pushed straight away? The songs I found to sound very similar to oneanother ? but this may be the fact I don't like them. To add to this the sound quality between the songs and the dialogue was very different ? the songs all had a very studio feel when heard beside the dialogue. Also the plot is a little cliched ? although I after watching it I did think that it was well done and like I said, had nice touches (which I won't tell) that upped the drama ? even if you THINK you know how it'll end.But over an almost 4 hr running time, minor flaws can be forgiven. Khan is a good Bollywood lead but the film helps him by not making him invincible ? rather it does show him making mistakes etc. Singh is good as Gauri even if she is a standard `wide eyes' Bollywood starlet! Surprisingly good was `Holby City' actor Paul Blackthorne who not only manages to give a really mean performance but does it in both Hindi and English. He also looks a bit like Sean Connery ? or at least he did to me!Overall this manages to make the long running time fly by quite easily ? a rare feat for a movie these days. It is exciting, romantic and comic. It may have it's flaws but on the whole it is a very entertaining film in many ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Art Movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is seldom in this modern era of IT generation that a long movie surpassing three hours of running time and without a show of synthetic acting, vulgarity and cheap comedy, captivates the audience to stick to their seats. WELL DONE Gowarikar ...... WELL DONE Amir Khan ....... Mr. Gowarikar, please note that if this sublime film had been directed by a British or American director like Danny Boyle or Richard Attenborough .... the Oscars would have definitely flown into the laps of the director and the protagonist actor. This is not to say that your directorial skills lack the excellence to win the coveted Academy Awards, but it is to mention the inherent bias and prejudice which prevails among the jury of the Oscar Award Committee towards directors, producers and actors of the Sub-Continent namely India. Mother India (1957) met the same fate from the then jury of Academy Awards committee who simply rejected its nomination for the Oscars on the grounds that it is laden with too much songs, formulaic in nature. Besides, the excellent performance of Amir Khan as an aggressive and challenging native youth 'Bhavan'; Rachael Shelley has put up a remarkable and evocatively strong performance as the suave young British lady Elizabeth Russell, who aspires to help out the hapless villagers from the cunning guile of his brother, Captain Russel. Now what can one say if the members of the Oscar awarding committee do not understand the meanings of wordings of the emotionally focused songs (due to language and culture difference). It is a handicap with them and not with the local Indian movie making team. Keeping aside this injustice, the movie characterizes pure and pristine feelings, emotions, struggle and fighting spirit of a raw and unskilled cricket team of illiterate Indian villagers who capitalized the opportunity to get waived the odious land revenue tax, with exacting standards of will power and perseverance.After a long time, there is an Indian movie bred with the contents found in the Indian films of yester years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can add the name of Ashutosh Gowatrikar to the list of the new generation of Indian Film Directors. An amazing list with the likes of Aditya Chopra (Mohabbatein, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge), Farhan Akhtar (Dil Chahta Hai, Lakshya), Karan Johar (Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai), Sooraj Barjatya (Maine Pyar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, Hum Saath Saath Hain), Sanjay Leela Bhansali (Khamoshi, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam). And Now Ashutosh Gowatrikar (Lagaan).When I went to see Lagaan in the theater, I had certain expectations of what the story was going to be like. But as I watched the film I realized that it was nothing like what I thought. The story was totally unexpected. It was quite a surprise. Never before has a film done that, usually the trailers, promos or songs of an Indian film give the story away and you get an idea of what the film is going to be like, but Lagaan was a total surprise.The story is very well told and each character is well etched. Aamir Khan gives one of his best performances in the film. New find Gracy Singh gives an excellent performance. The Direction and Story of Ashutosh Gowatrikar are beyond words. After watching the film, it is very easy to see why this film was sent to the Oscars for the Best Foreign Film category.A great movie, definitely worth watching at least 10 or 12 times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly magnificent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnificent, what else shall I say? I first saw this movie in a TV/DVD/CD/electricals/computer, etc shop. The movie was on one of the TV for sale, only on to demonstrate the quality of image of the said TV. I walked in front and saw a group of people watching. Some of them had even sat down on the floor. I stopped too and was captivated. I stayed till the end and left the shop with the DVD.Like many Bollywood movies, this one can appear strange to the western movie-goers. We find it hard to understand the music and dances that seem to come out of the blue, a lot of details are also entirely up to Bollywood tradition, a tradition that we just don't know well enough.But what can at first appear as flaws can either be explained by tradition or in the case of this movie completely forgiven due to beauty of it. Yes Gauri is a bit childish, Bhuvan is just too nice, the English captain too evil and the ending just had to be a goodies take all, baddies run away type. Yes, it can seem simple and and superficial. Due to their exceptionnally uncomplicated roles, the English actors are not brilliant. Being 100% evil or 100% nice never makes one look like a good actor. But does all that makes this movie any less magnificent? No. The story is just wonderful, the colours, the dances, the songs, and the genuine innocence of the characters which make you care for them and really make you want them to win.</fullReview>

I thought the song and dance routines were great, providing the perfect bridge to a semi-mythologised narrative. The audience sometimes laughed at the exaggeration and coincidence of the plot, especially at the end -- the rain, the Englishwoman who never married. Astonishingly they even got the joke about 'this country will be the future of this game'. It seems that lack of knowledge of cricket and subtitles with words like 'runs', 'overs' and 'no ball' were not a handicap. Of course the pillorying of the British didn't go down badly here. I especially liked the representation of the Raj, not as a moderrnising influence, but as straight agrarian civilisation, extraction of the food from peasants' mouths.I was on the edge of tears throughout. Why? Because this was the first Indian production that to my knowledge has won a world audience. And it provided a new sentimental bridge to the world for my own trajectory. I could see how Bollywood is the only film-making centre that actually could do what Hollywood does, but in its own distinctive way, with a much more universal human interest. And the music of course. The plot and characters were caricatured, but that made it all that more accessible and touching, like a medieval passion play. I loved the symbolic roles contrived for the Muslim, the Untouchable, the Sikh, the collaborator, the headman, the intellectual etc.Above all, the plot of learning the game and beating the masters was perfect. It was CLR James to the tee. Beyond a Boundary indeed , with society in the shape of the crowd as much of the action as the players. And the idea of the bet! Play comes from an Old English word whose first meaning is to wager. The idea of life as a game of negotiated risks is very widespread among hunter-gatherers, where people have to be trained to respond instantly to the flash of white tail in the bush. Obviously it sometimes pays for peasants (and citydwellers) to pick up these skills. The play goes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A game of honour, a game of the lifetime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's my sixth Bollywood film, and I have fallen in love with this one as much as with the others. It's not as warm and colorful as K3G or as funny as Main Hoon Na, but the story is so involving that I spent almost four hours anxiously following the main characters' efforts to win the game. I almost started to bite my nails at the end, keeping thumbs up for Bhuvan and his friends! The strength of the film lies in the fact that it shows how important cooperation, faith and effort are if you want to achieve something in your life. And although I, as a Pole, have no idea whatsoever about the rules of the game of cricket, I was not bored for a second during the second part of the movie - thanks to the director's ability to introduce tension at the right moments. I liked the songs a lot and I think they've been nicely choreographed. The camera work is good, emphasizing the dryness of the land and the hopelessness of the people anxiously waiting for the rain. To sum up, it's a good film with an interesting plot, some catchy music and nice acting. A must-see for a Bollywood fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Hindi movies I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lagaan rates as one of my top three favorite Hindi movies, along with Devdas and Mohabbatein. Though I am a Caucasian American, my Kutchi wife has evangelized me with scores of Hindi movies in the almost six years of our marriage. While many of them are wonderful (Pardes, DDLJ, Phir Bi Dil Hai Hindustani, Umrao Jaan, Dil Se, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Sholay, Don, Dev, 1942, Roja, Hey Ram, Bombay, Mere Naam Joker, and many, many more), but few stand out as wonderfully written, directed, acted, choreographed, filmed and translated as Lagaan. I heartily recommend it to anyone curious about Hindi films.Aamir Khan's attention to detail is fantastic, as is his energetic portrayal of a young man fed up with the status quo and willing to risk all for a chance to cast the burdensome yoke of British taxation off his village. Revolution without significant bloodshed, beautiful cinematography and choreography, excellent costuming, an intriguing love triangle, and a captivating story line ... all this and an edge-of-your-seat cricket match! Who could ask for more?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best entertainers from Bollywood. It has a moving story, excellent music, amazing performances and great dances. All the ingredients are perfectly balanced, resulting in a true masterpiece.To the detractors of this movie(esp the American ones). Granted, on the average, your Hollywood movies are way better than bollywood ones. But your best movies are not even close to the good ones of Bollywood. The reason you may not be able to appreciate good movies like this is that in the US, your life is one dimensional and you don't have the different experiences that people who grow up in India have. For you guys (americans), the world starts from California on the west and ends at NY on the east. Movies are to be enjoyed and not analyzed. If you are of the thinking type, there are lot of other things which you can analyze (proof of Fermat's last theorem for example). Don't apply your analytical skills to movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not even know what the term Bollywood meant. I had to look it up just now. So I am not gonna try to judge it based on where it was made. I will just tell you what I thought of it as a movie.I have been sick and was ready to head back to bed when my brother said that this movie that just started seems pretty good. I figured I would watch a few minutes and then lay down for my well needed rest. Well, almost 4 hours later, I'm looking up the movie on IMDb.I don't understand the game of cricket at all and, honestly, could care less. I was captivated by the characters and their plight. I was rooting for the underdog The songs were so touching and spiritual. The dance scenes, especially the love dance one, were beautiful.I have read many comments on here that the movie was badly lip sang. I disagree. Until I read it here I hadn't noticed it at all.Overall, I cheered, I laughed at a few of the zanier characters, and I also found myself streaming tears for the young boy. I found myself experiencing the same emotions the English woman was showing during the game.I think they tied everything together well in the end. I ended the movie feeling like I wanted to recommend it to others.So see the movie!! OK. I am finally off to bed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is nice but a little boring because of its runtime is three hours and some and it tires until the person most patient. The yarn concerns about inhabitants of a village whose leader (Aamir Khan got his ears pierced so that he could actually wear earrings) asks the English deputies for the exemption a tax called Lagaan . Officer at command (Paul Blackthorne) will free them for three years if they earn a cricket match . The officer's sister (Rachel Shelley) will teach them to play cricket game .The film has an excellent musical scenario , the choreography is fantastic , the songs are enjoyable . The movie was shot in villages of Bhuj (Gujarat); Bhuj was destroyed in an earthquake on 26th January 2001, six months after the movie was shot . The first Bollywood production to use synchronized sound , most Indian films are dubbed entirely in the studio in the process . Bollywood has got a lot of experience in this kind of movies . The Bollywood center is located in Bombay , where has been shot hundreds of films .The flick mingles comedy , songs, music , cricket sport, a love story , joy and a lot of fun . The movie is an India/British production though mostly produced by the first country and specially by the main starring : Aamir Khan , a true idol in India with millions of fans. The film will appeal to the musical genre buffs and cricket lovers. Rating: 6'5/10 good . Better than average , well worth watching.</fullReview>

It's a tribute to the movie's appeal, the actors' talent and the movie-maker's storytelling skills. Another wonderful thing about the movie is that the mysterious sport called cricket becomes clearer to the puzzled Filipino. I may have one minor complaint, the musical numbers are full of energy and enthusiasm, but when the British Lady sings it becomes a parody of a Western musical.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Lagaan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having won multiple awards and gotten itself nominated in the 2002 Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category, my interest in Lagaan was actually in wanting to discover more of writer-director Ashutosh Gowariker's works, having seen his latest movie Jodha Akbar, and having bought Swades: We, the People starring Shah Rukh Khan, still unwatched.I've never been a fan of cricket and have never understood the rules, but I suppose after the time you're through with Lagaan, you'll learn at least the basics enough to enjoy the game. No doubt my interest in this sport has been piqued, and non-fans shouldn't steer away from the movie, because knowledge of the sport is not a pre-requisite for you to enjoy this wonderful gem of a sports movie running close to a whopping 3.5 hours (and I heard in the collector's edition, it runs to 4?)Set in British India, we learn that Lagaan is a form of taxation that the villagers have to pay to their Rajas, who in turn pay the British for protection against, erm, invading forces and rivals from other Rajas. In fact, the British were double crossing everyone during their occupation of the country, and bad weather makes the lives of the villagers even more hard pressed since they have zero crops to sell. Every village needs a folk hero, and herein lies Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) who decides to step into the shoes of one, not because of bravado, but because of the atrocities dished out by the British against his fellow countrymen, especially when taxes for the year have been doubled.So the stakes are raised in a game of cricket. Defeat the British, led by Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne) and have a tax waver of 3 years for the entire province, or if they lose, then their Lagaan will be tripled. And you don't need a rocket scientist to tell you that when the impoverished have their backs against the corner, they have little choice but to fight back. However, after years of being oppressed and cowering in the face of hardship, you'll need that bright spark or two to shake things up and bring everyone to their senses that Hope is something they have which they can turn into reality if they work at it.The storyline might seem cliché as per the usual sports movies, where our hero Bhuvan has to assemble a team of good men each with their own special farming background which can be incorporated into the game, and recruitment always is a challenge when nobody believes you, and thinks you're the troublemaker who started it all. There are leaders, and there are followers, and some good time is invested to develop this challenge, as well as to explore the plight of the villagers in more detail. The villains of the movie, those pompous Brits personified by Captain Russell with his nose perpetually in the air all the time, are put in very bad light with their looking down of the natives as slaves.But even amongst themselves, the Indians too have their infamous caste system, and this was touched upon when Bhuvan chooses to adopt the more meritocratic route in player selection, and this message undoubtedly stands out. I can't comment much on these themes that Gowariker touch upon in his films, such as that of religious tolerance in Jodha Akbar, but it seems likely that he had incorporated these knowing that his films do appeal to the masses, and therefore serve as a reminder to everyone.While the last 1.5 hours get devoted to the game, where two proud man go head to head against each other with their team, and team members having their own personal vendettas worked out during the matches, it never for a minute played out in a boring manner. In fact, it was entertaining to watch them go through the paces of the game in 101 terms, and from there, those unfamiliar with cricket will likely be able to pick up the basics. Even if the sport is not your cup of tea, its delivery will still appeal to you, as do the usual Bollywood staple of dance and song, as composed by renowned A.R. Rahman - I particularly liked the segment where any self-respective sports movie will have - the training montage, and with a love triangle of sorts fused between Bhuvan, his childhood sweetheart Gauri (Gracy Singh) and Englishwoman Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley), sister of the villagers' enemy but one who decides to teach them the game so that they can get on equal terms with her countrymen.Despite its clichés, Lagaan is wonderful entertainment, and you will not realize the movie's running length, as you'll be engrossed in what transpires, and will find yourself rooting for the clear underdogs as they go about trying to battle oppression in unfamiliar terms. Colourful songs and charismatic folk characters, Lagaan unquestionably reinforces my love for Bollywood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was totally an uplifting and an inspiring film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not an Indian myself, I'm a Filipina and this is actually the first Indian film I've ever seen but I was automatically enthralled as the film starts playing?I have to admit I became engrossed with the film already when the first scenes was where Aamir Khan was. Later on, as Gracie Singh performs superbly with all the musical performances, I decided from then on that I already love this movie! Even though I only have to watch thru the subtitles, it's certainly fine with me. This film was only introduced to me by my cousins during Christmas last year. From then on, I've looked everywhere for this movie in every video stores. Luckily, I got one 2weeks ago and I became so fascinated that I download pictures &amp; wallpapers already?all about Lagaan!!! I wouldn't be posting a comment here if I didn't have the Lagaan fever!!! =p The story started in a small village of Champaner , where Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) and Gauri (Gracie Singh) are in a community of poor and innocent farmers who are happily plowing, sowing, praying for the rains and reaping their harvest. Inspite of such unwanted circumstances, they are still full of hope.But then, a British captain, Captain Andrew (Paul Blackthorne), challenges the farmers to a cricket match. He is a capricious character that wants to burden the villagers with a land tax (Lagaan). He waived that there'll be no Lagaan for the next three years and that he'll be the one to pay it from his own pocket. Worst, if they lose, they will pay triple Lagaan for that year. He knows that the villagers are ignorant of the game and its rules. So he's pretty confident that he'll win the game? What he didn't know was that his younger sister, Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) is completely against his outrageous ideas? Elizabeth's first meeting with Bhuvan already got her attracted to him? Unsuspectingly, all of the villagers knows that she helps them purely out of sympathy?well, I guess it was that way but she fells in love with Bhuvan later on?it just pains me to see that Elizabeth's love for Bhuvan is an unrequited one?she remained Bhuvan's Radha? The cricket match between Indians and British was really superb and very uplifting. Nevertheless, their wit and determination never let go unnoticed. Even the British officers cheered for their victory! It's really a heartwarming story?of Purity in Spirit, Sacrificial Love and that good still prevails..Aamir Khan has absolutely a god-given talent?simply amazing?he dances like any other talented men I know who perform. He was very good in the role?he looks very appealing especially when Elizabeth imagined him in a princely suit! Gracie Singh looks convincing as Gauri who loves Bhuvan with all her heart. She looks bubbly and cute to me! She displays an excellent facial expression that she can shift from one emotion to another without any difficulty, I guess? They are really perfect for each other? On the other hand, Elizabeth may have love Bhuvan with the same intensity as with Gauri's but I guess, they weren't really meant to be with each other?the rest of the men in Bhuvan's team were also fit for their roles?they never failed to uplift, share their sentiments and inspire me?the British officials showcased a role of fairness?they sympathized and cheered with the villager's victory.For an overall view, the movie was really amazing and I never will get tired watching it all over again. The songs were enjoyable. I can even depict it in my mind?sometimes I would hum it 'coz I cannot recite the proper lyrics?moreover, even if this film didn't win in the Oscars?it's all worth it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally find sports films only mildly interesting. Stuff like Field of Dreams for example is OK, but only because it deals with big issues, like what's important in Life. Also, I normally detest Football and Cricket. When I was young I was forced to watch both - I never understood either and got bored pretty quickly. I think that Cricket is a game best broadcast on radio, and Footy on TV. Most times, they both bore me.Not so in this case. The match only takes up the last 45 minutes of this 210+ minute film, but the build up to it is quite good filled with intrigue, a love story, and a number of song and dance routines. By the time you get to the match you are totally aware of its importance, and how the Villagers are the underdogs. I won't give away the ending, but it really is suspenseful to the very end.If you only see one "Bollywood" film, make it this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True anti-colonial escapism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike, say, Once Upon a Time in China, with which this film shares at least its English (sub)title, this is populist anti-Western colonialism done right! For one thing, having the villains actually be white goes a long way; Paul Blackthrone is an extremely effective "evil Englishman," and he actually speaks Hindi for a good chunk of his role! As a result, we get a real struggle, rather than an ultimately-meaningless proxy battle as we usually do in Tsui Hark's film. This is, however, no Gibsonesque exercise in Anglo-bashing, and everything comes out extremely balanced, perhaps too obviously so. He does, after all, have a sister that helps out the village people as they try to learn cricket and beat his wager. More importantly, untouchables and Muslims, despite earlier misgivings, are welcomed into the team, providing a heartening, inclusive vision of Indian resistance against the occupier.What's nice about this film is that it is clearly a high-profile Bollywood picture with an eye towards crossover, but it is not so compromised that it becomes unrecognizable to anyone who is already somewhat familiar with Bollywood. I imagine this is one of the better "gateway drugs" for the genre, as the music is good and fits with the plot, and one rarely feels that the more-than-three-hour running time is needlessly padded. Sure, they could have made it shorter, but this is actually epic enough to deserve it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been able to find a Bollywood film that was so easy to sit thru the entire film without getting impatient. Excellent pacing, appealing acting, good music and about perfect movie entertainment. I've seen quite a number of Bollywood musical productions as the local Indian fast food restaurants tend to play non-stop DVDs that splice only the music and dance numbers together. It's been very hard to get a good recommendation of an entire film to see. The few that I've been able to watch were tough going, mainly due to the length and corny plot lines. The musical numbers were usually entertaining. I had to stop this film (on DVD) and resume watching it at a later time. I found myself watching from the beginning again and not getting bored! Director Ashutosh Gowariker has developed an excellent technique that I think the subtitle of the film gives a clue where his inspiration comes from. There are many scenes that remained me of the way Sergio Leone built scenes, introduced new characters and involved the viewer in the story. Really impressive.There is one problem, if this is your first Indian musical/drama, there's not much in league with this film. To extend the Leone connection, it's like watching "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" and then trying to find another Spaghetti western that comes even close.Excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Traditional Values Film From An Unusual Source</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, to enjoy this film, and you can--very much--the viewer should leave behind the cynical contemporary moviegoer who expects irony and sarcasm and nasty humor and fart jokes. This is an old-fashioned film about old-fashioned values, and the fact that it was made in India makes little difference.Lagaan pits good against repression, the individual against the system, and although to a modern viewer the outcome may be obvious, its great fun getting there, with a lead actor who very much resembles the early Tony Curtis, full of impish sexuality and the power to use it, a man who challenges an unjust system--in this case the rule of the English Raj before 1900. He impulsively challenges a ruling officer, a really nasty type reminiscent of previous villainous prototypes...and then he must meet his challenge. Viewers not accustomed to the Bollywood product should be able to believe that hundreds of drought-stricken villagers could break out in unified and very colorful song when they see black clouds on the way--if so, and you like romance and being on the winning them, this film is great fun indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10th Anniversary of Lagaan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Analysis of A.R.Rahman's background score in Lagaan In Lagaan, every known ingredient of a typical Indian masala film is in near perfect proportions. A.R.Rahman had to follow and use almost every single film scoring rule and technique for writing the background score of Lagaan. Every principal character gets a musical theme. Every dramatic moment gets an uplifting music score. Every song's melody is used appropriately in the background score throughout the film. Every musical theme that is not based on any of the song's melody is deliberately tuned catchy, so that it could get a life even out of the film. There are big bangs and grand orchestral outbursts. There are moments with measured silence amidst ample music. Every tear-jerking moment is filled with an instrumental soliloquy. Every instrument in the score is carefully chosen, and every piece is carefully orchestrated to convincingly transport us, a century back in time. The beauty of Lagaan's background score lies in the way all of these techniques come up in the right proportion, in the right context, in the right moments of the film....... to read more go to the link given below www.backgroundscore.com/2011/06/10th-anniversary-of-lagaan.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take Me Out to the Cricket Match</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything I ever need to know about cricket I learned from this movie."Lagaan," in typical Bollywood fashion, is ridiculous and ridiculously entertaining. It sounds like something conceived by Bialystock and Bloom -- a 3+ hour musical about British imperialism in India and the sport of cricket -- but much like "Springtime for Hitler" it ends up working like a dream."Lagaan" was nominated for the 2001 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but it lost to "No Man's Land," the first and only entry from Bosnia and Herzogovina in that category. This is also the year that produced "Amelie" as a nominee -- what a great year for foreign language films.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bollywood at it's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lagaan has to be my favorite Bollywood film to date.When a local British governor doubles the lagaan (tax) on a small village in the midst of a drought, the villagers make a deal that they'll be free of Lagaan for 3 years if they can beat the British in a game of cricket, or suffer triple the tax if they lose. Trouble is, they don't know the first thing about the game. It's a typical sports story with a rag tag team of underdogs squaring off against an experienced, arrogant veteran team vividly dramatizing the Indian fight against British oppression. The well executed story is buttressed with lavish Victorian era costumes, beautiful cinematography, and several musical numbers that are a cut above the average Bollywood song-and-dance numbers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was suitably entertained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film happens to the very first Bollywood film that I have watched in its entirety. Not being a fan of musicals, I braced myself as I popped in the DVD. Well, 225 minutes past by rather quickly and although there were moments where I was wondering exactly why I was watching a musical, but most of the time I was fairly well entertained. I mean, granted, my critical side could pick at this film for a while, but that didn't lessen my entertainment.The story is a pretty simple one and rolls forward predictably. The setup is this: poor Indian farmers get taxed by local British cantonments through their raj. One day the British capriciously demand double tax (lagaan = tax) and the villagers, suffering from an extended drought ask for it to be lifted. The big bad Brit offers them a challenge: win a cricket game against the Brits and no taxes for three years. Lose and pay thrice over. I like the word thrice.Complications arise as you have a British woman who goes against her tyrannical brother and secretly aids the Indian team. Of course, since it's a classically styled musical, there's a romance, complicated by a triangle (or perhaps a quadrilateral). And since it's a sports film (a cricket film), you have your requisite training montages. Since it's a musical, you have plenty of musical/dance numbers. And it's a recruiting film, so you could call it Bhuvan's Eleven.All right, the good stuff first. The production values are high, the photography is gorgeous at times, the acting is simple but effective, the story is unapologetically escapist, the song and dance numbers aren't so silly that I wanted to skip them and at least one of them actually moved forward the underlying drama, rather than being just a number. And then there's the tension. The stakes are high from the beginning and the cricket game itself is presented in just a way that the tension never really lets up until all almost four hours is said and done.One of the problems is that the characters are all very simplistic. The villain character is played over the top, which makes sense in the simple world of simple characters that's described here. Perhaps if you let yourself get caught up in the simple world presented and can hit the switch in your brain that cares about what's real, this isn't a problem. But I think the character is so entirely bad (and the hero so entirely good) that it's hard to believe characters in this movie to be real, for the most part.Another problem I have with this film is a problem I have with most musicals: many of the song and dance numbers are long and some of them are unnecessary for the purposes of storytelling. I understand that it's all part of a show, but sometimes I feel like all these things are either just tacked on, or a story is tacked onto a series of somewhat related songs. Which was why I was relieved that not every number was pointless. The movie is also really long and some trimming could help it be a little easier to find time to watch.I'd say that its escapism is a negative trait, but I can't help but wonder if the primary audience is one that faces the harsh realities of the world every day and needs a little hope in their lives. All the same, I can't help but wonder if some of the little things the film does to "say something" about the problems of the caste system, etc., are done with little meaning, but to just appease the hopes of those watching. There is something to say about the critics of escapist films in that it helps keep the disenfranchised appeased in their situation and holding out hope rather than doing something themselves to change the situation.And when it comes to believability, the initial love triangle is fairly believable, but the second complication makes me uncomfortable, since it appears to be over-idealized and part of me thinks that it's also, in part, an unbelievable male fantasy, even if not acted on.Still, for as long a watch as it was, I was suitably entertained. The only real barrier to me watching more Bollywood films in the future is carving out the heroic amount of time necessary to take one in. I suspect that this film will be a joy to musical lovers. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been hundreds of good reviews and comments on this movie, and I must say that I agree with almost everything that has been said about it. So I'm not going to patronize it anymore, because everyone already knows how great it is. But I did find a couple of negative points in the movie. Things that were either silly or unnecessary. What were they? I felt that the whole romantic angle between Elizabeth and Bhuvan was completely useless and could have been avoided completely. Why couldn't Elizabeth have wanted to help them purely out of the goodness of her heart? In fact, after their first meeting when the villagers are observing the cricket match in hiding, Elizabeth asks their names, and after they've left, she actually whispers "Bhuvan" to herself... as if she's already falling for him.. ridiculous! In fact, i thought the whole Bhuvan/Elizabeth/Gauri triangle was useless and did nothing for the plot. yes, it gave a chance for our "Gori Mem" to sing a song, but come on!! The last few words in the movie claim that Elizabeth never married, and is referred to by Amitabh Bachchan (the narrator) as her remaining Bhuvan's Radha forever. A little laughable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>two passions of Indians combined in one, namely movies and cricket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lagaan is absolutely a stunning piece of work by the producer-director team of Aamir Khan and Ashutosh Gowariker. It is one of the best films i have seen in my lifetime if not the best. Thoroughly entertaining and without meaningless subplots. The screenplay is as good as it gets and the 3 hour+ film just flies by. The cricket match in the climax is an absolute highlight of the film and is as nail biting as a real sports match. The game is explained so wonderfully during the film that people with very little or no knowledge of cricket will understand what cricket is all about. Aamir Khan is delightful as the enthusiastic Bhuvan. He takes to the role as a fish takes to water. He is one of the best actors of India and people who see the film will see why he is reckoned a perfectionist in India. In short, he does magnificently well doubling as the producer and the protagonist. Newcomer Gracy Singh (Gauri) is a revelation. She is simply adorable as the jealous village belle. She dances her way into viewers' heart esp in the "Radha kaise na jale" number. Rest of the cast is on target as well. The music by A.R.Rehman is another positive aspect of the film. The songs heighten the impact of the film unlike many other Indian films where songs act as deterrents in the ongoings. Cinematography has to be seen to be believed. All in all a brilliant effort. That too without leaving the commercial parameters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lagaan is untouchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah I watched lagaan the year it came out and I thought it was one the best movies that Indians have ever made and they should be proud of themselves.Its movies like these that make a person feel good about themselves and it makes you want to achieve more in life.I remember when I first watched Lagaan (3yrs ago), it was on VHS the print was terrible but it didn't stop me from watching it. I loved it even though they had cut some bits out. I later got it on DVD and I must say the quality is much better. I kept watching this movie over and over again and have studied it also, I love the making of a movie its so intriguing.Everyone puts on great a performance; Aamir khan is the Protagonist, he so realistic and versatile. He has been my fav actor since 1990 in Dil, he was great, he's one of the finest actors Bollywood has (Also you have got watch Dil Chahta Hai he puts on a great performance). Gracy is new and unique she will do fine, no one would have suited as lead actress except her, a great job. All the eleven members of the team also deserved to be applauded it was cause of them that lagaan worked, same goes for the other opposite team. Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne have done great acting; since they can't speak Hindi it would have been very difficult. They bring a certain amount of realism to the story and how British people use to be like back in the late 1800's.But most importantly, the man behind the scene deserves the most credit Ashutosh Gowariker the writer and director. This would not have been an easy movie to make and bringing it to silver screen is something amazing.I have been reading other peoples comments on lagaan as well, and many people have a problem that the length of the movie is to long, (hey look at the bright side at least you get your moneys worth) I can understand, in the beginning I found the movie a tad slow but it needed to introduce u to the village, characters, and most importantly the time frame. But once that goes ur glued to the movie till the end.Indian movies are very different to western movies, and what makes it unique are the song and dance routines, I thought the music and lyrics were so beautiful. The background music was superb. People also complained that song and dance routines are waste of time I don't think so, I think it's a way celebrating life and people like that.I really wished that lagaan would have got the Oscars, it would have been the first one for India, and all their hard work would have payed off. I haven't seen No mans Land but from the sound of it, it looks good. India just had some tough competitors.Now that lagaan has opened doors internationally India will very soon get an Oscar and I think it will be an Aamir Khan movie, which will get it.Lagaan will always remain a story untouched; Wonderfully made and showcased, I would give it ten out of ten, one of the greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

I am not a sports person and this movie definitely had a sports theme, but I didn't mind it. It felt kind of long towards the end when they played the game. It was a story of facing adversity in anyway. Its love story was told completely without kissing which in this day and age is very impressive.

		<shortDescription>Magnificent in every respect (but a shame about the elephant)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be put off if you're unfamiliar with cricket. I was surprised, given the film's intended audience (i.e., Indian), but "Lagaan" bends over backwards to make sure that even people who have never heard of cricket know what's going on and understand the rules as much as they need to in order to appreciate the progress of the game. (North American baseball and football films are never so charitable to outsiders.)And forget the reputation the sport has among those who don't know how it's played. Cricket is, in fact, the most exciting, and certainly the most dramatic, of all sports. Yes, test matches can last up to five days (and had been known to last longer before the five-day limit was imposed), but that's the point: only cricket CAN last for five days without sending the crowd to sleep. Most other sports would be pushing it at two hours. Only a game of cricket COULD bear the emotional weight which "Lagaan" places upon its lengthy finale. The conclusion to "Lagaan" is long, at once exhilarating and almost unbearably tense ? and, ultimately, liberating.No other sport is so well suited to the democratic ideals "Lagaan" wishes to express, either. It's possible to describe someone by saying "He looks like a rugby player" or "He looks like a basketball player"; but "He looks like a cricket player" is meaningless. Almost any physical skill can find a foothold in cricket. (And you never know WHICH skill will prove crucial in winning a match.) Cricket admits all sorts; but once admitted, the division of labour is admirably egalitarian. Every single player, even those who got into the team solely on the strength of their ability to throw a ball so as to make it bounce sideways, must bat; everyone, even those whose only natural ability is to swing a bat at a moving object, must field. It's a pity that not everyone must bowl, but the uncertain length of innings would make such a rule unworkable; and anyway, in long test matches especially, a cricket captain would LIKE every member of his team to be able to bowl, and certainly wants as many different styles of bowling at his disposal as possible. ?The result of all this is, the world's best cricket players look nothing like one another, yet considerably like ordinary human beings.?But back to the film. It's marvellous. It comes along at just the right time to prove (although it has been proven many times in the past) that films considerably longer than Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" episodes don't have to be monumentally boring. "Lagaan" is never less than entertaining, and (despite the occasional moment when it stretches too far ? there are maybe two or three moments in the whole three-and-three-quarter hours) ends up being genuinely moving and inspiring. By saying this I'm probably betraying the fact that it's the first big Bollywood picture I've seen; but it also shows that the skill and energy required to stage live action musical numbers has not vanished from the face of the Earth, after all. It's not true that "Lagaan" has everything. It's better than that: it has precisely as much as it can hold together in the one story, and no more.Just one teensy little criticism ?Spoiler ahead?As you'd guess from the subtitle ("Once Upon a Time in India"), "Lagaan" is, in addition to everything else, a fairytale; or at least, while the bulk of its presence is elsewhere, it has a kind of shadow life as a fairytale, too. The rule-of-three motif is used frequently: the same thing happens twice; then, the third time, it's different. I was expecting this rule to be used on the elephant (and I'm sure everyone else in the audience was, too). Two times the ball rolls through a gap in the boundary to annoy a nearby elephant; I was sure that the third time this happened, the elephant would sit on the ball, thus allowing the local team (probably when they were struggling with batsmen who for one reason or another were constrained in their ability to run back and forth, or when they needed to score a seemingly impossible number of runs in the last few overs) to get, say, ten runs off the one ball. But it didn't happen. We never see the elephant again. The game DOES end in fine style, and I suppose in a manner more respectful to the nature of the game, but all the same ? I was a little disappointed. That's all.I wasn't disappointed by anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lagaan is a tale from India in the times were the Indian people had to pay high taxes to the British rulers, since India was considered to be a ''piece'' of the British Empire. In one village where Bhuvan, Gauri and other friends live, they asked for the British rulers to not pay the taxes of that year, since the rains didn't come. The British decides to challenge the guys of that village to play cricket with them: if the Indians win, their wish will become true; if it doesn't, they will have to pay even bigger taxes to the British officers. I think 'Lagaan'is a masterpiece and it was one of the first Indian movies I watched in my life. The costumes and scenarios are beautiful as the musics sang.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best cricket movie ever made.Set in India in the late-1800s, the local British rulers are imposing excessively high taxes on the local population. One of the local villagers has a run-in with the senior British officer, resulting in a cricket match between the British and the villagers. If the villagers win, they don't have to pay taxes for three years. If they lose, they have to pay three times their usual taxes.Interesting, engaging movie with some of the most realistic cricket scenes you'll see in a movie. The April 2004 edition of The Wisden Cricketer, probably the foremost cricket magazine in the world, had their list of the top 10 cricket moments in movies, and Lagaan come in at number 1. I wholeheartedly agree with their assessment. Cricket in movies is normally very badly done, looking as if the director had no clue about the sport. Even Bodyline, the movie about the infamous 1932 Bodyline series, had some laughable moments (eg the England wicket-keeper, Les Ames, standing up to the wicket for the express pace of Harold Larwood!). Considering that it was a movie exclusively about an historic cricket series, thus is even more cricket-centric than Lagaan, which is as much a human drama as a cricket movie, Bodyline's cricket scenes were very badly done. (Bodyline's script was just as bad, very biased and propaganda-like: going out of it's way to be anti-English). I expected similar inaccuracies in Lagaan and was pleasantly surprised. While there are some minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies, this is truly the most accurate and best cricket movie ever made. It is also good as a drama, not just a cricket movie, so recommended for those less-into-cricket too. (Aside: Bodyline came in at Number 3 on Wisden's list).</fullReview>

The musical numbers bring to mind Hollywood of the forties and Broadway.I was interested too to see the costumes and props of the period, again from the Indian point of view. It is not something kids growing up in white-bread suburbia get exposed to as a rule, at least not in the 60's and 70's when I was in school. So I found it educational as well as entertaining.There was certainly more of the older style Hollywood in the acting than the more "method" approach of modern actors.

		<shortDescription>History, culture and sports - and Indian "Rocky"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Indian friend of mine shared this film with me. I enjoyed it very much. I had seen Indian films before, so I was prepared for the "cast of a thousand" musical production numbers. I also knew something about Indian history and culture, but almost nothing about cricket, except that people from former British colonies have become superior players, much in the same way that baseball players from Latin and Caribbean backgrounds are now powerhouses of the "American" sport. I thought "Lagaan" would be mostly "about cricket". I was not prepared for a film that had so many levels.I think it is plain that the villagers' struggle to "beat the British at their own game" is a metaphor for the "power of the human spirit" (regardless of culture), as well as the nascent potential of India, and other "non-western" countries, to learn from and compete with the west in spheres of art, science, culture, industry, and sports. The film tries to be "balanced" in showing that not ALL westerners are "bad guys", nor are all Indians "good guys", however, there is a clear villain and a likable hero.The film weaves a romantic subplot, historical elements, the main conflict (multi-caste/ethnic Indian villagers vs. the haughty British occupiers), the details of the sport (cricket), comic and dramatic elements, even song &amp; dance numbers in such a way that the film does not seem overlong. The film is plotted and paced beautifully. Some might find it too "saccharine", but I think that, like the sports classic "Rocky", "Lagaan" believes in the qualities of compassion, patience, endurance, ingenuity, teamwork, sportsmanship and love that it espouses - and as a result, the film works! If you have NOT seen many Indian films other than "Monsoon Wedding", but you are open-minded and like sports, culture and history, be prepared to step back in time to the days of the British Raj as seen from an Indian point of view. I think you will enjoy "Lagaan".</fullReview>

Yet they did it so cleverly and without much fuss that it was compatible with the Indian Mainstream, as well as contain so much depth to story and characters that it impressed higher categories of film-viewers too and thus reached the Oscars.The genially balanced blend of Myth-Legend and Bollywood-Spice Film had everything I desire from a good film: Fresh and interesting visuals, rich and diverse characters to relate to, stunning music and a riveting storyline. A game of cricket to decide a dispute, not more. It wasn't necessary.Normally such a film would not have had much success in India, for complicated themes requiring some general knowledge (in this case historical) just does not click. Indians want real-life soaps 3 hours long.But this worked, because it took to the most primitive forms of entertainment and didn't get to involved in historical matters.I loved it.

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: The Bravest Bollywood Effort of the New Millennium!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lagaan. It's not everyday affair when something like Lagaan happens. When Bollywood entered the new millennium, it was still craving for a turning point which takes Bollywood to international stage. Ashutosh Gowariker came with an idea which defies Bollywood norms by leaps and bounds, Aamir Khan is hooked by the idea as an actor and takes the risky decision of producing the movie on its own so that idea gets the much deserved heart felt treatment and what happened later is a history now. Lagaan year after year is considered the Bollywood's bravest effort of the new millennium.In its unbelievable plot where our hero a villager played by Mr. perfectionist Aamir Khan accepts the challenge of egoist British Commander Officer to play a cricket match in which if village wins, they need not to pay taxes for next three years. Even with a run time of 3 hours and 40 minutes, movie never gets out of steam, in fact gets better with every passing moment. An array of colorful characters played by credible actors, the mesmerizing music and back ground score of maestro A.R.Rahman, soulful lyrics of Javed Akhtar, a water tight screenplay with not a single out of the place scene and the genuine feeling of honesty and simplicity, all these factors make Lagaan an outstanding movie of modern times. First half is a smooth journey of introducing characters, the challenge, the team making and the match preparation. Second half is a like watching a nail biting cricket match. The movie is a perfect example that with full commitment and hard work, Bollywood can create the international level cinema with ease.Lagaan turned out to be an inspiration for audience and its makes alike. After Lagaan, Aamir Khan appeared into Taare Zameen Par, Rang De Basanti and 3 Idiots. Ashutosh made Swades and Jodhaa Akbar. I am going with mind blowing 9 out of 10 for Lagaan. It's a sin for any movies fan to miss Lagaan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kind of movie that makes you feel like a kid again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a poor village in colonial times cannot afford to pay the tax levied by the British troops, rebellious farmer Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) accepts a wager: if the villagers can beat the British officers at cricket, they will be exempt from tax for three years, if they lose, they'll have to pay triple the amount. This is the kind of old-fashioned entertainment that Hollywood can no longer make: it's crowd-pleasing and shamelessly manipulative but never in an obvious or cynical way and even though the ?underdog vs. champ'-plot is completely predictable, it's done with such sincerity and enthusiasm that it feels as if it's being invented anew. Lagaan offers four hours (yes, four!) of the kind of cinema that makes you root for the good guys, despise the villain and hope the hero gets the girl. And you won't be able to get those songs out of your head.****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughly entertaining combining two of India's great obsessions - Bollywood film &amp; the sport of cricket.Certainly not a short film at over 3&amp;1/2 hours &amp; although it last longer than the current Zimbabwean batting line up would, Lagaan moves along at a brisk pace, suffering few if any dull patches.The cinematography is great, as is the sound. The songs are fun too!The cricket scenes are well staged &amp; filmed quite well.I was impressed overall with the English cast, especially the fact that it appears many of the cast appeared to have learnt to speak fluent Hindi, minor touches such as these can make a huge difference to a film like this.A great film for cricket fans &amp; non cricket fans alike, even if the end is a tad predictable &amp; not unexpected. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A joy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many other viewers, I just picked this DVD up from my local library not sure quite what to expect. 2 discs and 225 minutes later I too was cheering and whooping in delight. OK, the story is nothing original but the exquisite manner and sheer love of detail in which it is told cannot fail to win you over. The Indian leads are charming, funny, delightful and earn our compassion whilst the English leads play the Imperalists down to a tea (no pun intended) And as for th supporting cast! Wow...just sheer joy. For me I can't understand why the overrated mish-mash that is The Pianist scoops up the plaudits whilst this glorious understated masterpiece slips by unnoticed. Go rent it now!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to Indian flavors, this movie is long and choral, but visually extremely powerful and musically stunning by its perfection and strange beauty. Every character out of the over twenty main characters from both the local and 'visitors' team is wonderfully developed and seamless integrated in this simple yet eternal tale on bravery and honor, in which thrill builds up as the match goes ahead.The simple embedded love story works as a join between two worlds, two cultures, which actually never meet in a direct clash. A beautifully crafted movie to enjoy for both western and eastern audiences, where cricket is just a wonderful alibi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching, well-written musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie based on a trailer that I saw on another foreign film rental. I had really no idea what to expect. I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. The trailer I saw was so vibrant, but there was no way to know that it would be written and shot so well. (Not to mention that the cast was beautiful and brilliant.) It took about 15-20 min to acclimate myself to the film, BUT, I was entering a foreign country and exposing myself to a completely unknown culture.LAGAAN was a touching, well-written musical film that , I think, should be for the Hindu community what THE SOUND OF MUSIC is to Americans. Though it was lengthy, the script surprised me at several pivital turns. The stakes were raised for our heroic villagers more times than I expected. The music was new for me and I became mesmerized by it. The English translations of the songs were nothing short of heart-wrenching poetry. The diversity of the characters added conflict and comedy. Many of them had to overcome personal downfalls to lift their community out of bondage. I cared not only for the hero and heroine, but about 7 or 8 minor supporting characters. THAT is not only good writing, but F***ing brilliant acting!!!! This movie was colorful, beautiful, spiritually uplifting, and entertaining, while still being educational on facets of the Hindu culture/spirituality, the caste system (the most moving character for me was 'the Untouchable') and a period of their history. I screamed and cheered. I got misty and cried. It was a long film, but well worth the wait.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.... how many movies keep you engrossed for almost four running hours? the brilliance of Lagaan is evident from keeping your interest up to the last minute and stimulating the audience to numerous scenic applause's.It could have been a few minutes shorter - but that would be at the cost of detail, drama, humor, or perhaps leaving the spectators unsatisfied. The picture as it is, is worth seeing and somehow brings close association to current world affairs in which one dominant nation seem to act up in full ignorance of the ethical and cultural diversity of this (our) planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film very much. It is a classic story in which the underdog eventually triumphs over his suppressors. Colonial times revisited, and hard times they were for the villagers in India where the film is set. The British demand more tax ('lagaan') to be payed, but since a drought has plagued the country there is hardly enough crop for the farmers to survive. They are desperate. What to do? Hopefully a game of cricket will change their fate. The villagers select a team that have to defeat the British who of course think themselves Goliath. It is a game against all odds. Should the villagers win, they won't have to pay 'lagaan' for a period of three years. Should they lose, they will have to pay triple the amount. The three day cricket game in the film is portrayed very convincingly. I watched 'Lagaan' on dvd with two cricket fans like me and we thought the cricket scenes were very realistic. The story develops in a slow manner but that does not raise any objections, for in a way the duration of the film (225 minutes!) reflects the pace of life in 1890's rural India as well as the course of a decent game of cricket. There is ample song and dance in the film as well which sort of gives it an oriental 'Sound of Music'-like pretension. The dance scenes are well-orchestrated and quite enjoyable, though they tend to hold up the story too much. I suppose this is very Bollywood. To summarize: yeah, I like 'Lagaan' a lot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bona-fide popular indian film on western screen at last? Maybe not, but it looks more Bollywood than many others "d'auteur" movies from India. Thinking of it rationally, it looks like a Disney Cartoon. Silhouetted dancers against a red sun with heavy drumming in the background as in Lion King; the white heroine throwing doves singing I'm in loooove in high pitches like Cinderella or Snow White, villanious Brits with big teeth flashing through moustaches as they sneer nastily at poor "coloured" as in Tarzan; the Indian girl frowning childish as Mulan. And musical numbers every now and then. But it works, it works, it works. Sometimes you can smile at the naive approach or rough editing, but I bet you won't be bored by sitting for 4 hours thru' this story. It has the same appeal films used to have on us when we were kids. And if it is Disney, is first class Disney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard the premise for Lagaan--a nearly 4 hour movie about 19th century Indian farmers taking on the British in a cricket match over taxes, almost entirely in Hindi, and, oh yeah, it's also a musical--all I could think is that somebody must not have been paying attention the day this one was given the green light. After reading numerous glowing reviews, though, I decided to give it a chance. None of the local video rental places had a copy (no surprise there), and I was hesitant to buy something I had so many doubts about. My wife finally got sick of hearing my debates with myself over it every time we went to Best Buy, so she bought it for me for Fathers Day. I'm now thrilled that she did! This is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. While I felt the first 15-20 minutes or so dragged a little (this may simply have been me adjusting to the language &amp; subtitles--something that generally happens any time I watch a movie in a language I've not heard before), the rest of the movie was spectacular. The story moves along at a good pace, and is fun and engrossing. The music, which was one of the things I had the most doubts about, was great (the sole exception being the English-language portion of the love song).Overall, it was a fun, energetic movie whose tone reminded me of an old Hollywood musical. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but the biggest surprise you'll get from the movie is just how much you'll like it. While it may not be for everyone, I really can't recommend Lagaan enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Lagaan"'s multi-talented Indian cast has a great time dancing and singing its way through this very entertaining story. Producers of American musicals should learn a lesson or two from the way Aamir Khan has assembled this movie. By the end, each Indian character is individualized and at the same time significant as an allegorical figure in a modern legend of how to live with grace and courage, even under political oppression. The British villain is the one cardboard character in the movie, but it's clear from the start that he's only meant to be a foil for the hero and his friends. Anyone who likes this movie will want the soundtrack, which is appealing across countries.(Aamir Khan, by the way, also appears in the movie "Earth.")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hoot, but very affecting, too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this story of love and honor during the British Raj highly entertaining. It's all very formulaic but great fun. Virtually everything in it is recycled from something else ? it's Rocky, Gandhi and MTV all rolled into one, with a heavy overlay of American-style political correctness. But it's all done with pizzazz. I loved the photography, the music (by the amazing A.R. Rahman) and the cast. I especially liked the performances of Aamir Khan as the hero and Gracy Singh as the spunky girl who loves him. They are both gorgeous (once you get past the nose ring on her) and have charm galore. The choreography is a hoot. Some of the dialogue is a scream. My favorite line: `You can't fool me. I know which way the Ganges flows.' The film is a campy, over-the-top melodrama, but its heartfelt earnestness makes it surprisingly affective. The movie has moments of sheer exhilaration. On the whole it's very sweet and uplifting. It's long, but always interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I predict that this movie will gain a huge cult following in America and spawn many English-language films with a similar style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Movie takes you back to 1940's when INDIA was a British Colony. Back then Indian Farmers had to give atleast 50% of the Cultivated product to the English Govt as a form of Revenue, which means LAGAAN in Indian Language. And one season There was Not enough Rain for people to grow enough to live, and giving lagaan was not even a possibilty but british Rulers are way too shrued to exempt them from that so they leave them with one Condition in order to get rid of the LAGAAN which was to Defeat the british Rulers in a game of Cricket and if they don't win they might have to pay double tax which was to give them everything they cultivate the whole season. So one revolutionist farmer Aamir Khan (the main lead of the film) takes up the challenge thinking that its almost impossible for them to pay them even single tax, double tax wouldn't make anything worse then it already is... so the film describes the sheer power and will of these Indian farmers which makes them Succeed!! The movie is nominated in The OSCARS under the best foriegn film and I believe it should get it with Ease... The BOTTOM LINE - A great MOVIE ...</fullReview>

If you have never seen a Hindi film before, or if you are not in tune with Indian culture, then my advice is to have patience while watching the first 30 minutes or so. This is certainly not Hollywood, but 100% Bollywood - at its best! Although I live in a country with cricket only second to rugby, I do not like cricket and never watch it - but I did in fact enjoy the cricket in this film - my wife included. Towards the end, there is a spiritual aspect of this film that brought tears to my eyes and radiance to my heart. Marvelous! There is not much more that I can add here (considering the many wonderful comments below) except to say that the romance and symbolism is a joy to see. Yes, there are some simplistic soap opera segments, but this is in fact a Bollywood film, so I embrace this difference and see it as wholesome and refreshingly moralistic.

		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of Bollywood movies, but I found "Lagaan" to be an enjoyable film.Of course, it isn't "Two Women," "The Bicycle Thief," "Seven Samurai," "Umberto D" or even on par with "The Apu Trilogy" and "Salaam Bombay!" (which, by the way, should have won the Oscar for best foreign film, instead of "Pelle the Conqueror.") But not every film can be on par with these classics and life would be awfully boring if that were the case. Sometimes, you ought to be able to sit through a corny film and enjoy it - and that's what happens with "Lagaan."There's something delightfully infectious about "Lagaan." And although the running time is close to four hours, the time whizzes by.I was not bored by this film. It was a fun experience, the music has a jovial quality to it and the entire film is truly a thoroughly satisfying experience. If you want to see a "The Bicycle Thief" or "Two Women," and that's the only type of film you want to see, then by all means see those masterpieces. But if you're in the mood for some diverting fun, watch "Lagaan." It is worth it.</fullReview>

The film is a mixture of drama , love and competition. In this film , we get attached to the different character with each character. Is the first film that i watch Bollywood.For negatives:The film is good but it is a bit too long. It is mostly in the middle of the film does not happen much and that they are boring... I liked the movie ends badly : that British win facing the people. It would have allowed us to understand the pain of the people who were colonized at the same time in 1893.In conclusion , i found this film good but with elements to change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. This film really deserved an Oscar. Because this film is the definition of a perfect film. And not the masala type of commercially "perfect" film, but the perfect film from a cinematic experience point of view. It has everything. First off, a great and inspiring story that features Indian villagers facing cruel and unfair Britishers in a game of cricket, which is something the villagers have no experience of. If the Indian villagers win, they are free of the British in their area and the enormous and painful land taxes they must pay. This story was inspiring and very exciting to watch and gripped me till the end. I cheered when India was saved in the end by the catch that didn't count. Second, the performances. Aamir Khan was magnificent. He played his character with so much passion and intensity. This was truly one of his finest performances. Also, the lead actress Gracy Singh did great and also showed that she has the skills to be a fine actress. The rest of the cast, including the British actors, also had powerful performances. And the third reason this movie was great is that it had everything. Drama, romance, action, thrill, intensity, great music, powerful and intense performances, and great direction by Ashutosh Gowariker that made one of the most gripping and inspiring stories come so finely onto the screen. Also, A.R. Rahman's soundtrack was beautiful; one of the best soundtracks in Bollywood history. His music helped add to the film's emotions. This movie deserved all the awards it got and also definitely deserved an Oscar. Overall, I would rate this film a 10 out of 10 and recommend anyone to surely watch this masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is widely regarded as one of the greatest Bollywood movies of all time and it definitely deserves that recognition. The scope, production budget and attention to detail were unprecedented for the time in which it was released. Apart from that, the natural performances given by the actors make the movie one to remember. The runtime of the movie is absolutely huge but surprisingly passes by in a breeze. The wonderful soundtrack composed by A.R. Rahman is one of the best ever and it complements the movie beautifully. Aamir Khan shows that he is one of the most talented actors in India and always chooses his movies wisely. I hope that other filmmakers take inspiration from this movie and try to make more such movies which show the real India. A must watch for all cinema-goers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This work of art is a film of childhood memory. Loved the great amount of emotional depth portrayed by Aamir Khan in the way it was required. The bar was set high and he achieved it through working all of the other characters into his as if he knew them for years. The cinematography when Paul Blackthorne catches the ball to the slow pan downwards really captured the hearts of the audience. These scenes are memorable forever for the ones who went through these harsh times in India. This film's cast from the baby face of the protagonist and the fierce look in the eyes of Paul Blackthorne. Great movie! Must see film if you're an Indian. Drama packed action with some romantic love reminiscing behind the tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India" is an Indian musical movie in which we watch the people of a small village in Victorian India try to survive due to difficult circumstances. In these difficulties came one more about the taxes and everything will be judged on a game of cricket between the locals and the British.I liked this movie because it was something different for me and I found it very interesting and beautiful. I also liked this movie because of the plot and the storyline. The direction which made by Ashutosh Gowariker was magnificent and equally good was the music and dancing. About the interpretations I have to mention the interpretation of Aamir Khan who played as Bhuvan and he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Paul Blackthorne's who played as Captain Andrew Russell and of course the beautiful's Rachel Shelley's who played as Elizabeth Russell.Finally I have to say that "Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India" is a very interesting movie to watch because it shows what happened to India in the Victorian times. What difficulties Indian people got through and how were their lives back then. Musical movies are different than the classic movies but I believe that this movie is not just a musical movie because it teaches us many things about India and its culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my First Review for a movie. Although I don't have much emotion and time to write a review I think this movie deserved to be known from the eyes of the biggest Fan. The movie is an Epic and I considered it as my top 5 favorite of all time.(The Godfather, The shawshank Redemption, The Dark Knight,Fight Club are other four.) The Movie is underrated because of its limitation to receive global Viewership. It deserved to nominate for Oscar more than most of the movies that have been nominated. The plot is epic and the actors have played there part very well. The music by A.R Rahman and the Lyrics by Javed Akhtar is extra Ordinary. The kind of sentiments we have for cricket, Social discrimination, Love Triangle have been depicted in an fabulous way. The movie captures the heart of India and for me is the best Indian movie ever been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As it was directed by Ashutosh Govarikar, there is no doubt from watching the movie. As the Lagaan tells about kind of true stories that had ever been happening in India when it was ruled by British government, it makes feel to be on real world living. When in the middle the movie feels to be slow but it has to be as the directed tried to be realistic. Lagaan is the story of those people who were condemned brutally by British Govt. Songs of these movies are euphonious. It is the music direction by A.R. Rehman-who is one of best music director all over the world. He has already been applauded with as Oscar. And the reputed singers-Lata Mangeshkar, Udit Narayan, Asha Bhosale, Sukhwinder Singh make these songs more melodious. And the lyricist- Javed Akhtar made the wonderful combination of words which made song worthwhile ever.The captain's sister plays a wonderful role. She not only sacrifice her relations with her family and British govt but also the love with the Indian superstar. Over all i loved the movie as it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The year is 1893 in a small village in the heart of India. A British Cantonment bordered the village. They protect the local Raja from neighboring Rajas as well as the other Rajas. So they are able to demand Lagaan (tax) from the hard-upon local villagers. There is a drought but the cruel arrogant Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne) doesn't care and doubles the Lagaan. Local villager Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) rallies the villagers to appeal to the Raja. There they witness their first game of cricket played by the British. Russell offers to forgive the Lagaan for the entire province for the next three years if Bhuvan can lead a team to beat the British. If the villagers lose, he will triple the Lagaan. Few villagers believe in the gamble except for Gauri (Gracy Singh) who loves Bhuvan. The captain's sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) comes to teach the hopeless villagers how to play the foreigner's game.Indian movies are not usually my thing but this one works very well. I'm still not a big fan of the Bollywood song and dance. However the story works here. The Captain is a bit of a cartoon who needs to be a better villain. The love story is good but the love triangle needs to hold off its resolution. The game is pretty much a Bad News Bear situation where all the disparate players join together. The game is interesting. They made it compelling and almost understandable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long cricket epic, simple but effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable Bollywood sports epic which celebrates the victory of a ragtag bunch of Indian villagers in cricket against British army officers in late 19th century India. The cricket match is long but never boring and there's a surprising amount of tension generated even though the outcome is never in doubt . Alas, the script paints the Brits as black-hearted villains. They are practically caricatures hell bent on abusing the native population. Still, the film works well, thanks to the strong lead performances. Aamir Khan is effective as the hero Bhuvan who challenges the English.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A must watch movie for all Indians since we're such cricket buffs. An epic colonial tale of a challenge taken by a group of Indian villagers to get away without paying taxes, in the form of a cricket match against a team formed by the British officers.These rural people are barely acquaint with the basics of the sport, however, a win against all odds happens to be their only chance to battle through a period of unrelenting drought..what else do you want for a reason to like this movie..legendary stuff..When you look at the storyline which was arguably based on a true story as well, and the way it was directed, it surely stands out as one of them movies, which changed the way movies were made in India, with a greater sense of purpose and motive being instilled in our system to raise the barriers that long denied Indian movies, the international fame. A testament to this is that since then, a number of Indian movies have won hearts abroad, and I'm sure that awards will follow suit..Nominated for Oscar, and in all fairness it deserved to be, as well, and though the award was nicked by another deserving movie, the adrenaline it pumped into the Indian cinema was a far greater achievement, and the change that it brought about, may win us many Oscars in future..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lagaan Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The price of making a four hour film is that of having a much more difficult time holding the attention of your audience for its full runtime. In the case of Asutosh Gowariker's 2001 epic, Lagaan: Once Upon A Time In India, it is rare to at any point have such a thought of losing interest in the cleverly crafted Bollywood film. Gowariker pays special attention to each and every shot as if it were its own innovative painting making sure there is always an array of activity to keep one's eye active.Lagaan tells the story of a poverty-stricken Hindu town that is struggling to cope with the oppression and high lagaan taxes of the British Raj. Upon the initiation of a further increase in the tax, the peasants begin to speak out begging for the tax to be lowered. In result, the British officers lend the proposition of a cruel intended-deal; a game of cricket will be held between the British officers and peasants. If the peasants succeed in victory they are exempt of any taxes for the next 3 years, if they lose, they will pay triple lagaan. This erupts into a predictable yet touching Hindu rendition of The Mighty Ducks from this point on.Although the story is cliché and somewhat overdone, it remains fresh to the naked eye due to the remarkable design outside of the script itself. Aamir Khan presents a beautifully performed display as Bhuvan, the only initial peasant to stand up for his community against the British. The supporting cast accents Khan to an ideal level as well, most notably Paul Blackthorne in the dark and immoral role of Captain Russell who plays the antagonist of this film with a respectable conviction and stereotypical "bad-guy waxed moustache."This is a visual masterpiece as well composed of gorgeous sweeping shots and vivid color which never seems to fall off the deep end as too "cartoony." Somewhere at about an hour into this drama, we see a musical spontaneously erupt which is covered in long shots opposed to a montage style- an interesting approach to musical numbers in film. Down to the bone, this is a very typical film portrayed in a completely innovative and well-done way; the writing is beautiful throughout as are the performance. It's painful but honest to say that this film overcomes its shallowness by being simply "really damn entertaining."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>over the top, but definitely worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've never seen an Indian movie - I've only seen a few - then "Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India" should give you a good inkling. This story of the Indian people's resistance to colonialism (in the form of a cricket game) goes over the top in just about every way. As is often the case in Hindi films, the characters break out into song at one point. I also noticed that the Indians call the English "ferengi" (like on "Star Trek"); I think that the word might mean "foreigner" in Hindi.Overall, this is a fine piece of work from the subcontinent, and I certainly recommend it. I haven't seen enough Indian movies to determine if this is among the greatest, but it definitely makes one appreciate the work coming from Bollywood. Starring Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh, Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lagaan" takes place in India, in a small village, ruled by the British, which is facing a drought due to the lack of rain because there hasn't been any monsoons. The lack of rain led to the loss of many crops. Even worse Captain Russell, a British captain, decides to raise the land tax also known as the Lagaan. This becomes even more impossible for the villagers to pay so they try to talk things out with Captain Russell. Captain Russell, knowing that the villagers have no clue about the game or Cricket, he challenges them to a game and gives them a few months to practice. If they win, they don't have to pay the Lagaan, but if they lose, they have to pay even more. Bhuvan takes up the challenge and gathers up a team. Bhuvan and his team is then aided by Elizabeth Russell, Captain Russell's sister. While all of this is going on, the movie is also a love story. Bhuvan is in love with one of the villagers named Gauri. Gauri then gets a bit jealous of the relationship between Bhuvan and Elizabeth.The acting in "Lagaan" was very good. At sometimes a little over dramatic but I think that added some comedy to the film. The set design was also very good. It portrayed the drought that the villagers had to live through. Their clothing showed their religion and social class on the Caste system. I think one of the strengths of the movie was definitely the directing. Ashutosh Gowariker did a very good job in getting my attention during dramatic scenes my zooming in on the actors' and actress' faces and actions. This was great especially during the Cricket game. The addition of background music made the movie even better, adding excitement and a little suspense to the movie.I give "Lagaan" eight out of ten stars. I think the movie was great but just too long for me, even though I expected it to be that long because that is the average length of a Bollywood movie. Another characteristic of Bollywood movies I'm not really a big fan of was the musical numbers. Even though it went along with the movie, it still felt a little random for me because people don't usually sing and dance randomly in real life. I'm sure if you're a fan of Bollywood movies, you would like the movie more than I did and most likely gave it ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Would you be willing to put your life on the line on a single match of baseball? One courageous Bollywood star would. Amir Khan plays Bhuvan in the movie "Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India." When a pushover British Captain, Captain Russell, messes with a small village, Champaneer, by challenging them to a game of Cricket, Bhuvan accepts the challenge on behalf of the village. The only consequence to losing this match would be to pay triple Lagaan, or tax, which was paid in food. This movie offers a suspenseful plot full of drama, music, romance, and action. The movie is very interesting in itself, but it's also pretty predictable."Lagaan" takes place in Colonial India, not present day. Most of the common folk were poor farmers. The monsoons where late that year, causing the villagers to grow little crop to pay their Lagaan to the government, even for themselves to survive. The living conditions are very believable as the setting matches the dessert environment perfectly for a poor Indian farmer. Captain Russell, played by Paul Blackthorne, is the collector of these taxes and wishes only to have power. Bhuvan first encounters the captain during a hunting scene when he is scaring off the animals so they don't get killed. Captain Russell recognizes him as a threat and so challenges him and village to a game of cricket. There was already a double Lagaan placed, and so the wager was if the villagers win they don't have to pay lagan for three year. However, if they lose they must pay triple lagan for this year, which would cause the village to starve to death. Bhuvan bravely accepts the challenge even though he doesn't know how to play the game, as he thought he did. The villagers where a little upset for placing such a wager, but Captain Russells sister, Elizabeth, played by Rachel Shelly, saw the unfairness of her brother and offered to teach them the game. The story gets dramatic and even comical as Bhuvan rounds up his players. Bhuvan is the main unifier as he breaks Indian tradition and sets aside the caste system and accepts a Muslim. The plot gets really suspenseful as the game starts and the underdog rises gradually. The game comes close towards the end and both teams are nervous.This Bollywood movie shows a great deal of Indian culture through musicals and in the storyline itself. The story seems possible but not likely. However, it's very entertaining and suspenseful. If the movie were cutoff, you'd be upset because you want to know what happens next. Even though the storyline may have a predictable plot, the director arranges it so things get interesting, such as an untouchable, lower caste member, joins the team. Over it's a great movie and I recommend it as an exciting movie. I give it an eight out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lengthy Epic About an Era-Defining Cricket Match Brings Out the Best of Bollywood Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of sitting through a 3 3/4-hour film about a cricket match didn't appeal to me until I read the reviews for this 2001 Indian extravaganza set in rural 1893 British colonial-ruled India. It's really the only home-grown Bollywood film I've ever seen if you don't count Gurinder Chadha's disappointing multi-cultural Jane Austen adaptation, 2004's "Bride and Prejudice". The film's title, "Lagaan", refers to the annual crop tax charged by the British army to the provincial Rajah, who in turn, must collect the lagaan from the local villagers.The plot begins with a drought which has hit the village making it near-impossible for them to pay the lagaan. The cruel, capricious Captain Russell is indifferent to the fate of the villagers and decides to charge double-lagaan. The villagers plead with the Rajah to cancel this year's lagaan in deference to the drought, so the captain proposes a challenge that will either wipe out the lagaan for the next three years or force the villagers to pay triple-lagaan at once. The challenge takes the form of a cricket match between the local British command and a ragtag team of villagers organized and led by a renegade villager, the hot-tempered Bhuvan.The middle of the film focuses on two plot strands - the local team's haphazard preparation for the match aided by Russell's sympathetic sister Elizabeth, and the romantic triangle that develops between Bhuvan, Elizabeth and Gauri, the local girl smitten since childhood with Bhuvan. Amazingly, about eighty minutes of the final portion are taken up by the cricket match itself in painstaking detail. Even if you know nothing about the rules of the game (as I don't), it is inarguably the best part of the movie. Granted there is little suspense in the outcome and cricket is not the most visual of sports, director Ashutosh Gowariker makes the extended sequence exciting in spite of itself thanks to the creative ways he develops the drama of the match.The rest of the film is a bit more variable, especially the rather slow set-up of the story, but as a whole, the movie is enlivened by the inevitable Bollywood production numbers. Unlike "Bride", the numbers are not interjected as pure kitsch but feed more organically into the plot. What also helps is A.R. Rahman's atmospheric music. One should understand from the outset that this is not a movie of great emotional complexity or dramatic subtlety. Almost every aspect of the film is very in-your-face, and for the most part, the acting reflects such a tone. However, the disparate elements somehow hold together, and Gowariker manages the even rarer feat of making the nearly four-hour running time fly by.Aamir Khan is a charismatic presence as Bhuvan, and Gracy Singh is certainly pleasing enough as Gauri. Whether forcing the Rajah to eat meat or beating down a villager, Russell is played with such moustache-twirling excess by Paul Blackthorne that his unrepentant villainy becomes laughable along the lines of Snidely Whiplash. Rachel Shelley, bearing a certain resemblance to Courtney Cox, fares better as Elizabeth, though her character seems frustratingly passive despite her bold efforts to help the villagers. Suhasini Mulay lends dignity to her role as Bhuvan's mother, as does Kulbhushan Kharbanda as the Rajah.Each of the Indian players makes individual impressions, the most affecting being the crippled untouchable Kachra (played poignantly by Aditya Lakhia), at first rejected and then embraced because his palsied arm provides an unhittable corkscrew throw. Special mention should be given to Anil Mehta's sun-drenched cinematography which captures the rural landscape well. The DVD includes filmographies for the principals, but of more interest is the eighteen-minute deleted scene which shows more explicitly Elizabeth's efforts to help the team and her growing infatuation with Bhuvan. Even with its predictable story and relatively shallow characters, the film bursts with such energy and historical detail that it is well worth sitting through the lengthy running time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lagaan, a tale of survival, struggle, love and courage and for those of you who have heard this too often it adds a twist ? a cricket match between two particularly different cultures in mind, traditions and techniques. Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India, directed by Ashutosh Gowariker and starring Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh, Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne is a movie that not only invites viewers of different cultures, as can be seen by the variety of both Indian and British actors, but also viewers of different ages. Rated PG for the lack of any sexual content and only minor violence, not only can adults and teenagers appreciate the lessons and stories of love and life, but children can enjoy the preparations to and final game of cricket. A runtime of 224 minutes encompass a wide array of genres including drama and romance, musical and sport. This story begins and ends in the village of Champaneer, with the fate of the villagers' lives resting on a game of cricket. British occupation of India during this time brings forth the conflict the villagers face: the Lagaan, a tax the Raja must pay for British services. The villagers, who provide the Raja with crops for the tax, pray for rain but their prayers go unanswered as the Lagaan threatens hunger and despair upon the entire village. Only Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) has the courage to stand up to British official Capt. Russell (Paul Blackthorne) who offers a game of cricket in return for the repeal of the Lagaan for three years, but if the British win the Lagaan will be tripled. With tension already inflamed between the Indians and British, Bhuvan and the villagers form a family, using each individual's talents to learn a game they've never played so that they could win life. Even Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley), the British sister of Capt. Russell, joins this family in hopes of helping them and finds herself in a love triangle between herself, Bhuvan and Gauri (Gracy Singh), a young Indian girl. When the day of the game comes you're left wondering whether spirits will be revived or broken for the Indian village.Even though at first I was frightened to learn the movie was about three and a half hours long, I have to say as a viewer I did not feel them. Not only is the script historically accurate and both humorous and dramatic at the right moments, the plot keeps you guessing, waiting the entire movie. An easy story to follow, the director provides just the right amount of suspense and relief to keep you going. The director I believe is a master of the camera as he uses various camera angles to get the viewers to feel what he intends, using both "bird's-eye" views as well as views from the ground and many more. Visually stunning, the settings and costumes were amazing from a gorgeous sunset emphasized by Gauri's sari to a dance number in the pitch black, gorgeous all the more due to the bright costumes of the women. The musicals were my favorite: stunning performances and beautiful voices but for those of you not interested in dance, the cricket game is just as intense and do not worry if you're foreign to the game: so are they. Lastly, I applaud the acting simply because they were able to get across the true elements of life: love, despair, happiness and hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many, many good movies, but I truly believe that Lagaan is the best. Aamir Khan's intensity on screen is virtually unparalleled, while the Indian supporting actors provide magnificent performances that are hilariously clichéd and yet also human with a deep originality. The nearly four-hour running time hardly ever lags -- whenever a scene begins to get slow, a huge song-and-dance number is just around the corner. The musical numbers are all incredibly complex, with stunning choreography and vibrant, dramatic vocals. You don't have to speak Hindi or even read the subtitles to want to laugh, dance or cry. There are many Bollywood movies that make it hard to sit through the first hour due to poor acting and sappy content. Lagaan, from the opening voice-over to the final moment of the big cricket match, simply makes you very, very happy.</fullReview>

Brought to life on a huge canvas which pictures the triumph of the meek over the powerful. A very David and Goliathian approach to a gentleman's game ( as cricket is most fondly addressed).A village pleads to their British command to reduce the amount of food they have to give away in the form of tax, because they don't have enough for themselves. The British command decides to grant them their wish provided the village win against them in a game of cricket. It's a brilliant effort to bring Cricket to the big screen in a way the world has not seen. And that it did by crediting itself a nomination for the "Best film in a Foreign Language" category at the Oscars.It's an absolute joyride flaunting with a lot of human emotions combined with a edge-of-the-seat finish. Great entertainment and worth every moment you spend watching it.</fullReview>

Lagaan is set in the late 1800s and is about a love triangle involving an English lady and two Indian villagers. This might be a true story as the tag line is "Once Upon a Time in India" I recommend that If you like cricket and understand Hindi then go and see it. A new face made her Bollwood debut in this movie"Gracy Singh" who was doing Indian soaps was called up to co-star with Aamir and acted excellently. Cricket is a big thing in the movie as the future of the province that they live in is decided by a cricket match between the Indian villagers with very little experience and an English team with plenty of match practise and experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing compares to the success of the human spirit, especially under tyranny. ...and thats what this film is all about.Its 1893, the location is a remote village in Rajasthan, an historic state in Northwestern India. British rule is at the peak of its cruelty in India, with British administrators pitting the mostly name-sake rulers of the provinces in Rajasthan against each other in return for a tax ...or Lagaan.This movie is a landmark, in that traditional Indian movies are 3 hours long, and often fail to tell a story. Lagaans story, on the other hand, contains many human emotions - love, lust, ego, jealousy, rage, sympathy and, of course, ambition. The plot is laid our well ...and scenes that show the careless lack of respect of the British Officer for the "Rajah's" observance of vegetarianism to the curiosity of Indian villagers when they first see the Brits playing cricket... guarantee you an insider's view of the clash of cultures taking shape in a cricket game. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very positive movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to comment after I've read the other comments. Most of the comments were by well informed westerners; I felt the views of a reasonably well informed Indian might be useful.The producers claim that the movie is based on a real incident that happened in the late 19th century; I don't know if this is true. What was definitely heartening is that they made an attempt to make the movie fairly authentic-looking - by hiring real western actors rather than fair skinned Indians wearing blue contact lenses to play the British roles, daring to have the chracters speak in English rather than accented Hindi, and more than adequate efforts at creating the period atmosphere. These had been lacking generally in Indian movies. There are of course exceptions like "Shatranj ke Khiladi", but then it is made by Ray.The first part of the movie is very good, in spite of the usual Hindi movie cliches. They have handled the script very well. Overall the movie is definitely too long &amp; I found the second part dragging &amp; full of sporting cliches, but I could clearly see the rest of the audience hugely enjoying it.It is definitely a very clever box-office idea - it has cricket, nationalism, and the evil British officer who gets beaten at his own game (both literally &amp; figuratively)! But this is a very positive movie, and this is what I like most about it. It shows how confidence, enthusiasm planning and hard work can win, and it shows it well. I think India needs more such movies - and then, so does the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of Bollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen Lagaan on video (with English subtitles) and was absolutely amazed, especially about the great pacing of the movie. It didn't drag for one minute, the four hours felt like one and a half. I was thoroughly excited and involved by this film all the time.I have become interested in Bollywood films recently and have seen some (as well as some extracts) and I must say that this one was at the same time 100 % Bollywood - but still different. It left out all the annoying Bollywood clichés (the hero beating up some bad guys, the hero and heroine dancing in the Swiss mountains) and had a decent screenplay where it was the story that mattered most and not the music scenes. And the production standards (especially of the dialogue bits) weren't as annoyingly low as in many other B. films, but nearly equalled those of Hollywood (except for the computer-generated clouds which were rather ridiculous).This is of course a very archetypal story where there were the Good and the Bad, and the small ones beating the big one, but it was thoroughly enjoyable and never got annoying. I normally get bored by the average Hollywood sports movie, but this one kept me clutching my seat during the cricket scenes (even though I hadn't had the least idea about cricket before seeing this movie).The love triangle was quite funny, I especially loved the taboo situation of the rich white lady lusting for the Indian peasant... (It must really be said that Aamir Khan was EXTREMELY sexy in this movie!!! :)) Funniest of all was the song scene of the three main characters, the bit that was most "bollywoodish" in my opinion. Most of all, because Bollywood love song scenes are in most cases "only" the picturisation of fantasies. This also became clear here (at least, in part) because this was the only scene where Rachel Shelley was not wearing 19th century clothes, but rather red veils blown by the wind, showing her desire for Bhuvan - or in another scene she was lying in his arms on the porch of his house, wearing a sari... I especially loved the bit in this song where Bhuvan and Elizabeth dance together in a Western ballroom, Bhuvan wearing an English uniform - but also still his quite prominent earrings... :)I am happy that so many people here seem to have found interest in watching Bollywood movies after seeing this one, but please, don't have too high expectations: you'll have to search for a long time before finding anything as good as this one here. Though there are lots of good non-Bollywood Indian films, Bollywood unfortunately hardly ever reaches the standards of this movie - though things are improving. I hope that Lagaan will get a large audience worldwide - and also come to Austria. (It is now shown in both Germany and Switzerland, but unfortunately not here - yet.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teenager, occasionally I read books which were set in India (i.e., the Far Pavilions). I watched "The Jewel in the Crown" from beginning to end, and after that "A Passage to India", "Heat and Dust" and others. All different films but with one thing in common; all from the British/Colonial/white point of view.Expanding my horizons to the Indian experience outside of India, I sought out films like "My Beautiful Launderette" and "Mississippi Masala". I had also seen a couple of Indian independent films, like "Salaam Bombay" and "Kama Sutra", but I had never seen a full-out Bollywood production before. I added "Lagaan" to my Netflix queue based, in part, on an Oscar nomination and on a favorable essay about the film on National Public Radio's "All Things Considered". In the time between placing it in the queue and actually getting the film, I saw "Ghost World" where, in one scene, Enid was watching a clip from a Hindi musical, which to my WASP ears, sounded like Chinese opera on speed. And then on top of that, I found out that "Lagaan" was over 3 ? hours long! The DVD arrived and I thought seriously about returning it unviewed, but I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't. IT WAS WONDERFUL. Engaging, uplifting and best of all, entertaining, and it passed the "butt" test (I didn't feel the need to squirm not once during the entire running time). And it didn't hurt that the star, Aamir Khan is a major babe. All in all, a great film for the whole family with valuable lessons in tolerance, integrity and cooperation surrounded by an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best indian cricket movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>since the movie clocks in at around four hours and I payed exactly four dollars to get into it, I had precisely 1 hour per dollar. And i did indeed get my penny's worth. I was skeptical about the whole viewing experience, having been mainly pulled into the theater by a friend of mine, but i was not dissapointed. The film concerns a group of indian civilians trying to stand their own against a rotten old british tyrant. The colors and the cinematography are gorgeous, as is the fluid motions of the camera. The musical numbers are stunningly choreographed and their style stands up against any music video you could name. The length of the film also does not detract from its viewing enjoyment. There are no real bland points or unnecessary tangent plotlines. Although there was an intermission held at the showing I went to, it felt largely unneeded and was the only point when the action of this bollywood epic broke.The film does have its weak points however. I am not entirely convinced that had the film plot removed itself from early 21th century india to 1950's hollywood, that this would have been another busby berkely forgotten yawknfest. The script is pretty much predicatable and clichéd. Any one who's seen a sports movie knows the basic outline of how the big game will go. Any one who's seen a love story knows where that will go. The female leads are also kind of one-dimensional and boring. It is a movie exclusively driven by the men, which seems unfair since the love triangle appears to be a big part of the plot. The villian of the film also seems intolerably awful. There is absolutely no sympathy for his actions, he seems to simply act out some nihilist Iago power-trip fantasy. The fact that the other elite Brits accept and laud him for that behavior without any insight into motivation seems a little trite. The film also gleefully throws around the term "Whitey" describing the british, which comes off a tad racist.However, these are points that can be looked past to see what might be the "titanic" of the indian cinema (rather than the "crouching tiger"). It's fully entertaining, pretty, and upbeat. Bring the kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could say "Lagaan" is India's answer to "Moulin Rouge", but obviously, Mr. Baz Luhrmann has drawn inspiration from these films than the other way around.The story of a Hindu's (Aamir Khan, who also produced) village's fight to keep from paying the British government any taxes (lagaan) for three years if they win a cricket match, (similar to Peter Cattaneo's "The Full Monty") is heartwarming, as it is topical. The gorgeous Indian landscape is put to wonderful use; as is the scintillating song-and-dance numbers. It's also aided by some robust humor and a steamy triangular romance.Even at 3 and a 1/2 hours, this film has sustained my interest. It also raised my interest in the "Bollywood" genre, and I hope it does with you too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what a fantastic movie. it is a microcosm of indian society mid-19th century. the hero (bhuvan) accepts the challenge from the british colonial overlords-- the annual tax (the lagaan) will be lifted for 3 years if the indians beat the british in a cricket match. if the british win the tax is tripled which will ruin the native population, their grip on survival is tenuous at best. drought has ruined the harvests for two years (the "black cloud" musical production is most entertaining, filled energy &amp; joy). the villagers are amazed &amp; very angry when bhuvan accepts the challenge to learn cricket and THEN play the british army. bhuvan builds a team the includes hindus, a moslem, a member of the 'untouchable' caste, a shik and a lovely english women. elizabeth is willing to teach the natives the game,demonstrating an real affinity &amp; love for the indian people &amp; for bhuvan. the plot is rife with nationalism, unrecoited love, boy-meets-girl, racial tensions, religious fervor, class struggles &amp; great musical numbers. the four hours just flew-by. there is no sex, no violence -- this is simply a wonderful movie. well acted. most entertaining.</fullReview>

My interpretation goes like this .The cricket match is actually a symbolic representation of Indian Independence .As everybody would have guessed ,its a team building effort (hindus ,muslims,untouchables and traitors ..) from the Indian side to accomplish the task .Some scenecs like ,the untouchable guy .He being a spinner and everybody in the team hugging him ,whenever he took a wicket .This was one of the aspect of untouchability prevailing at that time. When everything was going bad. The muslim guy comes in ,limping though.Which I guess ,the director wants to show there were some internal skirmishes within Islamic groups and dragging thier feet ,in fighting together with the hindu brothers.The bottom line is there is more to it than what most people thought(atleast some of my friends ) .The script was excellent and Ashutosh has done an excellent job .Amir's acting is getting better every day and A.R Rahaman ,the best you can get.On the whole keep up the good work guys.Atleast we have started the trend,with a nomination for oscars.</fullReview>

The struggle - depicted by means of a cricket match - was taken up in a very aggressive but non-violent way and it was their determination which saw them through.Sit through the movie and I am sure that you will feel that it deserved to be a bit longer....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A TRULY INTERNATIONAL INDIAN MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that Lagaan has been nominated for the Oscars, there's absolutely no doubt that Bollywood movies are happening and are here to stay. Lagaan is a truly impressive picture that does away with all the stereotypes and displays the new-age Bollywood film-making technique that is all set to conquer the world. It isn't the usual story of good-versus-evil. It is a war of egos, a war of fates, a war to protect one's identity, a war to protect one's land and one's existence. Bhuwan, the simple village youth who has never even heard of the game cricket which is so much popular with his colonial masters, takes on the angry Capt. Andrew Russell in this alien game, only in order to save his village, as-well-as the other villages in that province, from the almost impossible task of paying taxes during a prolonged drought period, when there's hardly any food for anyone.Aamir Khan, who can easily be named the best actor in Bollywood, has dared to make a brilliant film on an unconventional theme. Bollywood, despite having such a great mass-appeal, has always been very reluctant in handling unconventional, unusual themes. But Khan, a pure perfectionist that he is, just went ahead, and along with Ashutosh Gowariker, a film-maker who had so far been under-estimated, made a Lagaan which will stand as an example for other producers and directors.Everything about Lagaan is worth-watching. Aamir Khan as Bhuwan and his ten comrades, played by actors of calibre like Raghuveer Yadav, Sri Vallabh Vyas, Amin Haji, Raj Zutshi, Pradeep Rawat and others are matchless. Debutante Gracy Singh is wonderful as the village-belle Gauri who loves Bhuwan. She is a natural actress and more than that a wonderful dancer. Her's is one of the best debut performances that Bollywood has seen. However Gowariker should be praised for his terrific handling of the British cast. Paul Blackthorne as the tyrant Capt. Russell is absolutely convincing. Rachel Shelley as the memsaab Elizabeth Russell looks stunning, and her Hindi is good. The sets are very rustic and very real and A. R. Rahman's music gels with the narrative.A shouldn't-be-missed movie. An epic production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure all the lines on the comments by all are full of praise for Lagaan the film,team and Aamir.I did enjoy the film completely but would like to comment critically on the film. A)Aamir shrewdly altered the storyline which was written/conceived by Ash.Full marks to Aamir for making it crisp and evoking the best possible emotions from audience till date in the history of Indian cinema but pt made here is great film makers like Bimal Roy,Guru dutt,Mehboob never shrewdly cut the storyline to suit the market/or boxoffice. B)In spite of great research claimed by Aamir n team they missed out one fact which can be pardoned compared to the zillions of those in other bollywood flicks. The fact:- The story is set in 1868(something) and during the match theres a sequence where Elizabeth comes in betn and argues about rules of crick in book whereby a particular style of bowling is being allowed,which is true as per records.But the blunder is about the SIXER which Aamir hits in the end and wins.The books of crick defined SIX as ball which filps across the ground/or pavilion without touching ground whereas any ball crossed directly over the ropes was used two be declared as four.So logically Lagaan team has lost the game and not won it. Anyways hope they get an Oscar!!!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't have to be Indian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen Lagaan in a fairly small house with an audience that seemed to be about half Indian (broadly speaking) and half not. Everybody loved it, including me. It didn't seem four hours long, but then a game of cricket lasts a lot longer and it was targetted at cricket fans. I've only seen one other Bollywood film ever, Jai Santoshi Ma, and that was on television years ago. But I've read that they've become increasingly less "Indian", and these days tend to focus on beautiful young people in an international setting. Lagaan is quite the opposite, definitely set in rural India, and it seems to follow the other conventions, for example, everyone bursting into song and dance at key points, and a strong (but often humorous) background presence of Hindu deities. It differs from other, older, Bollywood films in that its theme is explicitly about spiritual resistance to the British Empire. Its main appeal to me is that it brings out the emotional appeal of a lot of different film genres in a coherent way. The central theme is the High Noon style personal duel between Bhuvan, the dashing hero, and Russell, the stupid and nasty British soldier in charge of the garrison. But the clash of cultures and good/evil around it is also pure Star Wars, and the way the different team members come together has a touch of Robin Hood (with Russell's honorable sister Elizabeth as Marian) or the Magnificent Seven, as well as of Jesus and the Apostles. The characters are appealing in themselves and plausible as a team. And the song-and-dance production numbers have an appeal of their own, especially the very funny one where Elizabeth sings in English in her boudoir while Bhuvan and his beloved Gauri do a more convention duet in the country side. What integrates all this is the cricket match, which provides a set of situations and rules for a conflict. There are a lot of cricket jokes (some anachronistic or knowing) but it's really more like an Ealing comedy where the spirit of the little guys makes them bigger than the powerful guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first Indian film I've seen, and I wasn't disappointed. I was a little apprehensive about the 4-hour running time (the only other film of that length I've seen at the cinema was Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, and that wasn't an experience I'd want to repeat) but in the end, I could have quite happily watched it for an hour longer. The actors were great, the depiction of life in the village was realistic, and the landscapes and cinematography were stunning. And as for the costumes and the songs, they just got better and better - I thought the song about Krishna was breathtaking, brilliantly executed and just fantastic to watch. But best of all was the cricket match. As a cricket fan, I cannot begin to describe how enjoyable this was. It was dramatic, touching, funny, sad, just totally engrossing - and it worked so well. Because we knew all eleven members of the Indian team and their idiosyncracies, it was brilliant to see how their characters translated to their batting styles. I also loved the way they were forced to learn about the game on the hoof eg when fielding the way that every member of the team chased the ball, until they realised what they were doing wrong - hilarious - and the way they brought the spinner on at the start. Truly a great game, and a great ending! My only criticism of the film would be that to my mind the British actors didn't seem all that great - the way they played their parts was over the top and not particularly convincing, especially the Captain. But I noticed this less and less as the film went on. All in all a great experience - considering going again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lagaan is a refreshing movie from Bollywood. Aamir Khan and Ashutosh Gowariker have put in real effort to make a good movie. They deserve credit for recreating the emotional trauma of being under British rule and how a bunch of people courageously won over their unfair rule. The cricket sequences are exceptionally well handled. Perhaps the only Indian film that captures cricket that well. However, I think these sequences can be improved phenomenally - that way Ashutosh and Aamir can turn totally brutal and leave the audience absolutely under their mercy - to be relieved from the ever growing suspense and excitement. Perhaps the rapid advances in Graphics can help. If Hollywood could recreate almost all of the coliseum in Gladiator [they only built a part of the coliseum, the rest was done by computer], cooking up some breath taking shots in cricket should be a piece of cake.Regarding the performances, Gracy Singh as Gowri excelled over everyone. Aamir's performance seemed more like a supporting role. None of his expressions "hit you". Gracy's do. The other performances are all adequate to keep the movie going as intended.Song sequences deserve a special credit. After many many movies, there is a movie where the songs come naturally. You never feel a song was put just for the heck of it. Once the song starts, the choreography takes over. This is another excpetional aspect of the movie..the choreography is smooth and not the usual "cut and paste" stuff. The camera moves from one artist to another in a seamless manner. "Radha kaise na jale" is my personal favorite.I personally think Sarfarosh was more "cooler" than this one. But both these movies clearly stand out to be one of the best one in the past 4 years - along with ofcourse, Satya.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is indeed a great one. Although it contains a somewhat overwhelming hyperbolic, It should actually expected beforehand, due to hyperbolas in the dramatization, even to some extremes, is to some extent a distinctive signature of any Indian movie, beside the all known singing and dancing every thirty minutes or so. I personally don't think that the hyperbolic are really needed in this story because it already is a great story to tell. Fortunately Aamir Khan realizes this and uses drastically reduced hyperbolas in the next works as 3 Idiots (2009). This movie is also able to teach at least the very basic rules of cricket, a game which is not very common in countries outside the British Commonwealth. The acting is just what is expected from any Indian movie. Not to say that it's bad, but I sure will not also say that it's Oscar quality. But then again I'm sure that, like most of Aamir Khan production, this movie's strong point is the great story based on a rare premise to be used as a movie screenplay. The set selection unfortunately is very confined and limited for a movie with almost a three hour duration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Indian film that inspires; a tale of courage that moves the spirit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A deeply spiritual movie with redemptive themes that captures the courage and determination of the human spirit, Lagaan will transport you to a time and place you'll wish you were part of. Can an Indian movie with subtitles hold your attention for nearly four hours? Our family has watched the DVD so many times we've actually purchased our second copy, and prefer to watch it in Hindi. The characters pull us in, and we feel part of the community; which love story will prevail? Will the subjugated and tyrannized be liberated? Will a seed of hope grow into victory? Set in rural India prior to gaining its independence from Great Britain, this story weaves together characters from a local British Cantonment, Indian Rajas (regional kings) and poor farmers forced to pay 'Lagaan' or tax that has moved beyond burdensome to oppressive. Seizing an opportune moment, one of the members of a village accepts a challenge from the British officer in charge: they must beat the British in their game of Cricket to be free of Lagaan for three years, or face triple the tax rate. The story unfolds as Bhuvan convinces members of his village to learn the game and confront the arrogant captain in a fight that for the village is not only about winning, but literally about survival.There is much to like about Lagaan. Of the many powerful scenes, some which may have you on the edge of your seat, two in particular are transcendent. In order to complete the team, Bhuvan asks an 'outcast' member of the community to join. The other team members are indignant, as the caste system seems this person as worthless scum and his presence as polluting the 'system.' In a powerfully moving scene, Bhuvan makes a stirring speech that puts in perspective what is before them. They must come together or literally starve. Gasps are heard as he touches Kutchra (the outcast), but hearts are changed and tears flow as one who has never known acceptance is welcomed as a key member. (As a Christian, I saw a powerful illustration here of the love and acceptance Jesus Christ offers.) Later, facing what appears to be certain defeat, the women of the village unite before their temple and begin to sing a song of worship to Krishna --a prayer for intervention. The scene is stirring: the devotion and trust in a deity is a turning point for their despair and catalyzes their spirits to face the challenge the next morning. If only every church possessed faith and worship so innocent, transparent, and 'authentic.' Even the coming monsoon rain carries a spiritual message of hope. Is God somehow displeased with them? The villagers' luck changes as the movie begins with drought but ends with a downpour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bollywood Delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ambitious epic pitting poor Indian villagers against the British Raj in 1890s India, this film is clearly a Bollywood product, although it manages to transcend some of the Bollywood formulas. Khan, who also produced, is the studly Indian farmer who has both wide-eyed Singh and sexually frustrated Shelley falling for his charms. Although nearly four hours in length, it never drags. The musical numbers are very well executed, featuring tuneful songs and energetic choreography. Although cricket is not the most exciting of sports, Gowarkier deserves credit for making the long, climactic cricket match compelling and believable. Blackthorne makes a good villain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures the Spirit of Indian Resistance to British Oppression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My whole family loved this movie--11 and 17 year old sons, myself and my husband. It's a 19th century fable, the story of how a scraggly bunch of peasants--including a cripple, a mute, a chicken farmer, and a crazy holy man--unite to defend their village against the British. It also gives a glimpse of how all Indians--from rajas to Muslims to untouchables--even English women--lived under the boot of Anglo power. But the movie doesn't preach; it entertains and moves the viewer. It is visually varied and colorful, with glimpses of scenic countryside, village huts, and palaces. And the musical part of the movie is well- balanced with the drama, full of lively rhythms, singing, and great dancing. Our real reason, however, for loving this movie is that it is truly a quintessential underdogs-unite and-fight-back kind of story which anyone with a heart will love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once upon a dream in India...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch this film, you'll understand why it was nominated for an academy award. Bollywood's go-to-guy for proper acting Aamir Khan plays a rebellious Bhuvan, a young lad who is tired of being oppressed by the British and dreams of liberating everything Indian one way or another. Gracy Singh plays the country bumpkin, Gauri who has fallen in love with him but must first fight off the affections and intentions of a well-to-do socialite named Elizabeth Russell (played by the L-Word's Rachel Shelley) who also becomes smitten with Bhuvan when she comes to help the villagers prepare for a mandatory cricket match they must play against an elite team that includes her brother, Captain Andrew Russell (played by Paul Blackthorne) who has crossed paths with Bhuvan one time too many. Bhuvan, the cause of this dangerous wager must now step up to the plate, in assembling a team that will play the elite, as he was the one responsible for the suggestion of the match in the first place (he belittled the game of cricket) in front of Captain Russell one day and Russell, obviously did not take that lightly. Look for strong performances by Aamir Khan of course, Rachel Shelley, Suhasini Mulay and Kulbhushan Kharbanda. Gracy Singh's whining/bickering performance is too irritating to be considered anything special, she nearly ruined the movie for me and I doubt I will be able to stand her in anything else after seeing her over-consciously play the character of Gauri so wooden and exaggeratedly upsetting. My favourite song 'Radha Kaise Na Jale' unfortunately suffers badly at the hands of Ms. Singh but luckily my love affair with the song began long before my eyes met its interpretation on her and Aamir in the film. Anyways, some key scenes include; a scene in which a bunch of villagers discriminate against a man of lower caste (a so-called untouchable) during the team selection process. Other highlights include the scene in which Rachel Shelley is dressed up in Indian attire, the cricket match itself and the rain anticipation scene. A must see but brace yourself, it's 4 hours long!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cricket Match In Ancient India</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One movie that should have won the Oscar but it didn't. A small village in British India is overdue in taxes. But due to lack of rain, there is no crops, so no money and hence no taxes. the British Raj gets impatient, and demands taxes. The village persons desperate, wants to make a deal. And so a deal is signed. the Deal - A Cricket match between the team of the British raj and the illiterate Indians. If the British win the Indians have to pay the double tax, but if it happens the other way around, the villagers won't have to pay any taxes. A lucrative offer and the naive villagers fall for it. (Considering the fact that they don't know a thing about cricket) The British confident of their success, are in the cool. The Indians start practicing the foreign game. Soon they have their eleven. In the midst of betrayals the game starts. The British post a huge total, but the Indians fight back. The team captain, being their spirit of hope. The irony is in the fact with only 1 ball remaining six runs are needed, for victory with the Jack (Who incidentally is a cripple) facing a fast bowler, the lead bowler. He fails managing only a single. The British rejoice in the victory. The Indians lie down with their heads hung in shame. But the umpire surprises everybody by stating there has been a no ball. The bowler goes back to his run up. He bowls but he is bowling to the captain, the unbeaten batsman looking forward to carrying his bat throughout the innings. He swings and it looks like he is caught by the British Captain. Hang on thats not the end. It appears that he has crossed the boundary. The result the Indians win. The ultimate reward comes in the end when the rain gods bless Champaran with a shower of rain. The movie revolves in a love triangle between Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh and Rachel Shelly. Shelly a British lady takes up in training the Indians the game of cricket, in turn she falls for the handsome Bhuvan (Aamir), the captain of the village team. Bhuvan in turn loves Gauri (Gracy Singh), a simple village girl. The music is superb and the songs are very soothing. Lagaan is one movie which most definitely should have won the Oscars, a real pity that it didn't. But the story and the entire theme was very original. The supporting characters though play a very small part in the movie apart from the leading characters. Yet each character has a definite purpose in the movie. The cripple, has the talent of spinning the ball (reminds me of Chandrashekhar), Laka, the traitor who betrays the villagers for his thirst for revenge, and all the rest of the Eleven. Each one of them has a definite purpose in the movie and thats what made this movie apart from the rest of the usual BS movies about freedom struggle. A must say for everyone. 10/10 from me.........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It was the first movie that was mainly in Hindu and I thought it was beautiful and had great music. I love musicals like Guys and Dolls and the Music Man and I love the music, but when I saw this it realized how bad and out of place the English language was in the beautiful rhythmic singing. I am not a sports person and this movie definitely had a sports theme, but I didn't mind it. It felt kind of long towards the end when they played the game. It was a story of facing adversity in anyway. Its love story was told completely without kissing which in this day and age is very impressive. I love this movie for the filming music and costumes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is NOT based on cricket!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes... The fate of everyone in India basically does rely on cricket, but that isn't the strong point of this film. This film SHOULD've shown India the way to good cinema, yet they still go with the scantily clad westernized Indian girls, who are not westernized enough in my opinion. Lagaan should've won the Oscar for best Foreign film or whatever it was. I'm also not a fan of Indian Music, but this isn't your typical Indian Soundtrack. India could also learn from this. Aamir Khan takes the cake, as always. Simply a great, great performance. This move is what led to all the hype with 1847: The Rising. Which I also cannot wait for. Now back to the Cricket. I honestly think Cricket is the worst sport ever, besides Baseball. (Just My Opinion, sorry to everyone.) But this film makes me want to see more of the Cricket match. After the movie is only when I realized I'd just watched a cricket match. And it wasn't a full cricket match. To everyone who hasn't seen this... Please watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>9/10 - One of the greatest Indian movies of all time, the only fault being that they did not show the farmers doing any farmer-like activity in the movie, if they did, it would have deserved a a full 10 stars. Good acting from Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh and all the rest of the cast. Good storyline - not the usual emotional rambling of star-crossed lovers or try too hard to be like Hollywood like many Indian films. Though the love story is still there, it does not interfere with the narrative. Good song and dance sequence, they kept it real - there was only one very short piece where a lover was imagining. It makes stiff and formal English culture look very drab in contrast to the flamboyant song and dance sequences, no offense to any English who happen to be reading this. Not one minute of the almost 4 hours was wasted, I have to hand it to Aamir and also Ashutush Gowarikar, good work guys.</fullReview>

The bulk of the burden fell on the villagers that were already in debt from the previous years of a hard and long drought.This year they had to pay even more as penalty for the previous years.

		<shortDescription>Indian spirit showcased beautifully!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simple story, but brilliantly presented.The two passions that fuel India (hatred for the British rule and love for cricket) are blended to make probably the most elaborate Indian movie ever. Very well made, it captures the struggle that Indians went through (and many still do) at the hands of nature and the powers that be. The one thing that keeps them going is their strength of character, personified as Bhuwan.This was the movie where Aamir Khan ceased to be viewed as Aamir the actor, but as Bhuwan the patriot. His role in the movie, as well as the efforts he put in for promoting the film abroad, earned him a lot of respect. He extended the spirit of the movie and his character beyond the boundaries of Lagaan. It was far more that what anyone else from Indian cinema has ever done before.A must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happened to come across this movie in one of those times when you just have nothing to do, I think I watched when it already had begun, although I'm not sure how much I missed of it. I started watching when Bhuvan and Tipu are trying to hit the ball in the middle of the village, it seemed interesting to me since I believed the guy playing Bhuvan seemed familiar, I obviously realize now that I hadn't seen him before in my life since this is the first Indian movie I watch.But still, there was something in the atmosphere of the movie that caught me, it seemed different to anything I've seen, perhaps it was the way they kept both languages and intersected them in various ways. The story is outstanding, and even though the dialogues seemed strange for me at times I think it might of been the way it was translated, the musical moments take a while to get used to but after you get past the new sound and get familiar with it you'll find it has great rhythm, I think anyone would get provoked to either sing or dance. There isn't a boring moment in this movie, it keeps you focused on the screen since you don't want to miss what they say!, the language is beautiful as well. Perhaps the songs get a bit long but those are the only times you're allowed to look away.Overall it's a good movie to watch if you want to learn about the culture, and even if you want to kill some time, it's definitely not a waste. And I promise you wont notice how long it is!</fullReview>

A must see for all the westners who know India mostly from those Satyajit Ray movies. It gives a totally new image of Indians even when they were not free. The storyline is paper thin with a predictable climax but its treatment is really marvellous. To sum it up its an age old saga of "weak" vs. "strong" and the weak winning in the end and so on.... Some very great direction and some very good acting make this film worth watching. The only drawback is its length are a whopping 3 hours and 40 minutes.

		<shortDescription>Bollywood is definitely ready for the Oscars !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many Westerners hold a grudge towards Indian Film. So did I, once.After viewing (and thank Goodness Owing it on DVD) this film, it demolishes the prejudice. (Watching DEVDAS a few weeks earlier helped too !!!) Bollywood produces wonderful films, and LAGAAN is a true ambassador.All right, it's long, but who cares, it's pure entertainment every minute every second ! Yes, they sing (occasionally), but if you like WEST SIDE STORY, HAIR, THE KING AND I, GREASE, Jesus Christ SUPERSTAR, etcetera-etcetera this film will appeal to you. If you don't, but like to undergo different cultures, well, there isn't too much singing here, the panoramas are breathtaking, India, certainly in 1877, is thrilling...Bollywood got his clichés, its typical framework, but with all due respect, doesn't the western film do also ? I mean, every thriller, whodunit, western, Hollywood comedy follows strict rules... And so does every SPORTS-thriller. Costner, Snipes, Redford... Eat your heart out ! Here we have a story that can challenge the wonderful 'Bang The Drum Slowly'. Honest ! Well acted, strong historic references, thrilling sets and costumes...This film is a joy to watch, full off exciting backdrops, some very thrilling acting-performances (watch Miss Rachel Shelley !!!), a story that goes straight to the heart... Honestly, LAGAAAN is a marvel.Give Bollywood a chance. Right now ! So you can say you knew it right before it starts grossing in international trophies.Because it will... Honest...PS: How to find your way through all these 1000's of Bollywood titles ? The usual sellers have discovered Bollywood and charge you outrages prices for the DVD's, without giving any info or guidance. Go to eBay, there are sellers with the same titles from the same manufacturers, but with normal prices AND a lot of know-how on the subject ! My advice to all of you, go the the store H2Bcom on eBay. You will feel like Dante guided by Virgil...Enjoy Bollywood !!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising and Refreshing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has its flaws, but any movie that can make a three-day cricket match suspenseful and riveting deserves a standing ovation in my book.Lagaan is lots of fun for those used to Hollywood movies. The variations from Hollywood norms range from small (but amusing) to major (but refreshing). No Hollywood movie would feature an adult male romantic lead whose primary criterion for a wife is that she be liked by his mother. And no modern Hollywood movie would take four hours to tell this story - four hours that are fun and entertaining, and that pass surprisingly quickly.Yes, this movie has flaws. Many of the characters are stereotypes or caricatures rather than people; this is particularly true of the British officers and the supporting villagers. The subtitling, so crucial in a film that uses two languages, isn't always perfect on the DVD. The rules of cricket aren't made particularly clear, so non-cricketers have to make some intelligent guesses to understand early dramatic sequences. And some of the romantic sequences (mercifully brief) made me cringe.However, the novelty of the movie makes it well worth watching. The songs and dance routines are particularly appealing; they retain Indian character, but are accessible and enjoyable to Western ears. And the composition, pacing, and cinematography are unusual, hence refreshing to people who are used to standard Hollywood fare.All in all, this movie is ideal for anyone who likes musicals, modern fables, sporting films, or just light-hearted, excellent cinematic entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was tired, bored, and not wanting to sit through a nearly 4 hour subtitled movie. It was late and I needed my sleep, but my daughter and I decided to at least start the film. What a delight it turned out to be!!! In fact, even though it was long past bedtime, we watched the whole thing.Lagaan deals with a late 19th century Indian village under the dominance of British rule, more specifically under the thumb of a sadistic British officer. In the second year of a drought, the farmers are faced not only with not having enough food for themselves, but having to suffer through double taxes (lagaan) owed to the British. Their only hope for relief comes in the way of a bet based on a cricket match, a game in which they are fundamentally ignorant.Despite the film's length, it never drags. Instead, it beautifully examines the will, character, and courage of the villagers in the face of hardship. Don't get me wrong. This is not a movie that is at all a downer. It is highly entertaining and fills the screen with wonderful colors and sound. It is also a film that seems highly predictable, one that you feel you know the eventual outcome of after the first ten minutes, or do you??? I will say that my daughter and I were startled several times during the course of the film.My recommendation: See this film and allow yourself to be swept up in its wonder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie that deserved the Oscar...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With no doubt, Lagaan is an excellent film. High on entertainment, morals, production values, and emotions.For most part, those that criticize Lagaan are either those that try to put themselves forward as being more intelligent than the masses, or those that didn't get the true message of the film.Lagaan is a movie about many things; not just about Cricket. Lagaan is a movie about a war without bloodshed. Lagaan is a movie about the triumph of human spirit. Lagaan is a movie about unity in gender, religion, race, and class.The movie is not just about a cricket match. India won its independence through non-violence, and that concept is mirrored here in the way that Champaner liberates itself from the British occupation. War doesn't have to be fought with guns; here it is fought with bats and balls.Human spirit is what triumphs against all odds in Lagaan and it is shown in a realistic manner. The British were overconfident about their victory and only lightly practiced; that too half-heartedly. Meanwhile, the villagers spent three months of intensive training, day by day. For those three months, cricket was their life; it is what would determine their future. And the moment the final shot of this war is delivered, the triumph overcomes the viewer, and the viewer is filled with absolute joy. Why? Because they too see how human spirit has triumphed against all odds.Some may complain that Lagaan shows the British in absolute negative light. This, however, is most definitely not true. As previously stated, Lagaan is a film about unity. First and foremost, the British in this film are British Imperialists. Saying that Lagaan is anti-British is like saying that "Schindler's List" is anti-German. Additionally, we see how not all the British go along with this plan. Captain Russel's sister feels that this is unfair, as do many of Russel's senior officers. And, it very well is true that many of the British Imperialists at the time were that antagonizing. Additionally, the theme of unity is brought forward throughout the film, mainly during the building of the team. We see women, such as Gauri and Elizabeth, play an important role in the team's victory. We see men of all religions (Sikhism, Islam, Hinduism, etc.) working together towards victory. When Kachra, the untouchable, is brought forward into the team, what we see is not an unrealistic speech; we see a social message.Most throughout the world view India as a land of absolute destitution, without learning about its rich heritage or culture, or what India is capable of. Even when India proves its worth, criticism is brought about (such as the case with nuclear testing). Lagaan proves to the world that India is not as they think it really is. While films like "Salaam Bombay!" are truly excellent, they only feed this general and negative perception of India.Very well, Lagaan is worth a chance by anyone, no matter where they're from. Lagaan has been appreciated by foreigners throughout the world, and nothing can move it away from that. -Rishi J</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always wondered why most Indian blockbusters are based on love and family affairs; Hollywood movies span such a vast variety of topics. I must thank Aamir for having broken that barrier making an excellent movie that not only touches the hearts of millions of Indians with their favorite pastime, cricket, but at the same time tackles the sensitive issue of the British Raj in the most hilarious way possible. The four hour long saga was smooth as silk and one of the few Indian movies in which songs are interwoven in the story and just seem to happen .... at the right moment! Accolades to Rahman for putting together another masterpiece soundtrack. I just wish this would've been released in the "English" theatres also to become the first Indian blockbuster in the US (surpassing even Crouching Tiger ...)</fullReview>

Very few Indian Films ( one may be able to count on their fingers ) can boast of packaging all elements better than LAGAAN.CLASSIC is the only word for this FILM. The movie has all the ingredients that have been used in the past to make a successful Indian movie. Comedy, Love, 3 sided love (though not well developed), doing the bad part because the person you love loves someone else, Caste / Creed, British rule, Exploitation of poor, Cricket, ??? the list is endless. The only things it doesn't have is use of vulgar language / Scene (which is used in almost every alternate Indian movie to hit the Marquee) and idiotic Fight Scenes (hero coming and bashing up 10-15 goons alone). The color's used are really earthy and well balanced. The lights (esp. in the night scene's ) are perfectly blended with the set's. The costumes done are really good just plain and simple. And not going for dhoti/kurta for each and every one. Like giving a Kurta / Pajama to the Sardar, flowing Pajama to the Muslim and the good turban on the village mukhia. This gives you feeling that it is a typical village and does not seem like that the people are just dumped there with the same cloths. Only thing is that they are always clean to the spot even when working / singing / dancing in the farms or learning cricket.The characters are developed as and when required, it really seems like they come into focus just at the right time. They are developed so much as to bring about the characteristic's they display in the climax. It is really a director's Movie and has done justice to all characters. Full Marks to Ashutosh.Music is like the feel of fresh fragrance in the environment. It is really brilliant. The rendering of O Ri Choree is really good and the part where western music is fused, is Masterfully done. Full marks to Rehman. The renderings of the other songs are also as good. The only point where Rehman seems wobbly is that he leaves a feeling that the has taken something for his previous compositions. In LAGAAN also it is not different, the starting of the song MITWAA seem very much like a song from 1 2 ka 4., but the rest is out of the world stuff. The composition of the Bhajan is really good and with the vocal from the ever fantastic LATA Mangeshkar it comes out with flying color's.All the actors on their part have displayed that they are really good. All in all LAGAAN is a really good movie and I will recommend to any one and every one.Once upon a time in India ??.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lagaan:the story of determination and passion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LAGAAN- the last word for determination and passion. Like me those who have watched this movie know that it's not exaggerating to say so. To describe the movie in one line it's simply a fight of poor villagers of champaran against the freakish nature of the British officials.The movie starts with detailing of each and every thing i.e. the actors, the situation, makeup etc. all the characters are so real that many of us can identify someone or the other with the characters. The story tells us about a poor village Champaren, where there is no rain since last few years. The villagers are unable to pay tax but the Britisher imposes double 'lagaan' on them. In the meantime, a piece of cloud is seen and the villagers rejoices with "Ghanan Ghanan ghana ghir aye badra......". But unlucky villagers the cloud flies away and then came the news of "diguna lagaan". They decided to go and pray to their king to look into the matter and first time sees the British "gillidanda", which was in real means nothing but the game of Cricket. Captain Russell challenge them and puts a condition that if they beat them in the game of cricket then they won't have to pay tax for three years otherwise the burden of triple tax would be forcefully imposed on them. Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) accepts the challenge but initially his friends did not support him. Gauri (Gracy Singh) supports Bhuvan and gradually support came from the other villagers. Elizabeth, sister of Captain Russell doesn't support her brother as she feels that its injustice to the poor villagers. She helps the villager to learn cricket.The D-day comes and the play starts. During the play, the cinema hall turns out to be Eden Gardens. With each and every ball it seems that its the Indian eleven playing and every moment you find yourself praying to God to help them. I would not mention the result, as the film really deserves the visit of each and every movie lover. All the actors were very good. The British actors especially Russell and Elizabeth were too good and the way they spoke in Hindi was also very charming, and very close to reality.I don't know much about the technical aspect of films but had heard about sink sound and really don't find any problem in hearing any dialogue. The songs by A.R.Rahman were really majestic.' O re chori...' seems to be great specially the mixing of Hindi with English. Other songs are also too good. Nowadays Indian viewers are very much habituated with the locations of European countries. In this film we find that the shots are taken in the particular village only. One has to admit that the picturisations were really good. Lastly to end this writing I must say that watching such movies are must because if you don't watch it you are really missing something.</fullReview>

Aamir Khan is a stand out performance along with Rachel Shelley and Gracy Singh. A number of great scenes exist - the climax cricket match as well as the scene in which the traitor Lakkha's cover is blown. Kudos for Ashutush and Aamir for a wonderful film.

		<shortDescription>A return to the Golden Age of Hindi Cinema - and how!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lagaan is one of the best-made large-scale films (by which I mean I am not comparing it with the films of masters like Ray, Ghatak, Bergman or Kieslowski, whose films to my mind are made on a more intimate scale than films like Lagaan, which means that the parameters of evaluation are different) I have seen, and is certainly among the best five films ever to have come out of India's commercial film industry. It combines some of the best song-and-dance sequences in Hindi cinema's history with an interesting premise for a plot, excellent, restrained yet powerful performances all round, beautiful cinematography/camerawork, and manages to elicit from the audience a level of emotional involvement that most films can only dream of. It looks consistently beautiful, without ever being untrue to its setting: this is not the beauty of bright primary colours so favoured by the average Hindi film director these days, but rather the more muted earth tones, combined with the earthy reds and oranges of the women's clothes, of its village setting. It really does mark a return to the sort of honest, heartfelt, genuine films that the Bombay was known for in the 1950s and 1960s, though technically this is an infinitely more assured piece of work than those films. For once, the dialogue never hits a false note ? admittedly, the use of Avadhi is a bit erratic, but my guess is that was a compromise between comprehensibility and authenticity, and it certainly does not jar. The integration of the British actors and the bits that are in English is seamless; the film is often funny without ever descending into farce of slapstick; even Rachel Shelley's typically ?Bollywood' declaration of love, complete with pillared room and flying tresses/dresses, works! Speaking of Shelley, her role is perhaps my one quibble ? it would have been nice to see her romantic involvement with Aamir's character be allowed to develop a bit more. Perhaps the only other critical comment I'm willing to make is that the plot sort of ran out of steam for the last bit ? the cricket match was very entertaining, but given that there was no way the outcome was going to be any different from what it was (this does purport to be a feel-good film, after all!), I think it went on for a tad too long. But these are minor points; nothing's ever perfect, and neither is Lagaan ? but it comes pretty damn close to being a perfect realisation of what it set out to be. Well worth a (couple of?) watch(es), and I've no doubt this will come to be regarded as a classic. Beautifully made, stunningly shot, perfectly acted, exhilarating, strong, earthy cinema that made me feel good for a while after I saw it!</fullReview>

It feels good watch such beautiful expressions on everyones faces. Gracy Singh has done a really good job. This is the standard that Bollywood movies should have! And of course, Mr. Bachchan adds his own magical touch to the movie! This is the kind of movie that brings you goose-bumps towards the end, and leaves you with a happy feeling in your heart. The music, it goes without saying, is brilliant. No unnecessary songs like other Bollywood movies have these days. Meaningful lyrics and wonderful foot-tapping beats. I really wish the other producers and directors and actors take this movie as an example of the potential that Bollywood has!! Hey Aamir.... we're waiting to see more of these coming from you!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Lagaan is a truly amazing film. The use of sync-sound, the fantastically authentic costumes, dialect and dialogues, etc make the film very, very realistic. The film got loads of awards, but I think if such a film was made at any time in the history of Indian cinema, it would have generated the same response. Also, it COULD'VE been made at any time. I think Lagaan deserves all the awards it got in the technical categories; but in the Best Film category, I think Dil Chahta Hai (also released in the same year) should definitely get the award!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the nearly 4 hour long lagaan has been a daring endeavour for aamir khan. nonetheless, the thinking khan doesn't let us down. the movie is an entertainer in every sense of the word, yet it is ages ahead of the regular potboilers that bollywood churns out every friday. watch this one in a theatre, the effect will no way be nearly as good on tv. this is the first time i have seen an audience participate with such enthusiasm and fervour. this is also the first time i have sat through a cricket match for an hour without feeling the slightest of ennui. divided into 3 parts by 3 intervals, the last part is completely amazing. the brilliance on display leaves you spellbound and yearning for more, despite the fact that this is your 4th hour on your seat. this is what is known as true cinema. the first part is good, with lots of light comedy which might not appeal to all but do try to enjoy it because that is the foundation of the movie. you won't like the other two parts if you sit sullen through the first. coerce yourself to laugh and soon it will all become effortless. the second part is comic yet dramatic. upto here, the movie can be passed off as a usual bollywood flick. but from this point it is one of the best hindi movies. aamir khan is good, but not excellent. this is his best performance along with the one in 1947 : earth. the supporting cast is probably the best i have ever seen. though there are too many significant characters, this movie shows care for each one of them. aamir and ashutosh picked the best in each field of film making. but the result could have been better. the cinematography by anil mehta is just about ok. the choreography is very good. music by AR rehman is good but not his best. it comes out in its best form on video rather than audio. oscar awardee bhanu athaiya's costumes are fine...historically accurate and all but really, any dress designer would do a satisfactory job here. i doubt if this movie has room for great dress designing, and even if it does, it does not achieve it. the dialogue be k p saxena is once again good. a bit difficult to understand since it is in light avadhi, but you do get most of it. and its worth listening to. what deters brilliance is too much coverage of the pre - climax part. some sharp editing and smarter screenplay would have done the job. despite its flaws, lagaan is a good movie to watch. three cheers to ashutosh gowariker.</fullReview>

It was not easy to gather all the stars together of both Bollywood and Hollywood. but yet they need to work hard and complete it. and their patience had paid for them. The movie became a blockbuster at the box office.

		<fullReview>This cult classic which is now become a hallmark of Indian film industry stands tall in story telling in Hindi films.There is not much that is new in this film, its a straight forward narrative, a conflict between the lower class Indian farmers and the higher class British men. But what is new is the perspective, depiction, bring life to each character and then evolving them in a relatable way on the celluloid. Ashutosh Gowariker has shown brilliance of how simply a grand movie such as this can be made. This film boast of many great things, that Indians were aware of till that point but never really realized it on the big screen.The love Indians have for cricket when all were ga ga ing Bhuvan Bhuvan at the climax of the cricket match, which I thought would come out only during world cups, but we seemed having a natural affinity to cricket. The triangular love story of Bhuvan, that involves Britihs princess is told subtly without much dramatics, the emotions are mostly imaginary or simply in dialogue and expression. There is no big sacrifice done to exhibit emotions.The music, oh my god Rahman gave was so apt that even today, 10 years later it still is one of the best soundtracks of Indian cinema and this will get better I think with days to come.And for the then first time producer Aamir Khan, all my accolades to have faith and belief and this story and investing all he could to make it as director Ashutosh wanted it.Whichever country you are from please watch it, it showcases human spirit and the gut in a beautiful way.

But the film was a blockbuster though released alongwith GADAR The film has a different plot wherein Indians and Britishers fight not with swords but with Cricket bats. The film does have resemblance to NAYA DAUR but the way it's handled is amazing though at times some scenes are prolonged, speaking of which the length is above 3 hours but yet it does have meat and ample scope of drama and emotions. The cricket match may seem inaccurate but it works big time in such a filmDirection by Ashutosh Gowareikar is amazing Music by AR Rahman is awesome, Ganna Ganna, O Rey Chori, Radha, Baar Baar are all great songsAamir Khan excels in his role, he makes you as always forget you are watching him, Gracy Singh was great in her debut, Rachel is good Paul Blackthorne is good, Khulbushan Kharbanda, Rajendra Gupta, Raj Jhutsi, Raghuvir Yadav, Yashpal Sharma are all goodThe film was one of the first films after 30 years to use sync sound, which means no dubbing, after this film it was followed in several films like Dil Chahta Hai, DON.etc</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lagaan, an epic in itself in the Indian cinema circles, like Ramayana and Mahabharatha are in Indian tradition. The movie defines perfection of movie-making spanning a feature-film length "The Making" and a book about it's making. The idea started in 1996, by Ashutosh Gowariker after his last movie, Baazi (an attempt at remake of "Die Hard"), starring Aamir himself was a flop.Initially, it was rejected by Aamir and several other actors. Aamir himself rejected it 2 times, finally agreeing to take it after several rewrites and even volunteering to produce it himself. The casting itself took almost a year. Aamir, Ashutosh and Reena had multiple trips to London to finalize the British cast.I will not delve into the shooting schedule, since a whole book has been written about it by Mr.Satyajit Bhatkal.About the story, it is about a group of villagers, in a village in Uttar Pradesh in 1893, who are forced to pay double land-tax, despite there being no rains in that season. When they go to have the tax cancelled, it results in a confrontation between Bhuvan and Captain Russell, resulting in a challenge from Russell to defeat his team in a cricket match to have their taxes cancelled for 3 years, if they win. If they lose, they'll have to pay triple tax.What follows is:- One person, Bhuvan versus the entire village (admonishing him for accepting an improbable challenge), Britishers' oppression, creating a team, ignorance of the game on part of the villagers, ignorance of big-match attitude in players, match fixers, social justice, etc. Sounds like a bad-story, but the screenplay and direction is so magnificent that you will not realize you have sat for almost 4 hours to watch this epic.Another clinching factor of the movie is the background score and music. Very often you find Indian movies with unnecessary dance and song sequences. Here is one movie, which does not take the pace off the proceedings, but adds to it.The dialogues, accent are perfect penned by Javed Akhtar. The art direction, choreography, supporting cast are very well in sync with each other.The best thing about the movie is, how the scenes have been visualized by Ashutosh and Aamir. Calling direction as great, fabulous, unbelievable, excellent, etc would be an understatement. It shows the years of hard-work everyone, from Ashutosh Gowariker to Jhamu Sugandh, has put in to make this cult classic.Truly a masterpiece!!!!!!!!! Hats off to Ashutosh and Aamir for giving us such a wonderful film.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't the most apealling film for most people. Foreign language and the stain of Bollywood would hinder the appeal, not mention the running time of 3 hours and 45 minutes. But that does nothing to ruin the greatness of this film. None of those 225 minutes are wasted, and I didn't find myself getting bored at all. The script is fantastic, though it can only be fully appreciated if you can understand Hindi. This is the most non-Bollywood to have ever come out of India for a very long time. A film as good as this has not left the studios of Mumbai since the 1950s with "Mother India". The main character is played by the best actor in India right now, Aamir Khan. The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, but not untalenteds. To enjoy this film, all one needs is a broad mind and a sensible idea of a good film. You don't need to know Hindi, or like cricket. Just sit down, enjoy the constant jokes, great story, and the excellent music by A R Rahman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lagaan is truly a unique movie. I've grown up watching many Hindi movies, and while I enjoy many of them, most follow a very standard formula. Lagaan does not. This movie has a great plot, with the suspense any sports afficianado finds in the bottom of the 9th inning in baseball, after the two minute warning in football, or watching a #16 seed keep up with a #1 seed in basketball. The movie has wonderful acting, starting with Aamir Khan, who is very well known in India and was focused on making a movie that the masses (Indians as well as non-Indians) would enjoy. And the movie has wonderful songs/dance, something that is not new for Indian movies.I would recommend this movie to those that like Hindi movies, but also to those that do not like Hindi "masala" movies or have never seen one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Indian Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on the big screen. Although, most of the movies coming out of Bollywood (India's version of hollywood) are run-of-the-mill kind, this one is unique in the sense that it has a wonderful direction and acting. I LOVE THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the most entertaining movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There may certainly be movies with more telling messages. There may also be movies that linger longer in your mind after watching them. But for sheer entertainment, you'd be hard-pressed to look past Lagaan!As one reviewer from England pointed out, the plot seems a little bit comical, especially from the Western point of view. How can you stake several lives over a simple cricket match? Guess if you've ever visited India and seen the passion for the game and understood it within the cultural context of the country, you might appreciate the plot as well. In any case, whether the plot is comical or not, what lifts the movie above all else is the stunning cinematography, flawless direction and incredible acting, by both the Indian as well as the British actors. There's just too many good points about the movie to be able to mention them all - not least the songs and the music!As for the chances at the Oscars, I haven't seen the other nominees so I cannot compare them with Lagaan. However, if the Academy is looking for movies with spirit and soul within them, I cannot imagine a better movie than this. Good luck to Aamir and co at the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic tale of small vs. mighty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I will not go into details of the story as it has been already written a 100 times by various people...I found the movie absolutely amazing... I enjoy watching/playing cricket, so that made the movie extra special. This movie would be great even if it had a different setting (football, hockey, etc.) The essence of the plot is what is so enchanting... it pits the small and weak against the mighty, which leaves the audience rooting for the improbable upset... Moreover the acting overall is excellent...This movie has been a blockbuster in India and has appealed to audiences everywhere in the world (rarely does that happen!!). I would like to encourage everyone to go see the movie judge for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some additional thoughts about a wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that a film like Lagaan, while good cinema in general, is also a particularly successful realization set of ideas that differentiates Indian commercial cinema from films made elsewhere in the world, and that some understanding of this background makes it and other films like it more accessible to an audience used to the conventions of Western film-making.In my opinion, commercial Indian cinema (whether Hindi, Tamil, Bengali ..) derives its basic aesthetic parameters from the 'navarasa' theory governing the conception of the performing arts in ancient India, most famously delineated in the Natyashastra, the treatise on classical dance. In classical Sanskrit drama, there is no differentiation into comedy, tragedy, etc. Instead, the purpose of art is to achieve the right mixture between the nine principal 'rasas' (literally: juices) - e.g. love, fear, the grotesque, pity, anger, the erotic, and a few more. Performing art is said to have succeeded if the right balance is achieved, in which case the viewer should find himself/herself in a state of 'ananda' (roughly 'bliss'). (Okay, I know this is dangerously reductive, but you get the general idea). The parallel with the idea behind calling Hindi commercial films 'masala' films is obvious, but whereas that term is usually used derogatorily, I think there is a real, powerful idea behind its notion of spices being blended together to achieve the right balance of tastes.Now I'm not suggesting that all commercial Hindi films either consciously try to do this, or indeed that those (if any) that do often succeed. But the historical and cultural justification in the use of comedy, tragedy, heroism, villainy, etc. in the space of a few reels, as typical of Hindi films, derives in my opinion precisely from this. Add to this the absence in the Indian traditional performing arts of boundaries separating dance, music, and acting, so that one artistic form is often an integral part of another, and you have a clearer idea of why Hindi films are what they are. Of course, often this reduces to a 'formula' for mindless inanity and clichés, but when a film or a play successfully grapples with the complex notion above, the result can be a very satisfying kind of film, which I think Lagaan - very much in the tradition of early Raj Kapoor films (Awaara, Shree 420) , and of films such as Sholay, Ganga Jamuna or Mother India - is.In fact, Lagaan struck me as one of the most perfect examples of the navarasa idea put into practice that I have seen recently. (Ironically, the last film I felt this about was Life Is Beautiful, which of course wasn't Indian at all, but I think it succeeded in striking precisely the right emotional balance, leading in the end to a cathartic experience for the viewer). In presenting a diverse, well-etched out cast of characters, Lagaan manages to evoke a series of different but related emotional responses from the viewer, which does in the end lead to precisely the sort of contentment that the ancients envisaged. It makes it all come together magnificently - I think a lot of Indian filmmakers try this, but it's very difficult to keep the balance and so few succeed. Lagaan, however, manages to pull it off - high drama is tempered with down-to-earth humour (and such humour; its sheer earthiness is a triumph); potential tragedy gives way to romance - but at all times, the balance is maintained so that each episode furthers the narrative and ensures that the viewer is drawn into the lives of the characters (whose very diversity and real-ness is exemplary - very soon, you actually care about these ordinary but highly individual folk and their lives), their concerns, motivations and the constraints governing their lives, but is never bored, and one's interest in the (admittedly predictable) eventual denouement never flags.Where Lagaan also works magnificently is as an allegory for the struggle for independence from British rule. It's foolish to take the film literally, as some disenchanted viewers have done. Of course the fate of the Empire wasn't decided on the whims of capricious commanding officers and cricket matches. Rather, Lagaan is best viewed as a symbolic representation of how people from different backgrounds, castes and communities came together to fight for India's independence, a message it gets across with considerable subtlety but also pretty effectively.Of course, another level at which it operates is a pretty clever comment on the role of race and racism in the world of cricket, which has been an issue from the first years when Indians started playing cricket for the British and is one even today (to wit the current power struggles within the cricketing establishment). Lagaan lays a stake to the game on behalf of the Subcontinent, but doesn't unnecessarily demonize the British in the process. It's also a very amusing introduction to the game for the uninitiated, while being a catalogue of the main issues in cricket's history for the more seasoned. Brilliant!Thirdly, Lagaan is notable for a return to the original idea behind songs and dances in Indian cinema: to move the story forward, to allow the 'unsayable' (whether thoughts or dreams) to be expressed in music. This too it does most elegantly, with Rehman's beautiful score, which is simultaneously modern and folksy. This is something Indian films used to excel in, but over the years the songs have become gratuitous (of course they can still be fun, but it helps if they fulfil this role too). Lagaan thankfully reverses this trend.Finally - I can't agree more with the person who said that Lagaan is quite different from Ray's work but is also enjoyable without being directly comparable to his films (which I love). I had said much the same in my first review. Ray's humanism was on a different scale from Lagaan's magnificently broad canvas. Ray's works were sublime concertos, whereas Lagaan is best thought of as grand opera.I hope Lagaan gets a broader international viewership, because I think that as a finely-made, well-directed, wonderfully-acted film, it deserves to. But I think it helps to have some idea of some of the things I mentioned in this review, which is more a set of observations than a review per se: I reviewed it earlier when I saw it for the first time (I've now seen it three times, and loved it each time). Go watch it, especially if it gets that post-Oscar re-release!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Indian Movie Production To Date Yet ! Jai Hind !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, to tell the truth, I only watched Lagaan; Once Upon A Time in India after knowing that it was nominated for the Oscars. Naturally, being a bit skeptical at first, I thought it was another "love triangle" nonsense. But, this movie showed a high level of professionalism and breathtaking movie production skills. Aamir Khan and Autosh Gowikar, has delivered one of the best and realistic movie about how a group of farmers in a village called Champaner rebelled against a raise in Land Tax imposed by the British. The deal they got was a simple one, defeat the mighty and experienced English team in a game of cricket and be exempted from three years of tax. The cast was simply amazing, with Aamir Khan delivering one of his best performances yet. The soundtrack, brilliantly composed by music composer A.R. Rahman was very original,fresh and contemporary of the 19th century India. Don't expect people running around trees singing love songs as the movie exemplifies great movie making realism only. The cinematography was a great technical brilliance. A great production from Aamir Khan !!</fullReview>

It truly is about the triumph of human spirit. Anyone feeling low will almost certainly get an uplift from this 4 hour film. The greatest accomplishment of this film is that once you walk out of the theatre, you'll be amazed at how quickly four hours went by! Lagaan deserves an Oscar because it is superb!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indian cinema history will now be divided into two phases: pre-Lagaan &amp; post-Lagaan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undeniably the most important movie to come out of the world's largest film industry (Bollywood) in decades, Lagaan rewrites Indian cinema history. At the cost of sounding repetitive and borrowing from Pritish Nandy's review of the same movie in Mid-day (June 20, 2001), "Our cinema history will now have two eras...Before-Lagaan and post-Lagaan."A running time of over 3 hours and 45 minutes, a period drama set in rustic Gujarat of the 19th century, a largely unknown (at least hitherto not so popular) cast, an ordinary looking debutante leading lady, a two-flop director, no mushy romance, no sex, no violence, a leading star who appears in dhoti.....a sure-fire recipe for disaster? Think again. A sure-fire hit, a stunning spectacle of the triumph of the human spirit, and just about the finest statement made on behalf of Indian cinema...that's Lagaan for you.Some emotions are very basic. They cut across cultures, time zones and generations. Lagaan evokes those emotions. It touches and activates those basic nerve circuits that send an electric shudder of exhilaration through your body, that rush of blood in to your heart, those goose pimples on your skin. It makes you stand up and applaud, because it stands for everything that an Indian is proud of. In fact it stands for everything that civilization stands for. I always wondered if any movie churned out by Bollywood would truly capture the soul of India. I was disappointed for years, because despite the great movies (oh yeah there are too many Indian movie gems) India produced, there was hardly any movie that embodied the Indian spirit completely. I was also disappointed because the only movie that came close to capturing what India was all about, was Ricahrd Attenborough's Gandhi. A film made by a Britisher, that came tantalizingly close to symbolizing the Indian-ness that I was so proud of. Circa 2001, all that changed. Lagaan changed it all. It made sure I have something to cheer about.I watched Lagaan for the first time in Bombay's Eros cinema, in it's first week of theatrical release. When I saw ecstatic viewers run up in the aisles towards the screen, dancing and clapping, I felt the same thrill. I felt it then and there. This was a completely new style of cinematic Indian patriotism. Understated, yet strong. Stylistic, yet simple. Multi-layered, yet basic. For giving us this immense, unadulterated pleasure, Aamir and team take a bow! Lagaan is a glorious invitation to the world, to come see India, it's spirit, it's people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lagaan - A masterpiece that will be remembered for years...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see Lagaan I had huge expectation mainly because Aamir Khan was producing the movie. I knew from the begining that being an Aamir Khan production this movie has to be different in real sense from all these masala movies that are being made in hundereds every year. Let me tell you guys this movie surpassed all my expectations and I think this is one of the best movie in bollywood's histroy. The way this movie has been made and the way this movie deals with several key issue is amazing. I mean how many times you have seen an indian movie dealing with the issue of tax on farmers probably never. A lot has been said about the movie so i guess i don't have to write the whole story but I will point out the strong points of the movie. 1) A very simple and unique story dealt with amazing direction. 2) All the characters in the movie with amazing performance. 3) An amazing soundatrack and background music. 4) Amazing art diection. 5) Great narration by the bollywood legend Amitabh Bachan. These are some of the storng point about the movie. I have many friends who never go for indian movies but I insisted them to go woth me a watch this paticular movie and they rate this movie as one of the top ten movie including Hollwyood movies. I guess if you don't see indian movies this movie is the best movie to start with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best cricket match I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday we went to see the Hindi film LAGAAN in a local Dallas theatre and I was spellbound.Lagaan, this emotionally and spiritually uplifting movie has been clearly a four-hour worth of unbelievable entertainment.Amir Khan, who I have always considered a "lalu" type actor with Bollywood in his veins, has made a major turnaround by producing and acting in a movie that will be remembered by posterity.Music, as usual, heart-touchingly done by A.R. Rehman, with poetic classical lyrics written by who else but Javed Akhtar, brings a different dimension to this movie shot in an 1893 british Indian rural setting where the villagers are challenged by the local cruel British Collector that they'd have to pay double their taxes (Lagaan).When approached by the local king, the collector throws a challenge - Learn our game of CRICKET and play with us. If you win, all taxes are free for the next three years. If you lose, you pay triple the amount of taxes due this year.With a hand-picked NSD/Pune Film Institute cast, the actors and actresses (Suhashini Muley of Hu Tu Tu, my all-time favorite Raghuveer Jadav, Avneesh Misra - everyone was great) - the team did a riot on the screen. The UK born and raised Gracy Singh was Indian beauty to its core. Her acting (especially eyes, facial expressions and body language) is so authentic, you could not tell she is second generation Indian - hopes for our children? :-)The Cinematography reminded me and Mithu of Gladiator, in fact we were wondering if the crowd-scene and team-spirit inspiration came from Gladiator.GO see it. If you are challenged in rural regional Hindi, do not worry - the film is subtitled.An additional reward is Amitabh Bachchan's voice in the background, narrating parts of the story, very similar to Satranj ke Khilari. Vishuddha uchharaN, ninaada kanTha.Regards,Shoumyo. (Tathagata)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a terribly great fan of Indian Film, but this deserves a perfect 10 rating! As a foreign film, it is simply genius. I have only truly liked 3 indian films in my life, but you can definitely add this to the list.It was filmed with International standards in mind. Many Indian films follow the same cheesy storyline, "Indian" special effects, and the typical hero who defeats 30 bad guys at a time. This film did not adhere to that typical "Indian" formula. To me, it can compete with the likes of other International epics, such as "Life Is Beautiful".The director used great song, visual imagery &amp; cinematography, and physical action (the game of cricket) to portray a wonderful story. Heartfelt emotion of despair, hope, helplessness, etc were vividly displayed both by these cinematic qualities and awesome acting on the part of Aamir Khan and Rachel Shelly! Paul Blackthorne was a very convincing villain, as well. All in all, it was perfect in the way they presented a real-life situation. Not like the cheesy love stories I usually see in Indian movies.</fullReview>

This happens only in (Hindi) movies.And another one being.. while being introduced to the Maharaja, Elizabeth was introduced that she cannot understand Hindi , but immediately after a couple of scenes, Ram Singh speaks fluent Hindi to her as if she could understand... The songs and location were beautiful, but they tend slow the pace of the movie..Gracy Singh was brilliant and so was Rachel Shelley and Aamir.Re-recording was an excellent piece of work by RahmanWe need such movies in Hindi..

Captures the charm of rural India to the hilt - it also shows what the ruthlessness of the erstwhile British Empire- there was a marked difference in the empire in the Americas and in India - they came to America to live there and to build it - and they came to India merely to plunder it - they did so for a long 200 years and even today we see India suffering from the blows the British dealt it. It also captures the triumph of human spirit - and shows that when mind is put over matter - anything can be achieved - in the tradition of movies like The Shawshank Redemption and Chariots of Fire. Just a piece of advice : change the subtitles - they are unintentionally hilarious like the one "Oh my lovely lassie" - else this is easily the best Indian movie ever - even better than Mother India or Bandit Queen.</fullReview>

At stake is everything..however with the help of a virtuous british girl who flips fro local hero bhuvan, the ignorant marginally beat the masters at their own game.the climax leaves the audiences relieved as the drought stricken land is washed up by heavy rains.the movie celebrates the human spirit and the director has laid emphasis on existing social problems .the brilliant music from rehman adds to the glory. but the length of the film does tend to get irritating at times.. nonetheless, a piece of brilliance..</fullReview>

This movie is longer than the average Hindi movie, but I never felt that, as I enjoyed every moment of it. The aspects of the movie that I really liked were the fight against the caste system, which has such a firm ground in Indian society even to this day, and the way people of different religions work towards a common goal. This movie should be used as a source of inspiration by people to avoid the communal fights which have plagued our societies.I have read many reviews of this movie and amazingly I found a consensus among all "critics" that this movie has set a new standard for the next generation of Indian movies. One "critic" even stated that after the release of this movie, the movies produced by Indian cinema will be known as Pre-Lagaan and Post-Lagaan. The cast and crew of Lagaan definitely deserve all the congratulations and recognition for a job par excellence. Amitabh Bachchan, an icon of Indian cinema, sums it concisely in his article "Big B is all praise for little Aamir", when he says "I found Lagaan flawless".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lagaan Is An Extraordinary Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Lagaan at the Regal Multi-plex in Whittier, California on opening night on Friday June 15, 2001.I liked the movie so much that I went to see it again on Saturday and enjoyed it even more. The picture has tremendous repeat value. I can see this 3 hour plus movie any number of times. There is not a single boring moment in the movie. Apart from Aamir Khan's incredible performance, the greatest asset of the movie is A.R.Rahman's music. He is without doubt India's best composer today and in this movie he has touched new heights. He reminds you of Naushad at his best in films like Mother India and Gunga Jumna. All songs are going to be big hits, especially Asha Bhosle's number Radha Kaise Na Jale and Lata Mangeshkar's Paalanhaare. The lyrics by Javed Akhtar are extraordinary.They are simple yet rich in meaning and poetry.In story, music and treatment Lagaan sets a new standard for Indian films. And it is an entirlely original piece of work which you cannot say for many movies these days.I could write endlessly about this movie but I am constrained by space. I would only like to add that the subtitles in English are excellent and all the non- Urdu and non-Hindi knowing people can enjoy it just as much. In fact, anyone who loves movies will love this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Braveheart for Indians!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first experience of Indian cinema, and what an enjoyable 3 1/2 hours it was too. The oppressed indian villagers must find a way to send the evil British and their unfair taxes (Lagaan) packing. A mighty battle? An uprising? A revolution? Yes - but not on the streets - on the cricket pitch! It seems the Victorian ideal of salvation through sport is alive and well in India, and its been spun around to portray the struggle against Imperialism. Who would have thought?To my mind, the basic plot seems fairly comical, but there is enough meat for serious film students to appreciate the picture as well. The cinematography is first rate, espically of the all important cricket match; the star Aamir Khan has a magical presence (albeit if he looks like an Asian Eminem); and the progressive content - including an untouchable in the team - is still fairly controversial for Indians.Anyone interested in Indian cinema, I would definitely recommend this film. It's convinced one very sceptical cinema goer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lagaan is a fresh breeze kind of music by A R Rahman. So different from today's run of the mill kind of numbers! It reminds you of good old days of pure classical music of 50s and 60s like: Mother India/ Do Aankhen Baarah Haath/ Naya Daur/ Baiju Bawara/ Goonj Uthi Shehnai/ Guide etc. All the songs are superb with excellent lyrics by Javed Akhtar. Udit Narayan is at his career's best in many songs. Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar have sung one song each and both are great as expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Second time of seeing this epic ? well, at 215 minutes long it doesn't seem that long since the last time! Once Upon A Time In India is a Spaghetti Cricket tale superbly portrayed and presented, and yet now I know: apart from the music by A. R. Rahman it just isn't my cup of tea. I'm missing a vital requirement in that (for example) I have no hatred or bitterness towards actual or attempted past, present or future invaders of Britain or any other part of the planet; life's too short.Evil cheating moneygrubbing British rulers and noble honest moneyless Indian serfs in a drought-stricken Indian province in 1893 conclude a deal to pay no tax for the next three years or be taxed at a treble rate: it all depends which side wins a cricket match. Hope it didn't give present-day Indian or English wageslaves any ideas; but I suppose as most British passport holders despise the game ? and musicals - it shouldn't make any impression here. It's slickly handled with marvellous acting, music, photography and storytelling but ? is it still entirely Bollywood or re-heated Hollywood? I must admit that I prefer the purer simpler films from the past, films like Mughal E Azam, Pakeezah or Roy's Devdas told me more and still give me more pleasure. Why, the cricket match doesn't even begin until after most films have finished! The usual messages are here, of tolerance and self-sacrifice mixed with a hokey competition plot device which becomes the plot...I miss the likes of Gene Kelly and Danny Kaye. Most of the songs are excellent my favourite being Radha Kaise Na Jale delicately sung by Asha and Udit Narayan. I never really liked Aamir Khan especially as a leading man but Gracy Singh impressed as Gauri, a perfect support character. It's Khan's film start to finish and he's seldom far away from the screen; he even bowled more than one maiden over in here too.If you understand cricket and are interested in this film's premise you should watch it - if you've seen it once that's probably enough though some of the songs bear repeated listening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Oscar material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that the Oscars themselves are always right or always pick the best films but this movie just isn't that good. Sure cricket may be an obsession in India but that does'nt mean that a bunch of villagers can become professional cricketers overnight. That is the biggest flaw in this movie. And how the hell can they get trained in cricket by an englishwoman? How is it that the hero can become such a great and consistent batsman in such a short period? It just isn't realistic and believable enough despite the great production values. It seems that none of the characters had a shred of self respect, the way they portrayed themselves. However, there are plenty of other plus points to make this movie highly watchable for a non Indian. The British cast are excellent in this movie.India has produced plenty of movies actually capable of winning the Oscars but this is just not one of them. Go see stuff like "Black" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Lagaan" is so delightful it became an international hit...something no other Indian film has yet been able to do. Although the more ponderous films of master Satyajit Ray won critical acclaim they did not enchant mass non-Indian audiences as this one has. Much of the credit goes to the winsome performance of Aamir Khan whose determined character pulsates with exuberant life. The usual Indian penchant for injecting songs and dances throughout is here done judiciously well and in keeping with the ongoing action so that it joyously moves the story along with a great deal of spirit rather than evoking a wince. My only criticism is that the film needed a few more European or American extras because it was obvious that Indians were pretending to be British in the British scenes. Altogether a joyously infectious, spirited romp. Even the inordinate length was not a problem and seemed to fly by, building to a nice tense climax as the poor Indian team tries so hard to triumph. With all the charisma and energy of Aamir Khan as their handsome young captain, how could they possibly lose?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it could have been shorter. It didn't seem like 4 hours but the film did drag in places.I haven't seen many Indian films in my life and know nothing about cricket so the film was hard to follow at times. (I think a short run down on how cricket is played would have helped) Still, I figured it out.The movie itself is very interesting--name all the Indian films that takes place in 1893, is about a cricket match between Indians and the British AND is a musical AND is 4 hours long! Purportedly this type of film is not unusual in India but here in America. Still I did like it.The dialogue (actually subtitles) read very well, the setting is (in a way) quite beautiful and the film is very colorful.On the down side: The acting is (with two exceptions) pretty poor--people either overact (the Indians) or underact (the British). Only Aamir Khan and Rachel Shelley give out good performances. He's great as the lead--handsome, hunky and full of charisma. Good singer and dancer too. Shelley has a role that could have been a disaster--she's a kind British woman who teaches the Indians to play cricket and (understandably) falls in love with Khan. It's an old stereotype, but she manages to rise above it. The songs are not that good--there are only 6 and only the first one and an unintentionally hysterical love song in the middle are fun. The others bring the film to a screeching halt and go on forever. The 4 bad songs annoyed me and the climatic cricket match goes on forever.Still, I recommend this highly. I saw it in a theatre but on video or DVD you can just fast forward through the bad songs and slow spots. When this film is doing well, it's just great. Worth seeing--perfect family viewing (if you have a kid who will sit through a 4 hour subtitled film).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this DVD on the strength of 1.) Aamir Khan's fabulous performance in "Dil Chahta Hai", 2.) Customer reviews and 3.) The film's Oscar nomination for best foreign language film in 2002. Well, the fact is that Aamir Khan truly does light up the screen in this outing as he did in the aforementioned. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that every moment he is on screen is a delight. Goodness only knows why the Western film industry have failed to recruit this considerable talent. He is a gifted actor, is profoundly charismatic - and a great dancer to boot! Unfortunately, he isn't on screen for the whole 215 minutes. Moreover, his co-stars pale by comparison. (No pun intended.) Be they the simpering girlfriend, the English Rose or the pantomime British villain, they are all lacking somehow. Thematically, the film is in the time-honored (fairytale) tradition of the "Rocky" movies but on long-play. It drags to an overly long conclusion. And I hardly think four song and dance routines qualify this movie as a musical - especially as none of them are particularly memorable.I've no idea why the film was nominated for an Oscar. Either it was a bad year for foreign films or the Academy must have felt obliged to include an Indian film for once. It's clear why it didn't win. It's not bad but it isn't Oscar material by a long way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie that will change how movies are made in India!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think of how many movies keep you engrossed for three running hours, the brilliance of Lagaan is evident from keeping your interest for all of its four hours (with an interval and some boring ads and trailors thrown in). It could have been a few minutes shorter - but that would be at the cost of detail, drama, humor, or perhaps a silent cinematographic transition. Different sections of the audience appreciate different aspects of a film - and a film that can please as many sections without getting on the nerves of another must be appreciated as a truly complete film. And in that respect, Lagaan is a perfect example of complete film, a classy entertainer, with superior technical execution - like Sholay (the only other comparable movie).The strength of "Lagaan" is in the people behind its making. Ashutosh Gowariker leads the way as a director first, and as much as the man behind the story and screenplay. Anil Mehta uses color and camera to bring out the mood in each scene. A period movie set in 1893 would rely on sets and costumes - but limiting the movie to one village called Champaner and nearby British Cantonment makes it easier on Nitin Desai and Bhanu Athaiya to successfully take you back by a century with none of the usual faux pas.A R Rahman´s background score combines with Anil Mehta´s visual brilliance for a strong audio-visual impact. The songs impress by themselves, and instrumental notes from the songs work brilliantly in the background track - that keeps you listening and appreciating it from the titles to the credits at the end. The songs blend into the movie with Javed Akhtar´s strong lyrics and are innovative choreography. There may be some whispers about the songs affecting the narrative but there is an audience that wants to see movies for the songs and choreography - and Lagaan manages the balance between narrative and song-and-dance well. About the cast, everyone brings life into their roles. Aamir Khan stands out - with his screen time to movie time ratio most likely to beat some of Kamal Haasan´s movies.Now, about the movie itself - it is a modernized presentation of four-decade old "Naya Daur". It is a movie about common men, led by a strong-minded individual to overcome resistance and differences in opinion - and standing their ground for a cause against a powerful opposition. There is a cause for a fight, there is a fight, and there is a moral victory in the end. This is the stuff that most good-over-bad and other moral stories are made of, but the details in the script of Lagaan make it work.The humor built into individual characters as Aamir Khan assembles a cricket team and respond to the challenge of the British General is most entertaining. At the cost of sounding sexist, some of the ignorant humorous descriptions of cricket amused me by how close it was to what some women in the house would say when all men are glued to the TV and households come to a standstill (often depriving the women of some boring TV serial). This humor is certainly a strength of the movie, blended most brilliantly into a serious and inspirational narrative. Full credit to the director, screenplay, dialogues, and the performers.About the story itself - it is incidental to the movie. Lagaan is more about spirit, inspiration, and cinematic brilliance rather than a story that will move you. And should I say, thankfully there is no marriage, no rituals and functions, and the stuff that most of 90´s were made off. The movie works at the level of spirit and inspiration, and not at some perceived lost cultural value in society - and most thankfully so.And to conclude this review - I must say Lagaan and Sholay, being two very different movies share a lot in common - in how complete they are. Think about this - what´s so common to these movies.Extra long movies, suppressed societies, domination through power, the spirit to fight, inspiring and building a team, humor and entertainment in a serious script, brown barren landscapes, strong people and characters, story of a single village, and we can keep counting ...So, here I am shooting off a feature by feature comparison of the two movies.Length and directions - Two "too" long movies - where the length didn´t bore you. Two directors, who got their formula right.Performances and characters - Sholay was easily better with a different genre of performers and more complete characters. Lagaan suffers from the typical "Kamal Haasan" syndrome - of centering around one character.The love story - If it were not for the Amitabh-Jaya love story of Sholay, Lagaan would be far superior with how the romantic angle never interferes or disturbs on the narrative.Creating a whole village - Two movies that successfully take you to a different society with pains, pleasures, and feelings that are not so common with what we associate with.Terror - Gabbar Singh scores and its an unfair comparison here. The British general is more about misplaced pride than terror.Humor - Lagaan wins, with humor being a part of its people - unlike Sholay which had parallel tracks and comic characters like "Soorma Bhopali" and the "Jailor".Visual effects - Technologies have evolved in 25 years, but the brilliance of Anil Mehta in Lagaan is still only comparable to what we saw in Sholay. Songs and dances - Lagaan scores with its songs, though R D Burman could undo all the brilliance of A R Rahman with one Mehbooba.Background music - It would be hard to tell the two apart in how well they served the movie.Climax - Sholay wins, for the stark and different end - and this is one weakness for Lagaan to be a little more cliched, heroic, and melodramatic. Yet, the climax of Lagaan has its moments and tries to be different in its own way. How often has a cricket match formed a climax (without getting so farcical as Chamatkar, Maalamaal, and the Dev Anand fiasco which incidentally again had Aamir Khan at the crease)?So - for those who still believe that Sholay is the best entertainer Hindi cinema has seen till date, here is reason to rejoice that Lagaan is comparable if not better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually original in its own way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must preface this review with several caveats. First, "Lagaan" is Indian cinema, and anyone unwise enough to compare it to Hollywood cinema should really think twice before writing a review. Indian cinema can and does have inexplicable musical numbers, acting standards that are sometimes at the level of a TV movie of the week, and they are LONG. If you know that before you sit down with "Lagaan", you are in for a treat."Lagaan" is a well told tale of the sufferings of a poor Indian village in 1893 under tyrannical British rule. The ultimate showdown between oppressor and oppressed is set up early on in the form of a cricket match between the British officers who rule the region and the inexperienced, spirit-shaken villagers, led by Bhuvan. If you haven't seen "The Longest Yard", "Victory", or even the game in "The Road to El Dorado", you are still probably familiar with the storytelling device of using a sporting contest in allegory.And let me tell you, "Lagaan" is shamelessly heavy-handed in its sweeping use of allegory. Nearly all of the characters might strike you as stereotypical if you fail to realize that they are deliberately allegorical. The director is not even trying to hide how each person represents an aspect of the overall situation of British Imperial rule, and how each person is also singularly responsible for representing a significant strength or weakness of the people they portray, whether Indian or English.So if you are looking for Scorcese or Spielberg (or even George Lucas! ha!), forget it. The musical numbers are sometimes jarring and might even appear silly to Western audiences, but they have strength and fit into the entire allegorical pattern consistently. I admit that had those songs been omitted, I might have liked the film more.But that cricket game is remarkable. I have seen the same kind of showdown game any number of times in any number of films. I knew what the outcome was going to be. But that game was astonishing and gives the film a strength that nicely balances out the weakness created by the songs and the ridiculous love story. I genuinely suspended my disbelief long enough to believe that the outcome of the film might not be quite so happy. When the director can do that to a veteran movie buff (and occasional cynic), he has demonstrated some kind of mastery in his craft.Before I saw this movie, I knew little about cricket. Afterwards, I knew slightly more, but I did understand one thing that really surprised me. Without making the British unnecessarily sinister or unscrupulous, cricket still came across as disturbingly unforgiving and even brutal. I understood why it is a game many consider to be synonymous with fairness and skill and knowing the rules. And I truly felt the director and the performers did me a service for my $4 rental fee.Give "Lagaan" a chance, and tell me if Aamir Khan doesn't look like a buffed out Indian version of American Tobey Maguire!!</fullReview>

They are already taxed to the bone by the British and their cronies, but when Jack Russell announces that he will double the Lagaan (tax) from all villagers, they decide to oppose it.So, Aamir Khan seems to be in every Indian film, and every Indian film seems to be three to four hours long. And often for no reason. This is another one of those.I appreciate the idea of having a film made by Indians about the Indian resistance to British rule. There is certainly more to that story than simply "Gandhi". But the Bollywood way of telling these stories just ruins them.

Too bad, though, about the heavy dose of revisionist history! In fact, this movie's a four-hour long demonization of the Raj (British rule) that's sure to disappoint any with an authentic interest in colonial times. The story centers around a cricket match wager between villagers hoping to escape taxes and a local colonial British administrator eager to out-do himself in providing a hateful stereotype for the Indian resistance (and their cinematic inheritors). One must wonder at the insecurity of any producer of so jaundiced and anti-British a screenplay. Not to mention India's movie goers. Far too much singing and dancing accompany it all, of course, but between musical numbers the viewer will find enough quality script, acting and scenery to carry it off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had rather high hopes for this. A high IMDb rating (8.3 for Lagaan) should at the same time never be seen as a guarantee (V for Vendetta, Rush, Ip Man to name just a few surprising above-8-ratings) and could be as deceptive as Academy awards nominations/winners. Im sure ratings and accolades accounts for something, but in some cases, it is hard to understand how a movie has grown to be generally accepted as a masterpiece. For me, Lagaan is such a film. The title (Once upon a time in India) and the length (244 min!) implies an epic. At the same time, the length is a double-edged sword. If musicals with an underdog sport story is not your thing ca 4h may prove to be quite a feat. I sat through this but did not like it much. I found it cheesy, sentimental and thought most characters where irritating. I guess the idea is you should sheer for the team of mistreated locals. One of the problems is that you never really feel that their situation is severe, since the film is so family oriented and polished...I'm sure a lot of people like Lagaan, there is a lot of proof for it. For me, it stands as one of many examples of mysteriously high-rated mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adopts the same ridiculous Europocentric Formulae!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good entertainment, but we should beware that this movie injects subtle twists that exalt European (i.e., White) supremacy. Ironic, isn't it? Four quick examples: (1.) As with most all Hollywood-formulaic scripts, no non-White group is capable of defeating a White man without, ironically, help from another White man. In this case, help comes from the kind-hearted sister of the megalomaniacal Captain Andrew Russell. Not even an Indian who played cricket with the British army is capable of teaching the game to his Indian teammates! (2.) The Elizabeth Russell character, a White female, incredibly masters the Hindi language in a matter of weeks. Of course, the local Indian farmers cannot seem to utter the simplest of phrases in English. (3.) It was not surprising to see that even the standard of beauty tilts towards European and away from Indian, by the camera lens work (particularly in a musical interlude featuring Elizabeth Russell) and music accompaniment that underscores the appearances of Ms. Russell. Predictably, she adorns herself in a sari to demonstrate yet another conquest of Indian culture. (4.) For the final insult, how terrible a "resolution" it is to see that as his "punishment," the evil captain is shipped to Central Africa! Supposedly, he is being sent there by Her Majesty in order to "tame" other restless "wogs of the Commonwealth". I guess there should be a sequel to show how the sub-Saharan Africans have been taught (by the benevolent Ms. Russell, no doubt) how to master the intricacies of POLO against the oppressive regime of the relocated despot Captain Russell!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but way to long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally enjoyed this movie, it was very well made for its low budget. It had a lot of singing and dancing and a very good plot. On the other hand the movie was a little "over the top" and was slightly confusing. There was no need for a spy in the community to tell the British what was going on, and there was certainly no need for the girls to get jealous of each other. Those parts of the movie were just a waste of time. Plus the film made me hate the British for 3 hours. The art of the movie in general was beautiful and fun. The dancing was well choreographed and the plot was exciting. I would watch this film again but I would skip a few parts. I give this film a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notwithstanding the fact that perhaps Oscar is not the last word as far as the worth of a movie is concerned, I've no idea on what basis Lagaan was sent to the Oscar nevertheless!At best, Lagaan is just another movie, or rather, continuous and endless buffoonery for almost 4 hours! This movie is full of stereotypes: ruthless British ruler, "superman" hero who has to score the decisive run in the match, villager who work as informer for the British, English woman falling for the village hero (Mard Tangewalla!!).. and so on and so forth. The whole cricket match was at best, irritating buffoonery. In my personal opinion, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander was a far better movie than this one, and only blockheads could think that this movie was worth an Oscar!Now the plus point: well, I could at least finish watching this movie, unlike another "great" Oscar nomination, Devdaas, which I had to stop after about 30 minutes of viewing.Note: The story of Lagaan is nothing original either; it's taken from the movie Victory (or, Escape to Victory), made in 1981.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong in some departments, weak in too many others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was amused at the hype the film created amongst well-meaning Indians when it got nominated for the best foreign film Oscar and found entry into the Competition Section of Cannes in 2002. It was no mean achievement for an Indian film, in the perspective of the political and other forces that come into play in the long selection process. Yet, the film was inherently too weak to represent the best in Indian cinema. The strengths of "Lagaan" were: 1. Great sound (I do not imply music) recording and the split of the sound into six channels--one of the best in Indian cinema since "Sholay"; 2. Commendable casting of Indian actors who are alumni of the National School of Drama, Delhi and the Film Institute, Pune--and not because they are sons and daughters of famous Indian actors or they won international beauty contests; 3. Good costumes; 4. Some good lilting songs with music of A R Rahman; and 5. authentic pronunciation.The weaknesses were: 1. Unrealistic photography--passing dark clouds that have sharp boundaries i.e., with an umbra and no penumbra, resembling shadows of sci-fi films like "Independence day"; 2. A screenplay that ignores the development of secondary characters like Gauri, the British characters, and Indians who work for the British while these characters are utilized unabashedly and lackadaisically to burnish the main plot -- a look at the character development of tertiary characters of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns or Japanese cinema will show the lack of depth of Lagaan's screenplay; 4. Lack of detailed research on cricket rules of that era which any serious director would have done; 5. Inadequate and poor subtitling, with key lines left out and additional lines that appear that were never spoken; 6. A director who fumbles with editing and camera perspectives on the deer and rabbit sequences and forgets to capture the "no-balls" of bowlers on camera, 7 Uninspired editing ... the list is endless.A modest production like Shyam Benegal's "Ankur" or any Adoor Gopalakrishnan's later films would have won an Oscar because these films take direction, screenplay, photography, editing and sound seriously to a level beyond the obvious importance the producers of "Lagaan" gave to the story and acting. Unfortunately, the films of Benegal and Gopalakrishnan were never sent to the Oscars by the Indian organizations that choose the representative Indian film to vie for an Oscar..Yet "Lagaan" is a good Indian film excelling in certain departments but is definitely not a patch on the best Indian cinema today. A film of Mrinal Sen (later period), Gopalakrishnan, Benegal, or Karnad offer better cinema than "Lagaan"--though none of these filmmakers could afford the monetary and technological advantage in the hands of the producers of "Lagaan."I commend the performances of some players such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajesh Vivek and Sri Vallabh Vyas in their poorly developed roles. These are great actors on stage but cinema unfortunately has resorted to casting them as stereotypes. I wish these three are picked up by accomplished directors and given an opportunity to express their talent in complex roles. Then they would give the Amir Khans a run for their money and prove acting skills of trained Indian actors further. British actress Rachel Shelley was refreshing to watch and may develop into an accomplished actress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly escapist portrayal of history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching a typical Bollywood film, the first thing that comes to the viewers' minds is an elaborate use of music and a strong theme of escapism in the storyline. Despite having these stereotypical aspects, Lagaan was able to somewhat distinguish itself from the so-called Bollywood 'formula'. The film takes place in India during the British Colonial era which is a setting that is rarely ever seen in Bollywood films, while its style of displaying a rural environment seems reminiscent of both Bollywood and Hollywood westerns. Along with its setting and cinematic attributes, Lagaan also differentiated itself by descriptively portraying the native culture of India. The variety of metaphors used throughout the dialogues and songs was able to show the audience what the lifestyle of Champaner villagers was like. Throughout the majority of the film, it could be seen that superstition played a major role in every character's life. With many of the songs being about gods and goddesses, the film was able to portray a religion-based society.In the opening scene of the film, the director was able to give a good feel for what the presence of the British Empire was like by showing a series of long shots which portrayed the systematic way in which tax was collected from the villagers. Also, the crosscut between the marching soldiers and the expressions of the villagers was able to effectively establish a feeling of animosity towards the British. The shot that cemented Russell's character was in the scene following his initial meeting with the Raja where he was shown from a low-angle as he stood along-side his subordinate Indian soldiers who in contrast to him, were all bowing down. This presentation of the antagonist enabled the director to send a message to the audience by portraying Russell as force to be reckoned with. Unlike the aesthetic visuals of the film, Lagaan's background score seemed very out-of-place throughout many scenes. The film lacked a sense of consistency in the type of music used in representing certain situations. An example of this was seen in every scene where Elizabeth would enter an Indian environment. This was clearly displayed when she asked to speak to Bhuvan alone. The scene started off with low-key, traditional Indian music and quickly changed to a western violin tune without having any transition between both melodies. Personally speaking, I believe the film should have had a balance between a western and Indian music theme when characters from both sides appeared on screen. Though the story of Lagaan focused on the colonial era, there were many instances where the film lacked a sense of realism. The greatest drawback of this film was the improbable way in which Elizabeth's emotions for Bhuvan were shown to the audience. Instead of showing character development in Elizabeth's role, the director made the colossal mistake of showing her fall in love at first sight. This narrative behind Elizabeth's love for Bhuvan left the audience with a feeling of vagueness and disbelief. Throughout the course of the film, the viewers were left wondering why a high society woman from England who had never interacted with Indian people would suddenly fall in love with a simple villager such as Bhuvan. Perhaps the most unrealistic dialogue throughout the entire film was in the scene where Elizabeth tells Bhuvan that she never had any friends throughout her life. It seems unlikely that someone of her stature would've live in isolation.Lagaan presented India's point of view on the colonial era but unfortunately, it wasn't able to relate to western audiences. The way that Gowariker portrayed the British Empire was too cliché and stereotypical. With dialogues such as "jolly good", a background score of classical instruments, and the formal style of British dancing, Gowariker portrayed a somewhat biased account of what western lifestyle was like. Though Ashutosh Gowariker slightly moves away from the Bollywood 'formula' it can be seen that his inspiration behind Lagaan's cinematography comes from both Hollywood and Bollywood westerns. The story of a village being oppressed by an authority figure (in this case Captain Russell), was a scenario often seen throughout 'masala' films of the 1970s. However, his portrayal of Bhuvan as a somewhat vulnerable character is what separates this film from the typical Bollywood venture. The script of this film required Gowariker to lower a certain amount of escapism simply because the film was about a serious subject matter. Unfortunately, in order to make this film a commercial success, Gowariker was forced to keep fantasy-filled songs throughout the plot in order to appeal to the Indian audience. In my personal opinion, Lagaan was no different from the typical Bollywood film. Despite Gowariker's attempts to deviate from the Bollywood 'formula', it still seemed like a film dependent solely on an escapist theme. The songs in the film took away the realistic feeling of the British Colonial era. With a stereotypical portrayal on western society, it seemed like the film went off of Gowariker's bias against the British instead of factual information of the colonial period. Another drawback of the film was Elizabeth's infatuation with a man who she couldn't communicate with. Her nonsensical love for Bhuvan not only made the film look unrealistic, but also took away from the main focus of the film which was colonialism. The length of the film could have easily been shorter if Gowariker concentrated less on creating an articulate love triangle. With its descriptive portrayal of Indian culture, but lack of implementing realism and a universal appeal to audiences, I give Lagaan 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cartoonish; Lacks Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lagaan" was a darling of the press; too bad; it's overrated.If you want to see art films from India, ripe with the magic that this film utterly lacks, view films by the master, Satyajit Ray.If you want to see a fun, expansive Bollywood flick, pick one with Amitabh Bachchan, "Coolie," for example.If you want to see a movie with a powerful social conscience and incredible amounts of courage, check out "Bandit Queen." "Lagaan" is cartoonish and strictly for the middle brow.There are extensive singing and dancing numbers, performed by people who can't sing or dance, directed by a director without an eye for the body and its movements.When the film's star, Aamir Khan, moves his shoulders in a typical Indian dance move, he looks so uncomfortable you wonder if he's got a coat hanger stuck in his shirt.He looks like he's never made that prototypically Indian dance move before; given the theme of the movie, his apparent inauthenticity is inadvertently comical. Maybe the stiff British officer would perform the move with more grace and ease.This is such a shame. There is great dancing in India, with a centuries-long pedigree. If a movie is going to be seen before international audiences, and represent Indian dance, it should not be this.Other Bollywood movies wear their buffoonery lightly. "Lagaan" takes itself oh-so seriously.It wants to be an expose of the suffering of helpless peasants and the cruelty of the British Raj.Thing is, you can see real suffering, helpless peasants in India today. They are not suffering under the heel of the British Raj, they are suffering under the heel of Indian policies and cultural norms, like, oh, say, the caste system and misogyny. VS Naipaul had a lot to say about that ...But, anyway. Real life Indian peasants look nothing like the plump, immaculate, perfectly coiffed, sparkly-toothed stars of this movie.And that's a problem. You can't really make a gritty expose while banishing from your set the very visible throngs -- visible even to the most casual of tourists -- in any Indian street -- who looks even vaguely like the people whose plight you are dramatizing and wringing your hands over.Well, musicals aren't realistic, you might be saying.Well, I'd reply, musicals do feature the truth of great singing and great dance. When a performer with the talent of Paul Robeson belts out a song as great as "Old Man River," you get the point being made about the plight of African Americans in the South, even if Robeson is on a soundstage, not on the banks of the Mississippi.No one in "Lagaan" can sing or dance, and there are no great songs in the movie. And Hollywood bothered to costume Paul Robeson in simple, torn clothing.The excruciatingly bogus peasants of "Lagaan" look like some very rich and privileged person's fantasy of what peasants ought to look like. They look like collectible international dolls, like something you'd purchase in an airport before departure. It's all very Potemkin-village-esquire.The Sadistic British Officer is utterly unbelievable. The audience looks at him and sees nothing but the filmmakers' pathetic political agenda. A more realistic character, once less flamboyant, painted and dyed, but more believable, could have been much more horrible.The movie wants to be Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" and ends up being a Warner Brothers' Road Runner v. Wile E. Coyote cartoon.Because it is so bogus, it is lifeless. "Lagaan" doesn't have the exuberant goofiness of less ambitious Bollywood movies. Those movies have their truth; their truth is the most extravagant dreams of their poorest viewers."Lagaan" is a politically correct dream, and, as such, it becomes an artistic nightmare.Some will like "Lagaan," though. As mentioned, there are costumes galore, with nary a tear from long use or spot from buffalo dung. There are vapid musical numbers, unencumbered by any connection to organic life.Aamir Khan, the lead, is gorgeous, and he wears very little clothing, so you get to enjoy his gorgeousness in all its gorgeousness.Khan greatly resembles Tyrone Power. Khan looks like Power, he is as beautiful as Power was, and he has Power's absence of any apparent quality -- intelligence, physicality, depth -- other than great beauty.Gracy Singh is beautiful *and* a good actress. Let's hope she goes far. Far away from "Lagaan." There's a lot up on the screen. A Big Plot Device, scenery, and, oh, did I mention the costumes? Ultimately, though, given its complete divorce from either artistic excellence or the courses of real life, it's all pretty boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not quite get the enthusiasm. True enough, the film has very high production values -- it looks terrific and sounds great. But to me, Lagaan is essentially a four-hour musical version of Bad News Bears that erroneously thinks is also a profound a political drama. Also, the characters are rather one-dimensional, particularly the bad white folks. Perhaps I would not have been so irked if not for the nearly four-hour run time. I have not seen much Bollywood, and I did find the cut-to-music-video scenes, coupled with fact that the actors are not singing their own songs (i.e., there is just one singer for all the women characters and one for the men) distracting, but I do not think that was the source of my discontent. I recently saw A Peck On the Cheek, which is also Bollywood, and I thought that movie was far superior to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can a movie about cricket, 15 minutes short of four hours, be entertaining?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The answer: kind of. Occasionally. But Lagaan is a very flawed film. I think the Sports Movie is probably the worst cinematic genre, in that there are really only two possible outcomes in the end. The underdogs either win or they lose. Both options have been so utterly overdone that a sports movie just can't really be very interesting. Add to that the fact that I know so little of cricket ? if you don't, you probably should read up on the rules before you see Lagaan (like the fact that you can bean a batter without any penalty whatsoever) ? and that promises a very dull movie. Fortunately, the film manages to be pretty entertaining all the way through. And since I personally broke it up into three different sittings, the length wasn't a big deal (if I had seen this in the theater, I very well might have despised it). It helps that the film is partly a musical. There are, I think, only six musical numbers, all of them good, a couple just fantastic (they get less impressive as the film goes on). The musical score of the film is also very good. And the (Indian) actors are all pretty good, with Gracy Singh (as Gauri) being an absolutely stunning beauty. I hated the way that the British were portrayed, though. Yeah, I know, they were pretty awful to their subjects at this point of history. But they're so evil, they might as well be twirling their ever-present mustaches. And the more flamboyant the facial hair, the meaner they are. There is a lot of semi-frightening `I hope our gods break the backs of the Whiteys!' sentiment flying around the film, and Lagaan sometimes seems like a very hateful movie. It does very little to actually separate the past with the present, it seems to me. And then there's the white woman. She seems like she might have been added to apologize for the rest of the British characters (she has no facial hair), but she's so poorly written that all of her actions and appearances are laughable. And the semi-romantic relationship between herself and Bhuvan, the main Indian character, is an incredibly anachronistic and unbelievable conceit. Not much is even made of it, really, except for a particularly hilarious scene where she joins in during one of the better musical numbers. I don't particularly recommend Lagaan (you might want to buy the soundtrack, though, or download a couple of the songs), but many may like it much more than I did. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lagaan is very stylish, but formulaic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lagaan evokes emotions by tapping into the Indian psyche. It distills into film the more exciting moments from a cricket game; batters getting pummeled, wickets getting knocked over, home runs, centuries, and tide-turning errors. The film also has droughts, evil British oppressors, and a pitiful Untouchable kid.Unfortunately these symbols don't resonate with my ABCD brain. Removing them, Lagaan is left me with flat characters, a simple plot, an undeveloped lovestory, and an awfully long running time.Purely as a sports movie I think Lagaan falls short. Compare it to Karate Kids and Rockys. There, the competition is not so focused on the win/lose/tie outcome, but on the heroes gaining self-respect. Instead, Lagaan's Indian team lacked a coach-figure inspiring them to "do your best; don't lose to fear." Instead, they had Aamir Khan telling them "try to let me handle it"The game-ending scene in Lagaan is about as fulfulling as G.W. winning the Florida election or Brazil winning the 1994 World Cup. The outcome hinges on chance, not effort.Songs and lyrics are fun but have a major problem: most of the the lip-syncing is not convincing. You see the mouths chatting in a desert while you hear the singers screaming in a closet. They don't blend well. Save the echo and reverb for the soundtrack CD.</fullReview>

The acceptance of the "Untouchable" player by the other villagers could have been handled with more realism. It's not so easy to change entrenched social values.The cricket match is the best part.

		<fullReview>First movie by an actor's production house, a director high on technicality, unlimited budget and lots of publicity--- combine all this and u have lagaan. Publicised as "Once Upon a Time in India" -- the once upon a time is just incidental. It is definitely not a period movie, but emphasises on its setting to justify a large canvas. The plot is about some village people trying to beat an English team(englishmen who are the all-in-all for smooth running of the British empire) in a game of cricket so that they do not have to pay any taxes(lagaan) for the next three years. The movie is excellent technically--well choreographed songs, beautiful cinematography etc but that is all the movie has to it. The actors too play their part, which is not substantial, fairly well. The movie has been stretched to almost 4 hours but the plot deserves no more time than a routine movie..(In fact, there is not much plot at all.) There is not even a single actor other than Bhuvan(played by Aamir) which is developed. The movie focusses solely on Aamir and does not allow any other strong character to emerge. The stress on good cinematography (read good looking scenes ) is so large that peasants(poor, starving and all) living in pre-independence India wear freshly laundered (as good as new) clothes most of the time. It just does not look like that these are the poor peasants struggling to save their land but just a cricket team which is desperate to score a win over a fancied team. The love triangle is not even a triangle but a fleeting line....All in all, a movie which looooks good but just that... Its soul is missing...And as for the length of the movie , for people who can watch test matches from start to end may find it to their liking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty boring and the same scrappy Bollywood style...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would rate this movie 5.5/10. Well to start with, I should be impartial if I want to give marks. In some aspects the movie was good (photography, camera work, actors roles etc.) but in others this was a disappointing movie. Same old Bollywood style with length that bored me a lot (3.5 hrs!!) and scores of songs. Traditionally, these songs never come out from the actors or actresses voices, all dubbed!! The movie that won an Oscar that year (No Man's Land) was really a must-watch, even Amelie (the contender for that year's Oscar) was brilliant in terms of conception and ingenuinity. One does not have to spend a million bucks to carry a movie to human hearts and the sole example was No Man's Land. Lagaan, truly speaking, doesn't even etch by the Oscar winner or even Amelie, I feel it was lucky to be drawn in the final six as a nominee. And speaking about the Indian Oscar nominations; I was pretty surprised that instead of choosing Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, the Indian government chose another scrap a year later, the result: Indian movie never got past. Even they could have selected Mira Nair's "Monsoon Wedding", a wonderful movie, much better than Lagaan. There should not be any false sentimental feelings that Lagaan missed the Oscar by whisker, in fact in terms of cinematic standards, it stands no where near the past winners, e.g. Cinema Paradiso, Il Postino, Life is Beautiful, The Seven Samurai etc etc. Am I true? You may differ, you have every right to, but the fact is Bollywood has three versions of movies, the most boring and dilapidated love and romantic movies, or the gangster movies or the age old police-thief-politician story. One wonders when the time will come for the age old Bollywood directors to present the truth and the real. And I am pretty sure they will never send Bavhum for Oscar, instead send movies like Jeans or Devdas...much of the similie of Indian politics here too!! My real query is if India really boasts of being a secular, democratic and multi-lingual country (this is the only country which boasts of having more than 33 different languages, besides the Hindi), then why not send the regional movies which are miles ahead in terms of direction, art, cinematography and story? If there is a rule of sending only the Hindi movies for Oscar, then why falsify and overstate the word, "multilingual country"??? India would have won a film Oscar years ago if they had chosen to send movies of the regional languages (especially from Bengal, Tamilnadu and Kerala).</fullReview>

The sport is ridiculous enough as it is, no need for a four-hour commercial.Rating - 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much ado about the same old same old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most Indian movie fans seem to think that if a movie doesn't have Govinda doing his pelvic gyrations, or if some big-busted vamp/heroine doesn't do a "choli key peechay kya hai?" number, then it is Oscar material! How pathetic.This film, apart from being long and boring, is also totally unrealistic. How easy would it have been to get a low-caste person on the same team as the upper-castes, and that too, a hundred years ago? For our "hero", Aamir Khan, it is a piece of cake! A few sugar-coated words, and voila!, everybody falls in line! Well, that effort alone (of convincing the team-mates about playing alongside a lower-caste person) could have been a movie in itself!The plot is ridiculous, the screenplay is ridiculous, the assumptions are ridiculous and the finale' is ridiculous. Not to mention the numerous songs that the characters keep breaking into every now and then.There have been some good movies from India that at least had a decent and well-deserved chance at the Oscars -- Manthan, Pushpak, Nayakan, Salaam Bombay... (the last one was indeed nominated and deservedly so), but this movie is so trite that I feel the Oscars committee should really have reduced the field to four films if they didn't find anything else deserving a nomination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very well made and it looked fantastic with authentic costumes, locations and nice songs but the story and characters were one dimensional and cartoonish. A bunch of misfit peasants beat the arrogant Brits at their own game with a 3-way love triangle woven in pretty much sums this movie up. The ending is obvious from the very beginning and hence there isn't any suspense. There is some petty infighting amongst the peasants along with some modern day political correctness thrown in about the caste system but in the end everyone in the village lives happily ever after. I much prefer "Monsoon Wedding" and "American Desi."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4 hours of crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when i went into the film, i expected the match to end at half time, followed by some sort of armed uprising by the villagers to overthrow the british, or at least make an attempt. nothing like that. the whole film builds up to one long cricket match.the first time gracy singh came on the screen, i thought she would become someone else's girl, probably raghuvir yadav. i was shocked to discover she was the "heroine" !!the english actor who was the "villain" looked more like a spolt rich schoolboy than even remotely dangerous or evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4 hours of pain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shall attempt to drag you into the colonial India, which has been created in a mould as to justify the movie's weak script, in which of all the inane things, the British try to settle a row with the Indians over Land Tax [i.e Lagaan] with a Cricket Match! Its a combination of sorts of the Baseball movies Hollywood keeps churning out [with the plot of a small town team making it to the big league and so and so), and the various over-glamourised period films. The premise of the film is hence utterly ridiculous. It shall drag along for good 4 hours, the second half being a supposedly exciting Cricket Match with a nail biting finish! And oh, the ending is so predictable, the movie, however is partly saved by the various unknown actors' and actresses' decent performance.To top it all, this movie has innumerable songs which just test the viewer's patience. The makers should know that the international commercial audience shall NEVER accept the mindless song and dance routine that the Indian Cinema is infamous for. The direction, though a notch up from the usual Indian stuff is nevertheless bland and uninspiring. Basically, a wannabe hollywood type sport movie set in the colonial era. And we should of course know here, that Cricket is to the subcontinent what Baseball is to America. On the whole, a forgettable picture, more so because it goes on for 4 whole hours! No doubt the movie bombed at the box office across the United States.Better off without it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Boo" for Bollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sooner or later it had to happen: a movie to score a hit from the world's most prolific film industry: Bombay. For years we've been hearing about the 800 or more films churned out by this industry, which largely remain in India, unseen by the rest of the world. Now Ashutosh Gowaricker's "Lagaan" seems about to change all that. People are going to see his 223 minute musical drama centering on a taxation wager in the form a winner-take- or-lose-all criket game.But how can this or any of these film products be separated from the societal conditions of the country from which they come? World tourists to India return emotionally shaken from witnessing the horrid suppression of human rights there. Eye-witnesses of "untouchables" without decent homes, diseased beings begging in the streets, exploited to near-slavery conditions -- all in full view and awareness of the government, church, and upper class citizenry -- point to a highly divided, confused, and unjust society.Does one just close one's mind to all this, and buy into the fantasy world of "Lagaan"? Are all of these products, in effect, used to distract the peasanty and others from the actual injustices being perpetrated against them? The real-life conditions of the country suggest the need for a massive planetary revolution. Yet, here we are, blithely humming the tunes and savoring the romance of "Lagaan."For me, there's no joy in Bollywood. Not until the last vestiges of discrimination, supression, and domination are eliminated. Until then, "Lagaan" can well keep what it has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-hyped junk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler Just another Hindi movie where the overtly good prevails over the overtly evil , in the most absurd circumstances. Regular Hindi movies feature a hero bashing up 10 hoodlums ( maybe multiplied by another 10 ). This one features 11 non-cricketers ( including physically and mentally handicapped guys ) , who defeat 11 Eglishmen at their own game. Of course , to make things realistic , they DID get trained in the finer skills of the game by an English woman !The story starts off with the English guys being cruel enough to levy some unbelievable taxes on the poor villagers. The they turn sadistic enough to challenge the poor villagers to a game of cricket , and if the villagers win , they get to TRIPLE the taxes. This is the start of absurdities ...leading to more than an hour of badly photographed cricket , and Englishwoman falling in love with one of the villagers who happens to look like a Bollywood star ( Aamir Khan ). Of course , the chocolate-faced Bollywood boy shuns her for the local village girl . This village girl , played by Gracy Singh , is the only breath of fresh air in this gigantic mess of a movie , replete with over-acting , misfit music and a totally predictable cricket match.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A piece of Trash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a garbage of a movie, a disgrace to the Indian Cinema. Let me put it this way a proud Indian would dare produce a filth like this where henpecked, castrated men prowl around helplessly. This is an affront and insult to the brave men who defend the Nation. Surprisingly, these are the type of movies that make it to the Film Festivals. Movies like "Monsoon Wedding", "Deewar", "Dev" and "Teen Deewareen" never see the light of the day. This is because of the corrupt suvvar rats of the Mumbai Media who revel in promoting trash like this. Apart from the music and choreography which is innately Indian and the acting of Gracy Singh who is making her debut there is nothing here that made this movie an Oscar contestant. Aamir khan is a midget makaka monkey for a leading actor--this ugly idiot can't walk and chew at the same time let alone act. This scum lowlife only makes Anti-Indian movies or movies that denigrate, degrade Indians and India. It makes sense since this maggot is not Indian and never will be Indian. This is what happens when we let these banchods from Filthystan to infiltrate and takeover the Illustrious Indian cinema in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the best India has to offer?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am tired of hearing about how this movie is supposed to be the greatest indian movie of all time. Its a very bad American movie that happens to be in Hindi with some badly dubbed songs. It needs a severe case of editing, and a much better sense of pace.Only two groups of people seem to like this movie a lot. The first group is Non-Indians who have never seen an Indian movie before and think of themselves as chic and cultured for liking this one.The other group that loves this movie is the 'Jai Hind' crowd, who are amazed that an Indian movie was actually made with technical competence (Note comments like 'amazing production values' or 'high quality prints') AND seen by non-Indians. They are the same Indians that think that the Sixth Sense is the greatest movie ever made; not because its actually a pretty cool movie (which it definitely is) but because it was directed by an Indian and appreciated by non-Indians.If you want to watch a trully great indian movie watch Pakeezah. You won't find it at Blockbuster, and you might need to dig a little, but it'll be worth it.</fullReview>
