		<shortDescription>The message of truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was assigned to view this movie for class. From what I have learned thus far, this movie is the best representation of the truth about Islam. With all that is going on in the world today and many people's misconceptions about Islam this is a must see for all.Not only is it an educational masterpiece... The Message has a brilliant musical score, beautiful cinematography, a wonderful script, and terrific acting. If your video stores do not carry it, order it from Amazon.com and learn the truth about the origins of the worlds fastest growing religion and what it stands for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>most amazing experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was working and living in Brussels in 1979. Most of my friends were North African, ergo Muslim. When this film came out, we all went to the Bourse Cinema. The film itself was very enlightening, and the fact that Mohammed himself was never 'in the picture' (so to speak) I found contributing to the profoundness of the film. What really struck me was that when in the film religious (holy) verses (like psalms) were sung or played, the whole audience would reverently sing along. Very moving.Of course, it was 25 years ago, and I cannot remember a lot of it, but it was my first encounter with Islam and made a major impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE motion picture about the history of Islam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a muslim, you must see this, if you are interested in Islam, you must see this, and all others should still see this. It's an experience of a lifetime! It shows the true meaning of Islam, its roots, its basic beliefs, and so much more... When I first saw this film, it left me in tears and speechless for quite some time after. When I watch it today, it still does! I don't believe anyone can watch this film and not become moved or even shaken by what he/she sees and hears! If the movie has one shortcoming, it's that the main character, prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him), is never actually seen or heard, as it would have been a deadly sin to have an 'imposter' playing Him in the movie. Although this takes some getting used to and creates some lengths (i.e. dialogs which are rather more monologues with pauses), the rest of the movie compensates in full! Watching this movie will probably not make you go out to become a muslim (although I have read that most of the cast/crew involved did so), but certainly put some thought and understanding into you. One of the must see movies or all time!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film, visuals and acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film. I'm a history major who took several courses in the history of the Middle East and Islam, so nothing is going to be good or accurate or trivia filled enough for me, but it certainly didn't contradict anything I'd learned (for cinematic purposes or otherwise), and that's more than I can say for any historical epic I've seen in several years.This film starts with Muhammed receiving the Koran from the angel Gabriel and ends at his death. It was filmed in accordance with Islamic political correctness, so The Prophet himself is never depicted, visually or vocally. While this is well affected, it unfortunately removes him from a lot of the story. I would like to have known a lot more about his life from the film, not his mannerisms or speech as depicted by a particular actor, but at least the major events of his life, his children, his wives, and so on.Having said that, however, the film is still a very good depiction of the birth of Islam. The plot focuses on the historical events rather than the Koran itself, which contains almost no history from its own period, and is therefore different from a lot of Biblical epics which present the historical events IN the Bible. It's accurate in that it tries to present the birth of Islam as most people today probably learn it. Definitely not a propaganda piece, but it's not a movie filled with facts, truth or fiction, more a movie of character and tone. It's more similar to Braveheart than it is to Ben Hur or the Gospel of John. The movie presents a decent snapshot of the times and the attitudes and lifestyles under which Islam developed.The acting is fantastic, the music is good (won an academy award), and the cinematography, filmed in Morocco and Libya, is beautiful. Costumes are cool, and there's a few scenes with a set of ancient bagpipes for you Celtic history buffs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anthony Quinn is no doubt one of the greatest actors of the 20th century...The strange thing is that he fits to the muslim roles with such a perfection that, with his contribution "The Message" and "The Lion of the Dessert" both have been masterpieces which are still watched by many people. Though the theme of this movie is the birth of Islam, I think it should have a variety of audience from many religions and cultures. I think the things that are emphasized, the struggle for the cause you believe, the sacrifices you have made for the beloved, are all universal values that have been emphasized with a rather outstanding casting and directing...I think everyone should watch this movie no matter what his/her religion, thought, culture is...

		<fullReview>I don't think this movie has been shown in the United States for about twenty years, it was shown in theaters, then on the limited cable systems of the time, and then poof, haven't heard much about it. I'd be curious if it is continued to be played in other parts of the world. As I recall, it was difficult to follow, though Quinn is almost always entertaining to watch. It seemed a minor epic, though taking on a tough topic. The sad part about this movie is that some Islamic extremists engaged in some terror attacks in protest of the film -- protesting that one should never show the likeness of Mohammed, Islam's tenets deeming it blasphemous. They never bothered to find out that the film didn't show him at all.</fullReview>

The film is not about offence but about defence and ends with peaceful armed less walk into the city of Mecca after many years of suffering.This film explains how the Prophet Mohammed start his message with a few men and eventually gaining thousands and as you can see today millions. The film talks about the establishment the spread of Gods message and the story of the men who had to give away there lives for the sake of Gods words including the sacrifices that are made is the death of Hamza (Anthony Quinn).</fullReview>

With todays views on Islam being bad due to extremists who are doing sin against Islam yet claim to be Muslims, this movie honestly tells the truth, it is a must watch to get a real view on the religion and not the view that the media has which is wrong. After watching this movie i seriously considered converting to Islam and so did further research into the religion and now i am pleased to say i am a Muslim, i advise this film to anyone and everyone. The acting , music, directing is all a masterpiece. It was a risky movie considering they didn't show the prophets face neither his voice yet the film was based on him, and yet they managed to make such a brilliant film. From what i heard this movie was banned and no longer shown due to its powerful influence on people and converting them to Islam, although i have no proof on this but it is what i heard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faith and Film on IMDb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a critic, The Message poses a challenge. The story of Muhammad is the crux of the Muslim faith. The Message naturally demands a more serious approach than your biweekly romcom. This film necessitated a pause so I could reflect on the purpose of criticism. I admit, I almost submitted this review with a higher rating in an act of pandering. That would have been a popular move, but disingenuous. After all this more than a hobby, it is my immortal soul at stake. So for those already infuriated, please bear with me.Originally, I watched The Message to answer one question: Why is this movie in the IMDb Top 250? I had never heard of this movie before, and I would likely not have ever seen it if it had not cracked this questionably prestigious list. Some IMDb users have grown increasingly frustrated by movies not in classical canon receiving such an honor. These non-USA made, low vote count films, often receive strong vitriol in user reviews and message boards. My best summary of this contempt is these films lack objective quality, rather, they appeal strongly to a subset of the community and do not deserve a general recommendation. I think the voter statistics suggest that not only is The Message an example of this phenomenon, it is the prime example. Bollywood movies were previously the go to offenders. These films garnered on average approximately 40% 10/10 votes. Superhero movies, consistently overrated and raised by a large sub-community, garner a similar percentage considering their slightly elevated position. Shawshank Redemption currently reigns supreme, and only convinces 53% of the populous it is perfect. 60% of users rated The Message 10/10. Compare this anomaly to Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, which currently ranks one spot bellow The Message, has only 18%. Admittedly, IMDb uses black magic to come up with the top 250. Even so, The Message dominates true rivals like films in the Top 30 which only score 10/10 percentages around 30%. Excuse the excessive use of numbers. I want some outside verification when I say The Message speaks very strongly to some and less so to others. This is not a suggestion that the people who voted 10/10 are wrong or should be discredited.Unfortunately, I believe this opinion gap is primarily based on source material. This marginalizes the debate over more subjective intricacies. As a non-Muslim, this film failed to engage me spiritually. I can appreciate the perspective and education the film provides, but it obviously did not affirm my faith. Beyond that, the quality of filmmaking leaves me hard pressed to suggest The Message over other epics. The subject works effectively as a narrative. Acting and cinematography were solid, similar to Hollywood flicks of decades past. The most differentiating characteristics were how The Message dodged sacrilege. As entertainment, The Message is simply too long. There were many scenes that seemed unwarranted which makes one feel every minute of the three hour run time. I am sure there is a scholarly reason for every line, but, as an outsider, I am taxed. The challenge of not depicting the central character is also met inconsistently. In some scenes, the presence of Muhammad is tangible, his direct manifestation is not necessary. These moments do not feel like a director struggling with an inconvenience, rather mastering this obstruction for effect. Sadly, just as many scenes are clumsy. I simply cannot believe The Message is engaging enough independent of religious context to support such a devoted following.Despite my lukewarm critical response, I am overjoyed that this film exists. The Message provides a perspective that is consistently marginalized in contemporary society. And if this outlook is delivered in the form of an entertaining epic, who am I to complain? More importantly, I am glad others have enjoyed such a strong reaction to this film. Many have shared their own personal account of watching The Message. It seems clear that a movie is providing a spiritual experience for thousands. No, I did not personally share these feelings, but I can relate. For me, it was Andri Rubilev. Simply as a lover of film, I am happy knowing people I have never met are experiencing a film in a way they might not have ever thought possible. The Message is an achievement because it is rare movie that demonstrates film's overwhelming potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can only hope that this, and its actual message, is not hated in the shadow of today's terrorism. I knew the story going in, and would say that this is a quite accurate depiction of the events. It is a perfect choice to not depict the prophet. This film is incredibly well-done. The plot is well-written. This has stunning imagery, and breathtaking scenery. The acting consists only of top-notch performances. Characters are credible and interesting. The dialog is immensely well-done. This presents and communicates its points rather well. The score is marvelously composed, epic, sweeping, and in the style of Middle Eastern music. This has great cinematography and editing. The war scenes are well-done. This entire production is very effective. The pacing is good. Coming in at not much short of three full hours, it doesn't overstay its welcome, or dwell unnecessarily. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer and a 44-minute making of featurette. There is no language, sexuality goes no further than a few costumes, and the violence is neither strong nor gratuitous. This has disturbing content, and should not be viewed by children or others who may not be able to handle it. I recommend this to everyone else. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first step in the understanding of Islam ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Being Muslim myself who lived in the West I felt that it was my obligation, my duty, to tell the truth about Islam. It is a religion that has a 700-million following, yet it's so little known about it, which surprised me. I thought I should tell the story that will bring this bridge, this gap to the West." ? Moustapha Akkad, director of "The Message"And for this visionary effort, I respectfully applaud the late Syrian director who made the inspiring drama and haunting epic celebrating the birth of Islam, a faith that has reached today the billion of followers. So little is yet known about it and what is known doesn't prevent it from certainly being the most misrepresented, misunderstood and openly disregarded of all the religions. Still, Akkad's initial intention didn't fail, nor had "The Message" lost its cultural significance. the noble purpose of the film was simply diluted in a mass of events and uncontrolled sociocultural representations that contributed to erode the image of Islam within the average Occidental eye. Ultimately, for one film trying to depict the positive values for which Islam stood, the scarf, suicide bombers, hijackers, the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the Great Djihad or the Prophet-drawing controversy contributed to a whole negative mythology damaging the image of Islam. Indeed, the Green Scare still prevails and it's even sadder that Akkad, himself, was killed, along with his daughter, in a terrorist attack in Jordan in 2005. But this tragic irony of fate should also give the benefit of doubt toward Islam when it's the most faithful and respectable followers that are killed by minorities pretending to be of their own. The first victims of terrorism in the Islamic world are Muslims indeed; sadly, the media are so prejudiced that they're most likely to associate Islam with a fatalistic image of violence and intolerance, while its Universalist message was specifically delivered to stand against the very injustices on which it is blamed by the detractors. The film opens in the Mecca of the sixth century, where people from different regions of the Arabic peninsula came to pagan pilgrimages. At that time, like the Merchants who were banished from the Temple by Jesus, some rich exploiters made a real business out of a religious obedience counting no less than 300 idols, all represented in statues and totem-like figures. Slavery naturally existed, so did such infamous 'traditions' as baby girls' burials. But the days of these barbarian practices were numbered and rumor had it that Muhammad met the Ange Gabriel and received a Revelation. Muhammad was an illiterate shepherd in his forties but the Miracle happened when he was capable to read the Divine Message. Islam's founding event was the miracle of Muhammad's reading, which says enough about the importance of knowledge as a virtue more valuable than any skills at fighting.Muhammad and the first ranks of martyrs standing behind him would become a threat to the Order. The film illustrates from the contrast between Meccan practices and Muslims, the true nature of Islam: tolerance, justice and total equality. One of the most symbolical and powerful moments come when Bilal, the Ethiopian slave, refuses to slaughter a man who was stating that everyone was equal in Islam, which earned him a worse punishment. Bilal would ultimately become the first muezzin of Islam's history, the voice that reassembles Muslims to the mosque for the prayers, and it's still a man's voice that continues to unite Muslims in all over the world. There is this constant idea of the world as a whole, of men and women as one people submitted to one God, as the first pillar of Islam is the testimony of faith, that there is no god but God (Allah) and Muhammad is his apostle.And speaking of Muhammad, I have to be honest, it's very difficult for me to review "The Message" as the film speaks for something deeply rooted in my soul: a vague notion some would describe as 'faith'. Faith is never blind in my opinion but it does possess blinding effects. At the end, it's impossible for me not to feel directly concerned by 'The Message", as a Muslim, and I'm not blind because I don't want to see what could be seen as flaws but because I see what can be seen as flaws but I know that there are not, and that the film handles bravely and tactfully a very difficult subject. And naturally, the first element that would immediately divide opinions is the representation of the Prophet Muhammad.It's one of these strange ironies that one of the most influential and important personalities of Humanity's history is the least represented human figure. But that's the very basis of Islam, there's no Icon because "The Message" came specifically to fight the pagan obscurantism, nothing can be sacred, not even a human since there is no god but God, there's no God-like figure, even the Divinity of the Christ, the Trinity, is not recognized. The physical absence of the most preeminent character can confuse some viewers, but this is the way Islamic civilization acknowledged the holiness of Muhammad without materializing, that would have fatally made him an icon. This is why Muhammad is spoken about but never seen, but his aura is powerfully indicated by all the other performances, notably the late Anthony Quinn who plays Hamza, the prophet's uncle. Many other epics would be made about Islam, but "The Message" remains the milestone, the first to tackle the difficulty of representing the prophet and its resonance in the Islamic world is indubitable. Till now, Maurice Jarre's score, rightfully Oscar-nominated, is used in many religious programs and is widely associated with Islam, as if it was capable to translate into notes, this very aura Muslims tend to embrace without totally touching it. No one is perfect after all, only God is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Islam starts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moustapha Akkad's movie "The Message" (alternately called "Mohammad, Messenger of God") tells the story of the founding of Islam. In compliance with Islamic tradition, Mohammed himself is not depicted, since the religion forbids depictions of him. So, the movie focuses mainly on Mohammed's uncle Hamza ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib (Anthony Quinn). Most of the movie is very energizing, despite a few slow scenes. Without a doubt, Mohammed (just like Jesus) was basically a revolutionary, showing how the people in control of Mecca were oppressing the majority of the population. And so, he founded a religion that is now the faith of about one fifth of the world population. One can argue that there was nothing bad about having multiple gods as Mecca did before Mohammed founded Islam, but Mohammed and his followers certainly believed in what they were doing, and the movie makes a very good point of that. Also starring Irene Papas, Michael Ansara (Barbara Eden's former husband), Johnny Sekka and Michael Forest.Akkad (who was best known as the producer of the "Halloween" franchise) later cast Quinn and Papas in "Lion of the Desert", about Libyan national hero Omar Mukhtar, who fought against the Italian occupation. Akkad got killed in a terrorist attack in Jordan in 2005.</fullReview>

The king Hassan of Morocco, Al Gaddafi of Libya and King Khalid bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia financially supported the full production of this film. with the full support from the Libyan and Moroccan Govt the production team finally came to an end.

They all gave very good and solid performances, which really got me emotionally involved in the story. And that's where the strength of this picture truly lays."The Message" has that rare quality of really making the audience intrigued and captivated with the story, there is not a single dull moment due to the combined factors mentioned above.Additionally, viewing the film and doing research on Islam prior or after viewing "The Message", will hopefully clear up misconceptions a lot of people have.I highly recommend this film, watch it :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot SummaryThis amazing historical epic is concerned with depicting the birth of the Islamic faith and also the story of its Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). This film not only depicts the life of the Islamic Prophet with accuracy but also respects the Islamic principle and belief that the Prophet Muhammad should not be depicted through any form of imagery or through an actor, instead the film uses the view of a camera and background music to depict his actions and presence within each scene. In general, the film portrays the Prophet's visit by the angel Gabriel, who brings him revelation to spread the message of monotheism and to remove the 300 idols within the Kaaba, speak out against social and political corruption, and to also stand against those leaders of Mecca who are causing all of the corruption.World Religion This movie falls in almost perfect synchronization when it comes to the related material we will eventually learn in the World Religion's textbook on the topic of Islam that can be found in the twelfth chapter. Within the movie, the story of the prophet's family life, social life, and political/military life is portrayed in great detail. With his family life, his story is told by a sahaba (companion) as to what he experienced up in the cave. One of the characters spoke to the prophet's uncle as to what happened up in the mountain when the angel Gabriel visited Muhammad, How the angel commanded him to "read in the name of his Lord who created man from a clot of blood", how scared Mohammed was of the situation, how he went to his wife and best companion Khadijah, and how she attempted to comfort him through good facts of his character (truthfulness, trustworthiness, etc.). The companion explained most of the story within the film because the prophet's image and also the image of Khadijah could not be portrayed. All of these statements and facts portrayed by the film coincide directly to the descriptions of Muhammad made through multiple historical documents and also within the book (Pg.462; Muhammad and the Revelations, Khadija; pg. 463).The film also portrays in great detail the death of the Prophets uncle, the harassment he suffered while he attempted to preach his faith (being pelted with stones in one scene), and great portrayals of major battles in which Muhammad partook in. The film also displays the nature in which the Muslims were commanded by God to preach to the common public. In that scene, the Muslims formed rows and locked arms while saying the Shahadah, "There is no God but God and Muhammad is his messenger." Overall, this film is relative to the topics discussed within World Religions because it gives a visual portrayal of how Islam formed, its significance in history, the tribulations that the Prophet and his followers underwent, and how the message was received to the Prophet and how it was spread. All of the events that were portrayed in the film accurately portray the scenarios known to historians and philosophers and most importantly educates the audience of the stories and teachings that came along with Islam.</fullReview>

It is the best movie for anyone who is interested to know about this story from an unbiased source.Hope you enjoy it.Peace be upon you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had watched very few film on Islam but it was best among few. Mustafa and Anthony did brilliant work. Best thing about The Message is, it teach message of Islam with all modesty and respect. After watching this movie i become fan of Anthony Quin, he played his role very well. Considering the release time of movie, war scene and KAABA depiction is superb. Even though i am disappoint because there was no role of Hazrat Ali which is one the biggest character in Islamic history. Expansion of Islam was immediate after initial hurdle and it was helped by Allah. Islam is the need of time and it need more exploration in cinema which easier medium to connect masses right now.Thanks Mustafa for making such a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movies shows true Islam and not the Islam media and politics show to the world. Watch the movie then you will no true Islam. True Islam teaches about peace, mercy, compassion, love for others. It teaches that it is not allowed to convert people unwillingly. It teaches that racism is forbidden. It teaches that everyone is equal to one another. That women is equal to men. It teaches that becoming rich while you see others suffering is not allowed. It teaches to share. It teaches that you can defend yourself by war, but fight only those who harm you and not innocent people. It teaches that whosoever kills an innocent human being, it shall be as if he has killed all mankind, and whosoever saves the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind. If you want to understand Islam better you need to learn Arabic and need to learn Arabic poetry, because the Quran is written in Arabic poetry and you can never translate it properly if you do not understand the Arabic poetry.</fullReview>

This movie shows the real facts that has been said in His pbuh most perfect biography. However this is only about 0,01% of his pbuh biography and this movie or 100 movies like this can not tell us all about the greatness of prophet pbuh.I would really recommend this movie to those who don't know anything about Islam or knows a little bit. This movie really shows people how Islam got started and empowered itself by the will of God.This movie really shows why a man that was one of the most respected and one of the most trusted and one of the most beloved among the people of Mecca would start acting and saying things that turns almost everyone against him. But finally with the will of God he pbuh not only became the leader of Mecca but the leader of 1.7 billion people around the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great! Better than many Christian films of similar theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, please note this is mostly a review for the English version of the film, because, ladies and gentleman, the maker of this movies shot this film twice, once with Arabic actors and once with English speaking actors. That is the kind of dedication that was put into this project. From the start of the film there is a note that Al-Azhar University approves the historical value of the movie. People took this job seriously and it shows in the final product.I expected the film to be in Arabic with English subtitles and was disappointed to see a large amount of exceedingly white "Arabs" in the main role. But that did not detract from the quality of the film or its message. The English speaking actors are not well known, but all give good performances.There is a certain Greek actress, Irene Papas, who plays the wife of one of the tribe leaders and she is something fierce. She has a beautiful wrathful gaze and with those acting skills and face her name should really be bigger in the West.I eventually briefly viewed the Arabic version of the film and it looks of equal quality. The acting is different but still good.Because the makers were not allowed to show Mohammed, the prophet, it gives the movie a unique angle but also a unique awkwardness. The first time the story introduced the presence of Mohammed it was confusing. You stare and wonder what is going on until you realise that, oh OK, these people were just reacting to his presence.People speaking to Mohammed are often speaking to the cameraman, and thus to the viewer. Mohammed does not speak, even though people speak to him. So it feels like you are the silent protagonist in an adventure game. You must agree, it is a bit odd to have a main character who does not appear in his own movie even once. I mean it is pretty cool that these guys think that I am Mohammed, but I would prefer not to get dragged into the whole birth of Islam thing if you do not mind.Please note that this film cannot avoid being a religion pusher, just like any Jesus film would be, but of course any viewer already knows that going in, and if you can make peace with that idea, what awaits you is a pretty epic movie, with clashes of character, faith and sword. It is a very coherent, well shot movie, rival to the best of Christian epics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anyone has a claim to the epic laurels of David Lean, it is Mustafa Akkad. Between his epics "The Message", "The Lion in the Desert" and the sadly unproduced &#x1e62;al&#x101;&#x1e25; ad-D&#x12b;n biopic, this filmmaker did for Islam and Libyan freedom fighter Omar Mukthar what Lean did for T.E. Lawrence: bring them to the global audience in a lush, compelling and vibrant way unequaled since.Both his finished epics star Anthony Quinn, a veritable fountain of charisma, in many ways revisiting his Auda Abu Taid role from Lawrence of Arabia with added maturity and nobility. The tech credits are astounding, particularly for a non-Hollywood film of this period. And the film's main appeal to a Western audience will likely be the exploration of the tyranny of confusion of early Christianity (doing to the first Muslims what the Romans did to the first Christians) and the evolution of this new religion.While "The Message" is laudable in its handling of a precarious balancing act: telling the story of a hero it can not show, for religious reasons, this works to the film's detriment. While you can squirm at the depiction of Jesus Christ in various films about that particular prophet, at least it gives you something to hold on to as an audience. Akkad's film's delicate reverence still proves too much, and while only hearing of the Prophet creates a powerful sense of mystery in the first act, it slowly wears on you. Religious dogma or no, we want to see him, and we never do.This is where "The Message" loses the epic duel with "Lawrence": the sweep is there, the visuals are lush, and Maurice Jarre's score is adequately stirring, but the human element is missing.And for all that, any film where Anthony Quinn charges through sand with a sword deserves to be treasured.</fullReview>

Muhammad (sav) is sacred for us and no one should visualize him, all Muslims are very sensitive about this case. to sum up i would like to thanks all people who work for this masterpiece.

		<shortDescription>An introduction to Islam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This life story of prophet Mohammed is strictly halal - a retelling of the beginning of Islam true to the essence and devoid of popular misconceptions about the religion. This naturally caused a significant filming problem as depiction of Mohammed is haram (forbidden), so director Moustapha Akkad had to devise a way of shooting a movie about the prophet without ever showing him or even supplying him a voice. This actually initiated a popular uprise amongst Muslims, when the movie was first received, as they were fed by the wrongful assumption that Anthony Quinn is indeed portraying Islam's holiest man. In fact however the closest we ever come to seeing Mohammed is a shot of his famous blade Zulfiqar (in some traditions a gift from the Archangel Gabriel), his wooden staff or a first-perspective camera as we look through his eyes.The story itself is told by secondary figures (as depicting Mohammed's immediate family is also not allowed) like the prophet's uncle Hamza (Anthony Quinn) or adopted son Zaid (Damien Thomas). Other characters featured are the freed slave and first Muezzin Bilal (Johnny Sekka) as well as his first enemies: Hind (Irene Papas), Abu Sofyan (Michael Ansara). Apart from the origins of the religion, its similarity to Old Testament teachings of discarding false pagan idols, kinship to Christianity and Judaism (extremely well depicted when Muslim refugees seek audience with the Christian Emperor of Abyssinia), the movie also indulges into epic warfare with two key battles fought during the emergence of the Islam: the Battle of Badr and the Battle of Uhud (argually the weakest spot in the movie as lacking tension and poorly choreographed). There obviously is a significant problem with the main protagonist of the story hidden from sight and his messages relayed by third persons, as it causes lack of character identification and little involvement into events portrayed apart from a historical and educational standpoint.As pure contextualisation of Islam "The Message" stands the test of time, at times struggling within the confines of non-presenting the prophet and carrying a mixed bag of performances, but otherwise steadfastly placed within the facts and religion. Somewhat whitewashed, albeit not as much as some detractors would claim, it carries the strong humanist ideal behind Islam, focusing on points which ring self-evidently morally correct in modern time (mainly regarding slavery, equal rights or women emancipation). That does of course bring to the forefront questions whether Islam has been so misrepresented by religious scholars or subverted by tradition, that especially women's rights as nowhere near the place it is presented in the movie.A strong kinship exists between this movie and those epics dealing with the birth of Christianity, such as "Quo Vadis", "Ben Hur" or "The Ten Commandments". Not only regarding the subject, but a predominant Hollywood model of portraying such religious events. As such faith conversion is never deeply analysed, but treated as a given (obvious superiority of the new faith over idolatry). With such framing right and wrong is obviously divided between religious lines, although a certain grey area does exist and 'villians' are always offered a chance at redemption. Essentially glorified iconography not much can be derived from it as commentary, most heartfelt reactions are brought about by messages inherent to the given religion. Nonetheless an excellently shot movie gifted with a strong budget (apparently given by the late Muammar Gaddafi), nicely pulled in together by a gifted helmer.Proves that big-budget features can be made in Arab countries. I for one wish for some big financiers to throw together their diamond rings, Maybach's and gold-platted villas to fund a movie portraying the Arab point of view on the Crusades...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a correction to some bad ideas about Islam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have watched this movie more than one time ,i really like it,it reveals a very good picture of Islam but to know the whole truth ,a more than one movie must be produced because the whole life of prophet Muhammad can't be made in only 3 hours!! As a Muslim i am jealous about my religion and i can't accept a single bad word about it.God ordered us to argue with the people of Book(Christians and Jews)with logic and good advice.Islam never considered Christians and Jews as a second class people, Islam gave them the religious freedom means they are free to convert to Islam or not,those who don't convert to Islam have to pay the gizya which was small tax compared to the zakah which was paid by Muslims themselves every year,they paid this tax in order to be protected by the Islamic army because they will not join an army to defend a religion which is not theirs!!,unless they really want to join the Islamic army ,that will be their choice.Even prophet Muhammad told his army when they enter any city : not to kill a woman ,a child , an old man,never to destroy any church, leave the people of this city free to have their own religion.Even when the Islamic army entered Egypt and Jerusalem or any other country, they treated the priests there with a very honorable treatment, never force them to convert into Islam.Islam considered all the people whether Muslim,Christian or Jews at the same level they are all equal in rights and duties. when Muhammad entered Al-Medina (which means the city in Arabic),he found there the Jews ,he made treaty with them:to free in their religion and to protect the city together against any enemy ,he didn't make them stand as one line and chop their heads that is not correct.and at last for the rights of both men and women,yes they have the same rights as in education,being equal in duties and rights ,both can Inherit (as before Muhammad woman can't inherit and was considered a bad omen) But Islam gave the woman her dignity and all her rights.but also Islam considered the man as the breadwinner of the family so he takes a higher share than the woman in heritage, but also he is responsible for serving her and get here all her needs ,Islam also put the steps to make the husband and his wife living a very lovely life together.i hope i have corrected all your incorrect ideas about Islam and please if u r interested in Islam read more about and have a good understanding of Koran verses not only take a piece of it and say that is the Islam,understand the whole verse please and if u want a good beginning i recommend this: HTTP://www.inspiredbymuhammed.com/ please feel comfortable to contact me for any about Islam and i shall do my best to help u Al Salam Alikom (peace be upon u)</fullReview>

I loved the sound so much that I used it on a recording I played on in 1975 in London called Cloud 99 (Soleado). it went to number 14 in the U.K. and was performed on BBC "Top of the Pops" in later that year.

The acting was so real and the plot was interesting.This movie sums up the Islamic beliefs and life of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) in a detailed way. For those who want to know more to the origin of Islam, this is a very interesting and entertaining way to do so. All the facts in the story are written in the books, so no scenes were added to the original events.Maybe some might feel that not showing the face of the prophet or some other characters was a disadvantage, but I do not think it lowered the quality of this movie.For another great movie by Quinn, watch "Lion of the Desert".

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies, i never have enough watching it. each time is like seeing it for the first time. the Arabic version of it is just as excellent with a all Arab actors. the director did an excellent job to have the same events depicted in both versions, without settling for dubbing one version. Antony Q. really shines the same way Abdulla Gaith does in the Arabic version. Al Aqad is definitely an excellent example of using art as a way of telling people about the greatness of Islam---bringing people of different races and cultures and tribes to unite and yet be different. I especially love the part when the prophet's uncle Hamza (played by Antony Q.) comes to Mecca and directly goes to defend the prophet and his companions who try to defend him against those assaulting them. He then slaps one of the leaders daring him to hit him back, then addressing his nephew, he announces his faith in the new message and confessing that whenever he crosses the desert at night he feels the creator is too grand to be kept in the tiny building where the tribe kept their deity. The other favorite is when Khalid bin Al Walid fights the war against the Muslims and then converts before the Prophet (pbuh). I hope everyone who watches the movie would be able to see the genius of the director and the story by comparing it to the movies that were around during the same time. Do not let the fact that it is about Islam of Muslims blind you to the fact that it is about a great leader of people and the people who believed in his message that he was chosen to deliver, and he did despite all challenges. Try to think from a historical point of view, do not allow the current events taking place prevent you from having a more open view to look at things. The area is not the map. Try looking at the whole map to have a better understanding. the view differs when you're standing in a ditch, hill, mountain, flying. always try to find the bigger picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinematically, it was pretty good. Clearly a lot of work went into the sets, costumes &amp; locations. While the acting was adequate, I have to disagree with other reviews in that I did not think it was Anthony Quinn's greatest work. Maybe because I viewed it through the lens of Christianity or maybe it was the way the actors talked to the camera when addressing Mohammed (i.e., it is against Islam to show the likeness of Mohammed - sort of a parallel to Jews never wring the word God - they spell it G-d), the movie had an odd "vibe" about it. The story itself is difficult to follow, much like the Koran itself. Though downplayed in the movie, early messages from God conflicted with later messages. It also plays up the 'peaceful' side of Islam, (but there again the movie has some fantastic battle scenes, if you overlook the overly fake looking blood) which stands in stark contrast to the evidence we see on the nightly news. Ideally, every Muslim would embrace the teachings of this movie and renounce the more radical teachings - not just the modern day "terrorist" mindset, but the way the early Muslims treated women in the early years seems to be quite different than today. I can't think of a Christian equivalent of this movie, as most movies about early Christianity only tell a small portion of the story. This movie attempts to explain the roots of Islam from when Mohammed began hearing from God at age 40, in about 610 AD to the full establishment of Islam around the world. It does to a reasonably good job for the early parts of Islam, but I kind of got lost in all the who's fighting who scenes. It was apparently all historically verified at the time of its making by Islamic scholars,which is explained at the beginning and end of the movie, which only adds to the eerie feeling the movie being less documentary and more propagandist. So, in short, the cinematic presentation is quite good, but the story is hard to follow and I felt it had a propagandist "vibe" throughout the movie. If you have 3 hours to kill and are interested in the subject matter, you'll likely enjoy it. For me I got restless in the middle when I started to get confused about who is battling who and for what reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent film, clearly meticulously adhering to the historical details. Unfortunately I think it is badly let down because of the omission of most of the absolute key people in the story of early Islam.There's no Umar, no Abu Bakr, no Ali, none of the Prophet's wives, no Fatima. To explain to a Christian, that's like telling the story of Jesus while omitting Mary, Peter, Mary Magdelane, Andrew and arguably most of the other Apostles as well.I understand as a Muslim why the Prophet himself should not be portrayed, but in my mind I don't think Islamic monotheism would be at risk if some of the more important companions had been portrayed. How was the decision reached that it was OK to portray Hamza and Zayd for instance, but not Umar? That's just odd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie par excellence. The direction is superb. The characterization of roles is remarkable. The whole film, its cinematography and portrayal of various revered Muslim personalities corresponding to earliest era of Islam has been depicted with caution and in compatibility with its established history and legacy.The battle scenes present authentic show of conflicts arising as a result of resistance to the new faith. Anthony Quin has rendered complete magnitude and resonance to the anchor role of the person of Hamza, the uncle of Prophet Muhammed (PBUH). Whereas, the persona of Prophet Muhammed has been appropriately avoided from on screen appearance lest the feelings of his adherents may not hurt. Although, his holy presence is effected by a sublime and inspirational music reminiscent of spiritual effervescence during certain scenes.It is by far the best film representation describing the interaction of various forces and events taking place during the birth of one of the greatest traditions in the history of faith and creed.</fullReview>

I was impressed by the battle scenes looked very realistic and also liked the way the Director filmed the parts of the Prophet i.e. not upsetting anyone. Anthony Quinn was brilliant as Hamza, you start missing his character after he is martyred on the battlefield. If you like this movie which i am sure you will Watch Akkad's other work Lion Of the Desert which once again stars Mr Quinn also very impressive. Watch this movie if you haven't already!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately there aren't that many movies that tell the story of the greatest man who lived. The Message gives the viewer a glimpse of the life of the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his struggle to deliver God's message to the pagan Arabs of Mecca and his migration to Medina. The movie tells a story that most non-Muslims never heard before, that alone makes it a must see for non-Muslims. The production value is not the greatest out there but if you know the politics behind the movie...well, that's a different angle that I don't want to comment on! I you never heard the story of Muhammad (PBUH) and the birth of Islam, I guarantee you this movie will be a life changing experience(not instantly of course) that will add something to your soul it never had, Guaranteed!

		<fullReview>Originally I didn't want to see this film, because I generally dislike religious films...and in truth, any film which is too old. It was actually my cousin that had converted to Islam a couple of years ago who recommended for me to watch "The Message", and a few days later, I was watching it with him. As the credits rolled at the end, I was wholly satisfied with the film, a rare occasion. The music was beautiful, the cinematography was spectacular and the acting was very raw, very real. Every actor in the film, even the ones with very small parts, delivered very realistic performances.I would like to say that Anthony Quinn gave one of his best performances in his outstanding career. I would also like to say that Moustapha Akkad will be very missed, a very talented director, as he proved in this film.An extraordinary and breath-taking epic, making a film like Ben-Hur seem boring and bland. It is truly 3 hours well spent.Overall I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film about the Prophet of Islam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no Muslim but I am interested in the story of Islam since it's the final of the monotheistic religions, as the Muslims say: its "seal". This is a seventies epic in the same style of Zefirelli's "Jesus of Nazareth" and "The lion of the desert". All three movies feature a magnificent Anthony Quinn. The movie is very enjoyable and well made. Beautiful shots, great cinematography, good score, great acting. Of course it brings a very short version of the story of Islam, mainly chronicling the most important political and military events but leaving out loads and loads of elements. At 3 hours one cannot expect more. This is why I would have preferred a miniseries double that length, as in "Jesus of Nazareth". That gives time to settle in, to give much more information, teachings, etc. Of course the movie is not as it could have. Islamic creed prohibits the depiction of the Prophet: you never see Muhammad nor do you hear an actor as his voice. That's quite a handicap for the movie. The same goes for the most important people around him. Next to none are depicted in the film: Fatimah, Aisha and in general the whole family of the Prophet, Ali, Abu Bakr, and the other first four caliphs etc. The result of the above is a movie which brings the most important "earthly" sides to the advent of Islam, but lacks a bit in spiritual depth. It also brings the story of Islam without including all its most important pioneers. Though I respect this, I find it a great pity. Nonetheless, even with these limits the movie still deserves 7/10 if alone for the beautiful photography, the acting of Anthony Quinn and the beautiful depictions of Islamic holy sites at the very end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure that there are some people who will refuse to see this movie, no matter what you tell them. Too bad, because this is a pretty interesting film on a subject not that well known in this part of the world. I am sure a lot of western viewers will be surprised by some facts the movie reveals to the audience. For example, it is taught that in Islam, women are equal to men, and that Muslims should have respect to Jews and Christians. Also, the telling of how Arabia was slowly but eventually converted to Islam is a pretty interesting story.The movie is well worth seeing, though it's not perfect. Some flaws are:(1) The character of Mohammad is distant to the audience. Now, I realize they couldn't show or reveal the character on screen in any way. And they try real hard to work around that. But in the end I didn't have that much grasp on this historical figure. Maybe I would have to read the Quran to find out more about him.(2) The battle scenes are not very well directed. Many shots show the hundreds of extras shuffling around, or not acting in a way as fierce as you might expect.(3) The length of the movie - three hours long. The movie does seem to need this length to properly tell the story, but it's kind of exhausting to sit through. I would recommend that if you watch the movie, you divide it in chunks and have a short break between chunks so you won't be worn out.But as I said, the movie is still worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Prophet Muhammed, was truly the messenger of Allah. He was more than a prophet, he was also a: business man, freedom fighter, statesman, diplomat, intellectual(despite being illiterate), judge, a founder of a nation and most of all a revolutionary. Through message of Islam, the Prophet fused the waring arabs tribes into one nation, and as a result ushered in a revolutionary transformation of Arabian society. The Arabs were transferred from the darkness of ignorance,inhumanity, backwardness to the light of freedom, justice, and a higher state of consciousness unprecedented in the history of the arabs. Even though the Prophet lived to see he is work done, his message would transform the world at large through spread of Islam. As a Muslim watching the movie, though this might sound silly, but it fealt like that I was time travelling. I felt I was there in the presence of the Prophet. Though I really enjoyed the movie, there is some things I question. For one if Islam gave greater rights to women long before the west, it should have shown active women among the muslims, not necessarily the wives of the prophet, for it is understandable concerning tradition, but it should have portrayed this for the non-muslim western viewers. The reason being that islam is perceived as misogynistic in the west. Other than that all other teachings of islam were definitely embodied in this film. Hopefully, in this century, the Western media would abandon the distorted image of Islam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A splendid tale... And that's all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning (first 1/3) I was enthusiastic about how I'll learn more about Islam and find out why so many people are under it's impact...And I found out:1. There are the same old virtues preached - behavior and qualities that have ever been, are and will be actual. They always win attention.2. The "new" religion gave though the liberty for one to fight with weapon for his (religion's) values and maintain it viral thus. Otherwise it'd die quickly and without glory. It is tempting to know that you're allowed to kill in the name of... virtues.3. The "new" religion made a promise to the men that they will ever be a supreme race. No matter if they are rich or poor, crippled or in great health... Always above the other half of the humanity. This unites at least 1/2 of the population of an area.4. Education - Mohamed proclaimed it and made it an affordable dream, which obviously the creators of the movie assume as a reality. Although everybody knows that religion/authority blossoms on ignorant masses' back. (and they are too ignorant to see it :))Where were left the following promises:- equality between men and women; - non violence; - equality between nations and religions?In the movie somehow too quickly total opponents were turned into followers.I believe that masses can be rushed into everything, but this movie says that it can and had been done beautifully and nobly :)Finally, the movie turns out to be a simple, tender, precise propaganda. The next one in a row.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately, we are informed that some of the historical movies are misleading and false in terms of presenting the real facts about the stories it tries to tell. Well, this truly masterpiece of Moustapha Akkad is an exception. The whole movie tries to tell and portray the last of the prophets of the Muslims (Muhammad PBUH) as the man he is. And from the lessons that i learned about the prophet, it conforms to what i have watched in the movie. In this aspect, i think all the film makers of any historical movies should have followed the footsteps of this kind of film maker in making a well thorough research before presenting their so-called historical features. This is very important because we know that in every historical event that has happened, it carries with it a generation of people who are touched and affected by it. And it is very important to tell the truth about it since the effects are so much felt by the one who are involved.In terms of the movie itself, in my own personal opinion, it is one of the best movie i have ever watched. It is unique in style since the main character is not even spoken any words or showing any physical gestures. It is indeed an epic of a holy man. The acting, no doubt about how great it is. The talented actors such as Anthony Quinn and Irene Papas really do their jobs well. If you are interested to know a brief biography of this man who are followed by about one-fifth of the people in this world, well look no further than this movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is without doubt one of the finest historical epics of recent times. the epic sweep, acting, and cinematography is reminiscent of david lean. a finely told story of one of the worlds great religions. a shame then then that it has never been seen outside the (mostly) moslem community. the message is a must for anyone who appreciates fine cinema and a basic understanding of islam. it is beyond my comprehension this film has never been shown on television (including movie channels!)islam is so misunderstood by the west. in my opinion one showing of 'the message' can rectify that mistake.</fullReview>

It is legendary story that matches up to Brian Deacon's "Jesus" and Charlton Heston's "The Ten Commandments" It's portrayel of Islam is true and touching, it teaches the morals of peace and honor, while still maintaining it's role as a War epic.

		<fullReview>I have seen both the Arabic version, and the English version. This movie was not dubbed from English to Arabic or from Arabic to English. A movie was created for each language with different cast both movies are very accurate and extremely well executed. The movie depicts Islam in its true form. Islam is about peace, equality, and freedom, war is only a last resort to free Muslims from persecution and oppression. The movie also shows the bond that exists between Islam and other religions. There is a lot more to Islam than what the movie shows but it's a good overall introduction to how Islam started and what it stands for. I highly recommend this movie to Muslims and non-Muslims. Movie buffs will love the movie because of the performance of the actors as well as the scenery; this movie was filmed in Morocco and Libya. You are in for another treat if you watch the director's commentary after the movie, it shows how the movie was made and to what great length Moustapha Akkad went to in order to preserve authenticity, you will also get a brief look at Muslims from around the world.</fullReview>

Editing was also superb bringing out continuity between various events in the film as well as not covering some events in history which would have extended the plot. Actors, especially Irene Papas and Antony Quinn were very good. The development of the plot enhanced the title of the film - Muhammad's messages to various rulers of the world. The battles fought are incidental and are seen purely justified. Muhammad is at first reluctant to fight the Meccans. Muhammad also shows mercy to them after their defeat. The scenery and traditional Arab music very good. Comment at the beginning, middle and end of the film makes it easier for a person who is not familiar with the history understand the events. The events are also in line with historical accounts Prophet Muhammad's life. The pictorial absence of Muhammad does not take away much from the story. This film is a must for anybody!</fullReview>

Both versions Arabic and English are great to watch. I do come in tears in many parts of the films feeling the greatness of early Muslims working with their teeth and nails to raise the message of Islam and make sure it reaches every inch in our globe as it was known then. If you are a Muslim, this movie adds immensely to your faith. If you are a non-muslim, this is a great introduction to Islam and is a significant change from the stereotypes (terrorism) that is constantly associated with Muslims in the western world.The music by Maurice Jar is incredibly moving. I don't see how this movie cannot be at the same caliber as the Ten Commandments and other historical movies. Actually, I'd put it above and beyond these movies, but you know, Muslims and Islamic related media material is still forced into hiding by the strong non-Muslim lobbysts.Go see it over and over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An idea on the Prophet (PBUH) never speaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing we can't deny about a movie with such great cross-cultural potential is that it goes a little beyond entertainment. Its trying to project an idea, value system, principle, ethic...When the Prophet Muhammads (Peace Be Upon Him) message is seen as finding action through his followers, a powerful message is indeed being made about his personality and the overall nature of Islaam. Its true that Muslims have certain ideas about his image and voice being projected and what causes shirk .. BUT the truth of the message is witnessed in the transformation of the people the message touches. Islaam is fundamentally for people and is ultimately about the enlightenment of people.Anybody who understands this messages impact on people wont be able to say that Islaam needs to be transformed to include secular humanistic and democratic principles.The Prophet (PBUH) can't be seen to be the divine message but only be considered as integral to relate the divine message itself. Confusion would be created because the lines can blur so much between the divinity of the message and the divine impact on the Prophet (PBUH). Why would we make fixed assertions about the Prophet (PBUH) when it is the message of the religion that is visibly transformational and dynamic in society around him? The reality of Islams impact on people would then be ignored in favour of a personality cult interpretation of the actual events .. which is false. The movie is truer this way to historical and spiritual truths. He would become a napoleon/lincoln/gandhi for western consumption and this is romantic indulgence.Muslim orthodoxy have drawn very fixed lines which are debatable (yes they are) but there's so much between these lines that are of much more significance.</fullReview>

Plus, with Anthony Quinn, how could it go wrong, right?Well if you have ever seen "Lion of the Desert" you know how wrong it can go. First off, sitting through the three hour propaganda movie is a chore and a half. This is no "Ben-Hur" or "Lawrence of Arabia" as there is nothing here to captivate your interest. Yes, I dug into the film with high expectations, but soon realized the high reviews were given by Islamist with an agenda, rather than Movie Buffs. So, if you're like me, always on the look out for great movies, look else where and save yourself the three hours, also stay away from the "Lion in the Desert" another Anthony Quinn bomb with no depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Labors Under A Handicap Of No Messenger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently when Mohammed founded Islam he never factored in the great use that motion pictures could be made for spreading the faith. The Message is about the early days of Islam, but as a film it labors under the insurmountable handicap of us not seeing the messenger.By all accounts the messenger was one charismatic fellow. He would have to have been to have accomplished what he did. He was not only a great religious teacher, but apparently quite the military strategist. It was by arms as well as faith that Islam triumphed in the Arabian peninsula and was spreading elsewhere when the Prophet died in 632. What we have in The Message is a cast playing to a vacuum. Anthony Quinn, Irene Papas, Michael Ansara and the rest of the players talk to the camera as if Mohammed was like Philip Marlowe in Lady of the Lake, that famous noir film shot in the first person. We never hear Mohammed, we see him on two occasions in long-shot and he's not recognizable. Still even laboring under that handicap, when it opened in 1976 there were still protests.This is by no means a new technique. The figure of Jesus in both The Big Fisherman and Ben-Hur is seen from the rear and is not heard at all. But in those films Jesus was not the central character. In King of Kings and The Greatest Story Ever Told both Jeffrey Hunter and Max Von Sydow read lines from the New Testament as part of the dialog because the messenger is of course an integral part of the story.In fact recently I saw Peter and Paul and I was quite impressed with Anthony Hopkins acting out the sermons recorded in the New Testament of Paul. It was the best part of the film, it couldn't have been made without it.But Islam has the restriction about hearing or seeing a depiction of the Prophet which robs the film of what it needs most, a charismatic player doing the role of Mohammed and reading some of the poetical/lyrical quality of his sayings.The film has a lot of good qualities, but as they used to say in that old MacDonald's commercial: Where's the Beef.</fullReview>

That, said, the film itself is not very good.The acting is iffy,many unimportant scenes (such as the horses riding in the desert at the beginning) are drug out, all of the Muslim characters are portrayed with perfection, and it is unnecessarily long and monotonous. It is good that this movie was made, but claiming it to be an excellent film is inaccurate. I am sorry if this offends anyone.

		<fullReview>I admit that I'm a sucker for long, lingering history-epics and state proudly: I've seen them all (or at least most). And although my interest in religion (never having understood why "The Bible" is considered real, and "Lord of the Rings" isn't), I couldn't allow myself to pass this curiosity of a historic epos.This might be an enjoyable romp for believers, who either know the story already or believe that the story happened as portrayed here, but all others might begin to wonder early on: "Why am I watching a three-hour-plus movie with an imaginary protagonist?" Anthony Quinn does his best to make his performance carry the scenes but there is something restraint in his performance and after a couple of hours of watching Quinn talk either straight to the camera or to what often seems an 'invisible friend', one cannot help but to feel slightly schizophrenic.If would have taken a director with guts, say Martin Scorsese (who would later refresh sanctimonious, one-dimensional bible films with his controversial "The Last Temptation of Christ"), to turn this tepid retelling into a real film. Perhaps in the future, a death-defying crew of producers and directors decide to make a remake of this film, allowing the protagonists to be portrayed, such as is the case in many other films, by an actor. My personal choice for Mohammed would be Daniel Day Lewis.If non-controversial, conformist films about the origin of a creed are your thing, I recommend "The Bible" or "Little Buddha" (which actually might have benefited from a policy that would have stopped Keanu Reeves from being seen or heard on screen). If you enjoy Anthony Quinn in his role as bearded, fez-wearing Arab, why not go for "Lawrence of Arabia" or even "Omar Mukhtar ? Lion of the Desert" (like "The Message" co-produced by slain Libyan president Muhammar Ghadaffi).This movie I can only recommend to the quire to which it's already preaching, and perhaps people who enjoyed watching "The Invisible Man" but found the Chevy Chases voice-over annoying.I'll give it three points: one for the beautiful setting, one for the lovely musical score and, despite acting slightly more restraint than usually, one for Anthony Quinn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie that Describes Islam Religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can read on the news like "Muslim Terrorist Bombed civilians". El-Kaide and some of those terror groups are not Muslim. They are just imitating Muslim people to pollute Islam religion. Islam has never been a "religion of carnage". Watch this good movie and see what Islam is based on. Quran-i Kerim (The Book of Islam) It's text never been changed so far and will never be changed in the future. It's still in original state and will be.Some of users said: Hz Muhammed has 23 Wives. His wives are not really wives. Most of them are destitute people that need help. Hz Mohammad patronages them and gave them a good life. Islamiyet's one of the first orders is: * "Do not fornicate" ( Having sex without marrying someone ) The God says in the Quran-i Kerim: Islam is the last religion and Mohammad is the last prophet. The Books of Religions are all writs of the "Same God". The Books were "Tevrat"(the Old Testament) , "Zebur" , "Incil"(The New Testament) , And last and the most big one "Kur'an-i Kerim" (Quran)Some reviewers are saying: Islam is based on war. So i should ask you, If some people had stolen all of your valuable items and and make your houses a wreck, and come for war, what would you do ? Escape like a chicken ? And again. In Wars to Protect the future of the religion of god, children and women never hurt, closed doors never broken, workers not hurt, trees weren't cut. The only thing is to war with your armed enemies. And even falled enemies don't hurt to kill them completely.Hz Muhammad could make the Makka fall with his very crowded army. But He didn't. He protected "The Caba" which was given by god to the Prophet Ibrahim to make that place worship center to pray for "the One God".In the Islam religion there is no preassure. Some people believe within several minutes, some people believe it within years. But some people are afraid of read the Book of Islam (Which includes all writs of old "One God" Books) A Note: One of Islam's commands says that: you must not preassure people believed in other "The One God" religions to make them Muslim. Becoming a Muslim is a choice given to all people.Final Question: Although everything about Islam Why are some people forcing Islam to show as a "religion of assasinating" Final Note: This Movie's story is completely confirmed by Historians.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moustapha misses mark with Muslim "King of Kings"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Muhammad's following grows even among old enemies, Bu-Sofyan says "Muhammad, there is still doubt in my heart." "If we were to cut off your head it would remove all your doubts," responds Khalid."Khalid," Bilal chastises, "there's no compulsion in religion." Bilal, one of Muhammad's top lieutenants, must not have received Allah's memo. The Koran's verse on "no compulsion in religion" (2:256) was at this point already abrogated by the more recently revealed verse of the sword: "Kill those who join other gods with God wherever ye shall find them" (9:5). Like Khalid's threat, director Moustapha Akkad's religious epic, "The Message," does depict the violent streak of Islam, but uses sugarcoated dialog throughout the film to allow for easier swallowing by Western audiences.Akkad must have grown up watching and loving Biblical epics, and wanted to bring the same Hollywood grandeur to the life of Muhammad. For example, Akkad portrays the early Muslims like the Christian martyrs of Nero's Rome in "Quo Vadis." Like Palm Sunday scenes from "Jesus of Nazareth" or "The Greatest Story Ever Told," Muhammad's arrival in Medina is marked by palm-waving locals (just swap out the donkey for a white camel). Anthony Quinn's Hamza character mimics John the Baptist, and Damien Thomas's Zaid is Muhammad's St. Peter. Irene Papas and Michael Ansara serve as the blood-thirsty Herod &amp; Salome of Mecca. And Richard Johnson, the narrator from "Moses the Lawgiver," serves as, you guessed it, narrator of "The Message." However, gospel parallels end there. Muhammad's ministry ends--not with salvation on a cross--but with a massive armed attack against his political foes, including a beheading spree. This bloody twist is fitting for a religion borne out of combat and a film directed by the future producer of "Halloween." (Another notable similarity: in "Halloween" we don't see the actual face of Michael Myers who, like Muhammad, is periodically played by the camera!) Sadly, Akkad whitewashes other uncomfortable aspects of Islam: Muhammad's followers in "The Message" proclaim repeatedly to astonished Arabs that women are equal to men, whereas the Koran itself actually ascribes to women lesser rights of inheritance (4:12), lesser innate worth (2:228) and permits wife-beating (4:38). Equally exaggerated is Islam's compatibility with Christianity: the movie's Christian king of Abyssinia tells Muhammad's representatives that the Muslim and Christian are separated by no more than a line on the ground. The scriptwriters thus sidestep the denial of Christ's divinity by Muhammad, the instructions of the Koran to "take not Jews or Christians as friends" (5:56), and that "Jesus is no more than a servant" (43:57).If you want a more honest assessment of the origins of Islam, try the documentary, "Islam: What the West Needs to Know." For Anthony Quinn fans, check out "Lust for Life." If you want a religious biopic, watch "The Ten Commandments." For a great desert epic, see "Lawrence of Arabia." But leave this snow-job on the shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I appreciate the effort, but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I am writing this review, this film has an IMDb rating of 8.4, which is fairly impressive. However, don't let the rave reviews fool you as they fooled me.I think one main reason why this film gets as many kudos as it does is the fact that it's makers took a HUGE risk --- they made a movie about the life of the Prophet Mohammed, who is generally not depicted in mainstream Islam. Well, really, this movie did not really change that last point. Mohammed himself is not seen or heard in the film to prevent offending Muslim sensibilities. The idea is that depicting Mohammed will lead to idolatry, which, of course, is supposed to be evil. Instead, it is told from the perspective of his uncle Hamza. Also in keeping with Islamic custom, none of Mohammed's close companions (such as Abu Bakr) or immediate family members (such as his wives or his daughter Fatima) are depicted. In fact, these people are either not mentioned in the movie or barely mentioned at all. The absence of Mohammed and company makes this film quite difficult to swallow. Imagine making a movie about Jesus... without Jesus himself. Furthermore, there are no disciples, no Virgin Mary or Joseph, and no Mary Magdalene. Would it be a very effective film? I highly doubt it. Furthermore, not depicting the Prophet only makes him seem more divine and actually promotes idolatry! Mohammed's invisible, ghostly presence, complete with spooky music whenever he enters the scene, only makes him seem more god-like. Compare "The Message" to "Ben Hur," for instance. In Ben Hur, Jesus' face is observed and his voice is not heard (as far as I remember). However, this is done to make Jesus look MORE, not less, divine. "The Message" is very pro-Muslim, which itself is not a bad thing. After all, couldn't most Jesus films be described as pro-Christian? However, the script presents the merits of the Islamic faith in such a cheesy, clumsy way that it's hard to take seriously. The screen writers of this film probably used every clichéd catch-phrase about how wonderful Islam is that they could find in a Muslim propaganda pamphlet. It's also Ironic that this movie places so much emphasis on how Islam promotes women's rights, considering that it completely ignores Mohammed's close female relatives. Actually depicting and narrating the stories of strong female characters like Aisha, Khadijah, and Fatima would do more justice to Muslim women than repeating clichéd phrases about how "Mohammed ended female infanticide!" or whatnot. The acting is decent, at least by Quinn, and the cinematography is quite good. However, the script just makes the whole film, and even early Islamic history itself, seem silly. Both Muslims and Non-Muslims alike deserve better. My advice would be to wait until some brave film maker actually has the guts to make a Mohammed movie with the full cast of characters. Watch this film if you are genuinely interested in Islam or Islamic history and want to see a brave, if not very successful, take on the prophet's life. DO NOT watch this film as an introduction to Islam --- buy a book. If you want a great epic film that takes place in the Middle East, see "Lawrence of Arabia" or "Ben Hur" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 20 war movies ever made? You MUST be joking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie improbably finds itself in the top 20 war movies list on IMDb. I don't know whether it's inclusion as a "war" movie is due to the sick humor of some anti-Islamic "prankster" (and that's being generous) who managed to sneak this by the moderators here or because the definition of "war" movie has been diluted to the point of meaninglessness.The movie has exactly one novel aspect: it chose to tackle a difficult and seldom-filmed but historically crucial event - the origins of Islam. As other reviewers will surely have noted by now, it tackles the prohibition of not being able to show the Prohet Muhammad by showing the film from his point of view.While this is one way to get around the problem, the actual result is mediocre at best. The acting in the movie is spotty at best - perhaps slightly better than your low-budget Christian production of the life of Jesus, but that's about it. Some scenes are nice, such as when the first muzzein makes the call to prayer, but in general the movie suffers from stilted dialog, an unconvincing characters, poor plot and background development. It's just not a very good film.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film on Muhammad but Muhammad is played by the camera.Weird!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>movie is just fantastic. The director of the movie has made three movies in his life time all on the same topic. Quite a difficult task, to make a movie on Muhammad and not show him. Its weird that not even Abu-Bakr and Ali are shown. I didn't know that Muslims were sentimental about the following two leaders also. I wonder why did they show Hamza and rest of the people aren't they holy enough? what a man Muhammad would have been. I think this was the best movie i saw on Muhammad which came really close to reality. No point of views just incidents. Muhammad is more important than even Alexander. It seems after Muslims united under Muhammad the first war they lost was after more than 100 years. Christ was accepted by king Constantin only around the downfall of roman empire which is around 378 AD. Weird.We don't realize that Christianity became famous after Christ was dead for more than 350 years. Islam is different as Muhammad became the king before he died and actually ruled for 2 years. A successful revolutionist. Its strange that political revolutions are closely linked with religion like Martin Luther, moses, Christ, conscious, even Gandhi was a practicing Hindu and so people called him mahatma before they accepted his political ideas. Stalin and Mao are probably two successful revolutionaries who did not talk about religion but then of course times were quite different in 6th-7th century. I liked that the movie took care of fact that Muslims do believe that god also talked to Christ before he talked to Muhammad. Thats one thing that Christians don't like at all. Muslim believe in it because Muhammad said so otherwise Muslims are quite discreet about such details also. I liked inclusion of the female child burial and slavery as an important issue for Muhammad to be accepted by common men. This movie has helped me understand the time in a better way. small details like Mecca citizens worshiped around 360 gods then, which is an important detail if care. I'v read about Muhammad's army but now i can relate to that army with Hamza and slaves in my mind. conflict between parents and youths was interesting. Desert scenes were breathtaking. Director did every thing as historically correct as possible. Even the sermons which Muhammad got from spirits were only talk of the town and not done in mythological way like thundering announcements from the sky(thank god).war scenes were pretty cool. I wish there was a movie in which Muhammad was shown as a character but that way Muslims are even behind Christians. you can film Jesus but not Muhammad. It seems three departments gave their approval before the film got released. One from Lebannon. after 50 years of civil war can't on their own feet will tell rest of the world how to make films that too historical. good film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The truth of a religion isn't served by falsifying its origins.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only actual history in this allegedly historical epic is that Islam originated with the preaching of Muhammed in Mecca in the 7th Century C.E.; became a major force in the life of Arabia with his move to Medina, eventually becoming the factor unifying the peninsula; that Muhammed sent invitations to the leaders of the neighboring nations to accept Islam, and that they rejected his call. Everything else is either wishful thing, rationalization, imagination, or deliberate falsification.The portrayal of Muhammed and his first followers as victims of persecution (a distasteful ripoff of the Christians in the catacombs theme) was hopelessly over the top.While it was refreshing that the makers of the film respected Muslim tradition forbidding the visual representation of Muhammed, it made for extremely awkward and sometimes almost comic scenes of his listeners facing the viewers like kids mugging in front of live TV cameras. To be fair, there were lots of accurate and useful tidbits about the man, his message, and its origins---all but swamped amid a cocktail of fiction, awful acting, political correctness, and propaganda. The sole saving element was a wonderful musical score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An updated review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, now for all of you who have read my older post and have not been happy with the review. I took what you wrote to heart, the sincere and well worded messages that is. The one's describing me as a Muslim bashing *&amp;^%$$ bleep bleep I did not appreciate, but noting the derision in their message, it still made me want to go back an to another review of this film. So, hear it is. I also watched the film again after reading The Koran and Islamic history. First, I saw this film back when it had a limited U.S. release in the 70's. I rated it from that memory. In my second rating, combined with my further reading I give you this.......... The stars give great performances and for someone ignorant of Islam, this film does help answer some questions non Muslims might have about this faith. The film shows a fairly accurate account of the Prophet Mohammed in accordance to Islamic history study. The readings given from the Koran are represented well. Overall, the film in it's quality and depiction of the Islamic people is very well done. Now that this is out, I must add that after having learned more about Islam, I have come to the conclusion that Islam, like Christianity did spread at times in history in violent ways. Do not write me back contradicting this. It is historical fact, but I stand corrected about the film The Message-okay? I got the message. Last, if you read this and you do not know about Muhammed or the birth of Islam, then this film is worthwhile viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not trust the rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie last night because of the excellent reviews and votes it got on IMDb, and I was very disappointed. It is religious propaganda in the lines of the movie The Ten Commandments, only the acting, the script, the special effects, the sets and the overall production value are much, much worse.The main character (Mohammed) was censored out of the movie, so instead in some scenes the actors are speaking directly to the camera and the audience. These scenes look like something out of a Monty Python movie (which wouldn't be so bad if you were expecting a comedy).Read some of the reviews and observe the one-sided praising of the movie's message. Then take a look at the breakdown of the votes and see how many people gave this a 10...it is rated higher than The Godfather.Then try to guess who wrote the reviews and cast the votes, and decide whether you actually want to waste more than 3 hours watching a tedious movie which was censored by religious leaders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the theology as illustrated in this movie is childish. Second, there were no equal status and rights for women under Mohammed, or anywhere else for that matter at the time (Though it was the Christian world were women's rights eventually improved, and thats because Christianity isn't a religion of laws). Nor is there tenants against slavery in the Islamic code. Christians and Jews were second-class citizens bound by tribute. All of this, you will see, is in the Koran itself. And their is a VERY thick line between the beliefs and practices of Christians and Muslims... this is perhaps the most deceptive lie in the movie, for Christianity isn't based purely on a book--the Church and its rituals are older than the New Testament Canon. This is just a movie designed to woo gullible viewers to a faith they won't look into for themselves. It's made up of pure lies and propaganda and designed to appeal to emotion and not to logic. The Muslims were not a bunch of whistle-as-you-work, happy-go-lucky innocents. From the very beginning, from Mohammed on, they were, as he was, zealous and coercive. Only seventy or so made their way to Medina, and the Medinians supposedly converted in exchange for law and order, not necessarily because they felt the faith to be unparalleled in doctrine. If you want to learn about Islam, read its scriptures and history, and just look at the mentality of the Islamic world for yourselves... don't think you will get it from a movie that was made palatable for a gullible Western audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very inaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of thing that are wrong in this movie: 1) Only one of Muhammeds wife i mentioned. He had 12! Why not mentions the other one? What about the 9 year old Aisha? 2) The conflict with the Jewish tribes in Medina i not mentioned. This is a very important part om Muhammeds life 3) The cruelty of the Meccans is of course exaggerated 4) Islam didn't abolish slavery 5) In front of the king of Ethiopia they say that men and women have the same right in Islam. If you read the Koran it says clearly (e g 4:34) that this isn't the case 6) The Muslim's started looting the caravans to Mecca because they needed money, nothing else. That the reason should have been that he Meccans stole there property is wrong (they didn't) 7) There were war after the victory over Mecca that isn't mentioned.If you are interested in the life of Muhammed, read one of the many biography's</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of the worse movies that i have ever seen.nothing is special about this film,i don't know what was the directors aim,making a film to create a war monger face from Muslims and the great prophet of Islam,or making a movie to show the real story?,the benefit time of the movie(more than70%)has been spent by showing only two events of a big duration:two wars(badr &amp; ohod)so what does it mean? it means that in the history of Islam there were only to big event and those two also were the wars???????? it means that Muslims in those ages were the warmonger people? why there is nothing a bout the miracles of the great prophet of Islam?????????????????</fullReview>
