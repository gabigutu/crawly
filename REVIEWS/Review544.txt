		<shortDescription>Probably one of the most intelligently written screenplays of alltime.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any idiot can sit down and spend four or seven years of his life writing out his "masterpiece." You do some research, you do some hard work, you get a little help from friends and family, and you get it done. But, it takes a true writing genius (or geniuses, in this case) to create something as original as "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure." The ingenuity of the movie can even be seen in its delightful tagline: "History is about to be re-written by two guys who can't spell." This tagline is both simple and clever, while being both corny and slightly comical. Like "Real Genius," this film utilizes ideas from both the highest form of screenwriting while still delving into the lowest common denominator, somehow doing both at the same time. For instance, to perfectly grasp the concept of Bill and Ted's "lingo," one would truly have to stoop to the lowest rung of the intelligence level. But, with such ingenius ideas as having Bill and Ted meet each other in the beginning of the film, then later finding themselves, allowing the audience to gain insight on what happened in the past is just a stroke of cinematic brilliance. And the running gag about "when the Mongols conquered China" was one of the many cherries on the cake. Even some of the background comments (after being told he's "too tall, man" making the phone booth even more crowded, Lincoln responds: "That's how I'm built.") Any movie where Genghis Kahn is tempted to come into a phone booth by a Twinkie has to be something special. If only production companies and filmmakers would take a chance on something as original as a time travelling phone booth carrying two idiots on the course to better the future, the public could finally go back to watching movies in theaters again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie rules. Am I afraid to admit it? Nope, 'cause it's the truth! I know by reading some of my reviews I sound like some stuffy person who doesn't like any fluffy comedies or unintelligent humor, but that's not always the case. Yes, there are good fluffy comedies that promise a really fun watch.I can't even count how many times I've seen this movie, but somehow it never gets old. 'Bill and Ted' is of course NOT a great movie, but it never pretends to be one, and I guess that's why I like it so much. I've always had a huge fascination with the idea of time travel (why else would I love 'Back to the Future' so much?), and this movie actually makes it look really, really fun. Not to mention that Bill and Ted's mispronunciation of the historical figures' names ("So-crates!") makes it all the more hilarious.Did I mention that Rufus is totally awesome? No? Well go ahead and kick me in the face!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly gnarly comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>June 8, 2002 was an 80's renaissance for me. Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore "Ted" Logan in all his movies.He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the success of such films as "Speed" and "The Matrix" trilogy, to a lot of people, Keanu Reeves will ALWAYS be Ted, the taller, darker half of the Bill &amp; Ted duo. And it would seem that Ted, of all Reeves many characters, is possibly the only one where he really seemed to have put himself into the role and felt like a natural.One of the great dopey dude slacker classics, the title characters Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (the aforementioned Reeves) are a pair of aspiring musicians, the Wild Stallions, who are in danger of being both separated if Ted can't pull up a good enough grade (which = military school) and flunking history class in general. But since they are destined to be "the 2 Great Ones" who's music will unite the Earth and even alien races together in universal harmony, the most excellent dude Rufus (George Carlin) shows up and gives them a time traveling phone booth to help them pass their history class by bringing back real historical figures like Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln, Napoleon, Joan of Ark and what not. Now all they have to do is keep them from getting separated and jailed before they have to pass history! Along the way, Bill &amp; Ted also fall in love with two sexy virgin princesses from the medieval circa.Yeah it's not great cinema, but it's a fun romp of slacker dude madness thanks to the energy and enthusiasm of Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves as the title characters.Followed by "Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 10/10 on the fun scale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW. Talk about a childhood classic! Bill and Ted first surfaced when I was nine years old. Those were the days...I don't know how many times my best friend and I watched this one, but it must have been every day during our third grade year. I've watched it countless times after that and it has yet to lose its charm. When Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey came out a couple of years later, the process repeated itself. These are two movies about a couple of (seemingly) burn-out teens who don't take drugs, which leads one to the conclusion that they were just born idiots. Thing is, just by being stupid, everything seems to happen right for them wherever they go, thanks to good ole Rufus (George "the king" Carlan). Excellent Adventure starts with our idiot duo, doing what they do; jamming out in the garage (on guitars they can't play) and talking nonstop about how someday, somehow, their band "Wyld Stalyns" will open for Iron Maiden. When their dream is threatened by the reality that they are flunking out in history, things take a turn. What it all boils down to is that they need to have a badass history report or they're both going to flunk out and Ted will be sent to military school by his mean, police officer dad. This is where Rufus comes in. He shows up in a time machine (in the form of a phone booth) and claims to have all the answers to their problems. The time machine is just what they need for their history report so it's "back in time we go", to capture historically significant figures (Socrates, Napolean, Billy the Kid, Joan of Arc, Abe Lincoln, etc.). The fun never stops. I'm really not sure why this movie works as well as it does. It takes an idea that would sound completely stupid on paper, and somehow, makes it all come together. The characters are completely likeable and the script is sharply written. Best of all, this movie is just good fun. The music is awesome too. If you have never seen this movie or its sequel, you are seriously depraved. Go put on your old Megadeth t-shirt, ragged out jeans, and a few beers, plop down on the couch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure" is most definitely just that! This is just an all around FUN movie! The plot is far from anything serious, but deep down there are some good morals and such things to take from this film. "Be Excellent To Each Other" That is some good advice, is it not?The comedy in this film is just superb! I've seen this movie more times than I can count with my fingers and every time it gets even better! There are so many lines in this film that you just can't help but repeat, because they're just so funny and well done! There are a number of times that I find myself just cracking up at the scene, situation, or what have you. If you don't laugh at least a little during the course of this film, then I think you've got some problems.The acting is great. Everybody knocks Keanu Reeves for his acting, but I think he's great. And he does a great job in this film. Alex Winter also plays a great part. The rest of the cast is great too.Not only is the comedy and the acting great, but there are some REALLY good science fiction sort of idea's in this film. The scene where Bill and Ted meet the future Bill and Ted is just amazingly well done, and such a cool idea. I love that you first see the scene from the perspective of one set of Bill and Ted's, and then later the Bill and Ted that the story follows becomes the other set of Bill and Ted's. Did that make sense? Well, anyway, see the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about. There were a few other really good scenes and ideas throughout the film.All in all, I would definitely recommend seeing this film, it's not a complex story by any means, and just a whole lot of fun. Try not to take the film too seriously and you'll hopefully enjoy it. I truly hope that you enjoy this film. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't come of age in the '80s, so I missed the era when people mindlessly called each other "dude" and said "totally" a lot. But fortunately, I've seen "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure", so I have some inkling of that culture. The movie of course focuses on SoCal high school students Ted Logan (Keanu Reeves) and Bill Preston (Alex Winter) who want to start a heavy metal band, but are flunking school. Little do they know that the fate of the universe in 700 years will depend on whether or not they ace their history report. No worries! Rufus (George Carlin) comes from the future and gives the two boys a phone booth, and they go back in time and pick up Socrates (pronounced SO-krayts), Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc, Napoleon Bonaparte, Ludwig van Beethoven, Abraham Lincoln, Billy the Kid and Sigmund Freud. Needless to say, these historical figures are a little befuddled when they arrive in San Dimas, and the people in San Dimas are befuddled by them.Mostly, the movie is an excuse to have Bill and Ted be the dopey dudes that they are. Whether it's Ted saying that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife (which, it turns out, some people actually believe), or the two boys getting slinky with some medieval princesses, the movie's got something for everyone. It is TOTALLY AWESOME! If you ask me, they should have also picked up Mahatma Gandhi and Alfred Hitchcock.One more thing: Stephen Herek scored a personal triumph with this movie, as he did with "Critters" and "Mr. Holland's Opus". Too bad that he drug himself down with fare such as "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead", "The Three Musketeers", "Rock Star" and "Life or Something Like It".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been something about reviewing movies that I have seen a million times over that unnerves me. When I check my email and add a bit of reviews here and there, how does one say if a movie is good or bad if you have seen it a dozen times over in the course of your life with different perspectives after every view? BILL &amp; TED'S is one of those movies. The acting is sad, yet the characters are charming. The movie feels cardboard yet the pace and plot are perfectly fine. All I can say is that if you are a fan of the late 80s and indulged yourself in saying words such as 'bodacious babe' and 'party on dude' than this movie completely suits you fine.Two high school 'dudes,' Bill and Ted get in a rut for if they get anything less than a A+ in history, the latter of them will get set off to a military camp in Alaska. This is bad news for the future, for their Wild Stallyns band had made the future a better place.Bill &amp; Ted are charming dudes who, like the bestest of buds, stick up for one another and that is where the movie shines above others. The character growth between our two 'dudes' and the historical figures they abduct make this movie interesting enough to watch on its own. I was impressed by the sets, as well as the special effects for its time as well, how the phone booth looks like it is grabbed before entering the circuits of time. BILL &amp; TED gets a thumbs up because the movie works with its characters to make you laugh and care about them. Look no more than Genghis Khan dodging the cops.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wild &amp; Fun "History Lesson"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to get upset at two very likable dummies who wouldn't hurt a fly. That's Bill and Ted, two Valley-type teens from back in the late '80s who play two really two guys who wind up going on a time-travel trip while trying to help themselves pass a history presentation.I've always enjoyed time travel stories but they've all been fairly intelligent......not stupid, like this. However, this was still fun to watch. Any time you get to see Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln, Socrates, Beethoven, Napoleon, Joan of Arc and others all in the same movie - especially with these two modern-day airheads - is pretty entertaining.Keanu Reeves was perfect for the role because he sounds stupid no matter role he plays! Alex Winter, I don't know. George Carlin has been goofy for 50 years so anything stupid he says wouldn't surprise me.This is comedy at its lightest but it's pretty inoffensive, safe viewing for most anyone and if you need a laugh - even from something dumb - this would fill the bill.</fullReview>

But both actors have come a long way and are very respected in their work.This is a very fun film. Is it silly? Oh, yes. But you have to admit that there are more than a few moments where you are laughing on the floor in tears. I mean, come on, "How's it going, royal ugly dudes?" LOL! Every line in here is pretty much a catch. Yes way, Bill and Ted, they did have an excellent adventure. Go on the adventure with them, you won't regret it. It's a fun movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>truly awful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>after watching this film i am left wondering how on earth did Keanu Reeves have an acting career after this. Not only is the acting so bad the storyline is so appalling. Most films like this i try to go along with the corny and silly nature of them but i couldn't squeeze an ounce of fun out of this film. The script sounds like it was written either by a stoner or someone on the verge of becoming a vegetable and Keanu Reeves previously mentioned awful acting was excruciating and was probably on par with an enthusiastic actor in a school production. The only good part of the film that i got a laugh out of was Napoleon, who is played very well with the good comic timing and genuine humor that was missing for most of this film.btw i was forced to watch this in a high school history lesson so i am genuinely sorry if i am shitting on one of your favorite childhood movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989)5 word summaryFriends travel time for historyTo give the good news first, the film is a fun adventure comedy, unfortunately it is also an annoying adventure comedy as well. When I was younger I remember enjoying this movie and so I watched it again recently and didn't realize how bad it was. With the obvious time travel paradoxes aside, since they come with any time travel movie, the film has just too many problems. Bad acting, that are shared with bad writing to make the acting seem even worse, lame directing and lame attempt to sneak in a history lesson, that I'm guessing is missed by most viewers.It is at times funny, I wont deny that, however the main characters are overwhelmingly annoying that its hard to care about the funniness. One example is how Bill and Ted always speak together, saying the same thing. Here and there would be okay but they really over did it. The film is watchable, you just really have to be in the mood, or have enjoyed it since the 80s. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, I originally bought it because it was ?3.99 during the New Year's Day sales, and, as a DVD collector, I meerly picked it up to add to my ever-expanding collection. Putting off watching it for over a month, I finally found the time to sit down and press play. Strangely (and almost instantly), I was totally hooked on something I imagined I'd never like...Bill and Ted are two dudes in 1988. Hoping to form their own band one day, they spend endless hours practising in their garage even though they have no idea how to even play the guitar! Also, they're both flunking History and unless they can get an A+ in their next history report, Ted's dad is sending him off to military school! They've got to figure something out, and fast! Along comes Rufus, an "awesome dude" from the future who has been sent to make sure they pass their report with flying colours... using a time machine! So, Bill and Ted set off on one heck of an adventure through time, picking up a variety of characters from the different ages of the universe, including Billy the Kid, Joan of Arc and Beethoven himself! When you begin watching BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE you can instantly tell you're in for something different. Sure, the plot's a little crazy and thin, but it's a fun movie aimed at doing one thing: To Entertain.There's no use in taking this movie too seriously or you won't enjoy it at all. Watch it with an open mind and relax, maybe get a few friends around too. Seriously, it's totally fun and I recommend it to any film fans, whether it's to see something totally different or to see something totally awesome! BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE: Fun, original and laughable. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BILL &amp; TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE is one of those charming, harmless comedies which, if you grew up in the 1980s, you probably saw once... or twice... or three or four times.Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are gnarly as the title duo, two high school headbangers (read: morons) whose future, it turns out, is crucial to the wellbeing of the planet! Trouble is, these dudes are about to seriously flunk history, and if that happens, the entire space time continuum could suffer. Enter from the future Rufus, sent back to the '80s to provide our dimwitted heroes with a time-traveling telephone booth. With it, they round up a who's who of historical figures -- Socrates, Billy the Kid, Sigmund Freud, Napoleon and the like -- to highlight an educational presentation that will be their academic saving grace.Nothing is overly spectacular about BILL &amp; TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE. It's neither roll-on-the-floor hilarious nor ingenious nor packed with amazing special effects. But it does deliver quality over quantity, nicely filling out its 90-minute running time with some chuckles and smiles. The first half is particularly strong as the guys venture from the Old West to medieval castles in search of people whose names they can't even pronounce (Beethoven becomes "beeth oven" and so on). Seeing them try to sweet talk Socrates with rock lyrics and lure Genghis Khan with a Twinkie is good for a laugh. The same fish-out-of-water scenario doesn't work quite as well when these figures enter contemporary times, but everybody puts in their best effort forward. And sometimes, that's all you can ask of a film. A kickin' soundtrack adds to the fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest look 20 years later at what was a most excellent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two Californian wannabe rock star teens, one played by Keanu Reeves of Matrix fame, are going to flunk their history class. Thankfully, a time traveller from the future, where those 2 same guys are revered as icons, comes back and gives them a time machine in the shape of a phone booth. Our heroes proceed to kidnap famous historical figures for their final expose. This is one of the quintessential 80s movies that was better in my memory than it is now, but still manages to be rather amusing. The main attraction for me this time around was their "most excellent" way of talking, full of slacker-surf lingo of the 80s. Our heroes seem dumb, but they have their hearts in the right place and are somewhat more clever than initially appears. This shows in the complicated words they sometimes use and in how they use the time machine to their advantage in the final part.The "kidnapping" sequences of the famous historical figures weren't particularly good, nor were those famous people particularly well characterized, at least in the beginning. Most of the sequences with Napoleon were weak and overstayed their welcome. I would have done without him (especially the long waterslide sequence) and also with some lame sequences that really don't work. Not only that but the Napoleon actor obviously didn't really speak French. However, when the famous historical figures start interacting in the present, with the exception of Napoleon, the movie gets way more entertaining. It struck me how the second half was much more fun and inventive than the first, with the exception of Bill and Ted meeting themselves in the first part, that was a great idea. This reminds me that because it tells us outright from the start, you know that things are going to end well. I would have preferred less information so there would be at least some suspense (despite the fact it's a comedy). The special effects aged surprisingly well, even the time travelling parts. In the first half, I thought the movie was somewhat poor with a few snippets of enjoyment, and that perhaps time had altered my perception of it. Thankfully, the better second half, when the famous people get to the present, redeems it and makes it worth watching and not just for nostalgia's sake, although nostalgia does help.Rating: 6 out of 10 (good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any younger person who did't grow up in the late 80's early 90's probably does't realize how this movie effected society as a whole. Whether you loved this movie, hated it, or never even saw it when it came out, there is no denying what it did, especially to advertising. There wasn't a commercial geared toward teens from 1989 till probably 1995 that didn't have a couple or morons talking like Bill &amp; Ted. I can't think of another movie that had such an effect as Bill &amp; Ted's did. Another example of how it became part of social thought, is how many movies or TV shows have you seen spoof the whole "San Demus High School Football rules!" quote have you seen, there are easily dozens. This movie rightfully gets a lot of praise for the fact that it had a moral, and actually taught kids some things about history, my hope is that history looks at this movie as it was; a movie that was goofy on purpose, showed great friendship between two people, taught us a little about history, and change the landscape of pop culture for almost 10 years (something I don't think many movies have done, especially any teen comedies).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can recall the feelings of dread whenever I had to take an exam at secondary school in England amongst a group of my peers who always used the highest percentage in an exam as a raison d'etre for intelligence. As we all know, common sense is more important.BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE is another one of those sweet little ideas that American cinema expands to great comic effect like FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF did. The concept is simple - two high-school dropouts have to compose a history paper or fail graduation. Enter a guiding light who gives them a time machine and like TIME BANDITS arrive at key points in history to meet the actual figures of their needs and then take them back to the present.If you're a fan of old-time 70's rock, you will lap up some of the references and as a prelude to the dumb and dumber cinema of the likes of WAYNE'S WORLD and FORREST GUMP, it is always a good bet. Good performances from the leads and great support from George Carlin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best time travel movie ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm serious!This movie has lots of things going for it, but little noticed is that its treatment of time travel is superior, for two reasons.First, it is realistic. I know that probably sounds ridiculous, but the majority of time travel movies fall into contradiction by permitting "changing the past." Only a very small number of movies ("Twelve Monkeys," and its French inspiration, "La Jetee," "The Terminator," "Time After Time," amongst them) avoid this error.But second, these other movies preserve consistency at the cost of what will seem to fans of "changing the past" to be the main point of time travel. Each involves protagonists who think they can succeed in changing things, and such stories have Oedipal overtones when fate plays itself out. Bill and Ted show us that (consistent) time travel can be used quite deliberately in ways that are advantageous--the sequence with the car keys is simply brilliant! (Unfortunately, having introduced this device for problem-solving, the writers get a bit carried away with it...)</fullReview>

This movie follows two teens, Bill &amp; Ted, who have to do a good history project in order to succeed later in life. A man named Rufus(George Carlin) comes to them with a time machine, which is also a phone booth. Bill &amp; Ted go back in time and try to bring some of history's most important people to the future so they can use them in their history project. Not all goes well though, as the historical figures get into some trouble. The humor in this movie is never dumb, it never becomes raunchy, and it always stays funny.This is a great way to pass a couple of hours. It's a very entertaining movie that doesn't have a real complex plot. It's just something you sit back and enjoy. I recommend this movie for just about anyone. It has a pretty wide audience, as it never becomes too inappropriate for kids, teens will probably find the antics to be funny, and adults will probably find something good about it. Watch this movie anytime. While it may not be the greatest movie ever made, it's a fun viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, Heinous, Awesome, Righteous, Dude, Bogus: Enhance Your Grammar with Bill and Ted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Some Minor Spoilers*Do you remember in high school, when you had a day to come up with something good or you were afraid of flunking? I think we've all had times with one thing or another where we had one day to put together something we knew nothing about. Well, that's how Bill and Ted feel in "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure," when they find out they have one day to present a history speech at school, or they will flunk.Bill S. Preston (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are two high-school clowns from San Dimas, California, without a clue. Literally. They don't know a single thing about history and are as dense as dense can be. Bill believes Napolean to be a "short, dead dude," and Ted thinks Joan of Ark was Noah's wife. But they try to clean their act up after their history teacher threatens to flunk them both unless they come up with a good history presentation that same day. Things turn even more heinous when Ted finds out his father is going to ship him off to military school in Alaska if he doesn't pass. Whoa.The two dudes are in most righteous trouble. If Ted is shipped off to military school in Alaska, Bill and Ted will never complete forming their rock band, the "Wyld Stallyns." But they have no idea of just how important they are in the future until Rufus (George Carlin) comes back in time from the future with a time-travelling phone booth. He tells the two dudes that in the future they solve world hunger, bring peace to the world, and stop war, all through their music. Sounds like "The Beatles." Anyway, the two teens are surprised and take Rufus' phone booth through time, trying to learn history first-hand. But along the way they learn that instead of taking history from their surroundings mentally, why not take history from their surroundings PHYSICALLY? Bill and Ted start to pinch historical figures and bring them back to the eighties. These figures include Napolean (who takes a trip to San Dimas' "Waterloo" fun park), Socrates, Joan of Arc, Sigmund Freud, Gengis Khan, Billy the Kid and Abraham Lincoln. But the two pals still have a lot of obstacles in their path if they wish to successfully pass history class. Dude!"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" is one of those movies that is hilarious in the beginning, funny in the middle, and outrageously, screamingly hysterical towards the end. I'll admit the first time I saw this film I didn't enjoy it much, but I saw it at a local video store for a few bucks on DVD and couldn't pass up the deal. I bought it along with "Spaceballs" and left "Bill and Ted" for last viewing. I finally watched it again today, and it was more than surprising. It was great! It cleverly combines eighties-type-humor with an original, if somewhat borrowed plot.It's predictable, yes, but on a scale of enjoyability it scores a solid "4" out of "5." A lot of times we can forsee many events, and unlike the "Back to the Future" films, the idea of time travel itself isn't played upon as much as it is there just as a reason to get historical figures into the eighties. The phonebooth had a lot more potential; and when they did start phone booth paradoxes, most of the time they were never fully resolved, and didn't make sense. But that is not really what the film is here for. It isn't "Back to the Future." The story isn't centered around the time machine and/or what it can do, but rather what you could bring back with you. "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" is nowhere near as good as "Back to the Future" Part 1 or 2, but I didn't expect it to be.The best parts of the film are when they play on what historical figures would do given the chance to be thrusted into a new year. Bill and Ted bring the different characters into the San Dimas mall, where Genghis Khan proceeds to wreck a sportshop, Joan of Ark tries her hand at becoming a fitness instructer, Beethoven plays the electronic piano in the mall, Socrates goes ice-skating, Sigmund Freud hits on women and asks cops about their mothers in an interrogation with another psychiatrist, etc., etc., etc...I won't ruin anymore for you, nor give away the specifics and outcomes of this mall exploration, but I will tell you that there is nothing more enjoyable for a Friday night then watching important, key-historical figures from different time eras exploring the 1980s. I know someone who gets mad at the Abe Lincoln speech and really hates this movie, but I think it's all good fun.Much like "Back to the Future" played on time-travel and its impact, "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" plays on the epic question, "Just what would historical figures think of modern-day life?", and while the outcome isn't as evenly funny or amusing as "Back to the Future," it's still a wildly funny film that will entertain you, if nothing else.4/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure was probably one of the most compelling films I've experienced since I first watched it. It has an idea only an indie director could possibly think of, but it avoids all of the campy expositions which would turn it into some bad "B" film. The story was great, and it was really one of the best depictions of high schools idiots in the history of Hollywood. I mean, you did not see these guys taking tokes or drinking in their spare time, which really vexed some people. They're just stupid for the sake of the story. While the technical aspects weren't special, they worked when they needed it. This film also had one of the best music soundtracks in the history of Hollywood, even if it was from the 1980s. Too many good things to say about this film besides the fact it is a film which doesn't take itself seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't discount this movie simply because it's stupid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of you are probably familiar with the plot. It's about two dopey teens who are assisted by a time traveler to do a history project and get an A in their class. Otherwise, if they fail, the future will be irreparably damaged. In other words, their passing this class is THE pivotal point for mankind--if the boys blow it, the future will suck but if they pass it, it will usher in a new age for the human race!While it's all very hard to believe (given that Bill and Ted are idiots), you don't spend much time thinking about the impossibility of the situation because the movie is so fast-paced. The film literally jumps all over the place in time and eventually they meet up with a ton of famous people ranging from Lincoln to Joan of Arc to Billy the Kid to Freud!! And, in a completely improbable twist, all these characters agree to come to California in 1989 to help our unlikely heroes!Sometimes some people are too uptight and look down on films that are totally silly and mindless. Such comedies aren't sophisticated enough for them and the humor seems "low" and possibly beneath them. As for the major critics, many often dismiss such a film or gave it a mediocre review without considering one very important factor--does it make you laugh? In other words, you can't just discount a film for being childish or dumb if it makes you laugh out loud. This is exactly the case with BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE. Sure, it is often pretty immature and silly...but it makes you laugh out loud--hard and often. And, as for most of us, there really are times we NEED to laugh and let go. I know that when my wife and I saw this film, our lives were pretty tough. We NEEDED a film like this to make us laugh and forget about our troubles. Watching a romance, drama or an Ingmar Bergman movie would not have done this! So before you sell this cute movie short or think I am an idiot for giving it a 9, just remember--it WILL make you laugh...again and again and again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't surprised with what I saw. This takes one gag--insanely idiotic guys--and beats it to death by having them display their ineptness through history. A few 80s movies tried this after 'Back to the Future', none lasted because they didn't understand the context.Here we have two Biffs and no Doc to run the show. The historical figures themselves aren't interesting because they rely on the stereotypes we have in our minds. 'Kid in King Arthur's Court' also had these problems. There was so much potential here, so why did it fail?I found the sequel more interesting because it explored the darker philosophical territory of life, death, etc. rather than simple textbook journeys like this. There was also the heavy duality motif that's absent here.There are some good points like the self-referential Incest Joke. The writers improved on this the second time around, but it's pretty deep stuff for a light movie. Also, there's the irony of Keanu. From airhead to Messiah, that's society in a nutshell.The music, vocabulary, and production design are throwaways. Fortunately, the writers had another chance with better crew to set things straight--and to Hell, literally, with nostalgia.I liked sequel self-reference of 'Bogus Journey' to the history-bashing here. From there came 'Wayne's World' and Beavis &amp; Butt-Head, two icons of early 90s culture.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teen time-travel trippers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not quite sure just why I watched this popular teen comedy-adventure film from the 80's but I was a teenager once myself and I enjoy a good time-travel yarn and with hopes of a "Back to the Future" type entertainment thought I'd give it a shot.Okay in hindsight, I'd probably have enjoyed it more if I was actually still in or just out of school, but it was enjoyable all the same. The nods to predecessors like the afore-mentioned "Back To The Future" (meeting themselves in time, the lightning bolt exits and entries), Dr Who (even down to using a phone-box as their time-travelling craft) and "Quantum Leap" (with the Rufus character as their Admiral Al mentor and cajoler) are obvious and of course it plugs into the same nerdy humour which made the "Wayne's World" movies equally successful.I enjoyed the first half hour more when the dynamic duo's catch-phrases and mannerisms were fresh but lost interest in the rest feeling that there could have been better interplay among their historical kidnapees. One or two of the jokes made me smile (Freud quizzing an interrogating cop on his feelings for his mother and Bill owning up to a mildly Oedipal complex over his sexy step-mom) and the two leads obviously have fun outgorm-ing each other.I could have done without the so-dated 80's pomp rock soundtrack, even as I felt that the movie was crying out for an Eddie Van Halen cameo appearance, but I can't judge this too harshly. Okay, so maybe "Time Bandits" did it better, but this was pleasant lightweight inoffensive fun and a lot less vulgar than most of the teen-market aimed output from latter-day Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a most triumphant comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alex Winter (The Lost boys) and Keanu Reeves (Dangerous Liaisons) star as Bill and Ted, two teenagers in danger of failing their history class. A man from the future comes from the future to give them good news. He gives them a time machine where they can travel through time to collect historical figures for their report.This Stephen Herek (101 Dalmatians) picture is the true catalyst of comedy, with excellent physical humour and sharp witty dialogue with ace brilliant catch phrases from the two central protagonists. Beautifully directed, this 1989 fantasy comedy is brilliant in justifying the genre, making a wonderful light hearted film.Winter and Reeves make a great on screen partnership with their timing, catchphrases, facial reactions and companionship making them one of the best male comedy partnerships over the last twenty years. Using typical teenage conventions such as stupidity and slang, we can relate to the characters and their motives and, though stereotypical, are fun to watch.The plot is "most excellent" with a very consistent baseline, sharp dialogue, great direction, action sequences and visual effects. Jumping through all different times, the film makes great use of settings and jumps on opportunities to capture the essence of each time well and from the comedy perspective, it is used brilliantly.The use of historical figures is also a great device to gain acceptance into the comedy genre with Billy the Kid, Socrates, Beethoven and Genghis Kahn the most interesting and funny, though none will match Napoleon who was by far the funniest character of the entire film, especially the bowling scene which will get you in stitches.It is most simply, most excellent and you must watch it dudes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 80's was the best decade to be alive in. Practically everything during that decade was the best including clothes,music,films,life and Miami Vice which has to be the ultimate and defining show that showed us what the 80's actually was. This excellent film from 1989 which stars a young Keanu Reeves. This film is a non-stop entertaining adventure comedy. Bill and Ted are two of the best duos from the 80's along with Crockett &amp; Tubbs. Everything about this film is excellent: the story,the humor,the characters,the special effects and definitely the soundtrack. I've recently purchased this film on DVD whilst I was in England and it was worth the buy and it was a bargain. This is film that can't forgotten. It's such a feel good movie and cheers you up if you feel quite lonely or sad. My favorite songs used in the film are "Breakaway" by Big Pig which was used for the opening credits and "In Time" by Robbi Robb which was used in two scenes: the scene when they're in the future and the final scene of the film just before the end credits. Rating for this excellent film: 10/10. A film that shows us what comedies where like back then in the 80's. A film that can't be missed out and has to be seen. Buy it or watch it and you won't regret it. "Be excellent to each other and party on!".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long Ago, I caught this movie on cable, and have since regulated it to my VCR. I don't know what happened to the tape, but just for the sake of nostalgia (and because I had a friend who has never seen it before) I checked it out on DVD and was pleasantly surprised again.For those of you who don't know, Rufus (George Carlin), an agent from a future Utopia is sent back in time to ensure that Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) pass their history report so that they can form their band, Wyld Stallyns, and bring peace to the universe.There are some very cheesy elements to this film, such as the pair acting like total dimwits (Joan of Arc was NOT Noah's Wife), and the aspect of bringing figures from history to our own time is completely unbelievable, but the cheesiness is what makes the movie enjoyable. it doesn't take itself very seriously, and it has a pretty good running length."Bill and Ted" spawned forth an animated show (with the actors from the movie doing the voices, also recommended), a live action show (somewhat enjoyable, but you could tell the franchise was running out of steam) and an enjoyable sequel that wrapped everything up nicely. Overall, a good way to kill an afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here they are, in their 1988 World Tour! So-Crates Johnson, Bob Genghis Khan, Dave Beeth-oven, Maxine of Arc, Herman the Kid, Dennis Fro-eud, and...Abraham Lincoln.Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is lighthearted good fun from the late 80s that despite the fashions and music, hasn't seemed to date itself too much to younger generations that weren't even alive in the 80s. A decade before Keanu Reeves stared in The Matrix, and before he was the FBI agent assigned to bank robbery in the early 90s flick Point Break, he did this film and this is the role I always associate him with, no matter how many more movies he does. The stars of the film are two seemingly brainless but well intentioned high school slackers, Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (the aforementioned Keanu Reeves) that dream of making it big with their garage band "Wyld Stallions". One day, they will open for Iron Maiden and perhaps even get Eddie Van Halen on guitars, perhaps one day. But they are in danger of being split up for good if they don't pass their history report. They study but just seem too moronic to hold much information in their heads.Help arrives from the 27th century from a guy named Rufus, a man who comes down in a telephone booth (Dr. Who reference?) and greats the two friends in front of a Circle K, providing yet another great quote, "strange things are afoot at the Circle K". Rufus explains that the two must absolutely pass their history report and he gives the guys their own time traveling phone booth where they travel the ages and pick up various people of historical importance. Pay no attention to the accuracy of how these historical figures are represented, this film is not to be taken seriously and anyone who nitpicks how Abraham Lincoln or Ghenghis Khan was shown needs not be so wound up. Get a hobby. The fact that they went to the detail of having Socrates and Napolean not understand English was more then enough historical accuracy for me. The guys eventually meet themselves both at the start of the film and then later as the journey progresses. The fun really begins when they dump all the people they picked up in a late 80s shopping mall. I don't think I'm spoiling anything when I say that the guys do pass their report, it has to be seen exactly how they do this for it likely is the most original history report ever conceived. This is not a great film but it is fun. And yes I know my title quote was not spoken by either Bill or Ted, but rather by the jock giving his presentation to the class. I loved his speech because it seemed so authentic and real to what a guy like him would say if he were trapped for words during an oral report. Plus it was great to see the rest of Bill and Ted's school, and makes you realize how much more likable our heroes are. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a couple of dudes (Bill And Ted, from the film's title) who, in order to preserve the future as it's known, must pass their oral history report with an A due to doing quite badly constantly throughout the year.Now, getting complicated here, if they fail the report, they both flunk high school, Ted will get sent to military school, and so Bill And Ted's rather pants band Wyld Stallions will be no more, bogus...Now, if their band is no more, then their music (which is really important in preserving peace and stuff) won't exist, and thus the future won't be as such an excellent place as it is. So, Rufus, some dude from the future, has been sent back 700 years (to 1988) to aid them in passing their history report, through the use of a time machine.If you like 80's rock bands, this is a film for you, as plenty are mentioned (with a rather excellent jam from Joe Satriani at the end of the film), with Iron Maiden and Van Halen to name a few I give it ****/*****^_^</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill and Ted are slacker, surfer types in danger of failing history. This would result in Ted being sent to military school ? hence splitting their band, Wylde Stallions. When all seems lost Rufus, from the future, arrives in a time machine to offer the dopey duo the chance to travel back in history and get first hand knowledge of the subject ? the future society is based on the music of Wylde Stallions and Rufus must ensure they don't split up. Bill and Ted set off on an excellent adventure.A famous film despite the criticism. The story is little more than a series of sketches where Bill and Ted kidnap famous people from history. This is quite amusing, but not hilarious. It only really gets funny when all the historical figures are set loose in modern day America for 20 minutes. However even this is broad farce rather than sharp humour. The characters of Bill and Ted are either annoying or cool ? depending on how you feel about the surfer-speak they engage in.Reeves is cool and dopey ? it's weird seeing this now, now that he's a big action hero (The One, no less!) but here he is at his rawest (although he's not a great actor). The smarter of the two is also the one that has had less success commercially, but Winter also manages to carry off his role easily. The rest of the cast are amusing in their one-dimensional historical roles.Overall it's silly and not very funny. However it does have a sort of gormless charm and is quite enjoyable ? like a snack that is tasty for a second but leaves no taste! The best thing about this film is that it gave us a much better sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that sneaked into my "top 10"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is a cult movie, receiving relatively low scores on this site, among others; however, its impact on film history is rather substantial, ushering in a new genre of "Dude Comedy" and inspiring films such as "Dude, Where's My Car?" and "Wayne's World."The movie features amateur actors, Alex Winter (as Bill S. Preston, Esquire) and Keanu Reeves (as Ted "Theodore" Logan). The acting of our lead characters may not be phenomenal, but the focus is on their journey. Following through several points in history, Bill and Ted collect historical figures such as Socrates, Billy the Kid, and Abraham Lincoln, all in order to get an "A" on their history project and prevent Ted from being sent away to military school. This of course leads to a wonderful finale in which each of the carefully picked figures presents something about their time period in history, and saves the day for our heroes.All the while, this film is of course riddled with late 1980's fashion, music, and surfer slang. The most prominent in this film, though, would have to be the slang. Bill and Ted go back and forth throughout the movie saying lovable and memorable phrases such as "most excellent!" "bodacious!" and "be excellent to each other, dudes."This film is one of the greats not only because of its influence on other films and creating two new stars in Alex Winter (now a director) and Keanu Reeves, but Bill and Ted is a family-friendly comedy anyone of any age can enjoy. Simply amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A most triumphant sci-fi comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not the first work of fiction to feature a time travelling phone box, this is a most triumphant sci-fi comedy. The film has a very strong script by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon. Like the two central characters, the jokes may not be the cleverest but they're extremely funny. The cleverest moment in the film is the inspired use of time travel to rescue the personages of historical significance. Stephen Herek does a very good job at directing the film, bringing a huge amount of flair and energy to the proceedings. At only 86 minutes, excluding the credits, it rollicks along at a great pace and manages to fit quite a bit into its short running time.The film stars Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves as the Two Great Ones Bill S. Preston, Esq. and Ted "Theodore" Logan, a pair of well meaning, gormless high school age slackers living in San Dimas, California in 1988. Although they don't even know how to play their instruments yet, the music of their garage Wyld Stallyns - which, as they say at very opportunity, rule - will eventually form the basis for all human society. Sure, why not? Humanity could do an awful lot worse than to live by Bill and Ted's maxim of "Be excellent to each other and party on, dudes!" However, all is not well. In order to ensure that this utopia comes about, Rufus is sent from the year 2688 to help the boys pass their history class and prevent Ted from being sent to an Alaskan military school. Much of the credit for the film's success has to go to Winter and Reeves, who have a very likable screen presence, great comic timing and terrific chemistry. It is very easy to accept them as best friends from the moment that they are introduced. Although Reeves has had the more successful career, to put it mildly, I think that Winter is the more talented of the two. Actually, the only Keanu Reeves performances that I have ever actually liked are contained in this film and "Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey". He does vacant very well, in fairness to him. George Carlin's appearances as the time travelling benefactor Rufus are little more than an extended cameo but he certainly makes a big impression. In a temporal paradox that was probably unintentional, Rufus never actually introduces himself to Bill and Ted. They learn his name from their future selves. On their trip through time, Bill and Ted pick up a variety of famous historical figures. Terry Camilleri does not have as much screen time as most of the others but he is a laugh riot as the "short dead dude" Napoleon, who develops an affinity for San Dimas in the late 20th Century particularly the water park Waterloo. I hope that he remembers that name as it may come back to haunt him. Unlike most other time travel films, this one actually addresses the language issue as the only historical figure from a non-English speaking country who can speak English is the polyglot Sigmund Freud. I think that the only English word that Socrates speaks is "geek," which he learns at the mall in 1988. Nevertheless, Tony Steedman is likewise hilarious as the ancient philosopher, who takes everything in his stride. He and the underrated Dan Shor, who plays Billy the Kid, are a great double act. I have to admit that I first heard of Socrates from this film when I was a child and, as such, "So Crates!" pops into my head every time that I hear his name to this day. My knowledge of him and his many accomplishments has increased in the meantime, I hasten to add. Rod Loomis is great as Freud and Robert V. Barron is perfectly cast as Abraham Lincoln. I loved the fact that all of the historical figures were ready, willing and able to go along with Bill and Ted's plan to show them off at their final history report, though it was hinted that Genghis Khan and Joan of Arc (who was not Noah's wife, by the way) only had the vaguest idea of what was going on. Oddly enough, this is one of three films or TV shows that I am aware of in which Lincoln and Genghis Khan have run into each other, the others being the "Star Trek" episode "The Savage Curtain" and "Clone High". They're not exactly the most obvious historical duo! I also loved the little moments such Billy the Kid and Socrates playing, Billy the Kid clearly being smitten with Joan of Arc - played by Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go's, which is suitably random - and Napoleon attempting to make his moves on Missy, Bill's very young stepmother to whom both he and Ted are attracted. Hal Landon, Jr. and Bernie Casey are great straight men as Ted's hardass father Captain John Logan and the firm but fair history teacher Mr. Ryan, who are probably the two most believable characters in the film.Overall, this is a bodacious time travel film. When I wasn't laughing, I was grinning from ear to ear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The future is perfect but it's in danger. Ted Logan (Keanu Reeves) and Bill S. Preston (Alex Winter) play in their garage band Wyld Stallyns in San Dimas, California. The two slackers are in danger of failing history unless they ace the final oral presentation. Ted is threatened with military school by his dad. Rufus (George Carlin) travels 700 years from the future in his phone booth to help them pass their history class and stay together to form their most excellent band. Napoleon stowaways with the phone booth and arrives in the present. The boys decide to bring historical figures back with them to do the report.This is simply a fun time with two adorable slackers. It is silly. I hope nobody takes the history lessons too seriously. One can certainly dissect this until all the fun is drained out of the movie. However, the lovable duo of Winter and Reeves cannot be denied. Also the diminutive dictator Napoleon is loads of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent And Hilarious SCI-FI/Comedy Cult Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure is an excellent(no pun intended),hilarious SCI-FI/Comedy that combines wonderful direction,a terrific cast,great laughs,a fine script,a memorable score and soundtrack and amazing special effects. All of those elements make Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure one of the most entertaining Comedies of the 1980s and a Cult Classic.Set in San Dimas,California,Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure tells the story of teenage best friends Bill S. Preston Esquire(Alex Winter)and Ted Theodore Logan(Keanu Reeves)who are failing history class and are in danger of being separated forever. But when a man named Rufus(George Carlin)shows up in a phone booth time machine that can help them with their history project that can save their grade and friendship.Released in 1989,Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure is a brilliant and hilarious movie that was a surprise hit at the Box Office grossing 40 million dollars above it's 10 million dollar budget and becoming a Cult Classic while introducing movie audiences to one of the coolest movie duos of all-time in Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted Theodore Logan AKA Bill and Ted. From start to finish Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure is a movie that is an absolute blast that gives viewers plenty of laughs,Adventure and fun that just never stops and keeps viewers glued to the screen and is a movie in my opinion that ranks alongside the Back To The Future trilogy as one of the most entertaining time travel films of all-time. Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of those movies that(along with it's underrated sequel Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey)remains re-watchable to this very day and for 90 minutes is most triumphant and never takes itself too seriously because it's not going to be thought-provoking nor will it make you think but it's a film you will never forget. It's one of those films that takes you back to the 1980s and tells viewers to turn off your brain sit back and have fun with this movie. The Comedy and laughs in Excellent Adventure are fantastic with over the top moments that are smart and outlandish and will have you roaring with laughter. The Humor not only comes from the scenes with Bill and Ted but with the historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln,Napoleon,Billy The Kid,Beethoven and Joan Of Ark deal with modern day and how they deal with the modern world and society(circa 1989). While it's historically inaccurate and very silly it goes with the offbeat style of the movie. The time traveling scenes in Excellent Adventure are dazzling and imaginative using a Telephone instead of a car or watch The Screenplay by Chris Matheson and Ed Soloman is funny and at times smart with dialog and scenes that are clever and over the top with great comedic timing. Bill and Ted are one of the classic duos that are just iconic from the moment you see them on screen with memorable lines that are quoted to this very day such as excellent,dude and others. It's obvious that Bill and Ted aren't the smartest guys in the world and they don't always better themselves(they want to form a band but can't play their instruments)the two always remain lovable despite their flaws and we root for them to succeed in trying to pass History. Bill and Ted are among my favorite movie characters of all-time and are legends that will live on forever. The ending of Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure is amazing,fun and filled with surprises and laughs that will put smiles on viewers faces. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are excellent and hilarious as Bill and Ted,with Winter and Reeves bringing laughs and chemistry. George Carlin is delightful as Rufus,a man sent to help Bill and Ted. Terry Camilleri is hilarious and memorable as Napoleon,the French soldier. Dan Shor(Billy The Kid),Tony Steedman(Socrates),Rod Loomis(Freud),Al Leong(Ghangus Kahn),Jane Wiedlin(of 80s group The Go-Go's,Joan Of Ark),Robert Barron(Abraham Lincoln),Clifford David(Beethoven),Hal Landon Jr(Captain Logan),Bernie Casey(Mr. Ryan),Amy Stoch(Missy/Mom)and J. Patrick McNamara(Mr. Preston give good performances as well.The direction by Stephen Herek is terrific,with Herek bringing an energy,pace and visual style to the film. Great direction,Herek.The score by David Newman is outstanding and memorable,with Newman's score matching the light tone of the film. Fantastic score,Newman. There is also a terrific Heavy Metal/Hard Rock soundtrack that adds to the film.In final word,if you love Comedies,SCI-FI films or both,I highly suggest you see Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure,an excellent and hilarious SCI-FI/Comedy that you will never forget. Highly Recommended/ 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going back in time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Provided with a time machine by future beings with a vested interest in seeing them pass History, two high school slackers travel back in time and capture assorted historical figures in this popular 80s comedy. Given how nonsensical the plot is (the film assumes that interactions with historical figures will not alter the past - plus the Beethoven of the film is not deaf), the movie relies heavily on the charm and likability of its young protagonists to carry things through and fortunately the chemistry between stars Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves is spot-on all the way. The pair mispronouncing names such as Freud and Socrates admittedly grows groan-inducing quite quickly, but there is something to be said for the way Winter and Reeves seem able to predict one another's moves, often saying and doing spontaneous things in synchrony. The film also gets some good laughs from having historical figures at a loss to twentieth century living (Freud's constant psychoanalysing of everything is great), however, contemporary interactions with Napoleon were done more cleverly in 'I Dream of Jeannie' and the film does not feature anywhere near enough scenes in which the historical figures bond with each other; one of the best scenes has Socrates and Billy the Kid trying to hit on girls together like high school pals. While bits and pieces of the film do not work though, everything spirals towards a memorable, if over-the-top, auditorium climax and the final line that George Carlin says to the camera ensures that the film at least concludes on a humorous note.</fullReview>

They just have the attitude, the behavior and the way they talk about absolute nonsense. The pair of them are funny. I'm also happy for them that they got their English chicks, it was rather unexpected but I'm delighted for them!I think the phone box was definitely copied from Doctor Who or Back to the future,it has like the same detail and idea of an actual time machine. It's really cool though.If you feel like you wanna be entertained, get down to watching this, it'll blow you away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BILL &amp; TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE is a film that works thanks to the excellent, one-of-a-kind storyline that's the very definition of high concept: a couple of high school slackers risk being kicked out of school if they fail their history project, so they utilise the services of a time machine to assemble various historical figures to help them out. I love that, I love the concept and the execution is above average here.Bill and Ted are also a lovably goofy couple of creations. I remember when Mike Myers ripped them off for WAYNE'S WORLD a couple of years later but I hated his creations, whereas these guys are actually funny. Their quirky dialogue is quite delightful. It's the historical stuff that makes this film work, though, and while it's never really laugh out loud funny, there's plenty of absurd humour that arises naturally from the premise. Plus it's impossible to dislike a film where henchman extraordinaire Al Leong plays Genghis Khan...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was not particularly smart, but it did kind of represent an era that we will never really forget: the excellent 80's. Meet the two completely spaced out losers that don't want anything else than to start a heavy metal band and will let nothing stop them, not even their lack of knowledge of their instruments. Helped by a man sent from the future, they travel back in time to gather celebrities in order to get an A+ in their oral TV show like exam. Beat that, Sly and Arnold!The film has gained a cult following immediately after, not because it was a good movie, but because it took no prisoners and it didn't take itself seriously for one second. That kind of courage from the entertainment studios was also a sign of a dying age, unfortunately.Like with the classic celebrities adolescents are forced to learn about in order to understand history, it would be criminal not to see the movie, if you ever want to know film. And for old folks like us, it is a trip back in time to happier days, when movies were fun and the world was dreaming of end to poverty and war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the greatest film ever made... please read</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many years I have held that Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is possibly the greatest film ever made. A massive claim I'll grant you, but I have sound reasons for making it. Isn't it fair to say that a great work of art should teach us something about the human condition? Is it not also the case that great film should entertain and enlighten? In these times in which we live, when religion is used to vindicate horrific inhuman acts or finds itself being left by the wayside as logic and science march forward with greater and greater strides, it's a comfort to see that a simple tenet can revive one's faith in the human spirit. With Bill and Ted there is no race issue, no religious overtone, no profit from moralisation. There is a love of life, wonder for the wondrous, simplicity in all things. Yes the story is ridiculously far-fetched (chewed gum would never hold the aerial of a time machine together like that) but it is engaging, lovable, silly and FUN. The performances are superb throughout. The cast, from the amazing Deacon to the incredible Missy, are loving every minute of it. George Carlin is great as Rufus (he knows what he's talking about) and demonstrates acting akin to Olivier's Hamlet. It's stunning. It has everything... history, truth, corn dogs, gnarly old goat dudes and babes. Then there's Alex and Keanu... what more needs to be said? The two 'great ones' on which this film and the alignment of the planets rests. I have been calling everyone a dude since 1989! The story, the idea, the joyous silliness, the observation... and the undeniable truth that there is no greater rule to follow than to "be excellent to each other... and party on dudes!" Seriously, there is nothing else. I mean that. I'd rather follow that credo than any other set of rules that might exist. I'm sure George Carlin would have agreed. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favour and check out the greatest film of all time, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.So crates... watch your robes dude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun comedy with decent acting, but certainly not a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will try to give this movie a critical overview, but it is a movie that is better if viewed without a critical eye. The whole movie is fueled by fun humor that is pretty easy to enjoy. Although it has some light sci-fi elements, it is by no means an action comedy, nor does is have an interesting story. The plot basis is fine, but there are no end twists or earth- shattering revelations and there are no time traveling issues (e.g. Marty McFly almost preventing his own birth by interfering with his parents' past). For those who haven't seen the movie, the essential plot is that Bill and Ted are failing history and cannot graduate high school without acing their final report. To make matters worse, Ted's dad is threatening to send Ted to military school if he flunks out. With help from a man named Rufus (George Carlin) from 2689, they travel through time to find historical figures to help them make the perfect history report.While these two excellent dudes are presented and even treated like a unit, they are given individualized home situations and slightly different personalities. Ted (Keanu Reeves) is a bit more cheerful and goofy than Bill (Alex Winter), who has a few moments of irritation. While academically incompetent, they actually have some pretty good ideas and moments of resourcefulness throughout, rather like Harry and Lloyd in Dumb and Dumber. The whole time, they surf speak (e.g. "Excellent," "Triumphant," "Bodacious," etc.) and play air guitar solos as they collect their historical figures. These small quirks are what I feel makes this movie so enjoyable.Of course, it isn't award winning in any regard. As mentioned before, the story is given very little thought. The scattered moments of sci-fi have pretty poor visual effects. Of course, it is a comedy so these technical aspects are not terribly important. Besides, the acting and scripting is satisfactory from the main characters, minor characters, and one- liner parts. The comedy has a consistent personality and mood to it, but there is a pretty good balance of situational and verbal humor. The comedy is presented blatantly and doesn't have much Home Alone style slapstick or Monty Python style British humor. The back half of the movie has lots of gags involving eight historical figures being put in California in the 80's. Bill and Ted have some pretty funny lines, but it's also quite amusing to just watch their non-verbal reactions to various situations. The humor is family friendly, though not written like a kid's movie. If that is confusing, it's essentially Wayne's World style comedy on a PG level, but again it isn't a kid's movie.You can watch this in almost any setting and not decrease the viewing experience. There's no problem if you watch it with a semi-boisterous crowd. If you don't find it funny or enjoyable after ten or so minutes, I would recommend turning it off. Your first impression of this film will probably be close to your opinion of it at the end. So in short, it's worth a try in search of a good comedy, but is by no means a masterpiece. Overall Rating: 8.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE is about as goofy as it gets, but that's totally its charm. And I can't really think of anything that's not likable about this movie; the historical figures at the mall, Napoleon and the waterslides, Bill's stepmom... It's got a surprisingly catchy soundtrack, some great one-liners and a winning sense of humor. The two leads are perfect choices for the eponymous dimwits (can there be a role more suited to Reeves' "Whoa" persona?). It all just works here, even if the time travel logic is threadbare. This is just good cheesy '80s fun. But most of all, I just love that George Carlin's in this. On paper, he seems unlikely, but fits like a glove.7/10</fullReview>

A film about two boys who fail school that get a time machine sounds pretty unique, but when you watch it, you get to see how fun it is. The script is well done, the action scenes are put together well, and the music is well done! One of my favorite parts in the film were the different scenes that go on at once. After Bill and Ted left Austria, accidentally taking Napoleon Bonaparte with them, Ted asks his younger brother to watch him. So we see Bill &amp; Ted going back into time capturing historical figures, while Napoleon is exploring the world of San Dimas in the 1980's. Not to mention, the CGI in this film is bombtastic for its time.It's a most triumphant movie, Dude!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the very beginnings of film, "buddy" comedies have always been very popular. From Laurel &amp; Hardy and Abbott &amp; Costello to Cheech &amp; Chong and Harold &amp; Kumar, audiences love to see what kind of trouble these guys can get into. After 25 years and with talks of a second sequel on the way, I finally decided to see what Bill &amp; Ted were all about. I was always scared off by the PG rating, I mean George Carlin in a PG rated film, come on! The first part of the film was pretty much what I expected it to be, as the two failing history dudes, fly around the world looking for historical figures. Things turn from ordinary to extraordinary when the group finally returns to 1989 and decide to go the mall of all places. This is where the film really finds itself and becomes more than just your typical buddy story. The interactions with people and the reactions on both sides are absolutely priceless and is what changed my opinion of this film. Keanu Reeves stars in one of his earliest roles, and manages to show that at some point in his life, he did have a personality and could tell a joke. His partner Alex Winter didn't really do much before or since, and while he wasn't great, he did have chemistry with Reeves, which always helps a movie progress. Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure wasn't so excellent, but it was different and manages to hold your attention. I still think this film would have been much better if it were R rated and a lot more edgy, but for what it was, it wasn't bad at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The comic tale of an amazing adventure directed by Stephen Herek.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Stephen Herek has made his film in such a manner that even a future star Keanu Reeves appears more of an actor sans all the fuss of an arrogant star. As great American philosopher John Dewey (1859- 1952) rightly remarked : "we only think when we are confronted with problems", an important lesson learned by two teenage boys who embark on a mission to meet some of history's greatest figures in order to complete their class' history project. This is the commencement of an amazing adventure of astronomical proportions wherein two dimwits get a chance to hobnob with some of mankind's greatest personalities namely Socrates, Lincoln, Napoleon and Freud. It would not be an understatement to express that all films try to entertain their viewers. However, there are certain films which succeed in killing two birds with a single stone. "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" is one such film which provides oodles of entertainment with adequate doses of pertinent messages about teaching especially techniques of imparting lessons in history to young people. The small town setting does enormous good to this film as it is depicted as an ideal place for young people with limited opportunities who yearn to showcase their creativity at any cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1980s Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two seemingly dumb teens struggle to prepare a historical presentation with the help of a time machine.This is the film that launched Keanu Reeves' career and brought George Carlin to a new generation of audiences. Those who grew up in the 80s and 90s may know him better as Rufus than as a comedian.The film has aged a bit in the last twenty-five years, but that is to be expected. Unfortunately, because it is a music-themed film ,this was inevitable. The film is and will always be a "cult classic", but the idea of the future as expressed here is a bit more bizarre than even originally conceived.The film could also be seen as misogynist, or at least anti-feminist. With the possible exception of Joan of Arc, there are no strong female roles. Missy exists as a trophy wife, and the princesses serve no purpose other than to be brides or girlfriends. A feminist critique would be interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun adventure with a phone booth time machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is an adventure comedy and also a Sci-Fi that is funny, fun and has two likable yet very stupid characters. The story is not drawn out or anything and is one of the best things about it, it doesn't try to be a fantastic movie and knows where it's limits are. It kind of thrills all the way through and at certain points you may really be rooting for Bill and Ted. I felt the film was just about good, and here below is why so.The story as said is fun and also comedic and that really mixes well here to create a film that will make you laugh but also let you just enjoy yourself whilst watching it. With the element of the time machine it just gets more fun, yes the film is goofy and very silly and can even seem like a stoner comedy without the drugs, but it is just consistently an enjoyable ride and one you can't help but like.Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter have a great friendship chemistry that is perfect in this type of movie, they even seem like brothers at times. As a whole the entire cast is good and they have good fun all the way to the end, I liked Terry Camilleri as Napoleon who is just hilarious and I won't ruin it for you but what he does is one of the highlights of this movie and along with other historic figures they all get caught in stupid things.Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon make a solid script which is really one of the highlights of this movie and the basis for much of the laughs. Stephen Herek directs it well too and he seems to do a good job when it comes to the travels Bill and Ted go on. For the 80's, it has some cool effects and although not awesome, they are still good to see, and the sets sometimes are well? just a little crazy.The film isn't always funny, misses the odd joke and that is why it isn't THE most funny film although no comedy is perfect. I think what I said about the stoner comedy but it doesn't have stoners part is also a reason this isn't great, very teen orientated and I can see why some people disliked this movie quite a bit, although yet again this film never claims or I think wants to be perfect.If you want a comedy that goes along the lines of many other 80's comedies then this is one to watch and it also has the added bonus of being slightly like a parody similar to Back to the Future. I think if you don't like the goofy films also made in the 80's then this isn't for you, very much a film that isn't afraid to target only teenagers as a market, but I think now the biggest fans from 1989 are way past there teens.Overall I did feel this was a Just About Good film and one I thought at first could have been an even higher score. Give it a go and literally chill out whilst watching this and you will have a massively good time, if you watch as a brutal film critic then you will well dislike it. But always remember watching this that it's just a funny teen film and I hope you have a most excellent adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how they did this, but Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure actually turned out to be a decent movie. There were some laughs to be had and the sci-fi is actually pretty darn crazy. In other words, this is a dumb film, but so dumb that it turns to be good entertainment. If you manage you turn off your brain and not expect anything serious, you will probably like this. (And no, there are no explosions here.) This film is about two doofus high school students named Bill and Ted who are on the verge of failing their history class, unless they pass their final oral exam. But with the help of this one mysterious figure, the duo use a time machine to head back in time to get their history for their project. But is it enough? Now, I wouldn't call the acting great. But everyone has just enough charm in order to make things work. Keanu Reeves in one of his very early film roles does an okay job and so does his mate, Alex Winter. I will say their characters are mildly irritating at times. There are also some cool cameos here, including the great George Carlin.Overall, this is a film that has no right to be good........but it is. It's an hour and a half of cheap entertainment that has some laughs and gives us a different look at time travel. Their take on the future is ludicrous, but pretty funny. This is not going to win any Oscars, but it's pure, dumb fun. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could quite possibly be one of the most original and well created comicbook style movie franchises that didn't actually start out originally as a comicbook. Yep believe it or not this cult franchise started out with the first film which was ingeniously written by two fellas called Matheson and Solomon, this film was not adapted from a comicbook source.I used to watch this film when I was still in school back in the day, it was massive! I adored it and watched it all the time. The basic premise is so simple yet the film has been so well crafted I fail to see how anyone can not enjoy it. Bill and Ted are a couple of metalhead school flunks in the present day, yet through a bizarre series of events both will eventually become the inspirational 'Great Ones' that changed the human race into a peaceful utopian society...through their music. The problem is if they don't pass their history class Ted will get shipped off to military academy and this future will never happen. Enter 'Rufus' to help and assist the bumbling duo in passing their final history test/exam thing.Watching this recently I guess the main things that stand out to me are...well actually there are a lot of things that stood out and still hold up today. The visuals are great fun, sure its not as colourful as the sequel but I'm still really impressed at how good each period looks mainly. The duo travel across a few eras and I must say everything looks pretty darn good considering this was a bit of a tacky throw away teen flick. Each period is only seen briefly but it all holds up even though you might only see a single room or street. For example when they pick up Beethoven we see a really elegant 18th Century room full of aristocrats or noble folk and it looks good, believable. There's a real castle with a nice interior for 15th Century England (God knows where), a small taste of ancient Greece with pillars and statues, a section of a wild west town etc...My point is they clearly have had to stretch and struggle to create each period but full kudos to them as it all looks amazingly solid.Not everything looks that good these days of course, some of the periods are a bit thin on the ground visually eg. Napoleon's war camp, prehistoric San Dimas and Genghis Khan's tent which is obviously an easy cover for not showing anything else. But again on the plus side all the costumes look really good and the casting is really good too. I still found Terry Camilleri's subtle performance as Napoleon to be hilarious with his little French mutterings and facial expressions, he fit this role like a glove, brilliant!. All the other cast really do look good with some nice makeup work, Abe Lincoln is especially good looks and performance wise, as is Beethoven and the almost mute Socrates. Honourable mention to Al Leong as Genghis Khan. Despite the age and silliness of this film I have no issues with any of the historical elements really. I'm just amazed it does look as good as it does because we all know how shitty these things can look with less care.I mean apart from the joyous adventure there is so much to praise here. The soundtrack is awesome, pure awesomeness, yeah its totally 80's of course but if you like 80's tunage then you'll love this selection. There are some truly electric sequences which are bitchin' simply down to the musical track that accompanies them. Add to that the full on retro vibe going on here, I just love every minute of it, the sneakers, cars, tunes, technology, clothes etc...there is one scene where Billy the Kid and Socrates try to chat up these two girls in the mall. Oh my these girls are visually the epitome of the 80's, not that that's a surprise of course but little things like this brings the memories flooding back and really helped me enjoy the film. Oh and my God one of them is super cute!.Admittedly the film does take a bit of a dive as you near the end. The whole history test thing they gotta take always did seem evil to me, what kind of high school test involves standing in front of an entire hall full of students and giving a lecture on history?! Jesus!. And lets be honest here, the presentation Bill and Ted give is pretty nondescript really, it is essentially a bunch of people giving them a pat on the back, its more of a magic show. There are bits I could pick at throughout the film like the fact they somehow manage to squeeze so many people into one phone booth and when they drop all the famous history figures back into their own times wouldn't their new knowledge and visions of the future change history dramatically?.But lets be honest here, this film isn't anything more than a wild ride that probably wasn't expected to do much more than hit the videoshop shelves and rot (many similar teen flicks over the years did just that, 'Bio-Dome' anyone). There's a reason the franchise became a cult and that's because this first film is so damn enjoyable. The cool phone booth concept is genius, the ultra cool Rufus played by Carlin, the quirky and amusing looking 2688 future humans and of course the iconic dialog which has become a part of modern pop culture and predates the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pizza surfing spiel. A most triumphant time travel fantasy which is pretty much a hidden gem these days, full of surprises and a franchise that Keanu Reeves was actually perfectly cast for.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent comedy with quite a lot of genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an 80s classic, as far as I'm concerned in the same category as things like Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Everyone has seen it (if not HOW?) and everyone loves it, films like Real Genius too. 'Excellent Adventure is comedy at it's best; entertaining, funny, cleverly written and stands the test of time as good clean fun. It's great to watch over twenty years later, and still surprises whilst feeling warm, fuzzy and totally familiar. The premise is simple; two slacker kids with big ambitions get some help from the future where their simple rock band have brought harmony and peace to the world, ended poverty and seen in a Utopian age. It's silly really and na?ve in many ways but the writing is most certainly not. It's like Innerspace, funny, daft and if you pay attention you might actually learn something (pulmonary alveoli came up in my Biology A-level so a quote from Innerspace was quite useful by way of revision) and if you know something already some of the jokes in BATEA are actually quite brilliant - watch Freud's corn dog in the Mall ;-) The script is brilliant, with some great and memorable one-liners, it's family fun, relatively clean and innocuous (quite rare these days), and whilst the main characters are supposed to be slacker idiots, they are actually quite profound and are fairly good role models! Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves play the lead roles (Bill and Ted respectively) and clearly had a LOT of fun making this film (ditto the historical figures) and the chemistry between them was excellent - apparently they were/are friends in real life. They look like they are having fun, the characters had fun and the viewer has fun. It's a popcorn movie, and what films should be about; feel good and uplifting. It's a joy. Their facial expressions and physical comedy are so enjoyable; Reeves especially (more well known now) is just fabulous to watch, and makes me smile all the way through the film. George Carlin is great, and I particularly like the actors who play Napoleon, Freud and Socrates. The SFX whilst a little simple are good and do the job, and haven't dated that much (a bit), and the music/soundtrack is worth an honourable mention.It's not perfect but then neither is life, and at least this tries to make life a little bit better by existing. "Be excellent to each other," is a good maxim, and the moral behind this film is as bodacious and relevant today as it was in the 80s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is very well written! The way Bill and Ted time travel and meet themselves is done brilliantly! I love it when stories come full circle like that! It also shows that Keanu Reeves could act at some point in his career, even if he seems almost robotic now! There were a couple of deus ex machina moments, like the tape recorder, but...it's a travel travel movie! There's no bigger deus ex machina than a time traveling phone booth! The movie is not meant to be taken seriously. It's a late 80's popcorn flick through and through! It has some foul language from Napoleon, so it's probably considered PG-13 now days. Overall, don't take it as historically accurate in ANY sense! It's a comedy, not a history lesson! Sit back and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit weak...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been a really good one when it first came out, maybe even great. But lack of development and not enough clever ideas make this one a passable duo adventure flick. I can sort of see why this movie was a hit when it came out but watching it now, it's just has quite a bit of flaws. The plot is basically about Bill(Alex Winter) and Ted(Keanu Reeves) who are in a garage band. They are both basically airheads that likes to air guitar. And because of certain circumstances they get a phone booth time machine and travel around collecting historical figures so they can pass their history class. But the thing is there just isn't much historical elements in this film. And just show very slight glimpses of the past while kidnapping historical figures. Sure it slightly humorous watching how the historical figures cope with being in 1989. But there is nothing to know about the historical figures in this flick and nothing really to adventure about in each of the time period Bill and Ted visits. There isn't anything clever about the execution as well. Bill and Ted are a likable duo but this adventure just seemed weak despite the time travel thing going on. Also Keanu's role in this stayed stuck on him throughout his career...Fortunate or unfortunate that maybe.5.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe because of nostalgia reasons, "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" remains as one of my favourite bodacious comedies. It mixes creative time-travel shenanigans (love the cheesy computer effects) with enthusiastic slacker humour leaving no pretensions. Light-hearted and quite juvenile, but infectiously amusing with many quotable dialogues and very fitting performances by duo Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter as two slacker teenagers Bill and Ted who are more concerned forming their rock band, The Wyld Stallyns that they're flunking history big time. Now they must pass their final history report with an A+. As Ted's dad (played sternly by Hal Landon Jr.) threatens to send him to military school meaning the end of the band. However their guardian angel from the future, Rufus (the laid-back George Carlin) turns up with a time- travelling phone booth to help them ace their report by heading into the past to actually learn from history's influential figures. The support cast do shape up nicely in their iconic depictions; Terry Gamilleri (the pick of the lot as Napoleon), Dan Shor, Tony Steedman, Jane Wiedlin, Clifford David, Rober V. Barron, Al Leong and Rod Loomis. Also showing up is Bernie Casey as the history teacher. Its one-idea gimmick keeps in character and crafts out some enjoyable, goofy interactions of the iconic figures adapting to modern times. But in all it's the energetic chemistry of Reeves and Winter that make it a complete blast, duuuude. "Gentlemen, I'm here to help you with your history report".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Ted' Theodore Logan and Bill S. Preston are two high school students in San Dimas, California and they are about to flunk history... all they know is that Napoleon was a 'short dead dude' and Joan of Arc was 'Noah's wife'! This shouldn't be a problem for anybody but them but as future society is destined to be based on their music it is essential that they pass their history presentation with an A+ grade... if they don't Ted will go to military school, the band won't form and the future is doomed! To ensure they succeed Rufus returns from the distant future with a time machine so they can learn about history by visiting it. This is a good idea but Bill and Ted come up with a better one; why not bring back real historical figures to give their presentation for them! They come up with the idea after accidentally bringing Napoleon back to the present; they then embark on an excellent adventure that will see them bringing back Genghis Khan, Billy the Kid, Beethoven, Socrates and Joan of Arc amongst others. While travelling they will have run-ins with some dangerous characters and when they return the historical figures will have a lot of fun visiting the mall before giving a presentation nobody will forget!This '80s comedy may be pretty dumb but it is a lot of fun. Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are just right as unlikely heroes Bill and Ted. The way they jump around through history does make it fairly episodic; a few minutes here, a few minutes there... in fact things are best when the action is in the present; Napoleon at the water park was funny and there were some genuinely laugh out loud moments when the various historical figures go to the mall... what Genghis Khan did in the sports shop was hilarious. The rest of the cast do well enough with their roles although they are playing amusing caricatures rather than real characters with the exception of George Carlin's character Rufus. The special effects are pretty ropey even by the standards of the day but that just adds to the films low budget charm. If you want a good laugh with little to offend then you could do a lot worse than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always love time travel stories because there are just so many things you can do let alone ways to have fun with. It's true that the only weakness these stories have is in the inconsistencies but personally I never cared and nor does this movie because it's doesn't care about being logical but simply having a wild ride.This film is one of my personal favorite comedies, I've seen this when I was a child and I still love it now. I was drawn in because this film had two of the many things I love in life, Rock n, Roll and Time Travel, both mixed together and made a tasty combo. On one hand you could say the film has a lesson on how people are always capable of becoming something great and making history. But on the other hand this film is just plain stupid fun but done right. The effects and production value is good and so is the music.I love their time machine, yeah I know a phone booth seems kinda stupid (let alone dated) but trust me the way it works will make you a believer. It cool because it's a non clich time travel device which is something I rarely see only other time travel that uses a phone booth is "Doctor Who". The film sort of have a bit of that wish fulfillment quality, just simply wanting to meet and take with you any historical figure you want, for them to be your friends and have a good time with you; one I'd love to bring would be Bruce Lee. The historical figures don't disappoint there all really just exaggerations of the persona's which make them funny, my favorite is Gengus Khan he's sort of reminds of cartoon characters "Tazmanian Devil" or "Captain Caveman" since both characters don't really talk much or at all and justly simply let loose when they feel like it.There is also this concept which is both fascinating and ridiculous at the same time, this of course is the infamous Time Game where if you say you'll go back in time and get or do this then it will appear or become possible in the present, it's pretty much the concept of being one step ahead. If I say I want to go back in time and I bring Keira Knightly to come at a certain spot and a certain time to help me out of a jam, then that would happen. Yeah, I know ridiculous but that the point which makes it all the more hilarious.But of course what really drives the film are Bill and Ted themselves (played excellently by Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves) I love the buddy buddy chemistry between them there's good back and forth. Both are practically one character since both have the same persona, they're both actually smart if not geniuses (then again how many really can be), talk in sort of surfer tone. But what makes them all the more fun is that their naivety, both are fans of heavy metal and rock n' roll but most of all how both of them have an ambition of being a great rock band and are trying to make it a reality. That I can emphasize with because the thought of being a rock star one time crossed my mind when I was a child and I'm a fan of rock n' roll and heavy metal music. Both just have dialog that is fraking hilarious, the things they say are deliciously fun and bad that you'll both groan and laugh at the same time. And most importantly it's just plain fun seeing two unlikely and slightly clueless travelers just have fun with both the historical figures and the decades they come from, likewise for the figures that come to our present. One favorite scene of mine is when both are in knight armor and are playing "Star Wars", just like that movie itself those reference jokes never get old.So just turn your brains of and dial in for an excellent ride.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still excellent after all of these years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had some reservations about showing Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure to my kids and their friends, not because of the content, which barring a rude subtitle is strictly PG, but because I feared that it might have dated really badly (I hadn't seen it for many years and I didn't want my kids laughing for all the wrong reasons). I needn't have worried: although the film is unmistakably a product of the late 80s, with some truly heinous fashion choices on display (Alex Winter's cropped top is most egregious!), its unprecedented sense of fun and silliness ensured that everyone had a most triumphant time.Bill &amp; Ted, as played by Alex Winter (from The Lost Boys) and a young Keanu Reeves, are a pair of likable dolts from San Dimas who are destined to become the saviours of humanity, but only if they pass their imminent oral history report with flying colours. To help ensure their success, the pair are provided with a time-travelling phone-booth by cool-dude-from-the-future Rufus (George Carlin). This set up allows for loads of bodacious time-travel chaos, with the duo bouncing through the ages, collecting famous historical figures along the way.Obviously, this all sounds extremely daft, and many might quickly dismiss it as worthless, brainless nonsense, but the script by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon is surprisingly astute, with lots of ingenious parodoxical moments to boggle the mind, plenty of clever historical jokes (I love Bill and Ted materialising in front of Joan of Arc like a vision), and even a totally cool message: be excellent to each other (and party on dudes!). All this plus Genghis Khan (played by everyone's favourite mustachioed character actor Al Leong) cleaning a toilet, Napolean experiencing the joy of water flumes, the lovely Diane Franklin as an English princess babe, and some early classic examples of Reeves' trademark 'Whoa!'. What else can I say but 'Excellent!'.</fullReview>

I think the best scene is the Waterloo trip, because it was filmed in Phoenix.I'm usually not one for old movies, because movies rarely age like wine.

I also enjoy how they have Joan Of Arc be the leader of a exercise group. Another thing is the friendship that they share is perfectly done and the jokes were hilarious. It was funny that George Carlin,a man known for being a cussing comedian, stayed very quiet. And anyways overall the movie was "Excellent" and it even got me hooked on the animated series that you can find on hulu.com Well, Be excellent to each other and party on Dudes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A most bodacious film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find that IMDb's scores out of 10 are usually reasonably sensible and accurate, however, for Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure I couldn't understand why it was so low! The film starts with Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) on the verge of failure in their history class and flunking out of school. Ted will be forced to go to military school if they do fail and the only thing that can save them is the deliverance of a most bodacious history project the following day. In the midst of their hurried studying a strange, cool looking dude called Rufus gives them a time machine, in the shape of a 1960s phonebox, and tells them to use it to travel back in time and gather various historical figures in order to complete their project for the next day. What ensues is a film of pure wonder and joy. Various historical characters such as Socrates (or so-crates), Joan of Arc and Genghis Kahn are picked up along the way and throughout the film Reeves and Winter are superb in their enthusiastic portrayal of the very teenage, very boneheaded Bill and Ted. A lot of people seem to damn this film for not being funny but I found it hilarious. There aren't any cheap or childish jokes, in fact quite of a lot of it is extremely well written and very witty.Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, the writers of the film, have said that the characters of Bill and Ted came from an idiolised version of their friendship, Chris and Ed = Bill and Ted. Given this you shouldn't go into the film expecting cinematic brilliance but rather a lot of fun, some good laughs and both a mocking and realisation of teenage dreams. Don't expect to have your heart strings pulled,your rage barrier smashed or you're life changed; just let yourself be taken on a most excellent, most bodacious and most unprecedented adventure and have fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a testament to the entertainment value of this incredibly engaging time capsule movie that it continues to be very funny over 20 years later. It's a time travel comedy with an inventive gimmick: the title characters, two of the most definitive slacker dude archetypes in the business, along with Sean Penn's Spicoli from "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", seem destined to flunk their history course, but thanks to the intervention of Rufus (legendary comedian George Carlin), they get some much needed help: a phone booth that allows them to access places and times in history, and collect a wide assortment of history making individuals. This allows for some truly side splitting fish out of water material. Stars Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are extremely well cast and work well together as the inseparable Ted "Theodore" Logan and Bill S. Preston, Esquire, who are determined to see their rock band Wyld Stallyns become a reality - with or without Eddie Van Halen. The movie is breezy, snappy stuff with some utterly hilarious moments, with the memorable Terry Camilleri as Napoleon completely stealing the show with his hammy performance - whether he's pitching a fit at a bowling alley, hogging the slides at a water slide park (appropriately named Waterloo), or greedily gulping down ice cream. The rest of the actors playing the historical figures are all funny, too, including Dan Shor as Billy the Kid, Tony Steedman as Socrates, Rod Loomis as Sigmund Freud, Jane Wiedlin (of rock band The Go-Gos) as Joan of Arc, Al Leong as Genghis Khan, Clifford David as Beethoven, and Robert V. Barron as a smiling Abraham Lincoln. Whether it's Billy and Socrates trying to pick up girls, Freud trying to analyze a detective interviewing him, Joan of Arc taking over an aerobics class, or Genghis Khan raising Hell in a sporting goods store, the antics in the final third get pretty hysterical. Hal Landon, Jr., as Ted's ticked off dad and Bernie Casey as teacher Mr. Ryan are good in support; 80's babe Diane Franklin has a small role as one of the princesses, screenwriters Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon have cameos as the ultra annoying waiters, and real life music industry celebrities Clarence Clemons of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, Martha Davis of The Motels, and Fee Waybill of The Tubes make cameo appearances as well. And how many of us guys would have been happy to have a gal like Missy...I mean Mom...in our house? The soundtrack is pretty cool, and 22 years later, this movie is overall just too upbeat, likably silly, and clever to resist at all. Followed by the sequel "Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey" two years later, and two short lived TV series, one live action and one animated. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another of my favourite movies. Most people seem to consider this movie stupid, but I think that it is just great. In some cases this movie is having a little fun with Doctor Who, namely by stealing the telephone version of the time machine, but where Doctor Who's Tardis has been permanently fixed in place as a police box, this time machine was designed as a phone box and operates like a phone box right down to the please dial again message when they try to go to a time that is not connected.Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are inseparable airheads whose dreams are about to be shattered when they are informed that they will flunk history if they do not come up with a good presentation in 24 hours and if they flunk history then Ted will be sent to Alaska. Bill and Ted have visions of becoming great rock and roll stars, but can't play one musical note, though this is not going to stop them, but this problem is dealt with in Bogus Journey, we are just told that they do get better.Bill and Ted, destined to flunk, are saved when an man from the future comes along and lends them his time machine. Sounds pretty silly, but the reason this happens is because if the fail, they don't form the band, and if they don't form the band then civilisation will collapse. As their history presentation must be impressive, they decide to go back in time and collect figures of historical significance, and then take them on a tour of the home town, San Demas, and then take them to the high school and have them tell every body, on a very flashy sort of way, what they thought.The way Bill and Ted act is quite amusing, they come across more like wide eyed tourists not realising the danger that they might be in. They wonder through a medieval castle and decide to have a sword fight, even though they will be treated as spies and killed. In the wild west they stuff up a poker game for Billy the Kid and almost get lynched, yet they still come out like tourists. They kidnap Abraham Lincoln and Sigmund Fraud, Ted charms Joan of Arc into coming with him, and lure Gengis Kahn away from his harem with a Twinkie.This movie lacks intellectual depth, but in my opinion it doesn't need it. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is just one excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter star in this goofy comedy in which history gets rewritten for a history project. There are just some things that work in this movie and some things that don't. For example, at one point in the movie we are supposed to believe that Ted dies while they are in a medieval castle. However this is hard to believe because we saw them in a previous scene talking to their future selves. The film starts to come up with some real insight near the end when they have gathered all of the historical figures for their presentation. Bill and Ted learn how to plan ahead of time using time travel after the presentation to put the keys behind a sign they remember."Be excellent to each other!"</fullReview>

To be honest, they weren't all that keen initially, but once the movie got going, they really got into it. Best thing about this movie, apart from being totally awesome and ridiculously funny, is that it has a really positive message: "Be excellent to everybody" and "Part on, Dudes!" But honestly, my kids really enjoyed the movie, and I had the chance to relive my own enjoyment of Bill and Ted through their eyes. Tomorrow night: Bogus Journey time!

		<fullReview>Poor old Keanu comes in for some stick, but Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure (or BATEA as I shall refer to it from here onwards) showed that he had a distinct propensity for understated exaggeration - that might sound like a contradiction in terms, but both Bill and Ted are very subtly pitched at a level just on the wrong side of accuracy.The idea is brilliant, and the time travelling misadventures of the empty-headed pair are inspired. The script is immensely strong (both story and dialogue - how often I see films full of resources and potential which fail dismally because they don't have a script worth a dime koff koff Sucker Punch). As well as the central conceit of the two slackers and their history project problem, there are some inspired elements arising from both the time travel conceit (Bill fooling himself with the fingers) and the time travelling guests (who can fail to be tickled by Napoleon in the water park or Beethoven delighting in the wonders of electronic instrumentation).Plus there is a moral, and George Carlin. Huge fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever Teen Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only been able to catch snatches of this comedy so, though I know the essentials of the plot, I don't know how it ended. Presumably in a triumph for Bill, Alex Winter, and Ted, Keanu Reeves. Just a few comments.One is that the writing and the performances are concordant. Winter and Reeves both play their characters -- high schoolers in search of material for a term paper -- with open-mouthed stupidity. They're both pretty good too. There's hardly a second that they take seriously.Another is that the writing matches the plumbless depths of the characters' ignorance. Sigmund Freud becomes "Frood," for instance, and Beethoven becomes "Beat-Oven" and Socrates turns into "Sew" and "Crates." They think "Thekid" is Billy the Kid's last name, as in "Mister Thekid." A third observation is that, amusing as the story can be, it's a pastiche, not as original as it thinks. The two characters, to whom everyone is "Dude" (pronounced "Dewd"), are clearly derived from Sean Penn's character, Jeff Spicoli, in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," which appeared -- and became a hit -- seven years earlier. Winter even resembles Sean Penn. The movie also borrows the time travel device from "Back to the Future" and its sequels, which began to appear -- to great commercial success -- four years earlier.This film itself was sufficiently successful to generate its own sequel -- "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey". "Back to the Future" had two sequels. And that's not to mention the several television series and merchandising.I laughed frequently while watching this thing. It raised an interesting question though: How stupid can you get? I mean, not just Bill and Ted but Hollywood and its MBAs. Is there some meaning to Bill and Ted's life other than facile self gratification? Is there any meaning in Hollywood other than a huge number preceded by a dollar sign? Has the well of imagination dried up? Is there anything at all left in it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words to live by, uttered by the Great Emancipator in one of the '80's best comedies.Before Beevis &amp; Buuthead, or Dumb and Dumber etc., Bill and Ted get tapped by a hip but odd stranger (George Carlin), who instructs them their mission to bring peace and joy to the world begins with a single step into a phone booth (anybody remember those?). Anyway, they have a science project to turn in, and the booth is a Dr. Who style time machine. They go on a trek through history, encountering everyone from Joan of Arc to Gengis Khan, and present one of the most awesome excellent rad science project reports of all time (pardon the pun). Speaking of puns and one-liners that became classic '80's jargon, this movie has a great supply of 'em. Way. The movie is a lot of fun, has a great plot, and the cast have expert comedic timing.Will the world be safe for most excellent new music? Way or no way? Only "So-Krates" knows for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fun, feel-good romp through modern Californian life and world history, with Keanu Reeves.I love how, unlike in most U.S. films, the heroes resolve problems in generally non-violent ways. Thus, I think it is quite a healthy film for children and teenagers to see.By the way, some may call the heroes in this film "unintelligent", but I disagree. I mean, they may not have much education, but they do manage to overcome much adversity and solve serious problems (in generally non-violent means), which shows intelligence. They also are quite good-natured - which I would say is infinitely more important and praiseworthy than book-knowledge.Perhaps the word "wisdom" is appropriate here. Like Taoist sages, Bill and Ted may not appear wise to those who think along conventional lines and don't go deeply into matters - but their good-naturedness and the way they succeed show them to be wise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" is a film I thought I wouldn't enjoy. I missed it when it was in the cinemas, when I was twenty years closer to the age of the main characters than I am now, and caught it recently when it was shown on television one Saturday afternoon. (It seems to be a standard assumption on the part of British TV executives that anyone uninterested in the sport which forms the largest part of their output on Saturday afternoons must be a lover of old films). I knew that it was primarily made for the teen market and that it concerned the adventures of two schoolboys, so I assumed that it would be horribly dated. (Nothing, after all, dates more quickly than youth culture, especially teen culture).Actually, the film is both more enjoyable and less like something from an eighties time capsule than I thought it would be. Certainly, the two leading characters speak in an outlandish slang with only a passing resemblance to Standard English, but I suspect that it would have sounded pretty outlandish even in 1989, at least in Britain where nobody, not even teenagers, ever spoke like that. A central feature of this dialect is that it takes words which normally are used only in formal contexts and uses them as colloquialisms. Thus something very good is "excellent", whereas something very bad is "egregious" or "heinous". "Bogus" also means "very bad", instead of its normal meaning of "not genuine", and any human being, especially a male one, is a "dude", pronounced "dood".William "Bill" Preston and Theodore "Ted" Logan are two teenagers from San Dimas, California. (In keeping with hallowed Hollywood tradition, they are played by actors in their mid twenties). Their great passion is for rock music and their ambition is to found a rock band which they have provisionally named "Wyld Stallyns", even though their talent as performers is minimal. Their talent for academic work is equally minimal (as evidenced by their eccentric spelling), and they are on the verge of failing their high school history class. Ted's authoritarian father has threatened him that unless he passes history he will be sent to a military academy in Alaska.They are saved by the intervention of Rufus, a time-traveller from the future. (Rufus's time machine is designed to look like a phone booth, a detail borrowed directly from Dr Who's Tardis). It would appear that several centuries from now the music of "Wyld Stallyns" serves as the basis of an entire civilisation, so Rufus has to ensure that Bill and Ted remain together as the consequences for future history if their rock group is never founded will be too heinous to contemplate. They have the idea of using Rufus' phone booth to travel back into the past and of kidnapping various historical figures to help them with their assignment. So the likes of Napoleon Bonaparte, Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln and Socrates (whose name Bill and Ted insist on pronouncing as "So-Crates") find themselves transported forward in time to the San Dimas of 1988. In another development Bill and Ted, travelling to 15th Century England, fall in love with the King's daughters Princess Elizabeth and Princess Joanna (not actual historical figures).We see the reactions of the historical characters to the California of the late eighties. Thus Napoleon discovers the delights of ice cream and water slides (which play a large part in the film, largely because San Dimas is famous for its water theme park), Joan of Arc (who Bill and Ted discover is not married to Noah, as they had previously thought) joins an aerobics group and Ludwig van Beethoven becomes a fan of rock music. The real Beethoven was of course deaf, but this is not a film which places a premium on historical accuracy. I thought, in fact, that more humour could have been derived from the contrast between modern life and life in the past, but this opportunity was missed, possibly because the film was originally aimed at those with a knowledge of history that was only slightly greater than that of Bill and Ted.Nevertheless, the film is generally an amusing and entertaining one; Keanu Reeves (who has since gone on to become a big Hollywood name) and Alex Winter (who hasn't) make an appealing pair of heroes. Certainly, "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" is just so much frothy nonsense, but even nonsense can sometimes be enjoyable. Not, perhaps, quite excellent, but certainly not egregious. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two teenage "dudes" living in California in the 80s go back in time to avoid flunking history: that's the kind of plot that may not make for a great movie, but will certainly charm you. Bill and Ted are total metal head idiots and when placed in the scholarly context of history, this blatant contradiction is at the least amusing. "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" sort of makes short order of its time travel concept, moving so quickly that the premise never has time to fully cook and so neither do the characters, but the fast-paced teenage mischief humor works in its own way for this movie to be enjoyable.When Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are on the verge of failing history, we learn that if Ted fails, he flunks out of school and his father will ship him to military school. As a result, he and Bill won't be able to pursue their dreams of forming their own metal band called Wild Stallyns. That's when they get a visit from Rufus (George Carlin) of the future, where apparently Bill and Ted are worshipped. Since the future depends on Bill and Ted staying together, Rufus provides them a time-traveling phone booth to complete their report.The boys travel quickly through time, treating everyone from the ancient Greeks to the medieval Englishmen like 80s surfer dudes. While they're not met with open arms wherever they go exactly, no one seems to notice their 80s duds and poor English. The historical figures that they capture don't exactly seem too alarmed that they're being jammed in a phone booth either. "Bill and Ted" prides itself on everybody being stupid, I guess, but with that in mind one begins to appreciate the shenanigans for the absurdity they are. I mean, Napoleon going bowling and cursing in French, followed by getting kicked out by some middle-aged white dude, is funny in its own way.Bill and Ted aren't totally lovable characters, but their naivety makes it hard to dislike them for their dumb behavior. Neither is a particularly good actor (even though that didn't seem to stop Keanu Reeves from finding future work) and their 80s lingo and jokes are pretty hit or miss with the more subtle, intelligent jokes that you have to listen for to pick up on registering the highest marks. The other good parts of the film come toward the end with how the historical figures react to the 80s."Bill and Ted" is a good movie for tweens and those who have some sort of nostalgic connection to the 80s, everyone else will find it amusing and likable comedic material, but nothing much beyond that considering it doesn't make much of an effort to do so. Slackers are as slackers do.</fullReview>

When an mysterious man (The late George Carlin) comes to help these slackers to pass their history exam by meeting historical figures like Abraham Lincoln, Joan De Arc, Billy the Kid and others to help come to understand History. But Bill and Ted didn't realized picking up people, they learned from their history class could be so hard.Directed by Stephen Herek (Critters, Mr Holland's Opus, 101 Dalmatians) made an lively entertaining comedy fantasy with two extremely likable performances by Reeves and Winter. Originally made in 1987, when Dino De Laurentiis' company titled "DEG" went bankrupt... when the movie was made. But it was bought by Orion/Nelson Entertainment in 1988 to be released in the winter of 1989. Which this movie turned into a surprise box office hit. It also spawned a sequel and a short-lived TV animated series. "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" and the sequel "Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey" went on to be cult favorites, especially when it is played on TV. It's been two decades, since the original is been out. This is certainly one of the remembered high concept comedies for teens in the late 1980's. If you haven't seen it, it is worth watching.

		<fullReview>Here's one that most people seem to love unconditionally, and I can see why. It loosely makes fun of movies like Back to the Future and other 80s movies with its silly characters and obsession with rock music, the settings are cool, the plot is...creative, and most of all...THE HISTORICAL FIGURES! Best part of the movie, seriously. All of them were insanely enjoyable (so much that you forget that Bill and Ted themselves are so boring most of the time). Joan of Arc was a cutie, Abe was damn cool, Genghis Khan, Freud, Beethoven, Socrates and Napoleon were all hilarious and the whole package makes for a hilarious joy ride that you will never forget.With that said, most of the writing in this is pretty damn bad, and George Carlin stands out, as much as I hate to say this, as an exceptionally lackluster actor, with his ending monologue being perhaps the most cringe-worthy scene, right next to the beginning of the "Wild West" segment for pure inanity.Still, good stuff, very fun and silly.

		<fullReview>There are corners where the film seems dated or shows off its less-than-impressive budget. These are swept aside by its effervescent good humour. A collision between a stoner movie and a high school yarn, this film's greatest assets are the titular principals - and a quirky, restless script.Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves (Bill and Ted respectively) need to finish their history assignment or their band is going to become part of it. Up steps the cool yoof-sprecher Rufus giving them the opportunity to visit the history they're trying to learn in a phone box. Naturally he has an ulterior motive and, naturally x 2, Bill and Ted's adventure may well be excellent but that's largely as it's not entirely smooth...Although it's following in the mighty footsteps of Back To The Future, Bill &amp; Ted still manages clever, time-bending gags and plot twists which don't seem contrived. In fact, it was sufficiently well-received to coin any number of one-liners and idioms and spawn a sequel. Such is the history of the cult movie in general. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two heavy metallers jamming they're way through time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll bet when screenwriters Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson pitched Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure to the studios it raised quite a few eyebrows. The very idea of two teenage wannabe rockers hurtling through history in a time travelling phone box must have sounded off the wall. But you can never really gauge people's tastes. Or what they will buy into. And quite unexpectedly, Bill &amp; Ted went on to be one of the surprise sleeper hits of the late 80s.It may have helped that only a couple of years previously Universal had a major hit with Back to the Future, the similar story of a teen travelling through time. But Bill &amp; Ted isn't a complete ripoff. Far from it. Even though it has the same spirit and similar good nature about it, it is quite a different film.The film begins far into our distant future. 2688 to be precise. The world has become a Utopian society through two young men, Bill S. Preston Esq (Alex Winters), and Ted "Theodore" Logan (Keanu Reeves). Bill &amp; Ted actually live in the late 20th Century, but their band the "Wyld Stallyns" has inspired others for generations to come.But Bill &amp; Ted have a task to accomplish before fulfilling they're destiny as saviours of the Earth. Passing History. Bill &amp; Ted are in danger of flunking ("most heinously") out of high school. If that happens, Ted will be shipped off to military school, Wyld Stallyns will never take off, and our future is history.But they have help from Rufus (George Carlin), a visitor from the future. With the aid of a time travelling phone box, Bill &amp; Ted head to different points in history, gathering historical figures from all over the world, all over time. In a last ditch effort to graduate from high school.Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure is a film that shouldn't even begin to work. And yet oddly enough it does. It's the lightness of touch director Stephen Herek brings that makes the film fly. Not to mention two "excellent" performances from Keanu Reeves and Alex Winters.They play their parts with perfectly gormless charm. They're two affable lunkheads who look and sound completely spaced out. Its easy to forget this was the beginning of Keanu Reeve's career. For all of his later success, Reeves is a terribly wooden actor, with hardly anything in the way of expressive performing. But he is absolutely perfect as Ted.Reeves has the whole heavy-metal teenspeak down pat. Its almost good acting on his part. His slow-witted monotone voice is ideally suited to that of a laidback dimwit. I think Reeves missed his true calling in life!Sadly Alex Winters' career never took off into the stratosphere the way Reeves' did. But he is just as good. He gets the lions share of all the lingo: "Bogus...heinous...non-triumphant." Reeves and Winters are so superb together. Every scene that pairs them together is a joy.The film gets a lot of its comic mileage from Bill &amp; Ted's inability to comprehend the enormity of they're endeavour. When they arrive in Mediaeval England, they assume being thrown into an iron maiden is a meeting with the band of the same name. The witty screenplay by Solomon and Matheson is full of funky amusements. And that's all before we get to the inspired second half.Once Bill &amp; Ted have returned from they're time-trip, all they're guests are unleashed on sunny California. Napoleon discovers the wonders of the water slide. Joan of Arc leads an aerobics class. Even Beethoven makes the logical leap from piano to electric keyboard.Bill &amp; Ted may be entertainment of the lowest gear. But its still entertainment. It's even unexpectedly clever at the unlikeliest of moments. Like when Bill &amp; Ted meet future versions of themselves, who have come back from the trip they're about to take.And we mustn't leave out George Carlin's Rufus. He's just as mellow and laidback as our heroes. I would have liked to have seen more of him. He's such an engaging screen presence. He quite lights up the film whenever he's around.If the film has any flaws they're only minor. The idea of a time travelling phone box is something that's been ripped off from Doctor Who, and the film perhaps glosses over some of history's darkest chapters, but nonetheless, Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure is supremely silly and good-natured. It gets by on its sheer sense of fun alone. The sequel is a polar opposite, and makes for an interesting companion piece, but its the original that rocks!Party on dudes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... This is indeed a wickedly fun ride. Just because the film's two main characters are lovable doofuses doesn't mean the comedy in the script can't have a brain, and it has lots of fun with the perceived stereotypes of a variety of historical figures. The film's premise is some form of bizarre genius, but the fact that it consistently manages to swap timezones whilst always maintaining some sense of narrative direction is an all too rare achievement for fantasy stories.Amidst all this hectic back and forth, to have it find time for throwaway running gags at all is impressive, but how funny they actually are in practice is nothing short of remarkable! My favourite is Bill's own pressing Oedipal dilemma, and the psychologically based funnies don't end there, as along the way the duo run into old Mr. Sigmund Freud himself! "How's it going, Frood-dude!", they exclaim...To conclude, I'm almost as excited over this film as Bill and Ted are about WYLD STALLYNS!!!!!!!!!!!! *triumphant air-guitar*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this as a kid, and when I saw it again, it was really good teen comedy from Stephen Herek (101 Dalmatians). William "Bill" S. Preston (Alex Winter) and Ted "Theodore" Logan (The Matrix's Keanu Reeves) are quite dumb rock guitar players making a band called Wyld Stallyns, but they won't graduate school if they fail their history presentation. But help comes in the form of new friend Rufus (comedian George Carlin, in Scary Movie 3 as architect). He lets them take a trip in his time travelling phone box in order to bring back historic figures and pass their test. As they travel through time they encounter many adventures, and bring back (accidently) Napoleon Bonapard (Terry Camilleri), Billy the Kid (Dan Shor), Greek Socrates (Tony Steedman), Dr. Sigmund Freud (Rod Loomis), Genghis Khan (Al Leong), Joan of Arc (Jane Wiedlin), Ledwig van Beethoven (Clifford David) and President Abraham Lincoln (Robet V. Barron). These people do get arrested by the police in the hilarious mall chase, but when Bill and Ted get them back they do pass their test, and have the happy ending with new guitars, and their princess babes. It was number 41 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!</fullReview>

Of course the movie is silly, but it's silly in an endearing way. The characters are extremely likable - sweet, even. The plot - in which Keanue Reeves and Alex Winter kidnap famous historical figures in order to help them create a totally awesome school report - is pleasantly goofy and laced with a number of clever time-travel loops and turns.

		<fullReview>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is the sort of silly fun with a long shelf-life that will have you grinning throughout the movie. This gentle but hip story of two goofy kids who get involved in an intersection of time travel and guitar riffs is by no means great art, nor is it a completely accurate time encapsulation of the late 1980's. It is fun and funny with only a few bad words and sexual innuendo ("Shut up, Ted!) thrown in to give it a PG.BTEA works well because of its deft performances, its tight plotting, and the fact that it is about as consequential as the tasty glop in the middle of a Twinkie. Come to think of it, because of its strengths, this movie will probably be putting smiles on viewer's faces right about the time a 1989 Twinkie finally starts to go bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill and Ted's Adventure is one of my top 5 all time favorite movies hands down (the sequels on that list too of course). Focusing only on their band Wllyd Stallions, Bill and Ted are in close danger of failing their history class and not graduating high school which has dire consequences for both. In comes, George Carlin who plays Rufus from the future who take Bill and Ted on their excellent adventure back in time to teach them first-hand the history of the world. Along the way, they pick up hilarious friends including "So-Crates". The plot is absolutely out of control and down right hilarious. I'm stoked for the box set of both movies coming out soon. Sweetness. Even more awesome is the fact its coming out the same day as the FREAKED DVD, Alex Winter's other work of priceless art. You better believe, I'm a huge fan. Oh and for any Henry Rollins fans out there, he does the soundtrack to FREAKED as well. Winters really is a genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter star in this classic eighties movie. Whoa!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, George Carlin Ahhh, what a classic slice of the eighties. Really, cheesy eighties movies don't get any better than this in my opinion. And cheesy this one is. Amazingly so.So, basically, here's the story. Bill (Winter) and Ted (Reeves) are a couple of guys who have the combined intelligence of a jar of peanut butter. They aspire to start a band called Wyld Styllyns despite the fact that they don't even possess the knowledge of how to play their guitars. They talk like a couple of surfers from the late eighties, using intelligent words like "heinous," "bodacious," "excellent," "bogus," and so on. It can get a little bit annoying, but it's not like people didn't use to talk like that (scary, isn't it?).The tagline of the movie is "History is about to be re-written by two guys who can't even spell." That hits the nail pretty much right on the head. Theoretically, in the future, the music that Bill and Ted make will bring about a time of galactic peace. It unites the planets and so on and so forth, blah blah blah. But the problem is, the band will never be started if they fail their history class. Because if they fail history, they fail high school, and Ted's dad will send him off to military school in Alaska.Obviously this can't happen, so a man from the future, Rufus (Carlin), is sent back in time to aid Bill and Ted with their final history project. If they get an A+ on that project, then they will pass the class, they pass high school, and the band will be started.So how are they going to pass this history assignment? Simple. Use a time traveling phone booth that Rufus brought with him, kidnap a ton of historical figures and put them all in a big presentation.So the airhead dudes travel through time and kidnap Billy the Kid, Socrates (pronounced so-crates?), Sigmund Freud, Joan of Arc, Genghis Kahn, Abraham Lincoln, and Ludwig Von Beethoven (pronounced bee-thuv-en).It really is a weak plot, but it's so imaginative and original and ludicrous that it makes the movie worth watching. Plus the high energy horrible acting of Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter make it truly hilarious. It's a great flick.The funny thing is, I think the only thing that's changed about Keanu from then to now is that he has shorter hair now. Man still can't act.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (give it a watch)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, The acting is pretty sub par (although Keanu Reeves gives far and away his best performance, and the performance he has repeated in Speed, the Matrix etc.) However, if you like 80's films, you'll love this film. It is a teen flick, but unlike the teen films today, this one doesn't have to resort to poop jokes (Like American Pie) to be funny. In fact some of the jokes are borderline intelligent (like when Bill is talking to Sigmund Freud and say's "no thanks, I just have a minor edible complex). It's funny, it's cheezy and if you have any sense of humour and appreciation for the 1980's you'll love it. Especially when Henry VIII orders them put in the Iron Maiden. "Iron Maiden....

		<fullReview>Another great, innocent eighties teen movie about rock, hope, the future, the past, the present, babes etc. As i've said before in other reviews it makes rock fans seem dumb, these two are, but it is a comedy and wouldn't work if they weren't. The idea that the future depends on these two is not as far-fetched as you would think- who honestly thinks politics and suit wearers can save the world? Anyway, the film is simply about friendship and trying to do something worthwhile in your life, that even a high school nobody can make a difference. Hardly original ideas, but given a totally excellent twist for the genre.Bill and Ted are two typical high school losers from San Dimas. They love their rock music, dream of being in a band and meeting some radical babes. Reality states otherwise- that exams are approaching and if they fail, it's off to military school. AS they believe that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife, their prospects of passing their history final are not good. One night, hanging around the Circle K, they meet themselves-from the future, and a guy named Rufus. He tells them they must pass their exam or there will be grave consequences for the world. They must travel back in time to find historical figures to bring back for their exam, travelling in a phone booth of course. On the way the fall in love, meet many people and get into a few scrapes. Soon though, their historical figures run riot in a local mall and get arrested. Time is running out- but they have a time machine...A silly idea, but very cleverly executed, and the result is much smarter than you might expect. Keanu and Alex are both excellent in their roles, and the rest of the cast are all very good. Special mention to Terry Camilleri who is very funny as Napolean. He gets some of the best lines-'Le Glace?' and 'Idiot!' amongst others. There are many one-liners, the film creating an inane language of its own which is both repeatable and harmless. The plot does fly all over the place, but it remains easy, and deals with the concept of time-travel much like Back to the Future did. There are many references which rock fans will get, modern audiences may not understand half the film now and will no doubt see it as extremely cheesy. The dialogue and fashion may have dated to some extent, but so will all today's teen shows and movies. This however retains charm over the years, and is still cool. There are many interesting ideas here, some very funny moments, and is more original than many would admit. Good solid entertainment, executed with a unique style.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like "Dude, Where's My Car?" minus all the raunchy humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is pretty funny, but more or less only if you like the surfer-dude-not-much-goin'-on-up-there kind of humor, like in "Dude, Where's My Car?" If you don't, then you'll hate this movie. Although it was really funny that way for the first half of the movie, but frankly it was pretty boring during the part where they let the historical figures loose in the mall. At that point, there's no getting past the fact that it's out-dated and from the 80's, and really isn't funny until they start with some more time-travel jokes. The logic in this movie is so ridiculously absent in this movie that it's funny.So if you're at least a bit tolerant to stupid humor, this movie will get some laughs out of you.I rate it 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not great, but underrated clean fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is kind of a cult classic...judging from comments, people have a love/hate relationship with the film...I would have to side with the love, because even though it is not a logical film, it is not meant to be, and is just fun.As a film though, I have to say it is very detailed for a movie many people may brush off as "stupid" or "mindless." The little visual details and motifs make it competent in its direction and script (notice the stickers, gestures, dialogue parallels). However, it is a film very much made for its time period with its California syntax and references to 80's life. Noteworthy is Keanu Reeves' actual character and acting skills, which are much more apparent here than in ANY of his other films (Matrix I and II, Chain Reaction, Johnny Mneumonic, to name a few).On the surface it may not be much of a film, but for those looking to have a fun time and who are willing to see past its marketed premise, it is a deep film and a gem to all those who love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This (and the much under-rated sequel) is one of my all time favourite movies, totally goof-ball humour for sure but Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are just such a cool pairing its unbelievable, the plot follows these two about to fail History so a man from the future Rufus (George Carlin) gives them a telephone booth that can travel through time (Do I need a Doctor Who joke?) and so the two 'dudes' collect 'persons of historical significance' and use them to deliver their History report. Great mix of comedy and sci fi and while its no 'Back to the Future' who cares it is still an amazing film with some fine acting and some of the best lines of any movie ever.

It's about two high school senior dudes named Bill (Alex Winter) &amp; Ted (Keanu Reeves), that are failing history 'cause they've spent all their time trying to form a band called "Wyld Stallyns". They must get an A+ on their history report tomorrow, or they'll fail, and Ted's dad will send him to military school, and they will never start their band! Bogus!Luckily, Rufus, an old man from the future (played by George Carlin), has come to help them pass the report, because, well...it'll all make sense in the end! He gives them a phone booth/time machine, and they go back in time and meet famous historical dudes such as Billy, or "Mister" the Kid, Beeth Oven, Bob "Genghis" Khan, "Noah's wife" Joan of Arc, and many others!Will they pass their report?You'll just have to see for yourself! This movie was filmed in 1987, and released in February of 1989. It is a most triumphant film, and was followed by a sequel, a cartoon series, and a live action series. It is a must-see for everyone! So, "Be excellent to each other" and "Party on, dudes"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the story of two boys with no brains that must somehow pass History or risk flunking out of school all together. When you include a phone booth time machine and some of history's greatest people you've got one of the most original movies I have ever seen. Besides being original, this movie was actually very funny! Most movies today have to use vulgar humor and people insulting eachother non-stop (ie. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) because that is what they must think people want. Personally I would take watching Genghis Kahn destroying a sporting goods store over any of that crap in a second. Besides Genghis Kahn this movie has other greats such as Socrates (So crates), Joan of Arc, Abraham Lincoln, and many more! The reason this movie is so good is because they actually thought about the humor and figured out something that anyone who knows anything about history could appreciate. Anyone who is tired of the mildly amusing vugarity that is everywhere today should go rent this one, or buy it on DVD because it only costs as much as renting it twice at Blockbuster anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gets high marks for originality and creativity. It was also the movie that put Keanu Reeves on the map. (no pun intended.) 13 years later, phrases made famous in this film are still being used today. The title is often quoted substituting current names. NO WAY, be excellent to each other, all we are is dust in the wind, and party on dudes, are some of the catchy sayings from that film. Bill and Ted must time travel to the past and learn about history so they can pass their final exam. In the process, they bring back the actual characters from the past to present day California. Characters such as Socrates, Napoleon, and Abraham Lincoln are suddenly walking around shopping malls and bowling alleys. What makes this funny is that Bill and Ted are a couple of goof balls when it comes to school. Ted, (Keanu Reeves), cannot even pronounce the names of these characters correctly. The film is extremely funny and both Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are actually believable doing their goof ball routine. I only wish the film could have devoted a little more time to the historical characters wandering around in present day California. The film portrays that laid back suburban airhead stereotype pretty well when the historical characters introduce themselves to the locals. At one point, Bill's mom, when introduced to the likes of Socrates and Abraham Lincoln, says `nice to meet you;' as if they were just other ordinary people. The bottom line, if you like history, you will love this movie. In general, I do not care for comedy films where the plot is ridiculous, but credit goes to both the actors and the writers in this film to make someone like myself enjoy it.</fullReview>

Two airheads with punk-Californian voices, who have a band, and go on Excellent Adventures with babes, despite their total lack of intellect. Bill &amp; Ted are two 18 year-olds, who are about to flunk San Dimas High, unless they get an A+ on their oral report, and Rufus (George Carlin) from the year 2688, gives them a time machine to fetch such dudes as Joan of Arc, Abe Lincoln, Sigmund Freud, Betthovem, and others.Ted is the funniest on the show (Like Wayne)he acts dumber than his friend, can annoy him at times, is never alert, and lacks common sense. One of the funniest parts of the film is that Bill's stepmom who's only a few years older than him is so delirious. When Bill &amp; Ted arrive with their historical figures Bill introduces them as, Dave Beefoven, Bob Gengiskhan, Herman the Kid(Billy THe Kid), Dennis Freud, and her mom doesn't notice. She thinks it's normal for two teenagers to bring middle aged people in robes, and suites, and a guy who looks like an ape man to say, "mom can you take us to the mall".The two of them trave lto medeavil England, and propose to two princeses, Joanna and Elizabeth, saying, "Oh beautiful babes of England, will you go to the prom with us in San Dimas?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time travel movies are always fraught with logical glitches, usually with the excuse of "plot device." The lone exception is "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure." As we watch these two, nearly illiterate delinquents blunder through history, the logic of the film remains constant and above reproach. But more importantly, it's a rip-roaring good time. From the opening, air-guitar-shredding scene to the closing speech by Abraham Lincoln, this film never misses. You can see it as a lesson in self-determination or an irreverent romp through history. But however you see it, pop some popcorn, get your two-litre bottle of Coke ready, sit back and enjoy. This is, by far, the most excellent time-travel movie, ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie when I was a kid and now, at the ripe old age of nineteen, I still laugh out loud when I watch this movie. Bill and Ted were my heroes, thick as tree-stumps but still managing to coast through life smoothly and with minimal effort. The plot involves the pair travelling back through time gathering famous historical figures for their end-of-year history report, in an attempt to save themselves from flunking. They are aided by Rufus, who supplies them with their time-travelling phone box, (reference to Doctor Who anyone?), and watches over them to make sure they don't screw it up. It is almost impossible not to enjoy this movie. Bill and Ted are simple guys whose only main concern is when Megadeth's next album is coming out, who are suddenly pushed into a position of great importance. No matter what age you happen to be, rent out this movie. Watch it with your kids if it makes you feel less silly, I guarantee you'll enjoy it just as much as they will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems like every critic out there compared "Dude, Where's My Car?" to "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure". "Bill..." was on last night, and at first I was apprehensive about seeing it since I didn't know if it would be that funny. Some reviewers had been degrading of it, after all.But when I watched this 1989 movie, I loved it! About the only thing that it has in common with "Dude" is that the characters in both movies are dimwitted guys who speak in slang ("That was most excellent, dude!")If you haven't seen "Bill", the following is a spoiler, although the ending is pretty obvious anyway:Two dudes named Bill and Ted are gonna fail history. One of them will be sent to military school if he does. A guy comes in a phone booth and tells them they can go anywhere in time so they can meet people and pass. They travel through time and, of course, have many mishaps. They get Billy the Kid, Socrates ("Hey, Soe-crates, man!"), Freud ("Come on, Frood, dude"), Joan of Arc, Genghis Khan, Abraham Lincoln, Napoleon, and Beethoven to come to the future with them, and end up making a really great history presentation.I found the movie hilarious, even though I usually don't like 80's movies - don't ask me why. The scenes with the "famous dudes" getting into trouble in the mall, with Freud ruining Billy the Kid and Socrates' chance at dates, Beethoven jamming, Joan of Arc teaching an exercise class and Genghis Khan destroying a sporting equipments store, was hilarious, as was Napoleon's EXCELLENT time at the water park.Yes, the logistics of it would not work, but this is such a fun, feel-good movie that I didn't care. I give this movie a ***** out of a chance of five stars.My favorite quotes?Police Psychiatrist: I don't know why you claim to be Sigmund Freud.Sigmund Freud: Why do you claim I'm not Sigmund Freud?Police Psychiatrist: Why do you keep asking me these questions?Sigmund Freud: Tell me about your mother.As well as Abraham Lincoln's yell, "Be excellent to each other...and party on, dudes!"After watching this movie, I couldn't stop saying "Excellent" and "Party on" for hours. :-)</fullReview>

It's a sad state in England when there's more exposure to the Worlds most significant historical figures in one 90 minute American film than you get in 20 years of education here. Even allowing for the inaccuracies &amp; toning down of Billy &amp; Genghis it still teaches you more, infact even acknowledging these figures existed &amp; when they lived is more than most TV does and most viewers sadly know.I wouldn't actually call this a funny film, ie laughing out loud. That seems to be the one reason people have for disliking it. It's highly enjoyable &amp; a highly amusing film. People sadly see it described as that and stupidly expect it to be a Leslie Nielson type film.Only Back to the Future has made time travel as enjoyable. It just baffles me what anyone can dislike about the story here, your mind can wander off for hours during and after, and every character is loveable and brilliantly written into the story.A rating way below what it deserves and pure entertainment &amp; education for all ages.10/10</fullReview>

"Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" is one of my favorites. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* In this film two teens, Bill Preston Esquire, (Or something.) and Ted Theadore Logan are a two person band called "Wyld Stylnns". They soon find out that they are failing history class, and have to get a passing grade on the upcoming presentation in order to pass history. From the future, a man named Rufus comes to their time. He tells them that their band will be VERY succesful. But if they do not pass history, the world would be doomed. Using a time machine phone booth, they go back in time and pick up historical figures like Billy the Kid and "So-Crates". They also get to pick up some "Bodacious Babes" saving them from "Royal Ugly Dudes".This movie is a great comdey to watch again and again. I can't believe I didnt see it sooner.</fullReview>

But when both are failing history class, and Bill's dad is threatining to send him to military school, which would end all hopes for the band, they both decide they need to pass the last project of the semester. So when a totally disturbing dude named Rufus comes down to them in a convinent store parking lot (Bill got kicked out of his room), he brings them a time-traveling telephone booth. Bill &amp; Ted see themselves in the future come out of the booth and future dudes tell present Bill&amp; Ted to go back in time. They do find this strange, but then they come across the point of "Why would we lie to ourselves?" Then they go back in time to fetch history greats to pass their project.The hilarious parts of the movie are like when they lure Ghangus Khan into the telephone booth with a twinkie. Or when they refer to Napolean as a "short,dead dude". Or how the knock on the door of the white house to get Abe Lincoln and say "Candygram". Bill&amp;Ted's Excellent Adventure is a hilarious comedy that never fails to make you laugh, no matter how many times you see it. I gave it a 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You haven't seen a movie, until you've seen "Bill and Ted"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can I describe "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"? First ofall, it's a blast to watch. And why shouldn't it be? It's got all themakings of a good movie. The characters are well thought out andwell developed, settings fit the storyline, dialogue is wellconformed, everything seems to work for Bill and Ted.The idea of time travel is something that Hollywood has toyed withfor years on end. Probably the most famous films about this werethe "Back to the Future" movies. I feel that "Bill and Ted's ExcellentAdventure" deserves more credit when it comes to this. Sure, acar is a real way to travel, but a phone booth is something that isn'tseen very much these days, and why not get the most out of them! Most adults do not like this movie, but why? I mean, after all,there's plenty of nutty stuff going on, but these guys still need to getan A on their History report or they're finished. Bottom line is, this is a well balanced film. It was made for teensand it's easy to see why. Nevertheless, why focus on that? Enjoythe way these two make their way through time and beat the oddsto not only get the grade, the girls, and their well deserved respect,but enjoy watching them have a blast doing it. Then, you'll wannaparty on, dude!!</fullReview>

Yes, Schindler's List was good, as was American History X, but really...when it comes to movies that touch you, that MOVE you...can any movie really compete with this one? I think not. This masterpiece is unmatched as it is flawless in every element. Out of a possible ten stars, I give it FOURTEEN! Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie, which is weird cause its about a duo of nitwits. Normally nitwits are frustrating and overly obnoxious, but Bill and Ted are not. They cleverly get help with their History exam from Rufus, played by George Carlin, who arranges for them to be able to time travel. They get the idea to bring back some of history's greatest leaders to San Dimas, California, for their exam. Along the way, they encounter some 'beautiful babes', Socrates (which they pronounce 'So crates') and Beethoven (which they pronounce 'Bee Thoven').Winning story, acting and it actually is a little touching at the end, when Abraham Lincoln speaks. Nice going, dudes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I laughed harder at "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" than at any other movie I have ever seen in my life! This movie is everything a good comedy should be.There were just so many great lines in this movie, I'm laughing as I recall them. For example, when they meet Socrates in ancient Greece, Ted says "Philosophize with him dude." At which Bill illustrates the rock lyrics "All we are is dust in the wind, dude." and illustrates by picking up and blowing away a bit of sand. From this, Socrates comes up with one of his famous philosophical lines. The casting was so perfect. All the historical figures made good caricatures of the real ones as we picture them to have been. I especially liked Napoleon -- "the short dead dude from our History class." Joan of Arc, "Miss of Arc" as the boys refer to her in their presentation, in her few scenes conveys her youth and her fight. Even as Bill and Ted rescue her from a jail cell, she is praying and says, "Merci!" I must admit that Keanu Reeves has never impressed me in any of his subsequent roles, but he made the perfect harebrained teenager. Maybe he should stick with comedy. And of course George Carlin, so deadpan in the face of any event.Unless you are a deathly serious person, I recommend this movie for people of all ages. In fact, if you are too serious, this might just loosen you up, dude. Be excellent to each other. And, Party on, dudes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent.First the characters are great.Keanu Reeves (Ted) and Alex Winters (Bill) are perfect for the parts. George Carlin as Rufus Thats good. Not to mention the people who played the historical characters.The first time I saw The movie was in 1989 and I was only one so I didn't remember it but then I watched It as many times as i could since I was four in 1992 and it's been 9 1/2 years at about 10 times a year so thats about 950 times. Now enough about my history because Bill and Ted have a history project and they dont have alot of time 'cause all they know is "Ceasar....Is a salad dressing Dude" and they're gonna flunk most heinously the next day. So watch the movie and find out when the Mongols ruled china, This is a spoiler for those of you who haven't seen it so dont read the upper cased letters GENGHIS KHAN RAVAGED THE SPORTING GOODS STORE,THE HISTORICAL FIGURES WENT TO JAIL, AND BILL AND TED MET TWO "HISTORICAL BABES" all of that is in this most triumphant movie along with funny lines like: Bill: Ted While I agree that in time our band will be most triumphant. The truth is WILD STALYNS will never be a super band until we have Eddie Van Halen on guitar. Ted: yes Bill but I do not believe that we will get Eddie Van Halen until we have a triumphant video. Bill:Ted it's pointless to have a triumphant video before we even have decent instruments Ted: How can we have decent Instruments if we dont really know how to play Bill: That is why we need Eddie Van Halen Ted: And that is why we need a triumphant video Bill and Ted together: Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill and Ted is a true comedy classic and has been a blast every time I watch it. I still get laughs out of all the historical figures at the mall. Two morons are flunking history class and if Ted doesnt pass, his Dad will ship him off to military school. Rufus played by George Carlin comes in a time traveling phone booth and lets the dudes use it to gain knowledge in order to pass a history project. The two embark across time going back to Ancient Greece and the wild west and pick up important historical figures such as Beethoven, Genghis Khan, Abe Lincoln, Freud, Socrates and Joan of Arc.

		<fullReview>The biggest drawback of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is that it it doesn't get the recognition it truly deserves. No one ever lists B&amp;T in a list of classic comedies, but that's exactly what it is -- an airy, enjoyable, nonstop romp of silliness across time. The movie is filled to the brim with memorable quotes and scenes, such as Genghis Khan running amok at the mall and Bill and Ted's implausible (yet totally logical!) escape from jail. And yet, despite the guys' loser-slacker attitudes and the movie's laid-back tone, it's also family-friendly and harmless. Again, an unrecognized comedy classic.Be excellent to each other and party on!</fullReview>

This movie was pretty realistic. Bill &amp; Ted were actually a pretty realistic portrayal of Californian youth, ie.their worldview blocked by the walls of the local mall and their attention span retarded by unGodly rock music. This movie was quite amusing, and the story sped along so it didn't yet boring once. I loved the way they used the paradox of time travel to steal Ted's dad's keys tomorrow and then leave them somewhere convenient yesterday. Quality stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" is one of the sweetest, most gentle comedies in recent times. Films like this are few and far between. Last year's "Galaxy Quest" is on the lines of the "Bill &amp; Ted" movies. A movie that isn't trying to reach into your esophagus and kick you in the stomach to get you to laugh. My favorite comedies are the ones that leave one with a warm feeling at the end, which makes me want to see it again. I'll take the "Bill &amp; Ted" movies and "Galaxy Quest" over the vulgar shock humor of the overrated Farelly Brothers.This movie must be put out on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Not toilet sick, just plain mischievious sick. Anyhow, the plot is wildly original and the film makers pull it off without a hitch. My only complaint? It's not coming to DVD anytime soon. To this day this movie was the SINGLE MOST ALL-OUT-FUN I ever had at the theater. Leave your critical mind behind and just coast with it. If you do, you won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two streams of excellence that make this film a wonder. Reeves and Winter manage to sustain Bill and Ted's utterly oblivious optimism and cheerfulness throughout the film. And the caricatures of the historical figures actually show more knowledge of history than film pretends to know. As is often the case, this light-weight, fun movie required a great deal of knowledge and subtlety to write, but all this heavy talent had to be absolutely invisible for the movie to succeed. Take the scene when Socrates and Billy the Kid are trying to pick a couple of gals in a mall when Sigmund Freud shows up holding a corn dog and completely blows their chances. It's a brief, lovely mockery of all things Freudian, but you don't need to know that. It's enough simply to see geeky Sigmund in action. This a fine little movie that is very easy to enjoy.</fullReview>

Without the characters Bill and Ted, this movie might have not been as good, but thanks to their crazy antics (and a performance from George Carlin that is one of his best) this film pulls through. Especially because they are a group that is stereotyped for their time and they are going on an adventure in the past. Not all the performances are good, but that is something you wouldn't look for in this film. One of the best films of the 80's.</fullReview>

The funniest scenes are when they are in the mall and getting into all sorts of trouble.The music is also ideal in epitomising this 80's style. The track "Two heads are better than one" perfectly goes with the 'losers become winners' feel of this movie.I've seen it many times including about 5 times in one week, when I was only 10 around about the time it came out.If you want a feel good fun film than try this!</fullReview>

It's not something little kids would wanna see, but maybe pre-teens and older kids would get a kick out of it. It's loads of fun, and Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, the second film, was just as cool! :) I'd recommend it to anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the basic commentary... cheesy and boring.. but the movie was great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I was younger and I didn't understand what was going on. I waited a couple of years, saw it again, and then I took a liking to it. I bought it for myself recently after I rented it again, because I decided that this movie was so trippy and out there, I just had to have it. Keanu Reeves as Ted "Theodore" Logan and Alex Winter as Bill S. Preston, Esquire play the perfect teenage duo. They have good intentions, but they don't know how to use them right. So they get a little bit of guidance from their futuristic friend. I give this movie a 10/10 for Bill and Ted's lines alone. It's funny, has morals (to a point..), and it gives someone laughter when they are feeling down. I can watch this movie until the tape melts.. All (we are is dust in the wind, dude) I can say is.. it was "Excellent!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic for it's time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although similar to "Wayne's World", this movie set the standard for the current-day Cheech and Chong movie genre. No drug use at all present in this film, but you have to wonder when seeing these two in action... :) I saw this movie the day it opened back in '89 and had absolutely no preconceptions about it. I love it! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. Perhaps not one to watch with the parents, but a good weekend party film. This film absolutely bleeds "80's California". The edited TV version doesn't leave much out, but I'd recommend renting it for the full commercial-free experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy With Some Deep Themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with most comedy films, the viewer needs to be in the right mood for "Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure" to work; otherwise it will fall flat. With help from the enigmatic time-travel guide Rufus (George Carlin) and a magic phone booth, Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) go back in time to learn firsthand about, and kidnap, historical figures as a way to pass their high school history course in 1988.The historical figures are all stereotypical of their contemporary public image, and include among others: Genghis Khan, Billy the Kid, Lincoln, Napoleon, and a couple of "dudes" who Bill and Ted refer to as Sigmund "Frood" and that well-known Greek philosopher "So-craits".Indeed, part of the fun is the inane jabber between dim-bulbs Bill and Ted. But the dudes are charming and energetic and mean no harm. Of the two, Ted, whom I refer to as mop head, is probably the funnier. At one point he addresses Billy the Kid as "Mr. The Kid". And when So-craits says: "the only true wisdom consists in knowing that you know nothing", mop head responds cheerfully: "That's us, dude". Marvelous.The film's first half contains some good humor; the second half becomes ever sillier, from the shopping mall sequence on to the end. The sequence in the auditorium where students give their reports is not the least bit funny, and is loaded with juvenile clichs. None of the script's dialogue contains any subtext. But that's to be expected when we have such bodacious characters that only want to "party on". The plot centers on physical action, not cerebral mind games.There's a lot of CGI in this film, and it is done rather well; the special effects do not get in the way of the story. Casting is acceptable. But it's the photogenic Keanu Reeves who really makes the story interesting. Acting is about what we would expect for a popcorn flick.However shallow the characters may be, and however silly some of the plot elements are, there are some deep messages here. The film offers a satire on suburban youth culture in the frivolous 80s. It also speaks to how different our contemporary culture is from bygone eras, thus offering historical perspective. And of course, "Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure", despite the comedy or perhaps through it, veritably oozes contempt for the failure of American education. The film's thematic depth thus renders it a serious study of suburban youth culture in the latter decades of the twentieth century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trivia is incorrect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the trivia section it states: "The Circle K is in San Dimas at the corner of Walnut and Arrow Highway. The scenes at the convenience store were at least partially filmed at the Circle K at the northwest corner of Broadway and Hardy in Tempe Arizona." This is incorrect. First of all they did not film any parts at the actual San Dimas Circle K. Secondly, the Circle K in San Dimas is and always has been on the corner of Walnut and Bonita...not Arrow Highway. Interestingly enough, the San Dimas Circle K did look very similar to the one in the movie before it was remodeled and many of my friends believed it was the one from the movie, but I could tell by the layout of the parking lot and nearby streets it was not.I grew up in San Dimas and was about 11 years old when this movie came out. I lived just behind that Circle K on Balboa Ct. I used to ride my bike there nearly every day and night with my best friend. My older sisters were attending San Dimas high when this movie was being filmed and their principal told them that she refused to allow filming there and that is why they went to Arizona to film.We were all sad that they used our city name, but didn't film anything there. The funny thing is they really did base the places on San Dimas...we have Raging Waters, they called it Waterloo. The only thing incorrect was the San Dimas mall...that never really existed in San Dimas.When Bogus Journey came out me and my friends walked to Canyon Theater in San Dimas to watch it and laughed when the opening scene said San Dimas, CA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of the best sci-fi comedies of all time Keanu Reeves and newcomer Alex Winter are drop dead hilarious as Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted Theodore Logan. These two guys are about to flunk history and not graduate from high school, so a real cool dude called Rufus (Carlin)shows up and informs them that the future depends on them to get an A+ on their final exam. It's bursting with awesome time traveling and excellent music. In my opinion this is the best movie of 1989.

		<fullReview>Bill and Ted are two idiots who just want to be in a rock band, then an important history presentation comes up and if they don't pass they will be sent to military school. Its about this time a man named Rufus comes from the future in a telephone box and lets them use the telephone box to travel through time and collect historical figures to use in there history presentation. A most excellent movie proceeds.Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is a great way to pass a couple of hours. Its pretty much 2 pretty damn funny people just being idiots in different periods of time. I don't care what anyone says about Keanu Reeves I like him; I think he's great in the entire Matrix trilogy but especially in this and the sequel (Bogus Journey, which is just as good). Alex Winter also very funny as Bill.The best place they travel to is probably the wild west where they get Billy the Kid, Billy the Kid and Socrates also happen to be my favourite people they bring with them. The only down points of the film for me where most of the Napoleon stuff as it wasn't funny and took us away from the film since most of it didn't have Bill and Ted there.If you're in the mood for harmless fun then definitely watch this.Final Rating: 7/10Entry onto Movie List: 167th of 342 (Better than The Good Girl, worse than Rocky 3)Entry onto 1989 Year List: 2nd (Better than The 'Burbs, worse than Back to the Future Part 2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>San Dimas High School Football Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The true key to knowing is knowing that you know nothing," so sayeth Bill S. Preston, Esquire (quoting Socrates, of course). Bill &amp; Ted are the pinnacle of moronic (but entertaining) underdog comedy heroes, and their Excellent Adventure marks the pinnacle of 80s teen comedies, and in particular, 80s teen science fiction. It one that, like the Goonies, has remained a timeless classic. First of all, you have a story that will probably never be achieved with modern films, at least not in the mainstream. The absolute fun of two rather stupid high school best friends who are able to pull together a most bodacious history project by being able to go back in time through the help of a phone booth. And they're not obnoxious. They're not ultra-rich. They're just happy-go-lucky Bill and Ted and they have a most excellent adventure. Maybe that's because it's like an English Composition theme we'd probably get in real life: how would historical figures behave in modern environment? What a fun idea to make a movie out of. Why can't modern teen genre movies utilize the same fun themes instead of lingering on old film's themes? Although, granted, as is the dilemma of most time-traveling films, there is some narrative confusion (if time kept repeating itself as we see from Bill &amp; Ted running into future and past versions of themselves, then Rufus must be one busy dude and on permanent call to keep the galaxy from destruction).Everyone in it is fantastic from Napolean, the honorary "Ziggy Piggy," to Misty, Bill's step-mom and the cause of his "minor oedipal complex," to Ox the dumb jock who gives the "computers are more moderner" speech. Plus, the soundtrack is excellent (particularly the "In Time" song played when Bill and Ted meet the Three Most Important People on Earth and "Do You Want To Play" played during the mall scene. You have 80s musicians like Clearance Clemmons, Fee Way Bill, the girl from the Go-Gos, and Stevie Vai (only his hands are visible) showing up. All I can say is....uh....San Dimas High School football rules!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Guys, your report had better be something special." (Bill and Ted's History teacher)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought the DVD, "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure", to mail to my son and daughter who were teenagers in 1989 and were fans. But I had to watch it first, and I am amazed what a fine film this is. The two boys, Bill and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are slackers on the order of Jeff Spicoli in "Fast Times", but they have a latent streak of goodness to them. Fearing they will flunk history, in which case Ted would be sent to military school in Alaska and their band "Wyld Stallions" will be broken up, the human race from 700 years in the future sends back Rufus (George Carlin) in a time machine that looks just like a phone booth. Seems that our race has learned to travel via the "circuits of history" and can go anywhere, any time, by dialing the proper number. Why are they doing this? Seems the "Wyld Stallions" are destined to become the most popular musical group in history, and their music calms the savage beasts and brings peace all over the Earth. Their survival as a group means survival of the human race. So, they travel and retrieve such diverse historical figures as Billy the Kid, Ghengis Kahn, Joan of Arc, Sigmund Freud, Napoleon, Socrates, Ludwig von Beethoven, and Abraham Lincoln. All of which results in the final presentation at school, and which earns them an "A+" with Lincoln delivering the final speech, urging everyone to "be excellent to everyone" and "party on."In some respects this is just a silly movie, but one done very well, with an inspired script and good acting. The overall message of redemption is very appropriate and the idea of school kids learning history by actually being there, though impossible, is admirable. The DVD picture is very good for a film of this vintage. It has Dolby 5.1 sound, but it does not actually surround you like modern films do. Overall one of the finer comedies I have seen, and I feel sorely underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable? Somewhat. Well-written? Not on your life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980s were once thought to be the absolute nadir of Western culture, with America producing so much throwaway drivel that some of the best examples of art from there during this decade were made by outsiders. It is only because of the sheer vapidity of the 1990s and 2000s so far that we can look back upon the 1980s with any sense of longing or nostalgia, and the titular duo of this film give us a good understanding of why. The film begins with a great dialogue from George Carlin about this great and wonderful future that was inspired by two legendary musicians. Okay, so far, so good. It is a concept that, while not totally brilliant, can be made to work if exploited properly.The problem here is that the subjects of the film are so utterly vapid that they flatten their own story. They claim to be rebelling against a society that does us all wrong, and that part is true enough, but one fundamental law is that one should never kill a tyrant until one knows whether his successor is an improvement or not. Bill and Ted, as a model for society, definitely aren't. I have read some previous comments that note the fascistic undertone inherent in the film, and I can only agree. Anything that the heroes disagree with or don't like the appearance of is bogus, apparently. One can just sense the kilns being fired up for the autistic or phobic individuals in the San Diemas of the future.Another interesting point is the whitewashing of history that occurs in the process of retrieving the historical figures, all of whom present far more interesting characters than the titular heroes. Apparently, maidens from France of the Middle Ages look exactly like gunslingers of the New Mexico of colonial America, who in turn look exactly like modern Californians. Sure, the inclusion of Napoleon helped with the European element (not). After all, we all know that French military leaders are foul-tempered midgets with bad personal relationship skills. And it is probably best to say nothing at all about Genghis Khan, since he never gets to say anything at all during his performance. About the only opportunity with these characters that gets any exploration at all is Socrates, who provides an interesting insight into the idea of an ancient Greek philosopher being transported into modern times. Unfortunately, since Robert Heinlein had a lot of ideas that Socrates expressed thousands of years ago, such as people being made to make decisions of conscience before they vote in affairs that affect millions, I can honestly imagine Socrates would find Bill, Ted, and pretty much everyone at San Diemas High abhorrent.The film's strengths, which are few in number, include the aforementioned George Carlin. If Doctor Who had been an American show, but had the similar lengthy, sometimes controversial, history that the BBC gave it, it's a safe bet that Carlin would have at some point played the good Doctor. Carlin displays the cool that Bill, Ted, and every San Diemas citizen who gets the slightest screen time seems to want to have. Indeed, part of the fun of Bill And Ted is taking note of how much the so-called good guys act like the dickweeds that they are so fond of calling others. Dan Shor gives a very good performance as Billy The Kid in spite of physically being totally wrong for the part. Shor looks as if he is at least four inches too tall for the part, and is far too muscular. Not to mention that his front teeth are not prominent enough, but that gets back to the Orwellian rearranging of history recently talked about. In spite of these mismatches, Shor at least sells himself as someone you'd take seriously if you met him in the Wild West.Interestingly enough, the film sat on a shelf for two years before Orion bought the rights to it from the De Laurentiis Group and released it upon an unsuspecting world. They must have liked the teen market a lot, since a mere four years would pass before they retooled one of the biggest artistic triumphs they had ever financed for such a market, and as a happy result, went bankrupt. I understand how cutthroat the film business is, but you'd think that film studios would look back at history to see this correlation between disrespecting one's audience and a poor box-office return.One more positive of this film is that it doesn't give a lot of detail about the future that Carlin's character is trying to protect. This allows the audience to fill in some details for themselves, which in turn makes the vapidity of the folk we are told it is based on somewhat less objectionable. With people like Rufus in power, it is easier to believe the future is not dominated by complete morons like the present.Like the sequel, I gave Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure a five out of ten. If you're bored and have nothing better to do, it is an okay way to pass ninety minutes. But if you want something to watch that will do more than fill time, then there is nothing to see here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has its moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'd definitely like to say that I don't hate this movie. It's just that there was so much potential for ripe humor and very little of it was tapped. Also, the plot holes in this flick are HUGE. "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" isn't meant to be a sophisticated comedy and that's fine. However, a little more effort could've been used to bring out the humor. It is made abundantly clear at the very beginning of the movie that Bill and Ted aren't the brightest of guys and they have their own style of talking. Unfortunately, words such as "dude" and "heinous" are way overused. The focus of the film should have been more on the historical figures once they had already been brought back to the present. Watching these two guys go back in time over and over to retrieve people isn't funny or very entertaining. Scenes such as Genghis Khan brutalizing a store mannequin are much more interesting. Overall, "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" has its funny and feel good moments but it doesn't strive to be all it could have been. That's bogus. 4/10</fullReview>

The characters are interesting and Reeves/Winter are a good pair, but the film as a whole is not funny and often tedious to sit through. I know it's supposed to be that way, but I found the plot highly far fetched, even unoriginal, and the historical figures that the title characters meet seem vastly unrealistic. Still, it was entertaining during stretches, and nearly everyone else seemed to enjoy it, so you could do worse.</fullReview>

Not a great movie? If it were even *passable*, but it's grainy, often not quite in focus, the dialog pauses between the principals sound so patently like they're reciting painfully memorized lines, the alleged "cool" Rufus has about two minutes total screen time, and you'd have to be drunk or stoned to swallow the premise.If you can ignore all of that ... the movie still reeks.Now there were a few amusing lines, the sequence of the historical figures in the shopping mall was genuinely humorous, and the "oral presentation" had legit energy, but that's what keeps this flick from getting a rock bottom rating. I thought in the Eighties based on the trailers that this film was for subhumans only. I wasn't wrong.3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest, "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" is a childhood favourite of mine so this review is probably going to be tinged with feelings of nostalgia. That being said, having just rewatched it I think that it holds up well.Bill (Alex Winter) &amp; Ted (Keanu Reeves) are a pair of hard rockin' high schoolers who find themselves in danger of flunking history class. This impending misfortune would result in Bill being sent to military academy in Alaska, thus putting an end to the duo's fledgling band, Wyld Stallyns. Luckily for them, help is on the way in the form of a time machine from the distant future. To quote Rufus (George Carlin) from the opening scene, "Don't worry, it'll all make sense".The story requires considerable suspension of belief but it does have its own particular charm. While other favourite films of my childhood no longer hold the same appeal this one holds up pretty well. In fact, it might even be more rewarding now, since today I get some of the subtler jokes regarding the various historical personages.Reeves &amp; Winter work well together as the dimwitted duo at the centre of the story. Both nail the dumb but lovable vibe that gives their characters their appeal. The incomparable George Carlin is also present in a small role while the actors playing the various historical figures are uniformly effective.The direction by Stephen Herek is above average for a comedy and the special effects have even held up better than I would have expected. The soundtrack doesn't have much in the way of recognizable content but it all fits the movie and the time period to a T.Ultimately, "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" is an entertaining comedy that captures the spirit of the time in which it was made. It's no "Citizen Kane" but it's well worth a look for anyone in the mood for a lively comedy with a uniquely goofy premise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that became a classic, two dopey high schoolers are threatened to be split up by one of their fathers if they don't ace the oral presentation in History. The problem is that someone else doesn't want them to part ways, and sends them on a special trip...into the past.Having recently saw this film for the "umpteenth" time, these two "dudes" obviously aren't that stupid in real life (maybe they watched Sean Penn's character "Spiccoli" in "Fast Times at Ridgemount High" for incentive on their character), but that shows how good they can really act. No one knew at the time what heights Reeves would rise to, but this film definitely begins to show what range he can achieve.If I'd written this comment and voted for it the first or second time I saw it (when it originally came out), it would probably have received a higher vote, but, alas, I have grown and my tastes in comedy have matured (No way, dude!) 6 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still remember when the movie came out -- how stupid and awful the trailers looked, and how surprised I was when I really enjoyed the movie. I think the key to the movie's success and its charm is how open it is about being what it is. This is a stupid movie about stupid people, but I didn't see a more enjoyable movie of this type until just a few years ago when "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" came out. The annals of film history will not be cluttered by mention of Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter as one of the great comedy duos. But what I find appealing about it is that it never descends to mawkish sentiment like John Hughes movies ("Planes Trains and Automobiles" and "The Breakfast Club") for example and his imitators' films always do. In fact one of Reeves' immediate follow-ups, "Parenthood" which starred Steve Martin, was exactly such a horrendous film. The ultimate point of this movie, saving the universe by way of Steve Salas and Joe Satriani-style whining blues-less guitar rock solos, is just as absurd as its main characters.The interesting thing about Bill and Ted as a comedy duo is that neither of them are the "straight man" in particular. There's no attempt to paint either of them as particularly more attractive, intelligent, or interesting than the other. To some extent George Carlin's Rufus acts as a straight man but he only appears in a few scenes and seems to share Bill and Ted's excellently poor taste in music and grammar. Basically the humor and the appeal of Bill and Ted are the same thing -- they are just so stupid and so optimistic that I think it'd be hard to really hate them. They do the same kind of comedy that Pauley Shore and Adam Sandler did for the next decade: valley-guy moron over his head in whatever situation. But because there's two of them they don't get annoying like those guys do, because there's an endearing quality in their friendship and their trust in each other.The reason I wouldn't rate the movie very highly is that a lot of the jokes do fall pretty flat upon a repeat viewing and the movie loses a lot of steam in the middle sections set in Medieval times. But compared to its sequel and most other movies of this type it's a masterpiece because it's actually watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Starring: Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves, and George Carlin.Two idiots have to make a good grade on a project in order for one of them not to go to military school. So they travel back in time and get many famous historical people. The movie is hilarious in that it has a great way of showing the historical figures, and Bill &amp; Ted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter do good as Bill and Ted, two dopeheads who need to pass a history grade. They go back in time and collect different historical people so they can pass the grade. genghis Khan was hilarious especially in the sports department. Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter give very convincing performances and I enjoyed them both. This is weird though because they didn't alter time when they took the people.Overall this movie is very funny and I loved it and bought it immediately on DVD. Rating 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Is It ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only like this movie for the time traveling aspects, and that's about it. In all, it's not a bad movie, but it's not a good one. It's not a teen movie, but it's not a fantasy. Two low-achievers are given the assignment to save the future. The reason is extremely far-fetched; it alleges that their music plays a factor to world peace. If that was the case, I can name twenty other more talented singers, vocalists and entertainers with a lot more brains and talent who honed their craft by hard work who are far more eligible. The boys will fail if they don't turn in a history assignment which just so happens to be set up for them to be able to yank historical personages from the past. Isn't it likely they were more likely to fail ? How could this so-called future have existed to send them a time machine to pass when it they were most likely to fail the test ? I think someone in that future rewrote their history to depend on the two idiots. The other facts about time travel are pretty close when it comes to being able to travel both a few minutes forward and backward, but there are historical contradictions a plenty on the characters, most obviously is the t-shirt tan on Socrates. Anyone from Before Christ would be a lot more tanned ! The actors are matched up solely on appearance to the roles they play and the script depicts them well, but it is less kind to Bill and Ted themselves. George Carlin is the only character to watch in this, but he has few scenes as a would-be Obi Wan to Bill and Ted, two characters sharing a brain - and both of them thinking the other has it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure if anyone else has pointed this out, but the story of a slightly demented, oddball character travelling through time and space was hatched in the 60s: Doctor Who, on the BBC. But I love Bill &amp; Ted, so don't get me wrong. I just always thought it was neat that whereas, the Doctor is usually in his early thirties to late sixties, Bill &amp; Ted are righteous teenagers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of modern comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say right up front that this is one of my favourite comedies of all time. What's not to like? The heroes are cheerfully good-natured and amusingly idiotic, and the plot has enough clever historical references and parodies to make it enjoyable for those whose cognitive functions are more fully developed than those of the movie's eponymous dork-heroes. The jokes are funny and the characters are lovable.All in all, an enjoyable comic romp that remains light-hearted and funny right up until the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Non-sense masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the most idiotic production i have ever seen. If you think you have much much time to kill, try this movie. Completely disaster. After seeing historical characters, i said to myself "It's OK. I can learn about history a little.". But, no. It keeps making fun with it. Just fun. It humiliates historical characters. I really liked the effects. But the fiction is completely irrelevant. Actors are so bad, i just wanted to wait whats gonna happen after that scene. But the scenes were kept worse. Also the behaviors of two lead actors are so annoying, i hated 80s&amp;90s which i definitely love it. Also the music. My entire life passed by listening iron maiden, led zeppelin songs. This movie does not have right to use them in very irritating way. It could be great. Because the script is something good. But I can say this without any hesitations, "DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE." I would be sorry for your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, Dude.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I thought some parts of this movie were "excellent," other parts were complete "bogus." It was a creative storyline and the characters of Bill and Ted were original, entertaining, and comedic. Some of the dialogue, story, and situations were about as dumb as the duo's intellect. Historically inaccurate, of course but Napoleon and Genghis Khan were especially hilarious. Overall it was slightly entertaining, but it was no where near a masterpiece or even a good solid movie for that matter. Do I regret watching it? No, but I probably won't ever watch it again. It did have some good lines and morals to live by: "Be excellent to each other, and party on dudes!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has gotta be one of the most enjoyable movies ever!!(This and Bogus Journey) I just love it and live it. Did anyone else like me get raised eyebrows from teachers when you pronounced "Socrates"? Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are just brilliant as the dimwitted teenagers. Bill Espreston Esquire (Winter) and Ted Theodore Logan (Reeves), who together are 'Wyld Stalions' are in danger of flunking history...if that happens Ted will be sent to military school in Alaska and then their band will never happen. This will have devastating consequences on the future, a society free of war, pollution, ("even the dirt is clean") thanx to Wyld Stalions music. But all is not lost...in comes Rufus, a sorta guardian angel type character from the future. He's come back in time to help'm out. And what better way of passing history than to have a time machine, "not bad!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIE EVER!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie. It is just so amazing. I can't describe it in words. But I'll give it a try anyway. This is an excellent comedy that may appeal to the enlightened. I love it. Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are cast perfectly as Bill and Ted, two high school seniors nearing graduation who discover that they are "in danger of flunking most heinously" when their history teacher informs them that Joan of Arc is not Noah's wife and Caesar is not the salad dressing dude. They then meet a most non-heinous dude named Rufus, who drops from a phone booth into the parking lot of the Circle-K convenience store. Strange things are most certainly afoot at the Circle-K when Rufus informs them that the entire fate of the world depends on them getting an A on their final history report. Then from the phone booth step two very familiar people. Bill and Ted meet future thems who inform them of the most excellent adventures they are in for. Most Excellent!! George Carlin as Rufus leads an excellent supporting cast in this most atypical movie. I would most certainly recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh or just wants to see a most non-heinous movie. If you haven't seen it, RENT IT NOW!!! "Be Excellent to Each Other. And Party On, Dudes!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I had a time machine I would kill the director of this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently purchased this movie from HMV for around $15, lets just say I didn't get my moneys worth.The movie is extremely boring, unfunny, and a waste of time. The movie doesn't even fit in the category "Stupid Funny". Scenes in this movie were longer than they should have been which made it boring. The jokes used were all based on the same idea making them tired right from the beginning.The acting in this movie was extremely terrible, I have a hard time believing Keano Reeves was in this.Only one thing I found useful for this movie...umm...errr....I had and idea...just wait...nope...nothing EASY STEPS FOR MAKING YOUR OWN TERRIBLE MOVIE! 1. Let a 14 year old kid write a fantasy story, now its important that he does his worst thinking oh and drunk too.2. Hire someone like Bob Hope for jokes 3.Make sure it has plenty of plot holes in it, example, Beethoven NOT being def.4.Oh throw in a telephone booth.5. And, uhh you know what it'd be so much easier to just react THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonstop hilarity from start to finish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter how silly this movie can become, it is still a hilarious and engaging comedy, and an utter delight from start to finish. The screenplay was intelligent, original, uproariously funny and witty. I also loved the film's plot, about Bill and Ted going back in time to make sure they don't fail their history exam. I will admit I don't care for Keanu Reeves that much, but as Bill and Ted he and Alex Winter turned in honest, appealing and likable performances. The soundtrack is hip and cool too. The film is full of wonderful characters and scenes, the Tudor scene was indeed fun, but any scene with Napolean and Beethoven are guaranteed to end you up in hysterics. The adventure is fast-paced, imaginative and never has an unengaging moment. All in all, a hugely enjoyable film. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not excellent, it is not even good. In fact, it is fair at best and that is being generous. Bill &amp; Ted's (Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves) so-called "Excellent Adventure" is a dumb film about two moronic high schoolers who come across a phone booth that is a time machine and go back in time to pick up some of the most famous (and boringest) people that have walked this world so they can complete a history project. Some of their new friends include Abraham Lincoln, Sigmund Freud, Genghis Khan, and Socrates among others. Overall the film is watchable, but if you miss it you are not going to miss much. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one were feeling charitable, one could call this 'comedy' the nadir of post-modernity, where history is flattened out, where the dead, largely white, largely European-American, largely male Great Figures are made the subject of infantile mockery, taken out of the period in which they dominated and dumped into one where the majority of yokels don't even know their name. It is post-modernity with a moral - you can't simply rearrange history to suit the present, as most of the students in Bill and Ted's school seem to do - the relics wreak suitable havoc on an archetypally inane mall. Except there is no moral. One jock caps a poisonously conformist paper with the cliche that it's what Lincoln would have wanted. You hope, as with Marshall McLuhan in 'Annie Hall', that the hallowed President steps up and clips the young fascist on the ear, but, oh no, our friends from times past consecrate the idea of history as progress and improvement, and take to the vapid airbrush that is modern America like the proverbial pigs. And you can see their point - most of these figures lived in times of great historical repression and violence, even if one or two of them (eg Genghis Khan, according to this film, the father of chop-socky) were doing the violent repressing. America may be a dolt's paradise, but you are unlikely to be burnt for hearing voices, shoved into an oven for being the wrong religion, or poisoned for having the wrong ideas. This is America, after all, and Joseph McCarthy, Vietnam and South America are nightmares that never happened. Because post-modernity would have to have been invented for America if it didn't exist: without historical amnesia, it would be forced to live with itself. And so, great classics or periods of history are stripped of politics and social analysis, and turned into neutered love stories. We are all Bill and Ted, we get the culture we deserve.Ahem. Sorry about that, bit of a rant there, very old-fashioned. I know a lot of normally sensible people have a lot of affection for this film, despite its visual paucity, its negligible script, its gauche 'acting', its hitting on a half-clever idea AND DOING NOTHING WHATSOEVER WITH IT. people dream of meeting all these historical figures and questioning them. it might be okay for our heroes to say 'duh!' and 'So-crates', but did the filmmakers have to join them? Couldn't they find SOMETHING funny, interesting, ironic, subversive for these great people to do, instead of standing around gaping , while Bill and Ted gurn infuratingly with only a thin screen between them and my fist. It goes on for hours. No thanks: we have 'Time Bandits'</fullReview>
