		<shortDescription>WOW ! ACTION Jackie CHan is back ! Great stunts, and Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was honored by my friend, Daniel Wu (coldwar, Police Story), to show me a screener of this movie. any real Jackie Chan fan knows a good movie! I have been watching all his movies since I was 7, lol. From Drunken Kung fu master to Rush Hour and the recent Dragon Blade. this is far the realest Hollywood movie Jackie has made. Despite the ones with Chris tucker, which made Jackie a sidekick..Jackie is no side kick. If anyone has watched his Hong Kong movies that were translated to English and debut in the late 90s and mid 2000s in USA.. you would Know Jackie CHAN is the leading action star in all his movies.. But he is humble, he gives creds to his co stars In all his movies despite what other critics say. I doubt they actually sit thru his movies. They just combine other critics viewpoints with their own and say they sat thru the whole movie! Johnny Knoxville is the perfect match, action comedy buddy since Sammo Hung Gung BO ( Jackies childhold friend, From China's Kung Fu School).Sammo makes a brief appearance in this comedy caper. From the beginning to the end I couldn't stop watching this movie.. reminds me of all his movies from Rumble in the Bronx to his Police Story sequels.What's weird is, Jackie doesn't care that his movies had been going directly to video on demand in US. It seems like in uS they don't want an Asian Action leading man star. Suffice to say in US, its still kinda sad and racist of the Movie industry.. Think back in 1997 time, when Jackie was coming back to America, The studios were re Releasing all of his Dubbed Chinese movies in English way before RUSH hour hit the scene.. WHY you say? Because studios back then actually promoted him.. Now everyone is promoting anime and cartoons and superheros instead.Sad how the system works, but luckily for JACKIE CHan, his movies open normally in other countries in REAL Theatres.. SO Hollywood, wake the F up, lol JACKIE Chan is a movie star despite the Hollywood studios in USA that doesn't think he is! The duo are the best buddy/ cop compadres I have seen in years.. And its by RENNY HARLIn ( Cliffhanger with stallone , Die Hard movie), HELLO Mr action Jackson himself. SO glad Jackie got renny to direct this non stop action comedy movie, we all deserve from JACKIE.Cant wait to see this in theatres on SEPT 2, 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not trying to nitpick here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually saw the first half in Chinese and the other half in English. Dare I say, dialogues in Chinese dubbed conveyed more sincerity. What I don't understand is the philosophy behind the villain like why he faked his own death in the first place and why did he kill himself again, why didn't he take care of his own daughter and left her to his so-called "friend" and why aren't the Hong Kong police talking in Cantonese, why can't that be subtitled as well. Yes, the film seemed like a "Rush Hour" layout with more rural beautiful scenery of China. The actions and fight scenes were great, don't get me wrong but it's really hard to make a good Asian-American film. Not enough scripts going around, I guess?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skiptrace is a tour of hectically told story and clumsy action, although there's collective effort from the visual and soundtracks to create a picturesque journey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The odd buddy cop movie, and partial road trip comedy, is something one would expect from a decade ago, along with "Rundown" or Jackie's own "Rush Hour". It has the apparent goal to deliver action comedy while presenting beautiful location as the backdrop. Unfortunately, the shady plot and awkwardly crafted fight scene along with odd pacing hamper the movie every step of the way.Bennie (Jackie Chan) is a cop with obsession to capture a drug dealer who kills his partner, but in order to do so he must chase a conman Connor (Johnny Knoxville). This might sound like a cliché cop story, because it is. Furthermore, it's riddled with consistency and logical issues, but nevertheless the movie pushes along since it needs to showcase more tourist locations.The strongest assets may be the cinematography, it's shot in various stunning places, which is already a boon for any movie. Activity such as the lantern or mud festival is bound to attract viewer, as much as it does to tourist. The problem is stringing these scenes in orderly fashion. It often stumbles due to editing or simply a missed piece in the plot.Same thing happens with comedy aspect as well. The movie may offer a few chuckles here and there, but too much is spent of the buddy cop relationship that is not particularly appealing. It can be attributed to the clash of multiple languages and the untimely delivery, even looking like the audio is a mismatch.As for the trademark Jackie's stunts, "Skiptrace" does have them. This once popular gig is now more of niche since most action movies have incorporated wilder style. The addition of poor green screen for obvious large scale scene feels too outdated at this point. Characters involved are rigidly played, ranging from drug lord to Russian mafia, most of them are highly underutilized or simply too stereotypical to be effective."Skiptrace" feels more like a promotional tour with mediocre cop story and odd buddy gimmick thrown in as excuse for the travel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-hyped but under-delivered.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Skiptrace is the result of a collaboration effort between Chinese talent and American filmmakers. The movie is directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger) and written by Jay Longino (Bachelor Party 2) and BenDavid Grabinski (Cost of Living). Jackie Chan returns to play the kind of role that made him famous in America. The movie's format is also reminiscent of Rush Hour. A series that Jackie was famous for in America following Rumble in the Bronx. Johnny Knoxville is seen here as the goofball reminiscent of Chris Tucker's role as Carter in Rush Hour. The film also stars famous mainland Chinese actress Fan Bingbing who plays as the adopted daughter of Jackie Chan's character.On paper, Skiptrace sounds like a great movie. I love Jackie Chan and Fan Bingbing and I also love the Rush Hour movies. What can go wrong? In reality the movie ends up disappointing. Jackie Chan turns in a decent performance but typical of his earlier action movies. Johnny Knoxville's acting was sub-par but I did buy the whole scumbag gambler routine. Fan Bingbing was far and away the best performer (in terms of acting) in the movie but she was relegated to a damsel in distress role.What I enjoyed most in the movie is seeing China's beautiful countryside as well as a brief look into Mongolia and it's people. The film overall is very run of the mill buddy cop flick. I didn't feel connected to Benny Chan's tragedy, which is central to his motivation for going after the crime boss Matador. I warmed up to the characters midway through the movie when it was more humorous. The plot twist was predictable and the ending gave me a bitter taste in my mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackie Chan and Johnny Knoxville have too little chemistry to make this 'odd-couple' pairing work - and no, the action hardly makes up for it too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter that it was filmed largely in China, 'Skiptrace' hews closer to the Hollywood action comedies that Jackie Chan was making for a predominantly Western audience in the early 2000s than the big- budget Chinese historical epics that he has been making thereafter. Like 'Rush Hour' or 'Shanghai Noon' therefore, Jackie is here accompanied by an American sidekick whose main and perhaps only purpose is to serve as his comic foil ? and that honour this time round has been bestowed on 'Jackass' star Johnny Knoxville. Yet even though it plays completely according to formula by allowing Jackie and Johnny to bicker and joust together and against each other, there is something distinctly diminishing about their 'odd-couple' enterprise this time round, such that the Renny Harlin-directed film is never quite as exciting or amusing as it needs to be in order to be entertaining. To be sure, it does begin on a high by introducing Jackie's Hong Kong police officer Bennie Chan in the midst of a raid on a drug trade happening in one of Tai-O's stilt houses. It is nothing spectacular to be frank, but seeing Jackie do what he does best is always a treat. Just as Jackie, Johnny's character also gets an extended introduction that establishes him as the disarmingly charming hustler Connor Watts, who arrives in Macau with Russian gangsters on his heel for owing a debt to their boss Dima. Connor is twice unwittingly caught up in Victor's affairs by being at the wrong place and the wrong time to have seen Victor shoot dead a female with apparently incriminating evidence against the latter, which also explains why he opts to go with the Russians later on. It is this turn of events that sets Connor up as a prized witness for Bennie as well as a target whom Victor sends his henchmen (led by Leo Ku) to eliminate. Bennie's initial run-in with the Russians that kicks off the middle act is probably the most lively action sequence among the three elaborate ones that Jackie stages throughout the course of the movie. Jackie is as playful as ever in these scenes, whether stuffing Connor in a bin and rolling him down the pavements or using a life-sized Russian doll to evade the blows of a tough leather-clad female opponent dubbed the 'Siberian Terminator' (Eve Torres), but this is unfortunately also the point where it (sometimes literally) starts going downhill. Because Jackie has taken it upon himself to be China's unofficial ambassador to the world, 'Skiptrace' also carries with it his motivation to showcase the sights and cultures of the more native parts of China. And so, even though it defies narrative logic, Bennie's trek across China with Connor back to Hong Kong will include a dinner-and-dance with a Mongolian tribe where Jackie will perform Adele's 'Rolling in the Deep' (believe that!) as well as a stopover at a Yunnan village where the people happen to be releasing 'kongming lanterns' that evening and celebrating the 'Mud Festival' and 'Hundred Family Feast' in the morning. In between, Bennie and Connor sneak their way on board a train, drive a rickety two-seater vehicle into the Gobi Desert, row down a fast-flowing river on a raft buoyed by inflated pig skin and even spend a night in a cave spooning each other to keep warm.Yet even with these opportunities for bonding, one never gets a real sense of camaraderie between the two travellers. That is partly because Jackie often takes the moral high ground chastising Connor for not being a 'man of honour', partly because Johnny spends most of his time scowling for being dragged against his will across China, partly because the script by first-time writers Jay Longino and Bendavio Grabinski lacks character depth, and also because Jackie and Johnny do not quite share enough chemistry to turn the antagonism between their characters into the sort of 'love-hate' relationship that the movie needs. As a result, Connor's change of heart later on feels obligatory, be it a newfound sense of honour that motivates him to speak up for the truth or a renewed sense of loyalty towards Bennie to help a 'brother' in time of need.Ditto the final setpiece set at a shipyard in Hong Kong ? notwithstanding a late twist on the identity of 'The Matador', the action feels tired and uninspired, even with Jackie doing a lot of running around. His best sequences have always had an operatic grace and order to them, but Jackie's last hurrah here lacks elegance and comes across haphazard ? and is even overshadowed by a girl-on-girl showdown between Torres and Mainland actress Zhang Lanxin. That is even more disappointing considering how Jackie and his director Renny (of 'Die Hard 2' and 'Cliffhanger') are supposed to be pros at staging such high-wire acts, but seem content to go out in a middling way here. Alas that sentiment is true of the movie as a whole, which ultimately lacks the screen rapport (between Jackie and Johnny) so sorely needed to make the buddy-comedy pop. By the time he finally got this made, Jackie too seems exhausted, and those looking for his usual level of energy or inventiveness will surely go away empty. Even on the level of the Hollywood action comedies Jackie used to make, this probably ranks among one of his least, not as dire or embarrassing as 'The Spy Next Door' but not quite much better than 'The Tuxedo'. This is no 'CZ12' for sure, and seeing as how Jackie has already lined up 'Railroad Tigers' for the end of the year, you'll be better off waiting for that than this 'Rush Hour' reject neither fun nor thrilling enough to even justify a fourth instalment under the banner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful film - just awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Asian people need to boycott this crap.White people insult Asians constantly and even castrated Asian men while turning Asian women into degraded whore roles for the racist enjoyment of white men.See kulturemedia See anti Asian Hollywood zakkeith and yet these ultra stupid Asians finance coproductions that does the EXACT same thing. This time they pair China's top beauty with a dlist celebrity like Knoxville.To round out this pure minstrel show is the number one go to eunuch of Hollywood, Jackie Chan.If you are Asian you need to boycott this crap and complain to your government. These are not 'funny and cute' portrayals. This is how soft power works. You keep showing white people in a good light while making your own people look like sex toys or 40 year old virgins.I understand why hateful many (not all) white people with a history of racism, invasion, rape, genocide, slavery, opium drug dealing, and plunder do thisbut why do ASIANS do this? Are they insane?</fullReview>
