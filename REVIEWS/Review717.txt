		<fullReview>Roger &amp; Me tells the story of Flint, Michigan after General Motors chairman Roger Smith, shut down the GM plant leaving the entire town in financial ruin. It also tells the story of director Michael Moore's quest to find Smith and bring him to Flint to see the town's devastation. The documentary tells the idiocy, cowardice, heartlessness, and kissing up of the rich while a town tries anything, and I do mean anything, to get back on their feet. I saw this in my high school economics class and after watching parts of Moore's TV Nation ( also highly recommended ) I felt compelled to watch this again. Contains grisly scenes of a rabbit being slaughtered, which I find painful since I have a pet rabbit, and Smith delivering a Christmas speech about the warmth the holiday season provides, while superimposed over a family being evicted on Christmas Eve. Smith later resigned as chairman and will later on meet a man in a red suit, and he ain't Santa Claus. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really showed me what America's free enterprise system is about. Make your millions in producing automobiles in an American town, then run to Mexico where labor is cheap, and not offer any jobs to Americans. I loved it, very true, very deep. I loved how Roger Smith dodged the film crews everytime they showed up. It was very good to show the effects of the plant closing shop. I never expected a true look into what happends to American workers.I give this one 5 stars, and I realize now that our Free Enterprise System just keeps the poor, poor. And the wealthy get even more wealth. Our free enterprise system is a joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up near Decatur, Il, a city that was devastated in the late 70's and 80's by downsizing in the auto industry, the migration of jobs south of the border, and corruption in the giants of agribusiness. The city's economy has never really recovered and has been on the frontlines of the labor battles of this country, while the national media has ignored it. It bears a close parallel to Flint, Michigan, as depicted in "Roger &amp; Me.Moore goes back to his hometown and sees the effects of massive job loss, created by a company that cared more about executive stock options and bonuses, than the community it lived in. We meet people who have lost their jobs, benefits, and homes as a result of short-sighted decisions. With few alternatives that pay a living wage, the community spirals into decline. We see the arrogance of wealth, via lavish parties, while the poor are evicted from their homes. We watch as city leaders concoct one bizarre cosmetic scheme after another, without ever addressing the real roots of the economic problems of the city.The film makes many valid points which still hold true and still occur. You can find fault with Moore's "ambush" approach and mockery of celebrities; but, Moore has usually made civil efforts to talk with these individuals, only to be ignored or driven off. So, he resorts to grandstanding tactics which brings attention to the issues he is pursuing. Also, the celebrities are so generally caught up in their own self importance, that they deserve the skewering they receive.You can fault Moore's tactics and selective portrayal of an issue, but he does provoke discussion, which is usually his aim. In this, he is following the great tradition of the muckrakers, like Upton Sinclair, who were able to stimulate argument on vital topics and effect positive change. Moore is a great filmmaker and thought-provoking figure. Love him or hate him, he makes you focus on issues. Too bad politicians and executives don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore's Roger and Me on Special Edition DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am quite shocked that no one else has commented on this film. This is quite possibly one of the most important movies in the last 20 yrs. Michael Moore by putting his own passion and blood into the making of this movie, showing corporate greed at all levels from political to civil , got an Oscar for this film and he pretty much cemented himself as one of the bravest and strongest directors ever.I don't even know where to start with the review. Shot on location in Flint Michigan, with real people including former corrupt President Ronald Reagan, this movie it as real as it gets.It pretty much started the whole documentaries on exposing corporate greed and well the downhill and moral decline of America (also shown in "The Big One" and "Bowling for Columbine" (which won the Oscar for Michael Moore).Before I get more into depth of the movie, I asked you to remember these image in your heads to show you how sad the situation in Flint Michigan both in 1989 and 2003 are:In the movie while General Motors is showing profits of over a billion dollars,they disgusting laid off over 25,000 factory workers. I repeat General Motors was showing a profit, not a loss, yet they decided to lay of thousands of people basically giving them a death sentence.Most factory workers didn't have the money to pay for their mortgage and were evicted,during one scene in the movie as many as 25 people in one day were evicted even on Christmas Eve.To show the real disgusting situation. A poor and mentally disturbed woman by the name of Rhonda Britton is so desperate to get money for her kids that she tries to sell Rabbits as pets. When that doesn't work she ends literally killing these poor animals and selling them as meat!!!! Which includes skinning them alive!!! The real sad part is that there a million dollar GM hotel only a few yars from where this women is doing this acts to get any form of help for herself.Basically Flint , Michigan as shown in the movie, from once a booming celestial center of action, is now a corrupt, poor , and crime infested city with no hope even amidst the lies of former Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Reagan's promise that they "would change the situation".In fact Reagan as shown in the movie uses Flint basically as a campaign ploy to elect himself during the 1980's. It's disgusting.Now the plot deals with General Motors and their disgusting actions of laying of well basically everyone who works for them in the factory. Even amidst Union groups like UAW , and booming profits, GM pulls the most disgusting acts reported in corporate history.Undoubtedly other sick American companies like Exxon and Enron followed in GM's footsteps.So Michael Moore seeing the situation that is happening, makes this movie as he puts it during the trailer "I did this movie to raise the spirits of the workers". Indeed he did, but more importantly he showed America and the world corporate greed up close and personal and the many people covering up the lie that all is well on GM.For instance Anita Bryant, Bob Eubanks and Pat Boone are 3 disgusting American celebrities who basically are hired by GM to fool the town into thinking everythings nice at Flint Michigan.They hire them for Carnivals, parades, tourism, nything. In Eubanks case as shown in the film, this self indulgent pig is promoting his newlywed game. Eubank is one of the first celebrities that Moore exposes. Eubanks at first seeing Moore doesn't think that Moore wont do much damage.And thats the big mistake that everyone at Flint Michigan does as quoted in the commentary by Moore "getting an interview with these people was easy...because they just took look one look at me and figured oh this isn't going anywhere".My God how wrong those people are. As stated in the first sentence where Eubanks shows his antisemetic joke, he obviously didn't think Moore's movie would have any impact. but furthermore, Eubanks is the typical example of every greedy American pig in the movie. He thinks because he has power he can treat and offend those who don't have power and those who aren't around to listen to his offensive remarks.Again backed up by Moore's commentary "This people thought they could be offensive ecause the groups that they were being offensive too weren't there." True cowardism and Moore's shows that too.The movie moves on to show the Union groups attempt to gain their jobs back and get GM to turn the situation around but they fail. One of the reasons they failed is because the Union Managers themselves kept giving concessions to GM, meaningly they gave into GM demands without getting anything in return.... True stupidity.The movie then shows us Moore's attempts to talk to and question the main man behind the GM scandal Roger Smith, the chairman and Ceo of Gm (this old greedy bastard is no longer the head of Gm).Moore's attempts go awry at first, apparently Smith has goons stopping him and people like Ralph Nader from exposing the greedy Smith.Eventually though using the fact that people underestimate him Moore does meet Smith (for 2 minutes basically) before Smith hightails it ouf there and Moore is removed from security from the Gm building at Chrismas no less!!! Where Smith aware of the unemployment, and crime wave hitting the city as a result of the layoffs still seeks to spew his lies and image of Gm into the media.However by the end of the film. Moore wins, TV Channels and programs become aware of the situation going on and give Moore credit for exposing the situation."Roger and Me" was shown at over 200 Theaters in America. It won several awards at Cannes, gave Michael Moore instant credibility not just as a director but a man, an American, someone who stood up for the rights of others, stood up to the corruption and greed and his area and did something about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, despite some of Moore's liberties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily the funniest documentary of all time, this film takes a hard look at the common working man. So many elements in this film are excellent, and one gets to see the tough life these factory workers experience. From the cross action between Roger Smith and the workers getting evicted is one of the most surreal moments in a film full of them. While Michael Moore fiddled with the timeline egregiously, the tongue-in-cheek attitude most of the people exhibit is shocking. A movie for anyone who feels frustrated with the daily rat race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great documentarian is born</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at a second-run theatre not long after its initial release. And not being a fan of documentaries, I must say I was incredibly impressed, informed and even. (gasp!).entertained. Prior to this film, when I heard the word documentary, I usually conjured up images from Mutual of Omaha African landscapes and another scene of animals either mating or killing.My mother has always touted the merits of stories based on true events, and of course documentaries being 100% true, she finally found a film that she could whole-heartedly embrace and recommend to her son who at the time, preferred films of a more fantastic and less plausible nature.Michael Moore, the "Me" in "Roger And Me" has a dry wit that can leave you rolling in the aisles with his dumbfounded disbelief in the face of human absurdity that he encounters almost everywhere he goes on his hunt for "Roger" Smith, the CEO of General Motors. Michael just wants to talk with Roger and ask him to visit Flint, Michigan, Michael's hometown, to see the effect that closing down all the automotive plants in Flint has had on the people who live there. That effect being at times incredibly depressing and at others, quite amusing. The most amusing moments coming from Roger Smith's repeated, successful but narrow evasion from the confrontational Michael Moore.Is Michael Moore entirely unbiased? Hell, no. But he is intelligent, engaging and inherently humourous in his views and I'm glad there's someone like him out there. If after this film, you feel you need more, than all you must do is prime yourself with his book, "Downsize This" and follow it up with the simple yet powerful documentary, "The Big One". Michael Moore is also the man behind the short lived "TV Nation" which ran for two years on two different networks in the early 90s, and proved to be some of the most intelligent, thought-provoking material that ever hit the idiot box. There are tapes available of the show, which I own, and sadly cannot recommend due to the low technical recording quality, which doesn't do the fantastic content justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best documentary i have viewed. This is a powerful indictment of American Corporate greed and the results to the blue collar worker. Who pay the price by loosing there job with the only trade they knew how to do since joining the workforce. Yes, like the one user mentioned, Govt. has something to do with the way companies function with there laws, tax's, and tariffs. But you can't tell me that these rich companies with allot of political power in Govt. Can't just stand up and say, No. Your hurting our company with these laws. But why would they care. All Ceo's and upper management have there golden parachutes. You can say what you want about all of Moore's movies, but if they were really so full of crap like so many believe, Where are all the lawsuits. There's none, because for the most part he's telling the truth. People who hate Moore are the same, Well off Middle and or Upper class, with no worries. You won't find too many poor people or people who lost there only job they know how to do, calling Moore a fraud and bum. Because they know the truth of what greed does. The Gordon Gecko's of the world still exist. And thats a damn shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roger Smith was (is?) a buffoon, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Michael Moore should have stuck to the facts. I lived in the Detroit area (Milford, the home of the GM Proving Grounds) from the early 70's until 2002. The 80's were a rough decade for the auto industry. Roger Smith became Chairman and CEO of GM in January, 1981. The man was an unmitigated disaster. Among some of the things he proposed was the elimination of GM's engineering division (pink slipping everyone). He didn't think that the world's largest automaker needed an in-house engineering capability. Absolutely moronic!There were several other examples of Roger Smith's buffoonery. The viewing audience would have been better served had Mr. Moore stuck to the facts. There were several items in this film that were either staged or flat-out false (people who never worked for GM getting evicted, Pres. Reagan being quoted out of context, etc.). This is the typical tactic Mr. Moore uses in all his films.The upshot? Mr. Moore is a gifted filmmaker and able storyteller. Unfortunately, he doesn't let the facts get in the way of the point he's trying to make. There was no shortage of material on what a moron Roger Smith was (is?). Had Mr. Moore kept with the facts, Roger &amp; Me would not just be entertaining, it would have the added benefit of being factual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flint is small town that was for many years a extension to General Motors factory. One morning boss of Genergal Motor ? Roger Smith woke up and discover the fact that closing the factory and fire of 30,000 people can make better business than carry on with production, despite the fact that factory didn't bring any losses."Roger and Me" is document where Michael Moore report the slow but systematic fall of his hometown because of Roger Smith decision. Moore just want one thing ? bring Roger Smith to the town, so he can see with his own eyes the fallout. I wont spoiler, let me just say the one of last scene of this movie is very eerie and surreal.This is very interesting document, when every reported thing is scary, curious and funny. My favorite moment is interview with women breeding rabbits (for pets, and for meat), but all of this encounters with Flint's peasants are at least informative. Yeah, it's a manipulation by Moore like always (I hate his Fahrenheit because of that), but here he selected and arranged the moment in very powerful way. The situation is real, and the horror of it its more then real, when we see this hopeless, not very bright people who where just because of one man decision put on the highway to hell.And of course this movie is all about Moore. He is everywhere, non stop commenting, but the god-crusader from last scene of "Bowling for columbine" (Heston) is no where near here, and that's a good thing. This movie is just a well aimed shot, a punk-rock scream for a social injustice. This is art for document with power to stir up emotion and show people ugly things just the way they are: evictions, parades, idiotic city decision ? ignorance, foolishness, powerlessness ? its all powerful evil, and the last scene with very sad Christmas Carol its surreal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing. Just amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Moore has an ability to touch a funny bone but at the same time to capture the irony and ambiguity of our capitalist system. He's told by a straight-faced lobbyist for GM that it's OK that CEO Roger Smith gets a several million dollar increase in salary while people are getting evicted from their homes in Flint, MI. It's good, we're told, that businesses make money. That's why they're in business: to make money, not to provide social welfare. The lesson is lost somewhat in the feeble attempt to instill the great "entrepreneural spirit" that made America great in a dying community. Moore's persistence to get to Roger Smith is neatly blocked at every path, until the final episode when they crash the Christmas party and get more sympathetic blather about how dreadfully sorry they are, but, (as we can infer from having seen The Godfather) "Nothing personal. Just business." We can see that point of clarification on where the sympathy of the Roger Smiths had such a great impact on the mother getting evicted from her home on Christmas Eve. Angry, foul-mouthed? Yes, she was...and in sharp contrast to the oily smoothness of Roger Smith when he looks at Michael Moore like I used to look at cooked spinach when asked to go to Flint to see conditions there.Moore's messages are often attacked as being "socialist," as I saw in a recent posting of a review of his recent Fahrenheit 9-11. Worse, "communist," said another, contending MM should be jailed for treason and his film(s) burned. I must confess that much of what he said rings true with the old signal tocsin from my earlier Red-baiting days in the 50s when calling someone a "commie" was worse than suggestions about the questionability of their parenthood. Yet, the stark reality of seeing communities gutted by "down-sizing," and the desperate hopelessness of laid-off workers being evicted from their shabby homes is sobering. We're faced with the questions of why do we endure the tragedies of having our production forces shipped off-shore to enhance the profits of corporate management and the stock-holders at the expense of our own labor force? We're going to pay one way or the other. The social costs of out-sourcing are more costly to us as a society than any trickle-down benefits gained by upper management and large corporate stockholders. We pay, they play. And, we should acknowledge a debt to this unkempt, shaggy bear of an obnoxious man who's not afraid to shove a mike in the face of these moguls and giants of industry who are asking us to pay for their pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The world needs more Moores!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a prototypical youngest child I have an affinity for feather-ruffling and rabble-rousing. As such, I love these types of movies hence the 8-star rating. Still, this film bothered me in a few ways; the primary one is the basic question of exactly what do corporations owe their employees? Tastes change, technology changes, and not surprisingly business tactics change. I am not sure if Moore or the employees stated this, but what exactly did they want/expect? Of course they wanted to retain their jobs but as I understand it the owners of corporations are looking for increased profits. Cutting costs are one way to do that. One way GM found to cut costs was to manufacture abroad. So, why wouldn't GM do that? Due to employee loyalty? I'm not sure a corporation can exist if employee loyalty comes before profits. I think Moore should have also gone after primary stockholders/owners as well.As I watched, I had a similar thought that I had to consider the source and remember that Moore is a business man and being controversial sells tickets. I had that same feeling watching Sicko. It's like Moore's documentaries outcomes are predefined and he will see to it that it turns out that way. I thought Moore's asking those presumably rich people(and Miss Mich) their impromptu thoughts on the situation was unfair. I would welcome more intelligent debate where both sides are given some time to prepare. Why Roger didn't talk to Moore surprised me maybe Moore liked it that way. After all, did Moore truly do all he could to get an interview? I will bet you this. If on hiring day, every employee was informed that in the future GM may adopt tactics that would result in job losses, but that if this occurred laid-off employees might receive a severance package, the vast majority would still have taken the job regardless of these known pitfalls.To me, going to work for a corporation is a buyer-beware situation. As employees we need to maximize our time there. Take your vacations, max out your 401K, take advantage of tuition assistance, get physicals, and watch the behaviors of those successful counterparts who always seem to be in the right place at the right time. Also, if corporations worry you, don't work for them, go to work for a private firm but don't get there and complain about all the benefits your buddies at Verizon (or wherever) are getting.On a side note (perhaps somewhat relevant considering all the layoffs we're experiencing), we Americans need to start living more practically. If you make $50K/year live like you make $43K. If you participate in a 401K plan remember that a 401K is not a rainy-day account, it is a retirement plan. If you do not need a 2000sqft home, don't buy one. Cars and kids don't need their own bedrooms. Smaller homes encourage us to get out of the house which is not a bad thing. While having your own bathroom is convenient, it is so for about 30 minutes/day: SHARE them.Gas prices fluctuate. If you find yourself stressing about that, buy a smaller car and drive less....it can be done. Instead of packing up the bikes and kids and driving them to a bike trail, ride your bikes to the store, bank, video store, zoo, etc.... Also, smaller cars get you from point A to point B exactly like big cars do...only cheaper. While driving smaller, efficient vehicles is not considered cool is beyond me, this means the driver is smart and may have more money to spend...on you. This is not to say that you shouldn't have a comfy car....the problem is when people pull out food-stamps then hop into a brand new Maxima or Escalade.</fullReview>

You will see things that the news media is quick to cover up so we live in our little fantasy world where we are all loved by everybody else in this planet.Other than that, I've read some of the comments regarding Moore's bias, timeline editing, and story skewing. I think that in this case, they're justified because a) sometimes telling the story exactly as it did is time consuming, b) the message being told doesn't seem to be warped into something completely different. Compare with our daily, all-american news coverage, with our politicians, and with the fact that no other nation on Earth has inflicted so much violence on others (while we're presented as liberators, etc), then draw your own conclusions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a beautiful representation of the divide between the have and have nots of this world, you cant go past 'Roger &amp; Me'. Though quite dated in the aesthetics department, this 1988 doco by master left wing film maker 'Michael Moore', remains a poignant vision of greed and destruction of a town where the major industry (General Motors - who despite record profits up to then decided to close 11 U.S factories country wide &amp; relocate them to Mexico paying the Mexican workers 70 cents / hr,) has shut up shop leaving 13,000 'Flint' locals out of a work. The flow on effect is catastrophic on the working class leaving many destitute fighting poverty and the eviction crew (evicting dozens of people a day, piling their belongings on the nature strip!), while they are unable to find further employment due to many of the town's businesses folding. No incomes means no spending, no spending means failed business. No businesses, means no jobs, no job no in come....well you get the picture. What is greatly insightful is the absolute ignorance the 'Wealthy' display of the troubles in their town, while playing a round of golf and discussing how many of the workers "Just don't want to work"!!!! Just goes to prove things don't change in society, the poor continue to get shafted &amp; the rich are on the whole, selfish, in-sightless, arrogant pricks! I love the smooth over job by G.M, building a music hall and providing performances by crooner Pat Boone &amp; other cabaret stars for half price for those out of work! Having the audacity to import a 'major' preacher to blow smoke up the population's collective arse. Just shows the contempt this company holds and the lengths it will go to distract them from the reality of their predicament! The G.M C.E.O chase is on in true 'Moore' fashion, his mission, a few answers and maybe a bit of interrogation. Looks like he'll have to look beyond his multi million dollar estate,the yacht or golf club!General motors did a damn fine job of creating this apocalyptic landscape for the camera to document and Michael does a fine job of showing the bleakness and giving the viewer an insight of the people's painful predicament.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the movie, and I found it to be very interesting. I did not like so much how Moore felt he had to make the documentary more humorous by making fun of the people he was defending. However, I felt Moore did a good job of showing the devastating effects of General Motors leaving the small town of Flint, Michigan. Although you can't be too certain on how accurate some points in the movie are, the general idea that the town suffered because Roger Smith invested in factories in Mexico with cheap labor was expressed. This documentary laid some valid points down to what was beginning to happen in America with jobs being outsourced. The effects on this small town are so severe, and as this all happened about 15 years ago, it seems much more of America is experiencing their problems. This documentary touched on outsourcing and its effects, which today is still becoming a problem. Overall, it makes a strong impression and is an important movie to watch.</fullReview>

They see just GM gave the people in Flint work, they don´t see that the people of Flint also made it possible for GM to become that what it is.

		<shortDescription>Me, me, me...it's all about "Me!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ROGER &amp; ME is an embarrassing, shameless ego trip masquerading as a documentary. It is not about the social and economic travails of Flint, Michigan. It is not about "Roger" (GM CEO Roger Smith), who is used only as a scapegoat for the film's simplistic vision of corporate evil. It is about "Me" -- i.e., Michael Moore. Basically, Moore has no story to tell. Wanting and not getting an interview with Roger Smith, he becomes a journalistic stalker, making, in effect, a film about not being able to make a film -- the ultimate journalistic cop out. The end result is a glorified home movie: "This is me driving my car. This is me standing here. And here is me standing there. And here is a poor guy getting evicted. He's not important, but, hey, there I am standing next to him, making him look important. Oh, here's a celebrity. Doesn't matter which one, because I am standing right next to him. Boy, doesn't he look like a jerk next to me. He's lucky I put him in my movie...." And so on and so forth.Like all of Moore's other dubious efforts, ROGER &amp; ME has only one focus and one star: Michael Moore. Like a con-artist evangelist who has set up his one-man church, Moore rants and raves in a brazen -- and unfortunately, successful -- attempt to lure the gullible and foolish into worshiping his graven images. Few films are as devoid of ethical standards as this pathetic imitation of journalism. Wearing the disheveled garb of a working man's "60 Minutes," the film expects us to buy Moore as a crusader for the common man, but beneath the pious platitudes there lies the heart of the "National Enquirer." In paparazzi fashion, Moore resorts to ambush journalism and dishonest editing tricks to perpetuate a world view that he cannot otherwise substantiate. He corners the famous in hopes of making them look stupid and exploits the less fortunate in a self-serving effort to make himself look compassionate. He's Jerry Springer with delusions of being Edward R. Murrow.The fact that he plays much of this for laughs shows Moore to have, not a sardonic wit, but a callous indifference. There are those who defend this film and Moore's other works, arguing that it is okay to manipulate the facts, as long as the final message is valid. The end justifying the means, using Nixonesque terminology. Maybe Moore's ultimate assessment of the troubles that befell Flint is accurate. But to arrive at the truth by dishonest means taints the truth. Moore's egotism and self-righteousness sullies this film, long before any ultimate truths are presented. This is not the work of a social crusader, rather it is the product of a cold-hearted, manipulative, amoral predator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good If Uneven Look at Issue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger &amp; Me (1989) *** (out of 4) Michael Moore broke onto the scene with this satirical look at Flint, Michigan, the director's hometown, which pretty much crumbled to the ground after General Motors laid off 30,000 workers and shut down the factories. Moore, with his camera crew, travels to various locations to meet the people effected by this but he also tries to track down GM chairman Roger Smith so that he come back to Flint and see what impact his decision had on the town. When viewing ROGER &amp; ME today it's easy to spot all the familiar Michael Moore touches but when this was first released people just saw this as a new sort of documentary. When viewed today the freshness might not be on high alert but for the most part I think it remains fun just seeing Moore work his magic. It's even fun to look at this film today and compare the tricks of Moore to the type he'd be pulling in his most current films. I think the one thing working so well for this movie is that Moore is able to get his message across loud and clear. One such example is going around with the local Sheriff to kick people out of their homes. Moore is right there are the eviction notices are handed out and we see people being forced to leave their items behind and move to only God knows where. Another thing going for the film is Moore's dark sense of humor and the way he's able to be sarcastic even in the darkest of moments. One such example is the way that he's trying to get the interview with Smith by constantly being asked to leave private clubs, events and of course the GM building. This type of thing is something we've seen Moore do throughout his career and it's fun to see where it started. With that said, there are a few problems with the film and I think some of the interviews go nowhere and really add very little to the film. I also think you have to put up with some one-sided moments throughout the picture. No one is saying the lay offs weren't horrible but nothing is ever mentioned about packages that the people might have been given. ROGER &amp; ME remains an entertaining documentary and worth seeing even if you can't stand Moore's current behavior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is ironically titled "Roger &amp; Me", as Michael Moore tries to get just a few words with villanous Roger Smith regarding the mass devastation that his decision to close the General Motors facilities has caused to both GM's and Mr. Moore's hometown, Flint, Michigan. However, the run around tactics employed by those under Smith work well enough against someone without clout such as Mike Moore, with the audience never getting a meeting between Roger and him until the very end, and even then, it's a very short one.Now, in some under circumstance, this may have been anti-climatic or dissatisfying. But it ends up working better this way because in seeing the Auto Empire spit upon the small, humbled town, we see that there could be no other way. The film would not have had the same vigor if Smith had indeed sat down with Moore and seen the madness. In being denied access to eye contact with the higher-ups, the film does just what it wants to do: it exacts immortal revenge on Corporate America by painting the picture that they are concerned with *only* the Bottom Line, and no matter what they say to defend themselves, nothing will be able to erase the wonderfully bitter violin solo that is "Roger &amp; Me".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of Moore's documentary, Bowling for ... was for me a quite interesting exercise not only proposed a more intense pace for the film but also posited a new position, I found Fahrenheit exaggerated and overstated; I found Sicko simply Moore.But the summary of all the opinions that are generated in me after seeing his "movies" are summarized in Roger and me. Undoubtedly the first Moore's documentary is truly a jewel within the genre. His research, this capability that has to unite and launch facts and conclusions, made his film becomes a product that, while it is far from the origins of the theory of a documentary, it is a good example of make a blockbuster dress of documentary.I don't want to talk much about information management in the film because it seems to me risky to talk about a subject that I'm not know, but what is certain is that the way he presents the facts is more objective and less influenced, although it is the most close to its field staff, perhaps Moore sought to have a more solid principles which results in a documentary well documented and well structured.While the subject does not have the significance of their ensuing years if it is the perfect example which set the pace for what will become every of his works. Roger and me did well in all aspects, not ask more, is a good documentary from a social theme with personal impact, Moore is not intended to save the world or make it a better place, that is working for each one... There is the reflection; Who dares to say that this did not happen? It is not the way to kill rabbits?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it slander to cut someone's speeches in with scenes of poor people getting evicted? No, but it sure is... insinuating. The movie Roger &amp; Me is rare. It shows one side of an argument thoroughly and convincingly - the devastation caused to Flint, Michigan when GM closed their plant and ended 30,000 jobs was undoubtedly bad. Scenes of that, paired with random ignorant people saying "why don't they all just do sumthin' bout it?" really infuriates. While it's not the whole picture of the Flint situation, it's the best, most identifiable, by far most convincing picture. The plight of Flint's citizens, at least, was brought into light and recognized (Of course, the town is still a s***-hole.) There needs to be more movies like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this, his first documentary, Michael Moore explores the closing of the GM plant in his hometown of Flint, Michigan and it's effect on the town and it's residents. Compared to some of his other work, there is not a lot of humor inserted in this film, possibly because it hit so close to home. Also unlike his later work, there is not a lot to argue about in regard to the facts ? this subject is more on an economical level rather than a political one.While the subject matter is difficult to digest because economic ruin can happen to just about anyone, Roger &amp; Me is so compelling that it's ending seems to come quickly. The only part that I had a hard time digesting (with no pun intended) was the `Rabbits ? Pet or Meat' segment. However, this was Flint's reality at the time and Michael Moore created an excellent film to portray this reality.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be Careful Not to Miss the Point...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore is making a key point with this movie that, judging from other people's reviews, seems easy to miss. The point isn't that the people of Flint expected GM to care for them "from cradle to grave," as one reviewer put it. The point was that the working people of Flint, despite doing everything they were supposed to do, despite keeping up their end of the bargain, were destroyed by a corporation that FELT NO OBLIGATION TO EVEN EXPLAIN WHY. That's the symbolism of the attempt to interview Roger Smith and Smith's unwillingness to answer questions.In a corporation like GM, there is no one really accountable for what the corporation does at the end of the day. The stockholders hide behind the CEO. The CEO hides behind the board of directors. The directors cite "the stockholders' will." The PR men blame "market forces" (which is a code word for greed). The union bosses double talk. And in the end, they all dump squarely on the working stiff, who always comes last in the considerations of management.This film is NOT supposed to be a documentary. It's the facts of the situation as seen by a kid who grew up in Flint among GM workers. He feels betrayed, he feels depressed and he feels angry. That's why the film is "manipulative." It's HIS opinion! And even if it IS his opinion, that doesn't excuse the disgusting behavior of all the rich cretins and politicians in this film. Didn't they KNOW that they were on camera?! As I watched, I wondered if America is really as full of snotty, middle-management punks as this film seems to show. And why do corporate androids get so rude when a camera is around? Are they really so terrified of someone exposing them for what they are? Sheesh!By the way: when GM closed down the Flint plants from 1987-1989, they were making one BILLION dollars in profits per year. They took jobs from Americans and gave them to foreigners despite a nice profit margin. Isn't that treason?A good film. A-.Some things to watch for: Sleazy Jeri-Curl eviction man, one snotty PR person after another, Michael Moore's fashion sense, Ronald Reagan looking really dumb and confused, Bob Eubanks' sense of humor, Miss Michigan's off-the-cuff brilliance, rabbit meat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just brilliant.

Many may be familar with the devastating effects of globalisation and capitalism but Moore really gets to the heart of the issue, not through statistics but by exposing the viewer to the real problems of real people, making the documentary all the more confronting.Moore courages and is powerful, refusing to give up or be intimidated despite his task seeming so futile.

Not pleasant to watch, but not half as offensive as most of Hollywood's gratuitous on-screen violence. At least there was a purpose to it. Unlike Bob Eubanks' tasteless jokes. I would have more respect for Moore if he didn't spend so much time trying to make celebs look like a**holes. Did anybody really expect Miss Michigan to contribute something pithy? The absolute best line in the movie was when Anita Bryant quoted Margaret Thatcher..."Buck up, old chums", or words to that effect. Priceless! As for the film itself, it was a little too much about Michael Moore, "auteur". I found it curious that he never once mentioned the population of Flint. In fact, I don't remember much of substance in the film, more a series of heavy-handed juxtapositions, especially the Christmas-eve eviction set to white bread choir music.

		<shortDescription>Roger &amp; Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you want about all the historical inaccuracies in Michael Moore's Roger &amp; Me, this film still accomplishes the overall goal of the director. Moore did not make this film simply intending to tell a story of Flint, Michigan. Instead he aimed to build support for the working class in a battle against the corporate elite.Sure, the fact that the GM layoffs forcing 30,000 Flint residents into unemployment and effectively destroying the city's economy actually took place slowly over a long period of time slightly diminishes the shock value of the film. However, one must remember that these are still real people Moore is interviewing, and their lives have been altered by the layoffs. It does not matter if they were laid off in 1981 or 1984 or years later. The sad state their lives are in is more than enough to prove that the GM layoffs did so significant, although possibly not as significant as Moore would have us believe.</fullReview>

Let's see if we can out-isolationist Charles Lindbergh. The only thing Moore lacks in comparison to Lindbergh is a medal from Göring.Admittedly, in this film, Moore had a bit of self-deprecation to his schtick. In this film, Moore mocks Roger Smith, CEO of General Motors, as an aloof, uncaring elitist. Moore could do that in 1989, but now that Moore has surrendered himself to aloof, uncaring elitism, this characterization of Roger Smith has an ironic twinge. Who really wouldn't rather be Roger's buddy than Michael Moore's?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst CEOs of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary focuses on a decision made by the CEO of General Motors, Roger B. Smith, to close several factories in Flint, Michigan and essentially lay off 30,000 workers who lived there. This decision had a catastrophic consequence for the city and to all of the people who lived there. But what I believe is even more important is that this documentary shows something that most people who embrace "free-market capitalism" don't fully appreciate and that is the difference between "stockholders" and "stakeholders". One would think a responsible corporate executive would realize that these two groups don't have to be mutually exclusive. Yet, even though this one decision was certainly bad for Flint, Michigan another aspect that people also don't see?and one that was not addressed in this video?is that this particular decision was one of many mistakes made by Roger B. Smith which eventually earned him the distinction of being named one of the "Worst American CEOs of all time" by CNBC. But I suppose in the minds of certain people since he and his buddies made millions everything is okay. Such is the mindset of the ignorant. At any rate, this was a good film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.</fullReview>

He leaves his small paper he created to go to San Francisco. It doesn't go well and he returns to Flint. In 1985, GM CEO Roger Smith closes factories in Flint. Michael goes on a quest to get an interview with Roger Smith.The criticism has centered on Michael Moore's manipulation of events in the movie. It's a valid argument if this is being measured against traditional documentaries. As a journalistic documentary, this has many flaws and possibly fatal flaws. As a reality-TV persuasion, this is a real ground breaker. While not every line is correct, the overall sentiment hits on a greater truth.

		<shortDescription>Moore's best and most honest work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over a decade before he was annoying the likes of Charlton Heston and George W. Bush, documentary film-maker Michael Moore was out of work and witnessing first-hand the devastating effects the closure of several General Motors plants had on his home town of Flint, Michigan. Roger &amp; Me, his first feature film, documents Moore's attempts to get an interview with Roger Smith, the CEO of General Motors whose decision it was to move several plants - after recording record profits - to countries such as Mexico, where labour is cheaper, laying off thousand of Michigan workers in the process.Moore's frequently rebuffed attempts to talk to the elusive figure provides much of the film's humour, with Moore's sardonic wit helping make light of what is a serious issue. With no film-making credentials so early in his career and with a membership card to Chunky Cheese his equivalent of a business card, he must rely of guerilla tactics to try and snatch a word with the man. He is kicked out of private clubs and a building where the fourteenth floor is strictly out-of-bounds, and the film is so low-budget that it's a wonder the boom mic doesn't creep into every other shot. But Moore has managed to craft a thought-provoking film despite the budget restrictions, holding a mirror up to Reagan-era America when corporations could simply pack up and move, leaving an entire town crumbling in its trail.When Moore isn't on the hunt for Mr. Smith, he's interviewing residents hit hard by sudden unemployment, following Sheriff's Deputy Fred Ross as he evicts one family after another, and showing the various, often laughable, attempts by Flint to reinvigorate their economy through tourism. Moore has been criticised for playing with timelines and editing in his favour, manipulating the truth to back up his own liberal agenda. While I can certainly agree that this can be a dangerous approach (especially with his later film, Bowling for Columbine (2002)), the documentary medium is rarely as neutral as it lets on and a director always has a right to artistic license . Unlike his later films, Moore thankfully stays out of the picture for the bulk of the film and this allows Roger &amp; Me to tell a more devastating story. Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) may have broken box-office records, but Roger &amp; Me is Moore's best, and most honest, work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, yet typically flawed, Michael Moore documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger &amp; Me is Michael Moore's first documentary feature film. It's more personal than his other films in that it focuses on his hometown of Flint, Michigan. More specifically on the aftermath of the closure of the General Motors plant that was based there, which resulted in the loss of 30,000 jobs and subsequently led to a steep decline of Flint itself. The town developed such a poverty and crime problem that it was named as 'the worst place to live in America'.It's a blackly comic work which constantly contrasts the people afflicted by the upheaval with the attitude of the town's elite. It also takes a dim view of GM itself and its chairman Roger Smith in particular. The narrative thrust of the film sees Moore pursue Smith to try and get a face-to-face interview. Needless to say, he is successful in this endeavour in only an extremely limited way, only getting a very brief exchange late on in proceedings. Moore's approach to this and the film in general is typically manipulative though, setting up situations where he knows he will be rebuffed and including some unfair interview snippets with some quite innocent people, making them look stupid with editing for cheap laughs. When I viewed Moore's work for the first time, this sort of stuff didn't very much concern me but now I find it a little too underhand for my liking.Having said all this, if you accept that documentaries tend to be biased to some degree, I have to acknowledge that Moore does at the very least shine a light on a situation which otherwise would have been long forgotten by the majority of people by now and does give some disenfranchised folks a platform of sorts. And he is a skilled film-maker so his documentaries certainly are dynamic and entertaining which does help in getting a point across more effectively than a more sober treatment would. Roger &amp; Me may be an attack on corporate America but it's often the smaller, stranger details that remain with you, such as the segment about the slightly unhinged lady who breeds and kills rabbits in her back yard in order to survive. On the whole, this film has all of the same negatives that all of Moore's subsequent work has, yet like those too it hammers home its point in an entertaining enough manner to remain in the memory and it occasionally hits upon an interesting truth every so often.</fullReview>

Moore was charged with selective editing, shifting time relations (so that events seemed to follow one another when they didn't in reality) and so on. It is, however, a bit of an unfair charge, not least because these are frequently used strategies of narration.As it happens, Moore's interwoven personal narrative of his home town is ripe for such explication, not least because the film is very clearly a very personal project. While Moore is clearly a key protagonist, his presence really does enhance the affectiveness of the film. While the precise sequence of events has indeed been tinkered with, this often happens not just for political affect but also narrative coherence. Either way, what happened to Flint is, by any measure imaginable a human catastrophe, and Moore's capacity to relate this is as powerful as can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Satire On Reagan And Reaganomics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger &amp; Me is a documentary narrated and directed by Michael Moore. It portrays the regional negative economic impact of General Motors CEO Roger Smith's summary action of closing many auto plants in Flint, Michigan, costing 30,000 people their jobs at the time and economically devastating the city.Once the site of a thriving General Motors plant, Flint went quickly to seed when GM decided to close down and move out. As Moore pokes around what has been described by one magazine as "the worst place to live in America", he finds out how the local populace is coping with GM's betrayal of the American Dream. Among those visited are a family who is evicted just before Christmas, and an enterprising middle-aged woman who set up a thriving business slaughtering and skinning rabbits. Never feigning objectivity,he contrasts the impact of the shutdown on the average Joes and Janes with the diffident reaction of Flint's power elite. The latter's patronizing attitude towards the unemployed multitudes is succinctly captured in the scenes in which visiting celebrities Robert Schuller, Anita Bryant, Bobby Vinton and Pat Boone exhort the citizenry to grin and bear it. Even more out of sync is "Miss Michigan" Kaye Lani Rae Rafko, who in her morale-boosting speech to the disenfranchised GM employees begs them to pull for her in the upcoming Miss America pageant! The film's through line is Moore's futile effort to locate GM chairman Roger Smith, so that he can show Moore first-hand the utter devastation of Flint.In this documentary,Michael Moore makes a good movie, and without inventing so many facts inspite of his obviously conceited and simple- minded attitude.Also,this is a this is a scathingly biting satire of Reagonomics that captures the zeitgeist of the late 1980's. This portrait of Reagan's America and the tarnish on the American dream comes down to a simple question: what is corporate America's responsibility to the country's citizens? That's a question no one at GM wants to answer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story About an Interview which never Happens Makes for an Amusing and Poignant Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The irony of this film is if Roger Smith, then Chairman and CEO of General Motors, had agreed to Michael Moore's request in 1987 when Moore began production, there wouldn't be a film, or at least it wouldn't be half as interesting as it turned out. Moore simply wanted to interview Smith and take him on a day-tour of Flint, Michigian where he and the GM executives decided to close several of their car-manufacturing plants. Instead, Smith avoids the encounter, sending Moore on a kind of corporate wild-goose chase which ends up being both amusing and heart-wrenching.The tragic under-story which is really at the heart of Moore's film is how Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan, essentially goes down the proverbial sewer once the plants began closing, because in all likelihood, the GM executives did not understand how entwined the plant was with the local economy. Unemployment went up, businesses closed, houses went into foreclosures, people were evicted from rentals, and crime escalated. At one point, Flint becomes the crime capital of the United States. Certainly, to blame all of Flint's problems on the plant closing may be unfair, but most of the people who made the decisions to close the plants, particularly Roger Smith, are unwilling to talk about it. Moore, as far as I can tell, never demanded Smith reopen the plant. He just wanted to talk about how the life of the town had changed as a result. But talking about it would mean having to look at it, and look at it is not what Smith wants to do, which is I think the whole point of the film.At some point, Smith and the execs of GM become aware of Moore, his mic, his cameraman, and his crew, and hide from him at all costs, despite repeated requests for an interview. His employees as well as one of the lobbyists for the car industry, most of whom were not making 1% of Smith's yearly income, have to make excuses for him. The few who are willing to talk to Moore on camera rationalize that the decision to close the plants were in the best interests of the company, and that GM has absolutely no civic responsibility whatever, only the responsibility to make lots of money for their stockholders. Because Smith avoided Moore's microphone and camera, the irony itself makes interesting fair for a documentary film. The viewer's first thought is, what's he hiding? Of course, if Smith and his fellow executives made such a good decision by closing these plants right at the height of their profits, they should have nothing to hide and welcome the opportunity to explain their reasonings. Their avoidance of the conversation is quite telling."Roger and Me" was Michael Moore's first documentary and became the prototype for all his later projects. Moore interjects all the elements that will become trademarks for his future films: Moore's voice-over, classic film footage, home-movie footage, interviews with local people, footage of local events, and the most interesting of them all, going to the large executive suites, trying to get interviews. He did the same thing in his most-recent film, "Capitalism: A Love Story" where he used a blow-horn in front of a New York financial firm yelling "Give us back our money!" In Roger &amp; Me he simply tries to get to the 14th floor of the main GM Building. At the time, the security and company managers didn't realize this would be tame by "Moore" standards.One of the more interesting developments is the numbers of celebrities and singers who come to Flint to try to inspire the town, everyone from the televangelist Robert Schuller, Pat Boone to then President Ronald Reagan, and Donnie and Marie Osmond make an appearance. Reagan suggests that the unemployed leave Flint and relocate to another state where there are more jobs. Sort of reminds me when certain politicians in the 1850's suggested African-American slaves relocate back to Africa. It's not only unrealistic, it's kind of insulting. Even Bob Eubanks, a native son and the MC for the Newlywed Game, visits Flint. Eubanks admits he knows nothing of their problems or their politics even though he was born there. The celebrities came and provided inspiration in very contrived live performances; unemployed persons got half off the regular ticket prices! The biggest irony is that aside from the discount, these celebrities who have made millions do nothing to actually help the town. The only attempt is an Autoland theme park, sort of like a Disneyland for cars, which bombs and closes after only six months.People have criticized Moore and his films because they distort the facts. But I don't think Moore is presenting a Frontline-like documentary. He uses humor and irony to make his point. The funniest and most-telling scenes are often the interviews of those on the adversarial side which inadvertently end up making his case. My favorite scene is when he is interviewing a few upper-crust ladies at a golf course, most of whom haven't worked a real day in their lives. With their golf clubs and sun hats, they're saying that these out-of-work people need to get off their duffs and do something. All the while they're swinging away at golf balls in between riding around in golf carts. It's so funny that they don't even see how hypocritical they appear. Of course none of the four women offer to do anything for their fellow Flint townsfolk. It's sad that these women could probably make such a difference in these people lives, but all they do is play golf.Certainly, Moore doesn't try to re-open the plant himself. But what he did was tell the story of Flint, Michigan, and I think that's Moore's main contribution. Again, his initial goal was simply to open a dialog. But of course, the minute people are willing to talk, who knows where it might lead?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of Flint presaged what has happened since</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's first major film was one of his best in my opinion for two reasons. First off, since he did not yet have a trademark style, he did not try to go over the top in this film as much as he does in his subsequent efforts. He does his normal routine of tracking people down in an effort to embarrass them by asking them pointed questions, but for most of the film he lets the story and the citizens of Flint do the talking. As you probably already know, this is the story of Moore's hometown, Flint, Michigan, and the utter despair that fell upon it after GM began shuttering auto plants under the supervision of then CEO Roger Smith. The film really highlights how clueless Flint's elite are as to the suffering that all of this "consolidation" is causing. At one point in the film Moore is talking to some wealthy people at a party who seem to think they are doing the unemployed some kind of favor by hiring them to act as living statues at one of their f?tes. When he asks the party goers about what is going on in Flint they seem somewhat offended that there is such "negative publicity" circulating and say there should be more emphasis on the positive things going on in Flint - they name the symphony and the opera. Ah yes, let them eat opera glasses! The second reason I consider this film to be one of Moore's best is that even though this film was made in 1989, it is still interesting and relevant today. This is because the contrast between what average working people have to endure - the struggle to find secure jobs with decent benefits and their increasing vulnerability - and the desire of the captains of industry to improve the bottom line at any cost ... as long as it doesn't cost them ... has only worsened and deepened over the last 21 years since this film was first made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Michael Moore's depiction of Flint, Michigan seems extreme, he successfully justifies his argument. Several critics have properly accused Moore of misrepresenting specific details and timing of events. Nevertheless, Moore convinces the viewer that Flint was undoubtedly deteriorating. He reveals how it really felt to be in Flint at the time. Scenes such as the woman selling rabbit meat as well as residents being evicted helped to further illustrate Moore's point. After presenting satisfied citizens, Moore would cut right to individuals who were angry or depressed with the given circumstances. These transitions initially seem sudden and unusual, but prove to be effective when demonstrating the chaotic atmosphere of Flint. Moore takes a serious issue and makes it downright amusing. Does it really take outlandish humor to make us realize the truth? This may seem immoral and unethical, but Moore does an excellent job using this technique in order to verify his position. Roger and Me is a comical, political, and affecting documentary criticizing big business while letting us laugh simultaneously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roger, Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ROGER &amp; ME was one of those movies I've wanted to see for years but never got around to seeing until recently. I've read most everyone's opinion of it on IMDb, and the biggest problem detractors have with it is that it's too one-sided. To that I say: So? THE THIN BLUE LINE, for example, is just as subjective, and it's a masterpiece. ROGER &amp; ME was an enlightening experience to watch, to say the least.I can't believe how misguided Flint's mayor was in the 1980s; turning that town into a tourist destination was a laughably misbegotten idea that was destined for failure. Add that poor decision with the other problems stemming anywhere from the ignorant vapidity of Miss Michigan to the anti-American relocation of GM's plants, and we get those who might see Michael Moore as some kind of savior.[And Money magazine's declaration that Flint was the worse city in America makes me wonder if its editors had ever visited Camden, NJ - a city scarred by decades of political corruption, racism, mass resident and commerce exodus (Campbell Soup was Camden's GM), brutal crime rates and stunning poverty - a city that only in the 1990s started to claw itself out its self-inflicted ghetto reputation with new urban growth, including a beautiful aquarium, an outdoor concert venue and a minor league baseball team; they're almost enough to let one not focus on the rather large prison erected right on the Delaware River waterfront.]HOWEVER, while the actions of Roger Smith may seem immoral to some, a case could be made saying that nothing he did was unethical, and neither he nor his corporation had any real obligation to Flint or its citizens. Yes, what he did sucked - and his ensuing indifference was appalling - but, hey, that's business.Another thing: Watching reruns of "The Newlywed Game" reminds me of Bob Eubanks' appearance in the movie - especially his jokes ("Why don't Jewish women get AIDS?"). Is Eubanks' sense of humor based more on anti-Semitism or homophobia? And I wonder if that Rabbit Lady still slaughtering her own meals...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mark Of A Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mark of any good film is it's ability to incite equally passionate praises and pans. Fourteen years later, "Roger And Me" still incites those same passions. And why not? It's a brilliant piece of filmmaking. Is it slanted? Of course it is - but to hear this claim from people whose idea of "unbiased news" is Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity is laughable. Is it emotionally manipulative? Yes, it is - but show me any film - short of a PBS documentary on ants - that isn't. This film clearly has an agenda - to show capitalism at the apex of it's greed and the pinnacle of it's indifference to the loyal workers who are, in the end, little more than warm bodies who are expendable when it comes down to the bottom line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film from the heart...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a lot of things. Angry, bold, biased, just to name a few. He is also more. He is a rare original who has an opinion, and expresses it. His opinion might not be right. You do not have to agree with his opinion. But you should at least listen. In a world that seems to be conforming at an alarming rate, his voice has a place. I just saw Roger and Me for the first time, and I admire what the film set out to do. It is a film from the heart of a man who watched as his childhood city was torn away piece by piece. It is a film that leaves no question as to who, in it's opinion, the bad guys (GM Chairman Roger B.Smith, and the rest of General Motors) are. Now, I'm sure that Smith is not the devil incarnate he's made out to be. That's not the point. The point is, that a man like Moore, who at the time, was a regular joe, wanted to know why? They were making huge profits, the economy was good, so why the cuts? why the lay-offs? He asked the man at the top. He never got an answer, and despite what some of the more negative reviews I've read here say, he deserved one. So did all the people who were laid off. I admire men like Moore, men who take a stand, and ask the questions. So what if he lives in a $2,000,000 home in New York? Does that make him a hypocrite? Maybe. But at least he's still asking the questions. More of us should follow his example. The world might be a better place for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conveys the truth of the events even though the details are sometimes altered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in Flint in the 1970s and early 1980s and lived through much of what Michael Moore depicts in Roger &amp; Me. My parents still live there, though I haven't been back since 1990. I know a number of the people featured in film (no, I've never met Rhonda "Pets or Meat" Britton), which is an odd experience in and of itself.Moore takes a darkly humorous approach to the plight of Flint as the auto factories that provided its life's blood closed and his attempts to interview Roger Smith, the then Chairman of General Motors. Black comedy is almost always controversial, especially in a documentary. Yet it's also a very appropriate approach in this case. As tragic as the events ultimately were, many of the responses of the leaders and citizens of Flint were comically inappropriate. Most of the residents knew that Autoworld was doomed from the start, no matter what its promoters claimed. In fact, Autoworld continued a long chain of failed attempts to revitalize downtown Flint, well known to those familiar with local history.Many critics of Roger &amp; Me have correctly charged Michael Moore with distorting some of the details and the timing of events depicted in the film. Yet despite this, Moore produced a documentary that does an excellent job of conveying the overall course of events and what it felt like to be in Flint in those days. Most documentaries, no matter how excellent otherwise, ultimately fail to convey as much of the emotions and experience of their central events.The film also suffers from some production flaws. Many are due to Moore's use of a video camera and fully understandable. In addition, Moore still needed more practice as an interviewer and narrator when he shot the film.Roger &amp; Me is still one of the great film documentaries, benefiting from its flaws and shortcomings as most others do. If you have an interest in the events or film, watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore's Best Film But Misses Roger Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the most creative of Moore's efforts. It details the plight of Flint, Michigan because of General Motors (GM) layoffs in the late 1980's. It is named Roger &amp; Me because the films story line is Morres pursuit of Roger Smith, the CEO of GM at this time, to find out why he is laying off all these workers &amp; moving a bunch of jobs from Flint to Mexico.Remember, this is before the twin disasters of NAFTA &amp; GAAT in the 1990's by Bubba's Administration &amp; Party in 1993. Moores pursuit of Smith is super imposed over the compelling story of the suffering in Flint. All the story telling in this is well done.The film clips of GM's heydays in the 1950's with Pat Boone &amp; Dinah Shore provide a great intro to the film. There are several dramatic reactions by auto workers getting laid off &amp; their desperation. The city of Flints angst is well documented too.Moore never does catch Roger Smith. This is too bad because historically there is a very solid reason that GM started moving these jobs out of the country. Roger Smith would not have told the full truth if he had caught him. Smith would have told Moore that GM was doing the job exodus to remain competitive if cornered.There is something more important which Moore missed &amp; Smith would not tell. The reason GM had to move those jobs is because of a change in Corporate Taxes pushed through in the 1986 Tax Law changes. That change eliminated from the Corporate Tax code the cost of the legal deductions of employee benefits by American Corporations. This made American jobs less competitive with other countries.Government did this in 1986 because they already knew the effect that baby boomer's aging would have on Medical costs, &amp; knew if they remained deductible on US Corporations books, our Government could not afford the future cost of them being deductible. Before you blame Reagen for this, a reminder, the House &amp; Senate were both controlled by Democrats when this passed.Moore is not smart enough to figure this out, which is why this film does not rate a 10 with me. If American Corporations could still deduct employee health benefits on their taxes, there would be no need for National Health Care, &amp; it would start to counter balance some of the effect of NAFTA &amp; GAAT by making the American worker more competitive again. Unfortunately, that is not in both "Parties" best interest.</fullReview>

It, like his other films uses humor and satire to show the slimy underbelly of American corporate practice, and the incestuous relationship between corporations and American politicians.

		<shortDescription>Roger &amp; Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Moore makes this documentary about trying to convince General Motors CEO Roger Smith to visit his hometown and observe for himself the amount of destruction the job cuts to plants in Michigan have done to the economy and to the people themselves in Flint, Michigan. It is also the beginning of Roger Moore's quest as a filmmaker to be personally offended by everybody who doesn't agree with his philosophy. Moore presents a good case for us to consider: why would General Motors cut thousands of jobs in the United States as well as strike deals with the UAW (United Auto Workers) to recover billions of dollars in benefit cuts, only to send those lost jobs off to Mexico? Well? uh? well, Moore never really answers that question. He implies the company is restructuring their business strategy to become more involved in the highly lucrative weapons manufacturing business, but he never expands on that line. Instead, his attention diverts away from the GM Company and towards the people of Flint in their struggle to get their lives out of the gutter as they lose their jobs by the thousands while plants close all around them. And so I'm confused by Moore. Is this movie an attempt to whistle blow on the GM Company for leaving the car industry to join the arms dealers of the world and then to address the issue implied there, or is this a sentimental story about the people of Flint and their sad attempts at picking themselves up out of the gutter of America? One subject has more power than the other and he clearly chose the wrong subject. This fact is what makes Roger &amp; Me not nearly as successful as the highly focused film he made fifteen years later. Roger &amp; Me was a tremendous starting block for Moore, but it wasn't until Fahrenheit 9/11 that his film-making career found its plateau and his investigative nature found its home. Good early work for a first time filmmaker. Found this at the University library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important documentary on the callousness of big business.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Roger and Me" follows documentary film maker Michael Moore on his efforts to confront GM president Roger Smith about his controversial closing of the Flint Michigan GM plant.It begins with a small history of the town, showing Flint's heyday as a thriving, prosperous community proud of it's General Motors based economy. Real footage from the 50's and 60's is mixed with Moore's home movies, to make a "Wonder Years"-esque opening to the film. Things take a horrible turn for the worse when GM closes it's main plant, laying off thousands of folks, with more closings and firings in the years to come. We see neighborhoods go from prosperous and happy to largely abandoned, with eviction notices haunting the remaining souls that stay around. Efforts to rehire auto plant workers at local businesses such as Taco Bell largely fail, as does a desperate and laughable attempt to reinvent Flint as a tourist attraction. Case in point... the Autoworld indoor theme park that closed within a year of it's grand opening. When you watch the scene that shows the animatronic auto plant worker singing a love song to the robot arm about to replace it... don't be surprised if you feel a nauseating mixture of absurd irony, and callousness on the part of GM. Do not expect this movie to have a feel good ending. It does not, nor does it even attempt to. It simply presents the cold harsh reality of the situation. And make sure to be prepared to turn away during the second time that Moore visits the woman that sells rabbits for "pets or meat". Most people understandably get rather squeamish when the woman kills and skins a rabbit on camera, that she had just been cuddling in the scene before."Roger and Me" will probably be stocked in the comedy section in your local video store (as it was in mine), but aside from some clever jibes at those that stand in his way, and the ridiculous out-of-touchness of the high-falutin rich ("There's LOTS to do in Flint... there's the BALLET for instance!!!") most of the movie is a depressing trip through the rapid decline of a once thriving town. This is not to say it's a bad film... on the contrary, it is QUITE good, and should be required viewing for anybody that continues to exhibit a blind faith of the American business structure. </fullReview>

It is pretty clear that Moore is manipulating our emotions, but damn if he doesn't do it so well.The documentary is both biographical and autobiographical in nature. Moore narrates the story of his life, but more than that, the story of his hometown Flint, MI. After General Motors puts tens of thousands of people out of work, Moore goes on a quest to meet GM CEO Roger Smith and get him to come to Flint and see what his meddling has wraught. Along the way we are treated to an eccentric cast of characters who couldn't have been invented if you tried.The story of Flint is tragic, and the way GM and people who side with GM act will annoy, aggravate, and confound you at every turn. Moore wisely plays this angle for humor. As interesting and moving as a film "Roger and Me" is it is always very funny.

		<shortDescription>Moore's "Roger &amp; Me" seeks the truth about the death of an American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stereotype #1: Michael Moore is a liberal prankster who makes a one-sided, left-wing propaganda piece and calls it a "documentary."The Truth: 100% Dead-on. It really helps that the viewer realize Moore is not a director out to make bipartisan political pictures; he's angry and wants to do something to change America for the better.Stereotype #2: "Roger &amp; Me" is one of the greatest documentary films of all time.The Truth: Bullseye, baby - two-for-two.In 1989, Michael Moore, then a 35 year-old native of Flint, Michican, picked up a video camera and a microphone and embarked on a quest to seek Roger B. Smith (of the film's title), the Chairman CEO of General Motors, and find out why he closed down the GM plant in Moore's hometown of Flint. In doing so, Moore made his first movie "Roger &amp; Me," a rough, (mostly) brilliant, funny, and sad expose of corporate America's reign of terror against blue-collar working men like himself.There's no two ways around it; this is one of the best documentary features I've ever seen, as I'm sure most Americans, even Moore's detractors, can relate to the desperation of his current predicament. General Motors was at the height of its profits during the late '80s, as we're told, so you have to wonder: Why would it close down its Flint plant, knowing it was the number-one source of employment there?I don't know, and neither does Moore, whose personal quest to seek the truth sends him on a whirlwind tour across the country as he tracks the elusive Roger and attempts to have a sit-down with the man. Along the way, however, Moore also meets a number of colorful characters, many of whom whose lives have been drastically affected by the General Motors plant's closure.We meet the local sheriff, who has now been reduced to evicting unsuspecting tenants from their homes. These scenes are indeed unflinching and hard-to-watch because you can't help but be made to sympathize and at the same time be angered that such things are happening, which is an emotion made all the more passionate by the fact that what's going on is real.Another native of Flint is a woman who's forced to sell rabbit meat to have some kind of income. Our encounter with her culminates in the film's most notorious scene (and one of the other presumed reasons for the "R" rating, aside from the harsh language), which is when she beats a rabbit to death and skins it, right before our shocked eyes. Perhaps Moore's camera lens doesn't flinch once because he knows this is what she's been reduced to as a result of a lack of suitable employment in Flint.Flint goes to shambles as a result of the plant's closing down, and the town looks a lot like a war zone. Moore's narration is mostly angry and resentful, something which would become more refined and apparent in later films. Here, he's angry, as he's effectively adopted his signature persona of the Everyman who's at war with powers far greater than he is while also fighting for his slice of the American pie.Whenever Smith appears on camera, he's definitely shown to be arrogant, smug, and pigheaded. (Sound familiar?) Just watch one of the film's ending segments where Moore appears at a business conference and pleads his case before Smith and other investors. When you think it couldn't get any worse for Moore, the light shines off his rumpled everyday figure and he's brutally ignored by the others, left standing woefully in the dark corner where he remained the rest of that evening.We know that Reagan's downsizing policies during the '80s affected a lot of Americans in some very negative fashions and that's made crystal clear with "Roger &amp; Me." Moore seemed to have struck gold with this picture, as it was set to become one of the most popular and acclaimed movies of the year in 1989. It, of course, allowed him to define and shape his image as the political gadfly and make more, controversial movies, like "The Big One" (1997), his Oscar-winning anti-gun feature "Bowling For Columbine" (2002), and last year's Bush examination "Fahrenheit 9/11" (2004).But before those movies, he was just the everyday guy with a video camera seeking the truth. This film does contain some of his trademark stunts, which include Moore heckling the security officers in the lobby of the General Motors building. Regardless of your political leanings, it's hard to not cheer him on in "Roger &amp; Me." Though Moore personally considers this film to be a failure (because he never did talk to Roger Smith, and no new interest was generated in Flint as a result of this picture), he made a fantastic movie that captures the death of the American Dream, and the death of his hometown and the reason why it died.Filmmaker Michael Moore has become of the one of the most valued figures on the political landscape. As a libertarian Democrat (who hates both libs and cons), I often find myself sympathizing with the liberal cause, and Moore's antics as a liberal prankster. He's just as valuable to liberals as Bill O'Reilly or Ann Coulter are to conservatives. With "Roger &amp; Me," one man, armed only with his microphone and camera, proved change and inspiration can be possible, even in the most dire of times.10/10</fullReview>

From the woman who slaughters rabbits for meat, to whole families with young children getting evicted on Xmas eve, to the end credits which say "This movie cannot be shown in Flint ........ because all the cinemas are closed down" this is one movie that should make you angry. Thank god for people like Michael Moore. This is Michael's first film - and his best. Raw with genuine emotion and real pathos. Okay it ain't as glossy as Bowling For Columbine and cheaply made, but it still remains a powerful testament to the genius of his journalism and tireless investigative searching - for honesty, justice and truth. I urge you to buy this DVD and show it to as many people as possible..... or urge them to buy it, now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scandalous behavior from corporate America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has a unique way of opening up american society.He does not rant and rave at his subjects.(he lets them do that) he does not accuse them of anything that is anyway untrue and he just speaks for the working class which makes his a hero in my book. Although this is no Bowling or columbine this is as interesting and considering this was made 13 years earlier his style has hardly changed at all. I presume Mr Roger Smith is now dead considering his age at the time of the film and i bet he at no stage wanted for anything unlike the people who's life he ruined in the name of profit.Rest in peace...Not likely.Good riddance. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no more a "documentary" than Columbine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie 14 years ago. It is not a documentary but a political statement. Michael Moore was born in Flint Michigan and was angry that General Motors had closed auto plants there, throwing some workers out of jobs and, in some cases, out on the streets. The plants were closed because GM couldn't make a profit, partly because the Japanese were designing better cars but mainly because the United Auto Workers' members were making $60-65 per hour including fringe benefits (in today's dollars) and quality was lousy (just look at the workers in the film). So Moore tries to get an interview with Roger Smith, the head of GM, and is turned away (he probably showed up un-announced). If Smith had met with him and explained the situation, there would have been no movie! Now Moore is happy to bank big bucks from his movies and books. I guess capitalism is OK when you are on the winning end. What a hypocrite!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see many people have chosen to bash this film about what it has done to Flint, and Moore himself for not caring about Flint. The only reason Moore made the film was to draw attention to the situation going on in his hometown. He did not do this with malice he did it with empathy towards his fellow citizens.If you had seen The Big One you would realize Moore has done a lot of things to try and help Flint get back on it's feet and defended the city itself quite a bit. He tried to get Nike to open a factory their to provide jobs. When Phil Knight wouldn't he made him agree to match him $10,000 in donations towards the Flint School System.He didn't make this film to destroy Flint, he made it to try and wake people up and prevent it from happening elsewhere in the world. I don't understand why you would be upset at Moore for bringing attention to a problem and then taking the time throughout the years to try and help. He can't fix Flint, Michigan or America by himself. That is why he makes these films and books.To show the people a problem he thinks is serious enough for all of us to address and try to fix. I don't agree with all of Moore's opinions but blasting such a great film over some personal issue you have with him really does nothing to get your point across. I give the film an 11/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A common look at life in corporate America. Thanks Michael Moore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the way that Michael Moore had the guts to make a film about the layoffs and downsizing that many American towns experienced in the 80's. Moore picked his hometown of Flint, Michigan to focus on the problems that people faced with the closing of the GM plant. The whole time Moore looks for answers and tries his best to talk to GM CEO Roger Smith but like all owners Smith turns cold. Roger &amp; Me showed just how a company can treat many workers and how the town like Flint suffers. The plant downsizing even caused a crime jump it did a great job to show how the poor economy can make a highway for crime. I feel like this film can be a little like my town and any other town that has experienced a weak economy just the depression and uncertain things you feel. I wish more film documentary types like these could be made to tell the truth and to have the guts to search for answers like Michael Moore did. Thank you Michael. Roger &amp; Me is a movie for anybody to watch.</fullReview>

There was history and humour combining to make for a nice film.However, there is a disturbing scene...*SPOILER*...in which an odd woman clumsily beats a bunny to death right in front of the camera, then proceeds to hang it on a tree, skin it, and cut it up. This had absolutely nothing to do with the topic or events of the film, was very disturbing to watch, and to me, was what demoted this otherwise above average film to a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agit-prop Documentary Film Making at its Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll get this out of the way first: I was born in Flint and lived in the Flint area until I went away to school. The last time I spent significant time in Flint was the summer of 1984, which coincided with the opening of the Waterstreet Pavilion, and Autoworld (I still have the souvenier mug, and if Michael Moore ever come to visit me, he's drinking coffee from it). There may be some things in this movie that are not entirely true, and the movie is slanted, but the feel for Flint is absolutely dead on.*SPOILERS*The idea behind the movie is Moore trying to get Roger Smith to visit Flint; or rather, those areas of Flint that have suffered while GM has abandoned the town in favor of cheaper labor. Moore has an everyman demeanor, right down to the "Out for Trout" hat he wears throughout the movie. This allows him to get away with a few things that might otherwise tick us off: the guy at the Private Club and the Security Giards that force Moore to leave are just poor schlubbs doing their jobs, after all. On the other hand, I felt a moment of justice when Moore was almost gleefully unfair to a Flint PR flack whose move to Tel Aviv coincides with, but probably did not actually cause, the intafada, or when the GM applogist PR man was laid off. Moore's personna also allows him to play the innocent: his surprise that the elevator at GM's World Headquarters do not actually go to the 14th Floor is priceless, even if he probably knew in advance that they do not go there.Coupled with the attempts to get Smith to visit are the attempts by the Flint City fathers and mothers to try to revive the town, and the residents whose lives we get to see a bit of. Particularly notable are Fred the Bailiff, who evicts people from their apartments every day, and the Bunny lady, who pets and talks to a cute little rabbit, just before braining it with a steel rod and skinning it for dinner.All in all, the movie is funny and poignant and sad. Smith never visits Flint, of course, and Moore's one chance to speak at a shareholder's meeting is ended when his mike is cut. And all of the hopes and dreams of the people of Flint to resurrect the City come acropper. And we are left with the sense of sadness for the wasting of human potential and outrage at Smith for allowing it to happen. Which is of course a simplification, but the simplification Moore wants us to make. The movie succeeds in its purpose and entertains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ninety minute moan about how a man's hometown has been destroyed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time that I lapped up anything that was produced by Micheal Moore because I believed that his documentaries exposed the greedy and corrupt nature of American capitalism. The truth is that there is a lot about what he is producing that is simply not true, or even if it is true, does not actually set the scene properly. This film is a case it point ? it is not really a film about an American company that is exploiting its workers, and destroying the planet through pollution, it is rather an ninety minute moan about how a bunch of factories closed in his home town and the effect that it had upon the town itself.At the beginning, he suggested that the reason that the plants closed was so that they could move the plants to Mexico where labour is much cheaper, and the truth is that this is happening all the time, but he seems to completely ignore the fact that Toyota still have factories in the United States which are employing workers, paying them decent wages, and making a profit. Some suggest that it is because Toyota makes better cars, and that is probably the case, however I am not one to comment because I have only ever owned one car, so I really don't have much to compare with (though I owned the Australian version of a GM, while my Dad owned a Toyota, and to be honest with you, I could not really tell the difference).Another reason why factories are closing and workers are losing their jobs is because of something called progress. With the introduction of robotics, there has been less need for workers to do the work that robots now do, but he seems to suggest that this is a bad thing. However, the company must remain competitive, and if the company were not to bring in a robotic workforce simply to keep people in a job, then that company is going to find itself in trouble. Further, with the onset of the GFC, GM actually did end up going bankrupt, and that was despite all of the cost saving measures that Roger Smith had put in place.While I am not endeared to the Republican propaganda that has surfaced with regards to Michael Moore, what we find is that Moore simply uses the same tactics as they do to simply make his point. The truth is that one needs to rise above those lies and deceits that are used to create a picture of reality that is simply not true. We have seen this recently in the Australian election, but the truth is that I suspect that the Australian people did not actually buy all of the rubbish that the Liberal party were putting out over the media, but rather they were simply sick of the in fighting and the back stabbing that was the Labour Party, and I suspect that if the Labour Party were to pull themselves together or (as I suspect will happen) the Coalition crash the economy in the same way the George Bush crashed the American economy, the there will be a massive swing away from them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a star is born</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When General Motors chairman Roger Smith closed the factory doors in the once prosperous auto capitol of Flint, Michigan, the subsequent citywide depression prompted filmmaker Michael Moore onto a personal quest to confront the GM executive with the consequences of his corporate greed. The result is an irreverent but sobering report that works better as a satire than a documentary, mocking the rich and defending the poor with an almost savage disregard for objectivity.Moore is neither an impartial observer nor a polite critic of Reaganomics, and his guerrilla-tactic documentary is, without apology, a totally biased dissection of the American Dream gone sour. On its surface the film is a record of the director's comic odyssey in pursuit of Smith, who Moore holds personally responsible for transforming his hometown from a proud capitol of industry into what Money Magazine later called the worst city in the USA. But of course Moore himself is as much the subject here as his elusive quarry, and he sets himself up as a champion of the common worker while sometimes poking fun at the same people he should be defending.It's easy to see how the director maintains a straight face, but he doesn't demand the same from his audience. And while his film isn't exactly a comedy, all the ironies and absurdities found in the clash between optimistic civic fantasy and harsh economic reality still provide a hilarious (if morbid) portrait of America in the 1980s. It's too bad that Moore isn't above getting laughs from cheap shots at Conservative mouthpieces like Pat Boone and Bob Eubanks (foolishly sharing ugly AIDS jokes on camera), none of whom are responsible for the Flint City economic chaos.Self-serving humor aside, there's more than enough truth here to shake the confidence of even the most stalwart Republican, with some absurd (almost surrealistic) juxtapositions of rich and poor, contrasting the pipe dreams of civic recovery (Pat Boone recommends a more positive attitude) with the economic nightmare of layoffs and evictions.In retrospect, Moore's need to make a crowd-pleasing movie may have spoiled his aim to hold Smith in any way accountable for his corporate negligence, and the facetious tone and black-comic digressions don't do his progressive agenda any favors. On top of which the director's self-serving publicity (for example his unlikely claim that the project was financed by an ongoing bingo game) has the unfortunate side effect of distracting attention away from the issues, to sell his own blue-collar credentials.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply Flawed But Mostly Great, And Definitely Worth Seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* A Few Spoilers*Hmmm - how to start here? Well - first - I'm a hard-core leftist. I'm also an agnostic, and I hate being preached to, which is at the root of my Michael Moore problem - preachiness either a) makes your opponents defensive, cutting the possibility of debate and discourse, or b) you're grandstanding, being a star whilst preaching to the converted (a real waste of time if ever there was one). And I'm very sorry to have a 'Michael Moore problem,' because ROGER &amp; ME is a great film, far surpassing most of what he's done since.There's at least one major flaw - presenting jumbled chronology as a 'documentary' for purposes of proving a point is a biggie (well-documented elsewhere, certain of the bankruptcies, like the hotel and Autoworld, which both went kaput before or early on in the layoff cycle, even though they are presented very late in the film). But the great moments are many: the end scene of Roger Smith's 'Dickens' speech, intercutting footage of a very irate and freaked out woman getting evicted from her house on Christmas is absolutely devastating - very, very bitter, but also moving - this has to be among the most powerful scenes to appear in a recent American film. And an earlier juxtaposition also devastates - Moore's friend, interviewed on a basketball court, describing his nervous breakdown (sobbing and driving as The Beach Boys' "Wouldn't It Be Nice" plays in the background), then cutting to a shot of an abandoned, rat-infested neighborhood as the same song starts - full volume - with a sharp snare drum hit...There are other random moments that offer bleak and bitter lessons in sociology: pets-or-meat, the tweaked guy at the blood bank, the feminist-turned-Amway salesperson. Bob Eubanks will be forever immortalized as a real piece of work, and Anita Bryant and Pat Boone - easy targets though they are - do nothing to redeem themselves either. A great many of these random moments offer (let's be honest) plenty of humor - yep they're easy targets, yep they do or say ridiculous, disturbing or pathetic things and the cumulative force of all of these moments drives home Moore's anti-corporate, think-local-or-else argument. It also offers a bit of an unintended moral - try at all times to be (or sound like) a sensible and intelligent human being as much of the time as possible, whoever or whatever you are, and take care during those unguarded moments.There are also poignant moments in spite of Moore's apparent intent - the aforementioned Amway salesperson instantly springs to mind. She's making some money - and if she's as smart as she seems when Moore introduces her, she's well aware of just how much of a crock it all is. But she's also putting food on the table - which as a college-educated, underemployed service-sector not-making-hardly-any-money type (all too common amid the gyrations of the post-millennial economy) who works my butt off, which I can relate to profoundly. I've ridden and fallen down corporate ladders, traveled, consumed great film and literature, and would sell Amway in a heartbeat if I had to, as keeping a roof over one's head tends to boost coping skills like virtually nothing else. She's presented as pathetic here, which doesn't fly - feeling sorry for an intelligent human being (especially one with a healthy survival/work ethic) is degrading and cheap.Yeah he's got an agenda, and I often get sick of having it rammed down my throat, so I'm occasionally resistant with his newer work. And there are a few too many cheap shots here - he could've easily pled his case without them. But this is also true of plenty of folks on the other side of the political fence as well. This remains a flawed, but still very powerful film - check it out, remain mindful that it isn't perfect, take it for what it is, and feel free to think for yourself.</fullReview>

(i dont know but making former GM worders human statues at a party sure seems like a slap in the face).i guess you can worry and whine about moores political opinions if you like, but if you do then you have missed the larger points about greed and poverty that this film deals with very well.</fullReview>

Roger and Me shows a real life example of the devastating effects of unemployment. This movie has everything: comedy, drama, and many moments that are stranger than fiction.

So, he takes a video camera, and documents the sweetest revenge ever produced on film. His "goal" is to bring GM boss Roger Smith to show him the poverty he has left behind in Flint. Of course, he is unsuccessful in this effort, but succeeds on many other levels. He takes big swipes at General Motors, The Flint Tourism bureau, Bob Eubanks, and others with a film that is so funny that it is only after viewing it you realize that it is equally as angry.

		<shortDescription>Powerful attack on the corporate world; a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is EXTREMELY refreshing to hear from someone in the media who doesn't bow and scrape to the lumbering corporations that control every aspect of global communication. Rather than push the corporate doctrine of "profit is everything," film maker Michael Moore pulls back the curtain to reveal the true, ugly face of capitalism."Roger &amp; Me" examines how Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan is affected when General Motors closes down a series of factories in order to set up production in Mexico. The town is devastated, economically and spiritually, because GM was practically the only game in town - the city was built around GM.Rather than interview labour experts and union representatives - people who would side with him - Moore talks mainly with GM executives and Flint citizens, building a damning picture of General Motors along the way. It becomes clear that GM cared only for making more and more money, for attaining the greedy goal of progress, while neglecting the human need in Flint.The elimination of jobs in Flint would be understandable if the company was going under, but GM was seeing record profits! Moore repeatedly tries getting an interview with the titular Roger, Mr. Smith, chairman of General Motors, so he can invite the CEO to Flint to see the devastation GM has caused. As Moore is stymied at every attempt, we get classic footage of security guards and low-level flunkies trying to shake the dogged film maker off their backs.Moore is a master of irony, effectively poking apart GM's lame excuses regarding the massive lay-offs. (A particularly effective montage is when Roger Smith's festive Christmas speech is intercut with footage of a former auto worker being evicted on Christmas Eve.) Moore lets the GM PR guy paint himself and the company as heartless by letting him state matter-of-factly that a major company owes nothing to the town in which it was born.The film is more than just a stinging indictment of GM, though. There is a powerful vein of despair and sadness running through the film. As Moore illustrates the desperate lengths to which the town and townspeople have resorted, we see a portrait of a town that has lost it's soul. (Who can forget the woman and her pathetic rabbit farm or the attempts to turn Flint into a tourist centre? "Our new spark will surprise you!")Serio-comic in tone, "Roger &amp; Me" is a passionate piece of work that reveals the evil that corporations do to the people who depend on them for a living. With it's heart in the right place, this film speaks up for the working man and makes itself heard loud and clear.</fullReview>

It really doesn't matter if Moore altered his chronology (as charged by the accusatory editor of Film Comment in the piece "Michael and Me") -- the spirit, intentions, and general truths about the auto workers whose lives were destroyed are deadly serious and dead-on. Whether one decides to call the film a "reality-based entertainment," a "documentary-style movie," or simply (as I prefer) a documentary, Roger &amp; Me is essential viewing for people in the market for searing, intelligent commentary on a few of the things that are wrong with America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore became really popular (sort of) with his 'Bowling for Columbine' but years before that documentary he already knew how to make them. 'Roger &amp; Me' is Moore at his best. Although the subject will not have the same impact as with 'Columbine', and is therefore probably not as good, 'Roger &amp; Me' is probably more believable for people who do not really like the way Moore approaches things. Here he looks at the city he was born in, Flint, Michigan, and what happened after General Motors decided to close the factory that was located there. He wants to speak to the man responsible for the closing, Roger Smith.If he will succeed in that you will see in the documentary, but on the road he also does his usual things. Talking to the people who are fired in Flint, listening to their thoughts. This documentary shows us more simple facts and less simple cheap shots than 'Bowling for Columbine', is more a documentary than Moore's 'The Big One' (in which he showed us his book tour for the book 'Downsize This!'), has less impact than 'Columbine' and has the same amount of comedy to offer. If you didn't like his other works there is still a good chance you will like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore tries to create a montage here reminiscent of 'JFK'. While Stone modified the truth for the sake of cinema, Moore twists reality for no gain other than selfishness. He loves highlighting the stupidity of others. Watch the reactions of the indifferent individuals he interviews.Overall, Moore's rawest film and for that it is interesting to watch. When Mike tried to make a regular film--'Canadian Bacon'--he failed.So, being clueless, Moore shows he is only a journalist--nothing else. He hasn't changed.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too slanted to be worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I'm about as liberal as anyone I know, but I cannot support Moore's blatant bias any more than I can support Limbaugh, O'Reilly or anyone else on the right's bias. Misrepresentations of a situation are lies no matter which end of the political spectrum they come from. Coming from my political position, I also find it insulting that Moore would feel he has to do this manipulative work in order to justify his position. In order to do this he has invented an almost new form of documentary, one that is the complete antithesis to the spirit of the genre, one that is without objectivity. When he gave the statistics about GM and how much money they were worth, that has to do with a) the overall size of the company, not its percentage profits and b) the total net profits of all the plants, not the profits of the Flint plant.Politics should be about open debate attempting to reach a truth, not simply trying to shout across your very-slanted view on an issue without leaving room for the opposing viewpoint. Moore's tactics make him no better than his right-winged opponents who he lambasts, in a way I am embarassed his is "on my side".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engaging, yet deceitful expose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore does a great job displaying the horrors faced in the small town of Flint, MI after massive lay-offs, but does so in a deceitful way. Many events have been re-arranged and blown out of porportion where Moore see's fit to cram it into the film. He takes footage and events from different years and rearranges them in a way that benefits his cause and plays on audience emotions, like the brunch with President Reagan that happened YEARS before any lay-offs. While a good story, his storytelling pratices are a bit shady, to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Moore really delusional?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being in born in Flint, I grew with this film. Now when I watch it I realize how absurd it is. Making a poor receptionist feel like they are the cause of GM's pullout just because she doesn't know where her boss is. Moore really is delusional. He recently claimed the MPAA gave Roger &amp; Me and `R' rating because of the rabbit scene but, as he put it, `They had no problem with a man being shot because he was black.' Now I concede that the MPAA is the biggest tragedy that has befallen movie making, but, to say they approve of people getting shot just because they are black is nuts. When I was deployed in the Marines to Turkey a few years back, the base was showing this movie on the base movie channel, after every showing people in my squadron would come up to me and apologize for where I grew up. I thought that was funny.Flint leaders (the ones that are left, Mayor Woodrow Stanley was recently recalled :) ) are still fighting the image that this movie left on the city. Things are better, the University of Michigan-Flint just opened a new $70 million dollar building to add to their ever-expanding campus, Mott Community College just opened a new tech center, and the Colleges will save the city. Moore, on a recent trip to U of M-Flint, talked for nearly an hour on how this city is significantly worse since the 1989 film came out. Sure, less high paying GM jobs are here, and that's a good thing, it helps versify the work force, so if GM collapses (think Enron) Flint will suffer less. And even as he was standing yards away from the new $70 million dollar building, Moore still didn't have a good thing to say about Flint. I've met Moore a couple times and he is a good guy, I'm sure he loves Flint, and he deserves credit for putting us on the map with Roger &amp; Me, but he carries a grudge upon every company in America that over rides any message he tries to sent with this "documentary". I guess there is never anything to be optimistic about on the Left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a rough start, but still the work of a genius filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Controversial documentary filmmaker Michael Moore's first film, Roger &amp; Me, is a socio-economic examination of Flint Michigan, Moore's hometown, in the wake of a massive General Motors plant shutdown in the late 1980s.Moore's films are great examples of why one's personal beliefs regarding the veracity of the material should not interfere with one's evaluation of a film. And as documentaries, these are excellent "tough cases", since one of the conceits of the genre is that most of the content is "true".In a nutshell, I love Moore's film-making, but I strongly disagree with his politics. I also think that he has a tendency to manipulate his material to an extent that he loses credibility. He's a propagandist. But what a propagandist! As with all other films, I judge Moore's work solely on its success as an artwork. As an artist, Moore is nothing short of genius. He easily gets his strong statements across, often using extreme irony in a kind of filmic Gricean implicature. He's consistently humorous, even in the direst of circumstances. He has an incorrigible "down-hominess" in his appearance and delivery. He is a master craftsman, with an eye for just the right footage, whether new or stock, and an impeccable sense of timing.Despite all of those general assets, Roger &amp; Me isn't Moore's best work. It has rough spots. But considering that this is the debut work from an innovative filmmaker basically forging a new subgenre--he has a completely unique approach to the documentary form--the rough spots are understandable.For me, Roger &amp; Me is most fascinating when it examines two kinds of Flint Michigan citizens, contrasting them against each other so that it seems they're living on separate planets. On the one hand, we have "average" citizens trying to cope with the economic downturn however they can. The woman selling rabbits as "Pets or Meat" is a captivating subject who could have easily merited an entire film on her own. On the other hand, we have the ever-optimistic Flint politicians and economic developers, pumping money and enthusiasm into increasingly bizarre projects, ultimately geared towards promoting Flint as a tourist destination despite it's exorbitantly high crime rate and its status as the #1 worst place to live in America according to Money Magazine.Almost as entrancing are the celebrity contributions towards morale boosting. Their disposition is as transparent as the politicians', with plugs for their products and projects never far behind their feigned concern. However, Moore is just as intriguing to watch as he does what he does best on camera--make a pest out of himself. He continually pushes the boundaries, basically seeing how far he can go until he'd be arrested for trespassing or harassment. While some may be sympathetic to his political causes, it doesn't take much empathic ability to put oneself in the shoes of someone trying to work or enjoy leisure time, and instead being hassled by a frumpy-looking guy sticking a camera in their face and generally being belligerent. It's not that far removed from Howard Stern's approach to "on-location" celebrity interviews. Like Stern and crew, Moore is as fun to watch in this mode for making an ass out of himself as for showing ostensibly less-than-congenial or less-then-admirable sides to his subjects.As for politics, my point of view is much more similar to the Flint-area lobbyist Moore interviews. I disagree that companies owe their workers a living. One has to be resourceful and adaptable to survive. But as I mentioned, I do not subtract any points for not agreeing with a filmmaker's message or political view. Moore succeeds partially because he gets his message across so well, propaganda or not. On this end, he's brilliant when it comes to editing. He knows just what section of footage to use to make his subjects look as he wants them to look, and he's a master at juxtapositions that emphasize or undermine points as he requires. I believe that all documentarians and journalists do this, by the way, just not with the same amount of skill. Moore is admirable for making the technique less opaque. He doesn't seem to be pretending that he's "objective".Roger &amp; Me's rough spots are mostly technical. Some shots are blurry, some are not framed as effectively as they could be, and so forth. Occasionally, Moore lets a scene linger too long here, and the film doesn't always flow as well as it could. Maybe these points seem worse in light of his later work, which avoids all of these problems--he's learned and developed a lot as a filmmaker over the years.But this is crucial viewing for anyone interested in Moore's work, for anyone interested in documentaries in general, and especially for anyone sympathetic to Moore's brand of American Liberal politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Political Satire of the 1980's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should say at the beginning that I am far from being an unconditional admirer of Michael Moore's work. For the most part, neither his films or his books have impressed me. Only once, with Roger and Me, did he ever succeed in doing what he attempts so often. With this movie at least, he has created a perfect work of art which also carries a clear and effective political message. Without ever seeming to preach or to distort what he records, Moore demonstrates the devastating effect the shutdowns at General Motors have had on his home town of Flint. He manages, without giving the impression that he is trying, to make the viewer feel his contempt for the vacuous celebrities, business leaders, and politicians who offer useless advice to the workers left unemployed by the plant closings. This is a very funny movie, but also an extremely bitter one. It inspires not merely laughter, but a sense of outrage and moral indignation quite rare in the films of the last two decades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, there is a fine line, and Roger &amp; Me steps over it just as all of Michael Moore's projects do. To consider any of his projects documentaries by any stretch of the imagination is laughable. They are fiction, plain and simple. Yes, many documentaries present the facts in such a way as to back the director's personal slant. But Moore takes it a step further. He purposely excludes material that completely contradicts his views. And he misrepresents footage as well. Because of this, it is hard to trust anything you see in a Michael Moore film.</fullReview>

It is hurt by the fact that less people have seen it, but I would have to believe that most who have seen it, love it. It is such a funny and yet powerful movie. Michael Moore is an extraordinary teacher, the type that teach you without you even realizing it. I watch Roger and Me and I feel very entertained, then I get that tingle that makes me want to do something political. I start to want to make a difference for the better, and then I watch another movie and forget about that, but still, Roger and Me is great. Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The male Susan Boyle? Decades without a partner must have caused him immense emotional pain to lash out like this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During university, our Philosophy professor, Mr.R, played us "Roger &amp; Me" in its entirety. This was at a time when the obese misfit was still pretty much unknown; a charlatan-in-the-making, a soon-to-be-household-name who was still busy honing his fact-bending skills and still learning how to manipulate the easily impressed, the pathologically paranoid, the mentally ill, the sexually frustrated, the illiterate, the semi-literate, the clueless, and the laughably gullible among ye.As we finished viewing it, I thought: "Yeah, it was somewhat entertaining - in a totally daft Bugs Bunny kind of way - but what an ultra-biased, anti-Capitalist propaganda turkey that has no objectivity whatsoever this is; its sole purpose being to take cheap shots at people and ideas which the film's creator has pet-peeves for. This isn't a documentary by any stretch of the imagination." However, our beloved Marxist professor was absolutely thrilled with R&amp;M, and we ended up not only NOT criticizing any aspects of it, but Mr.R actually spent the remainder of class praising its "qualities". Just so we understand each other, the words "propaganda", "viewer manipulation", "left-wing Extremist", or "selective fact presentation" never exited his perpetually smiling mouth... And just to remind you: this was supposed to be a philosophy class, not INDOCTRINATE YOUR STUDENTS WITH YOUR OWN POLITICAL B.S. course.Anyway, now I get to the really interesting aspect: this professor, Mr.R, is now a highly successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He has written several left-wing scripts with A-grade stars in them.The moral of the story: those are the kind of people for whom all doors are open in Hollywood.Michael Moore is a talentless filmmaker (which he proved beyond a smidgen of a doubt with "Canadian Bacon"), but being a Marxist liberal opens doors to just about anyone. Tinseltown is teeming with rabid pro-Chavez extremists, hence why political brainwashing through simplistic portrayals of reality has been part-and-parcel of the Hollywood experience for many decades now.Embrace this demagogue and you've betrayed your own brain forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Truth in this Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a native of Flint, Michigan I can tell you this film is full of lies. Those weren't GM workers he showed being evicted and if someone making $30 an hour back in the 80's was evicted, he was an idiot for not saving some money! If you want to find the greedy money-grubbers that caused GM to leave, you need to show up at the local UAW (United Auto Workers Union).My entire family worked in the plants in Flint. Both of my grandfathers were lifelong GM men who retired from GM and lived out their last years on GM pensions. My father decided early that he didn't want to be a "shop rat" and chose another path. He was the only one to get out of the plants. Of my uncles that went to GM instead of going on to college, all of them still work for GM. NONE of them lost jobs, their jobs were relocated to Auburn Hills, Pontiac and Spring Hill, TN. The ones that lost jobs were those with lower seniority and of course new jobs were lost but Moore doesn't mention that it was the unions that priced the workers there right out of a job. These unskilled labor jobs were paid more than some college-educated professionals. What really happened in Flint? The unions tried to strangle GM and GM said enough is enough and left! Add to it that Flint thought it would always have GM and didn't make any attempts to keep the company there. When other communities were begging for plants to move to their area and they were willing give tax-breaks, land, etc. to do it, why wouldn't they move? Don't get me wrong, I hate what happened to Flint. Our entire family has moved away from Flint, with the exception of my Uncles who still work for GM. I just wish Michael Moore was brave enough to tell the real story about the unions fat-cats who get rich on the dues of the workers. Let him tell the story of workers who have struggled through long strikes only to have to pay their union dues for the entire time they were striking. Tell the story of these union guys and show their lifestyles and you will see who really is greedy in America! They are nothing more than organized mafia extorting workers and any business they are affiliated with. But, the Unions wouldn't stand for any truth to come out about them. Moore would go the way of Hoffa if he tried. And, of course he wouldn't, because the unions OWN the Democratic party and Moore is obviously one of their BIGGEST (no pun intended) mouthpieces. What gets me is Moore acted so concerned about Flint when he made this film. Do you see him doing anything for Flint? No! He's the worst kind to me. He chooses tragedies and exploits them for his own personal gain and fortune. This was the first and only Michael Moore film I ever plan to see. If you want truth, you will have to look to another filmmaker to give it to you. Moore makes his living twisting the truth and profiting from the tragedies of other people's lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adulterated by Moore's Self-Indulgence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented Roger and Me with the highest of expectations. Seeing that it was ranked by Siskel and Ebert in the top 3 of all films during the year of 1989, I figured it must've been quite a potent and well-done documentary. Unfortunately, it just couldn't live up to expectations, due to some problems I have with what I saw of Michael Moore.The scenes displaying the grandeur of Flint during Moore's childhood contrast very effectively with the shots of Flint that show the decadence of the city because of the massive layoff. It is almost difficult to watch, as the viewer sees just what pathetic lengths Flint will go to to try to elevate its position in the world and re-instore morale into its people. Attempts to make Flint a major tourist attraction flop miserably, and soon the city is forced to resort to exploiting a new prison's opening by offering couples a chance to "spend a night in jail" for only $100. Residents, meanwhile, are forced to do whatever they can to keep from getting evicted. One woman has a sign in front of her house offering to sell rabbits as "pets or meat", and unfortunately the actual skinning of a rabbit is shown along with the cramped and terrible situations the rabbits live in. The way Flint reacts to being named the "worst city in the nation" to live in by Money magazine is notably humorous, as residents burn magazines of the paper and use pathetic means of support to convince themselves it certainly isn't true. A lot of humor is present in such scenes, but it is the bittersweetness that is touching and powerful. While truly the tragedy of the Flint situation is conveyed well through such ways, it is tainted by Michael Moore. His views regarding the situation in Flint can best be characterized as "sardonic". He appears to have little compassion for the situation, and this made me speculate that he is only making a documentary to exploit such a filmmable world he lives in. He constantly shows the "bad guys", whether it be uptight Athletic Club directors, elderly wealthy women, or Roger Smith itself. There is literally no point to this, other than to make these people scapegoats for a tragic situation. Moore even further tries to make himself seem like some sort of moral hero in front of these people, as he asks them pompously what they think about Flint's condition. I felt worst for Ms. Michigan. His treatment of her was quite cruel, as it was clear she didn't really know the depths of decadence Flint had sank to. He portrays her as being stupid and uncaring, yet she merely is the average citizen(I doubt she lived in Flint since she was Ms. Michigan and seemed unfamiliar with the city..if I didn't know about the GM situation back then, how was she?) Moore's voiceovers even further taint the documentary, as he wastes time talking about meaningless nonsense instead of showing more scenes about the conditions the people of Flint had to contend with. We're not allowed to think for ourselves, even though I'm sure we'd come up with a lot of the same conclusions.While powerful and effective in showing Flint's situation, I just can't give this my full endorsement because of Moore's apparent selfishness. I hope I am wrong concerning my views about him, but I just didn't see any evidence to the contrary. My apologies, sir, if I am incorrect. The film otherwise is great, and it is stunning that Moore was able to record such telling interviews from both sides of the Flint tragedy.Rating: 7/10, recommended</fullReview>

The actual idea on why making the movie took about 10 seconds to present. The only ones who can be interested in this film are those who lost their jobs and want to know why. They might find some of the interviews interesting. A different edit might have made an interesting documentary of this, but I doubt it, the interviews shown were not engaging in any way.

		<shortDescription>leftist propaganda with-shock here- a sense of humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was my first exposure to the Leni Riefenstahl of American leftism: Michael Moore. I laughed my a** off at this movie. Michael Moore was just so adroit at setting up a scene- and then delivering the punch line. Michael Moore is such a dumpy fat hog- you have to like him. If you find that kind of hog to your taste, however-you will continue to accept his loser lefty weltanschaung as real. Michael Moore has bigger fat to fry however- and this movie is a calling card for stupid and bigoted intellectual frauds to come. The basic thesis of this movie is that General Motors-GM- is an evil corporation. I suspect GM has many sins. As do I. I suspect Michael Moore expects GM to be a kind of paternal father and spiritual fountain of ethics- like Moses and Buddha and Jesus-wrapped up in a neat little package with a happy-smiley-face. I suspect Moore wishes that GM would be like a maternal fairy grandmother who grants every wish for every little princess and prince-disguised as an auto-worker- could want. I suspect Michael Moore is really p**sed off about things in general. Lefties are just p**sed off about everything. This really helps them live fruitful lives. Just ask a lefty who is now 50 or 60 or 70. Lefties just love Michael Moore because he wallpapers over the failure of their lost years of "activism". Lefties just love to " speak Truth to Power". I think lefties, of which I was one, are now Left-Over and sad regretful people. That is Michael Moore's sad demographic. That said, this is a funny movie and a good film. It is Michael Moore at his finest: a funny and intelligent and sardonic guy who has a gift. He has a way with a microphone and a camera. He perhaps misuses his fine gift. Just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a hardcore conservative nor a Michael Moore hater, but after watching this movie I actually felt pity for the people that watch movies like this and take the bait 'hook, line and sinker'. I watched this movie because I enjoy documentaries and always seek to educate myself. Unfortunately this movie hardly qualifies as educational since it fails to present context, commits the logical fallacy of 'appealing to emotion' and is simply an ingenious masterpiece of manipulation. Please be smart enough to question the things that a brilliant propagandist like Michael Moore presents to you and look deeper with a critical eye.I assume that the majority of people who watched this movie already knew they like Moore and were going to agree with any argument he presented; therefore they rave about it's insight without putting any additional thought into what they have seen. These people shouldn't bother to read my review any farther- they have already made up their mind and don't seek to learn anything. For those interested in some critical thinking here goes:Movie Summary:Michael Moore focuses his attention on the town of Flint, Michigan after massive GM layoffs have caused an increase in poverty and crime. He interviews citizens of the town and pursues GM CEO Roger Smith under the guise of 'An Interview'. In what has become Moore's trademark style he interviews people that we are obviously going to feel bad for (since we don't envy their position). He mixes these interviews with clips that make the "guilty" parties look stupid. He then follows with attempts to badger other "guilty" parties into interviews which they sensibly refuse to accept (making them look even guiltier).Critical Thoughts:1) What a display of selfishness and egocentrism!! People around the country and world starve to death, live in filth and crime and never get a chance at a better life... but never mind them, lets focus on the people of Flint and demand something better for them! The people of Flint have had access to some of the best educational opportunities in the world, they live in a country where basic education is mandatory and higher education can be paid for by the government (either through loans or the GI Bill). In lieu of this many people of the Flint, Michigan area were tempted by the fruits of a high paying unskilled union job that can be easily replaced by foreign workers or automation. It sounds harsh... but when people think short term and fail to invest in themselves this can easily happen. If you want someone to blame for this, blame you local union who jacks up the price of labor far beyond what its really worth. When you can make $20 for doing a job that requires no skill its inevitable that the company will move your job somewhere else. Once again, we need to stop being self centered and realize that $20 will save a whole village from starvation when a job is moved to a foreign country.2)Moore makes fun of Flint's local government for trying to bring tourists into the area. Sadly the government tries to do something productive that will bring long term resources into the area and Moore just criticizes it. Sure, Autoworld and a Hyatt may be bad ideas, but who can you blame for this, the politicians or the people who elected those politicians into office? Our government is a Republic, which means we choose people to make important decisions for us (a government for the people, of the people... kind of). Democracies and republics depend on an educated population who can choose wisely- when our government makes a poor decision, we must accept that ultimately we are to blame for it. In regards to this whole segment of the movie, my real gripe is that Moore simply criticized the governments good natured attempts to improve things and offers no suggestions for how he would have done things differently. Keep in my this segment of the movie is littered with clips intended to make the local politicians look stupid.3) Capitalism works, deal with it. I have a relative that only buys domestic vehicles. Although the intent behind this is good, it completely destroys a fundamental attribute of America's success: competition spurs innovation. When people buy things because they are "American made" they don't motivate domestic auto makers to improve their product, they allow the manufacturer to become complacent and eventually destroy any competitive edge the company has. My point here is, that if GM wants to stay in business it must be competitive. In order to be competitive, GM must maximize profits. In order to maximize profits GM cannot use old world manufacturing techniques that at 'new world' prices (they can't pay top dollar for manual labor when they could be using automation for the same cost or low dollar labor with the same or better quality). Keep in mind that at the time this movie was made, American auto companies were losing business to Japanese auto makers who were making a better quality, cheaper, more efficient vehicle. In order for GM to progress it had to refine its processes; sadly this meant that it had to lay off the people of Flint. This has happened for scores of years as America has evolved, the coal cities died, the steel cities died, and in the end the country will evolve and be better because we learn to adapt rather than to make silly business decisions.4) CONSTANT APPEAL TO EMOTION!!! When an academic tries to argue a point they supply facts in valid logical form and draw conclusions. When Michael Moore tries to argue a point he presents some facts, presents a conclusion and fills the gap between the two by appealing to your feelings of guilt for the victims, disgust for the guilty and condescension toward any who disagree. I MUST ADMIT THAT I DIDN'T FINISH THIS MOVIE. When Moore showed a woman hit a rabbit on the head and then proceed to skin it, I turned the movie off. This display of barbarism was intended to make me sick that these poor people were lowered to this level. I admit that the scene made me sick, but I was sick that these uneducated oafs would resort to animal cruelty instead of going to another town to look for a job! This scene actually convinced me that GM did the right thing by moving the plant since the only natural resource in the area was a ubiquitous abundance of white trash. I was even further sickened by the fact that Moore would feel that it was necessary to show this scene... it provides absolutely no LOGICAL value to the movie. It does however make all of Moore's minions cringe and blame the death of the rabbit on Roger Smith and corporate America.Sorry to ramble on, but I saw this movie and I was disappointed. Disappointed that Americans will only watch documentaries that are actually entertainment/political statements rather than educational and disappointed that so many suckers watch this garbage and just believe it without thinking twice. On a final note I will admit that Moore is a genius in this genre; he has found a formula that captures people's attention and makes them feel superior. The viewers think they are watching a high-brow documentary and can join in on the condescension of politicians and wealthy elderly female golfers. Hopefully since Moore is now a deca-millionaire after the release of Fahrenheit 9/11 he will give away all his money to the people of Flint since he feels that they so rightfully deserve special treatment- lets be honest though, both you and I know that Moore's compassion ends at his own wallet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I was always fond of Moore's 'The Awful Truth', over the last couple of years I started to grow a disliking towards him and his documentaries, of which I thought 'Bowling' wasn't really saying anything and 'Fahrenheit', although an improvement, still took way too many liberties to really be taken seriously.So here's 'Roger and Me', or 'A Humorous Look at How General Motors Destroy Flint, Michigan', as the subtitle is. Viewing these titles there are numerous errors to be found in it: 1. It ain't humorous. 2. GM did not 'destroy' Flint. 3. The title should be: Me, Me, Roger and then Me again.Let's take all these points by the hand. First off, there is little humor to be found in 'Roger and Me'. It seems Moore doesn't really have his wit or originality from The Awful Truth yet, and it shows. As voice-over, he makes some supposedly humorous observations, but everybody can do that after-wards. It's when confronted eye-to-eye Moore should be at his best, but here he's more of an observer than questioner, until after-wards he finds his tongue back in the voice-over room.The second point of which I am protesting is the claim that 'General Motors, and it's president Roger Smith in particular, destroyed Flint', the town Moore grew up in. GM simply decided it would be cheaper to move it's factories to Mexico. It's a simple, and logical, business decision, made by Smith because he is being payed to generate as much profit as he can for General Motors. Now, if Moore would have his way, then: 1. Business should not do the economically best thing. 2. The USA should shut it's border for foreign products. 3. Workers should come before stockholders. Now, I am not claiming such a system to be 'communist, therefore bad', but it is a *change of system* he would want to happen, not a change of a single decision by a single company. So he shouldn't seek up Roger Smith for that, but the US president, congress, he should have held a referendum. In other words, he should be fighting politics, not cooperations.The third main problem, and we've seen it in his recent documentaries, is that Moore is a smug 'look at me, I'm so socially and politically correct' kinda person, who offers some questions but never seeks out to truly answer them. Within this documentary he follows the routine 'Rich and mean guy shuts down factories. Honest and good poor people suffer. Poor people forced to sit around doing nothing and having problems with the police because of rich guy'. End of story. There is never a true analysis, as said before, of the system, it's just picking an easy target to blame for everything that has gone wrong. And that's the end of the story. The title itself is misleading as well, as Roger Smith barely speaks a few words. In honesty, Moore tries but Smith refuses, over and over again. But years later, watching Moore unjustly slamming a good-willing Charlton Heston in 'Columbine', I'm sure Smith (if he's still alive), will see the justification for that refusal.So, what is Roger and Me then? Other than one-sided (which was to be expected), it's also a pretty boring experience. If 'Columbine' had some humor and 'Fahrenheit' had an interesting issue at an interesting time, 'Roger and Me' fails on all accounts for making a good documentary. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's documentary is brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore shows the many ways in which his hometown of Flint, Michigan has suffered from General Motors layoffs in his documentary, Roger &amp; Me. Moore depicts the economic and social devastation that has occurred in this city as a result. The purpose in his seemingly endless quest to find GM CEO Roger Smith demonstrates how difficult it is for the average American citizens to speak with someone at the top. Business leaders make decisions that can affect an entire city yet they are so detached from the people whose lives they are altering. Moore's ingenious use of satire provokes his audience to question how such a tragedy could happen and if it could have been prevented. This film is highly creative and provides an interesting view of corporate America that is fascinating to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this film, I had no idea what to expect. What I saw greatly interested me. It is the basic story of how a large corporation's influence on a small town, has serious effects on its economy. It was interesting to see how Moore chased Roger, and even greater still to see his reaction, which I think makes a very powerful statement, and validates Moore's point father. When I looked into some of the data collected in the movie, I found it to have missed out the odd piece of information here and there, simply to strengthen Moore's point. Whilst I felt like I had been lied to, and this remains to some extent true, I also see that Moore had to do what he did simply to make his point. Would the film be anywhere near as controversial or interesting, or powerful, if it weren't for his manipulation of data? all that being said, I would sum up my opinion into one sentence, don't rely on the factual information, and certainly don't believe everything you see, yet at the same time Moore makes an excellent point, that is, big business can have a great, or terrible effect on its local economy. The film was interesting, somewhat informative, and at the same time, kept the viewers interest with various comedic scenes, which whilst funny at first, upon reflection, these scenes do not appear so amusing. maybe when we say he was making fun of those unfortunate people, he was actually trying to make us think more into not only how bad their lives were, but about our own opinions, and faults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Then and Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when it came out, and like most everyone else thought it was a fantastic and biting documentary, filled with equal mixes of satire and tragedy. Some parts I still remember vividly, such as the Amway woman trying to make a living amid the economic collapse, and the infamous pets or meat rabbits.But seeing it again recently through older eyes, and knowing now how extreme left Michael Moore's politics are, I felt disgusted with it. It's obvious how extremely manipulative Michael Moore is in his interviews, playing up anything for his view alone. He shows up at a country club asking where Roger Smith is at and his whereabouts and habits, and what does he expect but to get shown the door? However, he edits it into the movie to show how Roger Smith was eluding him. He asks people not even remotely connected to General Motors about the plight of Flint, and get what he wants, polite but ultimately uninvolved answers to again edit into his world view.Where was Michael Moore and his camera during the dot com bust and all the tech workers being laid off? But then he couldn't as easily documented those situations as an evil corporation for him to cast his jaundiced eye on. Moore's goal to portray General Motors as a heartless corporation that doesn't care about it's employees still works, but his portrayal of himself as a crusading everyman with a camera ultimately comes across as false and hollow. "Roger and Me" in it's essence is not a documentary but a near fictional account of Michael Moore's "quest." As a movie it's still worth seeing, if only because it was made before Moore's politics came to the fore in his movie making.</fullReview>

I felt bad for Mike though because he was unable to get Roger to go to Flint with him so he could see the distruction that he caused by closeing down the factory.It was sad to see all those people being kicked out of there homes and to see what the town once was and what it had become. I think that one day Roger will get whats coming to him for all the damage that he has done just so he can get more money for himself.</fullReview>

This documentary is a very good example of big business, and exactly how much they care about their working American. Im not saying that this is how every business is run, but Mr. Moore does an excellent job of showing the very corrupt man Roger Smith, and how he ran GM. Mr. Moore does an excellent job of showing an emotional account of some of the thousands of people who lost there jobs so one man could make a few more million dollars on top of his millions. I recommend that everyone take time to see this movie. Even if you don't like Mr. Moore and his last couple of documentaries(Bowling for Columbine, Ferinheight 9/11), this one is worth watching. I believe that this is Mr. Moore's best work to date, and I think that everyone should watch this. Very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore's Best Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this film, by leaps and bounds, more than I do Moore's more recent editorial commentaries, "Bowling for Columbine" and "Fahrenheit 9/11." This film works in large part because Moore doesn't try to bite off more than he can chew, in that he focuses on a small issue in one particular location, the closing of some GM plants in Flint, Michigan. This movie is no less a polemic than his later two movies, but Moore's intense focus on the effects of the plant closings makes for a less scatter-shot film, with a terse storyline and more time spent on regular people, as opposed to celebrities. Sure, Moore interviews Pat Boone, Anita Bryant, and Bob Eubanks, but he spends even more time on layed-off factory workers, the wealthy elite of Flint, tourism promoters, GM management, and ex-factory workers who had chosen new lines of employment. This diversity of opinion from average people gives this film an intimate feeling that Moore's other two movies lacked.At a very basic level, this movie shows the problems associated with the outsourcing of work by major conglomerates, and the cruel verities of the free market economy on people who are ill-prepared to cope with changing times. Moore's polemic is a powerful indictment of not only the callousness of corporations, but on the lack of concern conservatives have for the common people. In spite of Moore's deliberate bias, conservatives and liberals alike can enjoy this movie as a documentary on how the modern free market economy can have adverse effects on a community dependent on one corporation for its livelihood. Conservatives may sympathize with the GM management person who tells Moore that a corporation has little responsibility to a community, and that its main goal is to make a profit. It is possible to watch this move and form your own opinions and conclusions, even to the extent of disagreeing with Moore's view that a corporation has a responsibility to a community. The dialogue between Moore and the GM spokesman are the best parts of the movie, as the directly deal with the dilemma between corporate expediency, such as outsourcing and lay-offs, and the ill effects those may have on workers.I do have a beef with Moore over his mocking of Miss America. What is this woman supposed to know, or care, about the sufferings of the people of Flint? She is portrayed as callous, or at least to ditzy to know of the sufferings of the layed-off workers she waved to during a parade in Flint. Moore looks upon this naive young woman with a jaundiced eye, but it is quite unfair of him to vilify this lady who apparently had no clue as to what Moore was doing by interviewing her. This sort of guerrilla interview style is one of my main gripes with Moore. He does this, with much more devastating effect, on an unsuspecting Charlton Heston in "Bowling for Columbine," and it was rather unfair of him to manipulate this man's trust in order to paint him as a villain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing, depressing, interesting ? the editing is impact and Moore avoids the ego-tripping that has become his calling card of late</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite having grown up in Flint, Michigan Michael Moore was determined to get out and do something else with his life other than work in the General Motors factory like many in the town. Failing to settle in California, Moore returns to Flint just as General Motors decides to leave. Shocked that a man as warm as GM CEO Roger Smith would abandon the community, Moore sets out to meet him and ask him about the closure. This simple task turns into a three-year quest; meanwhile the city of Flint slides into deeper recession, unemployment and crime.Although this film opens with the usual Michael Moore problem of "me, me, me", it picks up within about 15 minutes as the film becomes more about the community, the impact of globalisation and the inability of Governments to help those left behind. To a degree the film is still about Moore, which I always find to be an irritating aspect of his work, and in this film it does weaken it a little here and there but there is still more than enough to make it worth seeing. Those looking for answers or solutions will be disappointed but as a documentary the film does well to present the "facts" (or at least as close as we're likely to get with Moore). Although chronological flow suffers as a result, Moore delivers a scathing judgement on all involved ? not by ranting and monologuing as he has recently, but simply by shooting lots of material and editing it together in a constantly contrasting manner. So we see Smith quoting Dickens about Christmas and human kindness while we see previous footage of a black family being kicked out onto the street; we see the local government ploughing money into tourism, bringing evangelists to the city to encourage the unemployed to pray for jobs, frantically building terrible attractions and creating lots of service jobs.Of course this is not an easy problem to address and in some ways it is unfair of Moore not to use the film to investigation a solution, but in other ways the film is better for just presenting the depressing reality of big business moving jobs to the cheaper markets. Living in the English West Midlands at the moment I can relate ? our favourite pastime at the moment is shedding manufacturing jobs while an ineffective Government can do nothing other than try and retrain workers for the service industries where many will end up. Those who criticise Moore for not living in the real world are wrong because he actually does a good job of accepting it but also questioning whether it should be that way ? a view that many will share regardless of the economic truths in reality.Overall this is not a great documentary but it is a strong piece looking at the effects of the new world economy, where jobs migrate from the highest cost markets to the lowest, leaving behind communities that slowly collapse once their backbone is removed. It is amusing, depressing and interesting ? not as even-handed as it could have been and the editing that is so effective is also a bit misleading at times, but it is still well worth a look but is hardly cheerful viewing if (like me) you work in the manufacturing sector for a multinational corporation.</fullReview>

Watching Flint trying to substitute entertainment income for automotive production is like watching the USA expecting solar and wind energy to make up for depleting oil and natural gas. It's a pipe dream folks, get ready for a third-world existence.US Oil production peaked in 1971. By the 1980's the cost of doing business using imported oil was making it hard to stay afloat. Since they could not do anything about the rising energy AND materials (oil is a chemical feedstock for plastic, paints, resins, etc.) they found cheaper labor instead. Roger did what he had to do even if it was all mean and whatever to the people of Flint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's Quest Is Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Roger &amp; Me," the first documentary from hell-raiser Michael Moore shows a town that is dying due to the closure of the auto factory. Auto manufacturer General Motors shuts down the auto plant in the town of Flint, Michigan, causing thousands of thousands of people to lose their jobs and the town to go on a downward spiral to disintegration. A determined Moore spends a great deal of the film trying to get then-Chairman Roger Smith to come to the town and to meet the citizens. But there is more to the film than Moore's determination to confront Mr. Smith: we see people being evicted from their homes, businesses shutting down, attempts to boost the economy by any means necessary (which ultimately fail)and some colorful citizens (My favorite is the Bunny Lady). While the poor are struggling to survive, we see the rich enjoy the high life (A party in which people are hired to pose as living statues is incredibly disturbing).This film will anger you because there is no "happy ending": There is no resolution at the end. Roger Smith never meets the citizens, people are still being evicted and the town is in its lasts gasps (Only the rat population rises in the town).Worth a rent or an addition to your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Roger &amp; Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Farenheit 9/11 and the award winning Bowling For Columbine, this is the movie that filmmaker (director, writer, producer) Michael Moore started off with. Filmed in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, we follow the chronicles of (what he wants you to believe) the town's love-hate relationship with General Motors.General Motors started off in that town, before it became the automotive giant that it is today. Michael Moore's from that town too, and start off the documentary fusing together his family's career (most were GM staff) together with the rise of GM. That is, until massive layoffs were made.At some points in the movie, you can't help but feel that that is the way corporations go about, worrying about their bottom line, and outsourcing jobs to the cheaper alternative. But from Moore's point of view in the movie, he's taking it from an everyday working class person's, who naturally, will not be happy with being laid off.We follow him, in his now familiar guerrilla styled interviews, to various families in Flint, to see the conditions they live in, and following the deputy sheriff to evict those who are too poor to pay their rent. His main motive in this movie, besides showing us the working class America, is actually to interview the General Motors chairman Roger Smith, and get him to go down to Flint to take a look at the situation himself.Naturally, being a new independent filmmaker with no credentials, he's being turned away each time he's at the GM head office attempting to make his way to the 14th floor. Staking out the chairman's regular haunts did not rake in any results, but it's kinda hilarious in the canned response that he gets each time he engages with a spokesperson.State officials and their seemingly enthusiastic attempts in lifting Flint out of its depression, like getting evangelists to bless the town out of its current mood, and trying to build its tourism industry, while in good faith, somehow became ineffective, and of course, subtly laughed at.It's seriously not a bad first attempt, sprinkled with the style, humour and satire that you'd come to expect from a Michael Moore movie.</fullReview>

With his current attitude and flashing the "loser" sign to John McCain, the audio commentary shows a more gentle and compassionate Michael. I did not know of his charity work prior and he made many demands on the studio to help the people of Flint.

Another being the focus on what's going on in Flint, Michigan and the other scenes about what people are doing to try and recover from the rough times after the closings of General Motors. I never really thought about it, but I guess in Flint, people relied heavily on General Motors to keep the economy rolling. What I truthfully want to know is, and I don't mean to sound foolish by saying this, but when Michael Moore stated in his film that Roger Smith was going to move his factories to Mexico and hire workers down there for a cheaper price, he didn't actually do that, did he?

Although I have rented this movie as a comedy documentary, I believe it is pretty serious. Yes, Michael Moore has a very sarcastic and ironic way o presenting the facts but he focuses in the core matters and that is the moral behind the facts. I watch Bowling for Columbine and hi did a great job on that documentary too. Roger &amp; Me is not as brilliant as the former but I think the most important is that he has somehow created a new way of making documentaries, which is so appealing as they dig deep in the matter to be presented. Moore achieves its goal, which (to my understanding) is to report the news after making a thorough investigation and at the same time to give a critic position about it. Not only stating his point of view but also allowing the viewer to make up his own.I'm eagerly awaiting for Moore's next documentary because it's clear that he has enhanced his documentary style which is indeed very unique and great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Tom Morello and Steve Earle, Michael Moore is one who likes to "rage against the machine" (insert canned laughter here). Unlike the aforementioned, Moore uses the medium of cinema to get his rather warped view of the world across to those who want to listen. Either be touted as a hero by leftists or a sociopath by right-wingers, one has to admit that Moore's has the balls to make a rather scathing documentary that will stand the test of time. He is driven to try and find out why GM CEO Roger Smith would 30-some thousand workers out on the street for no apparent reason? We never really find out why it happens. The question isn't answered even after thirteen years. In retrospect, this movie was quite shocking and quite biting in back at the time of it's original release and it still retains that shock value and biting wit. Michael Moore has devised quite an intriguing look at how corporate society will pull the rug out for under their workers for no reason. His relentless pursuit of Roger Smith is quite entertaining even though he is trying to prove a point. Regardless of what the point is, he has the guts to take on the GM security to get it across. Overall, this is crafty and ballsy documentary film that will be remembered as one of the best all time. I give this film 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore is definitely one of the good guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's so rare that this kind of humor gets used. When this sort of thing happens, we tend to kind of take it in, and accept it. Moore figured out the value of putting this kind of thing out on the table, "guts" and all. We deal with every day bad guys, our whole life, and when somebody puts that on the screen, it works perfectly. I wish more film makers taped in to something so simple, but so important. It says something about the power of humor. Laughing at this kind of stuff, doesn't serve to excuse it, it makes it more of a monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Noble Crusade that has lead to an ego trip for Michael Moore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter what your position is on the political spectrum, there's no denying that Roger Smith's corporate downsizing was a poor economic mistake for the people of Flint, Michigan. Desperately trying to ask him why he decided to sell off Hughes Industries, and lay off thousands of auto workers, a crusading film maker named Michael Moore showed the world it's miserable impact on the people. Instead he showed us those people -- recently unemployed auto workers as well as the people who relied on General Motors to keep Flint a decent place to live. Among the most memorable people were a man who tried to kill himself after hearing the sappy, sentimental Beach Boys tune "Wouldn't It Be Nice?" on his car radio, and a woman forced to skin rabbit fur to try to make ends meet. This was NOT what the Republicans of the 1980's had in mind when they were attributed to inventing "trickle-down" economics, because the only thing trickling down from these cost-cutting measures is poverty and misery. Like so many cities in America's rust belt, once GM closed their plant, everything else went to hell. And as we all know, the exposure of this despair and the difficulty of his ability to get any answers from the bigwigs at GM made Moore into a cinematic hero of the people. The problem with this movie is the aftermath, specifically it's impact on Moore himself. Once he succeeded at attacking GM, he thought he could go after EVERYBODY with money, power, and influence, and damn the truth. "TV Nation" had it's moments, but far too often there was a lot being left unsaid, and it seemed like he didn't want to hear anything that didn't reflect his P.O.V. The premise for "Canadian Bacon" was too far-fetched for any sensible American or Canadian to believe. At least the South Park movie was SUPPOSED TO be ridiculous. And now there are his most recent movies; "Bowling for Columbine," and the yet-to-be released, but sure to be biased and dishonest "Fahrenheit 9/11," in which Moore actually holds George W. Bush responsible for the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. This is a man who had the nerve to suggest on his own website that he was baffled that the jihadists attacked "cities that DIDN'T vote for Bush." In less than 15 years, Michael Moore has gone from the man who exposed corporate irresponsibility, fascism and injustice(real and perceived)to America's version of Thierry Meyssan, the far-left French nut who claims that 9/11 was a hoax sponsored by the C.I.A.Another bad investment that General Motors made in the 1980's which Moore didn't cover was the selling off of GMC's bus manufacturing to Motor Coach Industries in 1986, because it gives credence to the false impression that "General Motors killed mass transit," a myth that left-wingers like Moore have been living on for decades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is the awful truth "As a native of Flint, Michigan I can tell you this film is full of lies. Those weren't GM workers he showed being evicted and if someone making $30 an hour back in the 80's was evicted, he was an idiot for not saving some money! If you want to find the greedy money-grubbers that caused GM to leave, you need to show up at the local UAW (United Auto Workers Union).My entire family worked in the plants in Flint. Both of my grandfathers were lifelong GM men who retired from GM and lived out their last years on GM pensions. My father decided early that he didn't want to be a "shop rat" and chose another path. He was the only one to get out of the plants. Of my uncles that went to GM instead of going on to college, all of them still work for GM. NONE of them lost jobs, their jobs were relocated to Auburn Hills, Pontiac and Spring Hill, TN. The ones that lost jobs were those with lower seniority and of course new jobs were lost but Moore doesn't mention that it was the unions that priced the workers there right out of a job. These unskilled labor jobs were paid more than some college-educated professionals. What really happened in Flint? The unions tried to strangle GM and GM said enough is enough and left! Add to it that Flint thought it would always have GM and didn't make any attempts to keep the company there. When other communities were begging for plants to move to their area and they were willing give tax-breaks, land, etc. to do it, why wouldn't they move? Don't get me wrong, I hate what happened to Flint. Our entire family has moved away from Flint, with the exception of my Uncles who still work for GM. I just wish Michael Moore was brave enough to tell the real story about the unions fat-cats who get rich on the dues of the workers. Let him tell the story of workers who have struggled through long strikes only to have to pay their union dues for the entire time they were striking. Tell the story of these union guys and show their lifestyles and you will see who really is greedy in America! They are nothing more than organized mafia extorting workers and any business they are affiliated with. But, the Unions wouldn't stand for any truth to come out about them. Moore would go the way of Hoffa if he tried. And, of course he wouldn't, because the unions OWN the Democratic party and Moore is obviously one of their BIGGEST (no pun intended) mouthpieces. What gets me is Moore acted so concerned about Flint when he made this film. Do you see him doing anything for Flint? No! He's the worst kind to me. He chooses tragedies and exploits them for his own personal gain and fortune. This was the first and only Michael Moore film I ever plan to see. If you want truth, you will have to look to another filmmaker to give it to you. Moore makes his living twisting the truth and profiting from the tragedies of other people's lives.""No Truth in this Movie"-it's b******t -you sound exactly like the GM staff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WAY TO GO MICHAEL MOORE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a bold move that Michael Moore made. He was the real good guy. The bad guy was Roger Smith, the CEO of GM in Flint, Michigan. He was having the time of his life, while the auto workers suffered.He was wealthy, part of the elite. But I know for sure that his wealth, won't keep him from dying. When it comes to judgement day, HE'S IN BIG TROUBLE!Everyone plays themselves, including Bob Eubanks. I was surprised he was using curse words. But this was an R-rated movie and a docu-drama. So anything goes.Roger Smith is a disgrace to Flint, and to the USA. And all of his security guards couldn't stop this persistant reporter from getting his word to him. WAY TO GO MIKE!This movie was strong, hard-hitting, and all the way serious. I ENJOYED IT. 5 stars and a 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>arguably Moore's most honest, personal work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of Michael Moore's three feature films ("The Big One" and "Bowling for Columbine" are the others), "Roger &amp; Me" feels less calculated, less strategically-edited to Moore's own lefty viewpoint, and therefore a lot more honest and realistic. The concentration is not on humor or theatrics, but on how a single act of corporate greed devastated an entire city. That it takes place in Moore's hometown--Flint, MI--after the closing of the General Motors plant forced unemployed workers into poverty (one woman sells rabbits for pets OR meat) gives the proceedings an eerie, surreal quality. The title pertains to Moore's pursuit of Roger Smith, president of GM, who cut 30,000 jobs (shutting down 11 GM factories nationwide) while the company was posting record profits (but see, you can set up factories in Mexico and have people work for 70 cents a day and make even MORE profits!); keep in mind this was in the days before NAFTA and the WTO. Moore not only wants to make the crooks accountable for their actions, but he also draws clear contrasts between the viewpoints of celebrities (such as Pat Boone and Bob Eubanks, both Flint natives) and the struggling citizens of the poverty-stricken city; how the views of the "haves" and "have-nots" differ drastically. Granted, "Roger &amp; Me" doesn't have the lighthearted asides of "Columbine" or the thorough scathing commentary of "The Big One," but it is a chilling, infuriating, and courageous slice of Americana that few have dared to match. [It's also ridiculously rated "R" for a few four-letter words and one scene of bunny slaughter.] 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently viewed Roger and Me, a documentary by Michael Moore. I felt that it was a very interesting movie because I had never even heard of Flint, Michigan before I watched this film. It was an eye-opening experience because I got to see all of the lives that were affected by one corporation. I feel that Michael Moore stated some very good points about Flint and the GM chairman, Roger Smith, although I do feel that he was very intrusive when trying to find out information. I also feel that Michael Moore's documentary was factual, but at the same time biased towards the side of the unemployed. Roger and Me was an entertaining movie, but I don't know if I would make any effort to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective film... too bad it is fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film as a teenager. I was moved by the events depicted in the film, and trusted their accuracy.I still see "Roger &amp; Me" as a great piece of entertainment. But now I know how little of it is really solid fact rather than highly manipulative propaganda. Oh, sure, it is very true that Flint crashed and burned economically in the wake of the GM closures. I don't mean that. I mean the particular cases; the little moments that were the most effective.It is a movie, not a documentary (which is why Maltin calls it a "documentary STYLE" film (emphasis added)). Moore's shown his hand in recent years by dropping the facade and coming out with his point of view. His most recent rhetoric in the wake of the terrorist attacks displays ignorance, posturing, and vitriol that makes me almost as mad at him as I am at those who destroyed so many lives in the city I live in.Enjoy Roger and Me. But if you do even the smallest amount of investigation into the events depicted there, you'll get a very different story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my realizations of big businesses and Micheal Moore's lies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw the Michael Moore documentary, Roger &amp; Me. I was aware that it was about the GM Corporation but I really wasn't sure about anything else. I didn't know anything about Flint, Michigan or even that it was where GM began its corporation. As I began watching it I found the hardships which these people faced due to the GM factory closings were awful. This documentary showed what happens to the workers and the surrounding area of these "American" companies when they relocate the factories to Mexico and oversees in order to save money. It was a real eye-opener to what happened in Flint, Michigan however I feel the way that Moore went about getting footage was not right. He was very pushy in his interviews and I feel that he was not sympathetic to the families that were being evicted and the hardships they were facing. The actual footage itself was very deceptive. He showed events in what would have been thought of as chronological order when in fact many of the events had occurred before the closing of the factories actually took place. This enraged me a little bit; due to the fact that I felt lied to and I couldn't really rely on anything else which was shown because I questioned its accuracy. I also feel that the whole point of the documentary, to get Roger Smith, the CEO of GM, to come to Flint was a pointless attempt. I don't see what could have been accomplished if Roger did come to Flint. Overall I feel that this documentary did its job, which was to show was happened in Flint and what happens when these big businesses move their factories overseas or in this case to Mexico.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore's satirical attitude did not convince me to sympathize with the people of Flint. He is portrayed as the only serious character in the movie while others are poked fun at as they struggle with jobs in Flint. Tho gory scene of the rabbit being skinned not all disturbed me but made me dislike the movie even more. It didn't serve as anything but just to get a reaction from his audience. He depicts the families being kicked out of their houses and poor and unfortunate, but it is not just the fault of GM motors. He also manipulated the times events took place to better his position in the movie. Overall, I am not fond of Moore's movies, but Roger &amp; Me is my least favorite of all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few funny bits, but not all that good.It's pretty clearly padded, and strangely lacks both a savage side and personal touch that would have made the movie more well-rounded. It doesn't really engage in the tragedy of Flint from either the side of a full-out rant, a focus on the personal impact, or satire.It ends up being a hodge podge of stuff that got thrown together for no real coherent reason -- the bunny scene doesn't seem to be there for any real reason except to get a few cheap laughs, and what that has to do with GM closing plants is anyone's guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael "please no" Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film aroused a lot of emotion. I felt bad for those poor people of Flint. Theirs jobs tragically stolen away and given to Mexicans, getting evicted from their homes on Christmas Eve, etc. But when I read other sources on the truth of the lay offs in Flint, I lost part of that feeling. I suppose any film maker uses artistic license to smooth over the real story into something more emotionally stirring for the audience. Michael Moore didn't just smooth it over, he manipulated and rearranged facts to make it look 10 times worse and drastic then it really was. On top of that, the people he was trying to help were made to look like fools. He created a cheap laugh at the expense of the residence of Flint. I don't appreciate being fed twisted facts as God's honest truth. And I don't think Michael Moore proved anything but that he's a pushy, poorly dressed, sad excuse of a man who's Machiavelian documentary proves nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was forced to watch this film for my World Reigonal Geography class. This film is what is wrong with America today, instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone else's fault. This film goes through the downfall of Flint, Michigan and blames it 100% on General Motors. In the process of doing so Moore goes to great lengths to make the executives of General Motors out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society. Moore films several evictions throughout the film and does not ever even ask once if the person is being evicted because of a GM layoff. Additionally, he never interviews the landlords of the tenants filmed. Moore goes to great lengths to twist historical events to fit his political agenda in this film of pure propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant! Look for the parallels in "Michael Moore Hates America."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Damn fine work. Too bad Michael Moore suddenly has taken on the title of an Al Franken book only with his name supplanted for Rush Limbaugh. Now the book should read, "Rush Limbaugh is a skinny deaf egotistical jerk &amp; Michael Moore is a big fat idiot."This film however, is pretty damn good. Even though Moore was a hypocritical jerk even then, he still did a fine deed with this project along with the book, "Downsize This!" Moore has the most difficult time getting an interview with Roger Smith, who was no Lee Iacoca for sure, &amp; this film follows Moore as he pursues Smith. At this time Moore was simply a left-wing Bill O'Reilly before becoming a total puts. Roger Smith was &amp; is the devil, &amp; Michael Moore succeeds in exposing him as the Bill Gates of his time. Along with Sam Walton of course. Now, sadly, Moore is now a minion who still thinks he's looking out for the people below him. Only now, he acknowledges that everyone else is indeed beneath him. Watch later this Summer for the documentary, "Michael Moore Hates America," by another Michael. In that film, the other Michael (Michael Wilson) who is decidedly anti-Moore, goes thru virtually the same bunch of crap that Moore did in his pursuit of Roger Smith as Moore is the one this time who won't consent to an interview with Wilson because "he doesn't have to."

		<shortDescription>Regardless of Your Politics, You Can Admire This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are those who brand Michael Moore a hypocrite. It doesn't take a lot of investigation into Michael Moore's personal life to see that there is some legitimacy to the accusation that Moore is a 'limousine liberal'. Don't let the personal attacks on the director however distract you. Roger and Me is a great American film.You don't have to agree with the politics of this piece to appreciate Roger and Me's clever delivery and simple story. A real life industrial city called Flint, that was once a bastion of post-war America, is now destroyed, not by bombs but by the very system the Flint was meant to symbolize.Roger &amp; Me is admittedly, an angry man's look at the hollow promises of the American Dream, but it is unquestionably demonstrated with real people, real events and most of all, a sharp sense of humor. Moore's ability to paint the tragedy of Flint with such humor is what makes this film so enjoyable and a great American documentary.This is a movie of contrasts. This is its magic. It goes back and forth from the dreamer to the near suicidal, from the glamorous singer to the stark butcher, from an executive luncheon to a man with a lunch pail. It shifts from cocktail party to evictions, from misguided politicians openly wasting millions of dollars, to a young child sucking his thumb while being evicted into the snow. It's fascinating to watch it all unfold.Perhaps Moore's greatest observation in Roger and Me is just how desperate people become when trying to survive in rapid economic decay. The really clever part is how he can find a sense of irony and humor around the whole situation. Consider, the hilarious but futile efforts of local and state government to turn a collapsing industrial town into a tourist attraction, while at the same time the local U-Haul can't keep up with demand with everyone wanting to leave. It's both tragic and funny and Michael Moore walks that tight rope so very well in this film.There are striking contrasts all throughout this movie, all the while with keeping a sense of humor. We go from Anita Bryant, telling us, that anything is possible if you work hard and have faith in God, to a woman who separates her rabbits into two categories, 'fryers' and 'stewers' and points to a hand-painted sign that offers both for just 5 dollars. The government several months later cuts off her assistance but spends money to send an inspector to ensure her rabbit cages are 'clean' and up to 'government standards'. It's a remarkable examination of the kind of irony and tragedy the American dream can weave.You can disagree with Moore's politics. You can point to Moore's personal shortcomings and rightly claim he is in no position to pass morale judgement on anyone. What you can't deny however is that Moore's Roger and Me is a valuable documentary. It's a clever look at the cruelties of life, money and society and it offers it all with a sense of humor and irony. You might disagree with the film's message, but you simply have to admire its delivery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the success of films like Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11, documentary director Michael Moore started small with this "one- off" which was considered great viewing by the critics, and being in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I was definitely going to watch. This film documents the regional negative economic impact of car manufacturing company General Motors to the town of Flint, Michigan, with several of the auto plants closing and causing the loss of over 30,000 jobs (80,000 to date). The numerous actions of company CEO Roger Smith also cause negative results, so it follows Moore trying to find and talk to Smith himself in the various places he is meant to turn up, for leisure or business. The various people and businesses affected by the loss of work, capital, funding and finances are interviewed, bankruptcy and bad spending is focused, and archive footage is used well to show all this stuff as well. I did like the attention to detail put into it, and it was certainly interesting to see a town self implode and become "the worst state in America", but I maybe did not find this as engaging as Moore's later works, but overall it is a most watchable documentary. Very good!</fullReview>
