		<shortDescription>A wake up call.. for all of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDb ever, but I thought this documentary deserved it. The cinematography of this documentary is amazing, even the images of pollution of the environment that humans have caused look remarkably appealing to the eye. But this documentary is much more than a stream of beautiful images from across the world.The message that the documentary contains is a strong one: unlike our nations, our ecosystem doesn't have any borders. As humans organized in nation states, we spend 12 times as much on weapons to defend ourselves from each other than we spend on aid for the poorest. The effects of the exploitation of our shared ecosystem will affect us all and will hit those who already face the toughest circumstances the hardest. The problems that our world faces, cannot be solved by any country alone. Too long have we focused on what separates us as citizens of specific countries, without realizing that we are all bound together as human beings. Without a rapidly growing global awareness of the situation we are facing, we will leave a much harsher environment for our children, in which natural resources on which we all depend will become increasingly scarce.I am a student in my twenties; the state the world is in today, is how my generation will inherit it, before we will have had the chance to have any effect on this trend. Can this really be the inheritance of a generation that dedicated itself to peace, love and happiness? Maybe. Or maybe it's not too late just yet. You might still be a skeptic about the message the documentary tries to convey after reading my comments, but I promise you this: it will be much harder to be skeptic about that message after having watched Home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie for ETs to study our extinction, or our escape from it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was gripped from start to end, at first by its breathtaking aerial footage, then progressively also by its even more breathtaking dramatic plot, which we all are living. No wonder Yann Arthus-Bertrand spent 15 years preparing for the production of Home.The narration is top-notch, arranged in perfect logic sense and fueled with precise and profound wording, reminds me of audio versions of Scientific American. I had thought it was a pity that David Attenborough wasn't a part of this amazing project, but Glenn Close, five-time Oscar nominee, indeed gave a mesmerizing voice performance, and along with a powerful score, deeply drew me into Home's elaborate illustrations and logical reasonings.Some might think this documentary is so emotive that it's more of a propaganda despite how fact-based it is, but isn't a subject like this meant to be emotive? No this is not the kind of documentary that presents you with non-judged information for you to consider and debate- of course it is not, it's telling you the most overwhelming and alarming truth through worldwide facts and images in a careful logic flow, and yes with a great lot of passion built in! Vastly connected with the daily life of everyone and the fate of the human race, the movie left me steeped in thoughts. Like said many times in the movie, everything is linked, I find tons of images flashing in my head rapidly after watching Home, and more importantly, now I look at them linked together in a meaningful way.Let me put it this way, if the entire human race were to be extinct on this planet, Home would be the recording that we should bury deep underground for extra-terrestrials to find out what happened and learn the lesson of our species- it is that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Visually Stunning and Beautiful Movie You May Ever See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps it may seem that I overstate my appreciation for this movie. But, when you see the extraordinary compilation of beauty, work and effort that went into creating this work of ART, you may agree.It focuses on the breathtaking gorgeousness of this singular planet we call Home.Some may find this topic boring, repetitive, do-goody, tiresome... but trust me, this movie is BEYOND interesting and entertaining.Some of the scenes are absolutely SURREAL in their beauty. There is one scene of people in a dump... how can such a scene hold so much impact and yet be so artfully gorgeous? I can't get that misty picture out of my mind, and it has compelled me to hope and work towards solutions. In a good way. Uplifted.Question: How can a company (the one that sponsored the viewing of this movie) (Europa?) that thrives on promoting luxury and excess, care so much for the natural and inherent things of earth? It is true that such a company would cherish beauty and art... and the Earth is the most beauteous of all... perhaps when you've contributed to the downside, you grow and want to uplift, see things change for the good.Whatever... this is one of the most beautiful documentaries ever made and EVERYONE should make the effort to SEE.An extraordinary, unforgettable visual treat. For all time.AFTER you see this movie, you MUST see FOOD INC. You MUST!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Home delivers some of the most stunning photography of our planet I've ever seen. Really needs to be watched in HD to be be fully appreciated. Sweeping, glorious, rich shots of our planet, like we've never seen it before.Even more powerful than that - the content of this documentary. The underlying message of Home really drilled home - no pun intended - how we're devouring this planet to hairs breadth of the point-of-no-return, after all "we've chosen survival over prospering". It is really quite scary watching the desperate facts this film delivers one-by-one.At the same time, Home finishes in a upbeat manner. Home will definitely change the way I live my life - it's that powerful.Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning but with questionable content</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I am not a native speaker, so please bear with me! I have seen this movie twice now and I really wanted to like it. I love the Planet Earth-Series and other nature/environment-related movies, but this one is a little...special. First of all, the visuals (e.g. photography) are stunning and very beautiful. Sadly, this is the only real good thing about this movie. What I consider bad about this movie? Well, there are several things:The whole movie has a kind of instructive touch (as in preaching from above to dumb people) and it seems as if the filmmakers thought of their audience as stupid and therefore repeat everything over and over again - maybe they have to, but it still leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. | The narration: Firstly, the (female) narrator is not bad, but in no way can she compare to David Attenborough of the Planet Earth-Series. The narration makes this movie seem a little alarmist, but not in a way that shocks you and makes you want to change things, but in a way that makes you think 'Yes, yes, I know! You said that already!'. Then, there is the vocabulary used. This is one of the things that disturbed me from the start (especially me as a German). Talking about herding cattle as keeping livestock "in concentration camp-like conditions" is not only outrageously insensitive, but also outright stupid. While saying things like this may be effective in creating attention, there are definitely better ways to do so. And why is half of what the narrator is saying numbers and statistics without any reference or comparison? Nobody will remember any of the numbers anyways, so please, at least give us the numbers with a context! | I personally don't like what I call the "spiritualistic approach" of this movie. By this I mean, that it is repeated over and over how everything in this world is connected and how humans are kind of a tumor on this earth that ruins it. While this may be true to some degree it still leaves a weird taste and makes this movie seem like creationist propaganda (which I am sure it is not, I'm just saying that this is not a very smart thing to do). | The movie basically only complains about the destruction of the earth by humans but offers no real solutions. The solutions it offers are ones that are already being used (e.g. using solar power) or are weirdly esoteric ones (e.g. everybody live in peace, the rest will work itself out). - This movie is very over-simplistic and one-sided. While none of the things being said are really wrong, most of them aren't really correct either. By using (debatable) arguments like this, the movie gets a bit of a manipulative touch. | While sponsoring this movie might be a good idea for the companies involved, this leaves one question: Why was every company allowed to put their name on this movie? Most of the companies produce in so-called third-world countries under worst circumstances for the workers and sell the products as luxury articles in industrialized countries and therefore actively take part in some of the activities that this movie wants to tell you about - so why the heck did the filmmakers take their money? | All in all, as a movie, this film isn't very entertaining. There is not really anything more than the visuals to keep you watching it, the narration is basically mostly throwing statistics at you and there is simply nothing new to it. | Another big problem with this movie is, that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It isn't a documentary, but it isn't a normal picture either. It starts with stating that certain things are bad about the way humans treat the earth, but keeps adding stuff until you just don't care anymore. For example, the narrator says, that eating meat is bad for the environment. Then it adds, that coal mining is bad, goes on to say something else is bad and so on. Starting from 'Oh, yes, that's interesting, I didn't know that!' you will go to 'Okay, so everything is bad?' This IMHO also weakens the message of the movie a lot, the filmmakers should have just focused on fewer issues to tackle instead of being against environmental destruction, industrialism, globalization and the military. Don't get me wrong, it is very right to be against all of those things, but being against all of them at once is just hard to communicate in only one movie.Also, please keep in mind that this movie is NOT a documentary in the usual sense of the word. There is nothing that is being documented, there is nothing new and there is nothing innovative in any way about this movie. While this is not necessarily bad, it changes the focus of the film from being a very boring documentary (which, as I have already said, it is not) to what it really is, a beautiful, but still only mildly entertaining movie.So, in short: If you haven't seen the Planet Earth-Series, go see it now! If you have already seen it and watched all the other recent documentaries about environmental issues and want to see this one, go on and see it, but don't expect it to be more than average. Keep in mind what I have written above about this movie not being a documentary and you should be happy with it. About my rating: Considering 10 is the best and 1 is the worst possible rating on IMDb, I gave this movie 6 stars. 5 stars is average, I added two stars for the awesome visuals, none for the narration (above average voice-work, but without any real substance) and subtracted one point for things that really made me angry (for stuff like the concentration camp-reference and similar things).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are we going?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Home is a documentary about Earth, humanity, nature, where we're going and what we've been. Shot in 54 countries with aerial footage it's a combination of all the navel-gazing movies we've seen lately like Planet Earth and Baraka. Like a guilty abusive adult, we're now taking a closer look at ourselves, what we've done to the planet and what we've to ourselves.That's in large part what the first 3/4 of the movie is about. Showing different locations on Earth, the stunning gliding shots of our planet's more beautiful locations as well as the terrible damage we've caused. In that way it's much different than Baraka and Planet Earth, the two films I compared this to. This movie talks about humans, not just their achievements but the economic chaos we've wrought on each other.The vast differences in class structure in the west from the east. The vast amounts of wealth owned by 2% of the population. Starvation, disease, war, are all covered in this documentary. It's not just about the nature but the capitalist system which has destroyed the planet and brought humanity to its knees.Many of these changes have occurred in the past 50-100 years. Vast change which is increasing to the point where urbanization is epidemic all over the planet. The melting icecaps are also covered in very nice detail. The consequences are of course very grim. Some of this information I knew but it's good to be reminded how we live in the western world which is rapidly destroying the planet and taking all the innocent passengers along with us.The movie was released on the internet, television and internet on the same day. It's on YouTube in its entirety, but I downloaded a high quality version from One Big Torrent which was very nice to watch.Probably one of the best movies of 2009 and one of the best documentaries of the year as well. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, scary, hopeful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens with a sequence on the history of life on earth, based on science. But it's somewhat important to understand this history, for points made later in the film.The film shows ways in which our current activities are not sustainable, such as over-use of water, reliance on non-renewable oil and sources of fresh water, the use of agriculture primarily to feed animals to become meat, overpopulation, monoculture, shipping, etc.It spotlights one case in history (Easter Island) to show what happens when a society doesn't react to the damage it is doing to its own environment.I thank the filmmakers for drawing attention to my own country's (Canada's) dangerously wasteful use of land, water, and energy in the tar sands of Alberta and Saskatchewan, in the junkie's quest for harder-to-get oil.Near the end, the film puts some facts on the screen (a few were unfortunately too small to be read). Some struck me as not particularly relevant to the film, such as how many people may be going hungry or thirsty. On the face of it, given the facts in the film, that's a good thing. To clarify, they needed to tie that to the fact that we could fix this problem if the rich used less, and if there were fewer rich.It does end on a hopeful note, spotlighting some cases where people have taken small steps toward stopping our bad behaviours and living sustainably. It is hopeful, but I wish they had dwelled more on that, because we need concrete solutions that we can go to our mayors and councils with right now. Many of them have their head in the sand with petty politics, social issues, labour issues, the recession, and aren't thinking about when it really hits the fan a decade or two from now.The images were mostly wide shots or aerial shots of landscapes, herds, cities, factory farms, etc. and were mostly quite beautiful. I also liked the music. Narration was a bit sparse, and in the English version I watched on Youtube (no subtitles), I think the narrator said "climactic" several times when she meant "climatic". But given the scale of what we're facing, maybe either word is OK.The film was not shown in theatres in my area, nor was it shown on TV, except on the French channel (of course ... all the best stuff is on the French channels in my area) so I did appreciate the simultaneous Youtube release of this film. Given the free home viewing, a torrent would have been even more preferred, for portability and quality. My poor PC had trouble keeping up with the video AND the downloading at the same time.In comparison with Earth (2007), I found this film to be more relevant to today. It isn't about the beauty of individual animals, but rather our entire home, and it clearly lays out that it's changing and that at a minimum we need to be preparing to handle that, and ideally trying to slow the change down. It's more honest.In comparison with An Inconvenient Truth, I think it trades some of the information and style for a richer visual that lets the pictures do the talking. It's been a while since I've seen An Inconvenient Truth, but I think it covers much the same territory. I think Al's lecture approach was effective at drawing some people in and presenting the message clearly. But being a political figure maybe Home will attract some different viewers that may have been driven away by the earlier film just by his presence in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that was made for lots of reasons...but not to rescue the planet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might call it "l'art pour l'art". And stunningly beautiful it is. But 120 minutes of beauty still don't make it a film. A film needs pictures, but it also needs a true vision.It is a published fact that the aerial cameraman Yann Arthus-Bertrand got the funding by Francois-Henri Pinault to shoot this movie long before it was ever decided what exactly it should be. In fact, after shooting for years in more than 50 countries, Arthus-Bertrand returned with a truck load of stunning footage. A lot of pictures and no story. The only common denominator being the expertise of camera aesthetics and an encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of the best locations worldwide. After screening it, he couldn't help feeling a bit helpless, maybe even desperate. He had spent a lot of money and all he had to show for was beauty. Although his sponsors make a lot of money selling beauty, it is rather the story behind the beauty that is the selling proposition. Arthus-Bertrand had no story, except maybe the adventure tales of such an extreme undertaking. This is where Isabelle Delannoy comes to the rescue. A woman who knows neither fear nor scruple. She takes a cunning look at the footage and knows how to tag it. She doesn't care that most funds for this project originate from enterprises selling to the happy few who account for 25% of global pollution and exploitation. Nor, that chasing hundreds of helicopters, jets and piston planes around the planet most probably had a carbon-dioxide balance comparable to a mid-sized western city. Nevertheless, Arthus-Bertrand is happy. Now he has a story and something to show for. Regardless how cynical it is, a bad story is still a lot better than none at all. And here we are: looking at awesome pictures. And again awesome pictures, and yet more awesome pictures...and a narration that should make anyone blush who took money for writing or reading it. So, what is it? It is not a documentary. Is it a sermon? Is it the letter of indulgence for PPR? Or PR for PPR? Or all of the above? It is certainly beautiful. But as in the case of Dorian Gray, there sometimes lies a very ugly truth behind a stunningly beautiful surface...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most brilliant documentaries on one of the most important topics in todays world. The impact the movie has with its simplicity of delivering such a strong message is absolutely brilliant. The way they have shown the different sides of the coin and the vast dispartiy among the various parts of the world was an eye opener. The images presented were something never seen before and thee facts presented along with these were very interesting.Lets hope they succeed in their goal of educating people about the alarming rate at which we are heading towards disaster. I sincerely hope that everyone sees this documentary and makes the little required effort from their side to dow what they can. I switched off my airconditioning after watching about 20 mins of the movie and didn't turn it on for the remainder of the movie. :D</fullReview>

She's actually quite disturbing. Where did you get your numbers from? why are you repeating everything? Do I look stupid to you, I'm not a child. Maybe its what many of us needs to hear?

		<shortDescription>Eye-opening and beautiful- but sadly not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I am relieved that a movie on this subject has been produced with such a high budget. It's about time someone really tried to sum up what the human condition is, and the relationship between our condition and the condition of our planet.The visuals for 'Home' are for the most part near perfect- pinpointing the beauties and miracles of this world, whilst also the disgraces and disasters with a total sensitivity and respect for all sides of the issue. The subjects covered are well chosen and diverse, and you really get perspective on how widespread and potentially devastating our manipulation of the natural world has become. Unfortunately though, what slightly let this movie down for me was its 'matter of fact' approach, and a lack of attention to some important details. In some ways this film avoids a one-sided approach, with interesting stats showing how our attempts at alternative fuels have their own negative effects, but for the first section particularly it felt like some very dated notes on the history of the earth. We know some amazing things about the history of our planet but it's important to recognise that there is far more that we don't. I for one stand firmly on the side of science that can admit to not knowing. The most blatant error, as picked up by IMDb in the 'goofs' section, is the narration that the first towns appeared 600 years ago- how could you get that wrong!!? Apparently they meant to say 6000 years ago, but even this isn't fact as there is evidence of towns up to over 8000 years ago. On top of this it is continually stated that human beings have been around for 200'000 years, a theory that has been far from proved and therefore should be treated as such. I think that in a film that is trying to be scientifically credible, in this case vague/speculative language would possibly be more accurate. At least they managed to avoid a '2001: A Space Odyssey' style chimpanzee scene! Scientific stuff aside though, the most inexcusable error is that in the fairly small amount of on screen text there are numerous spelling mistakes. In most cases that doesn't bother me, but in a high budget film production it does, and it certainly doesn't help the reputation of the Eco-warriors (hippies come to mind!)After watching this movie though, I'll admit that I had mostly forgotten the flaws because it really forces you to think about the issues. This is a good thing, and for the most part it is done with beauty, sensitivity and grace, which is why I've given it such a high rating. Watch this movie- the cinematography and well crafted narrative will open your eyes to the fragile state of our planet and cause you to appreciate your place in it more. Just don't be a sucker for the slightly anti-human philosophy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, but somehow flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematography is absolutely stunning.This film is beautiful, and some of the sequences are pure genius. The Dubai skyscraper, the oil tanker at sea, and the tar sands are all jaw-dropping. The 'natural' environments are the focus of the story - and they do not disappoint either. Icebergs, rainforests and deserts complete a stunning canvas.The music is also perfectly pitched, matching the visuals perfectly, and, by using a palette that goes from ethereal voices to frantic orchestration, tells a complex story all on its own.But... add in Glenn Close and her earnest recital, and suddenly it's less clear what this film is about. Evolution? The history of civilization? Over-population? Poverty? Education? The nature of human greed? Evil multinationals? Defence spending?! Or simply climate change? - which is reached quite late in the film, and by which point we're quite punch-drunk with a barrage of statistics.(With the visual and aural parts of my brain already in overdrive, the mathematical portion can't keep up.)The overarching message could have been a simple, powerful one: because of immutable human nature, our influence over the planet is vast and accelerating. We've probably reached the point of no return, and we don't know what's going to happen next. But here it got fluffed up with a roster of teenage naivety: "feed the poor", "stop buying guns", "love nature", "why can't we just all get along?" - as though somehow Ms Close might be able to compel us to unwind our oldest primeval urges.The opportunity was there for a dialogue on the circumstances of a species that thinks it has beaten evolution, the Pyrrhic nature of that claim - and the likelihood that it's about to get its comeuppance.Instead, I left the viewing with the impression that the film-makers thought that solar panels, Grameen Bank, rerouting defence budgets to aid for developing countries, peace, love - and a clever power station in Denmark - were going to make everything OK.Clearly they don't actually think that. Perhaps they felt obligated to tack on a relatively optimistic ending. They certainly didn't come up with any ideas for the taboo, yet inevitable, issue of population.So in summary...An admirable project with an incredible aesthetic vocabulary. Even without the commentary, it serves as an awe-inspiring and wary induction to responsible species-hood.However, this is going to be an extremely traumatic century - yes, I think we knew that - but, overlaid with dialogue, this film shouldn't pretend we know what to do about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "4" rating is solely for the stunning cinematography (meaning, the points added). The points taken off are for the deceptive nature of its presentation on the disc.Sure, I'm all for saving the planet and absolutely support the need to handle global climate change. But this "message" movie is not the way to present it. Combining beautiful footage of spectacular, mundane, and even unpleasant scenes with a wave of statistics in the narration makes for a disjointed experience at best.If it had been presented as what it was (or even described as such on the cover) I would not have had as much of a problem with it.My recommendation: turn the sound off and put on some relaxing music for the first 90 minutes or so. All the info is presented as text in the last several minutes anyway, so save that for another time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Home uses stunning aerial footage to tell the natural history of the planet and show how human civilization are destroying the natural cycle of life that was provided to us by Earth. The focus on carbon's history and the advent of plant life and other bacteria that gave way to human life provides a compelling, full-circle narrative of showing how this delicate balance can be thrown off course if we continue our methods of extraction and energy consumption. Home as a visually-stunning documentary serves an important role in cleanly communicating the history of the planet, its unique systems, and the ways in which humanity has altered them. While we are on a path of destruction, the documentary hints at solutions. Hint, because it is not comprehensive in paving the way forward. This is truly a love song for the Earth. A film to teach about systems. The solutions are out there and require further investigation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that calls upon humans to save home.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie gives beautiful aerial views of the planet to give a visual on the beauty of Earth and also the impact of human beings. The aerial views makes one really notice how beautiful Earth is as our HOME. It is hard to comprehend how beautiful the Earth is even though parts of it are being negatively impacted by us. The movie provides a background and explanation of how everything in nature is interlinked in the hopes of convincing any skeptic or doubter about the impacts of humanity. While the movie highlights the already present dangers of the impact of humans, it offers some hope in reversing these effects. The combination of the aerial views and the tone of the narrator are almost meant to scare the viewer in the hopes of motivating viewers to act on stopping the negative impacts on the Earth by people. Just as technology is constantly evolving, human care of the world's ecosystem must evolve. The combination of efficient use of our resources and reducing our impact should restore the balance now lost. Movie should be seen all as it provides a wake up call with visuals.</fullReview>

But that is of course a very opinion based way to capture the documentary.What is not opinion based are the facts shown in the documentary. It shows our earth like many of us have not seen it before. And most of us know that we are depleting our earth in a concerning way, but the facts shown in the documentary still came as a shock to me.It should be mandatory for every human being on earth to watch this documentary. Especially for the ones that are most responsible for the growing disappearance of our resources.I personally think it is time for change. And change starts when you are aware of the sad state that our world is in. That is why this is a good documentary. Because it makes you aware of the situation!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any nature-lover will love the movie as much as i did. It's a documentary that leaves any viewer contemplating.Breath-taking footage of the existing and unexplored places on Earth and the looming darkness that would engulf this beauty if the rapid industrialization and commercialization is not put to check is the theme of this documentary.The effort of the documentary makers to capture the stunning reality- be it the farms in France or the fragmented arctic ocean that makes way for the cargo ship- is much appreciated.Some facts might sound a bit exaggerated but that bolsters the argument on what the repercussions of our rampant industrial activity would lead to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wake-up call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OMG what a wonderful documentary. It not only has an important message, it also has the most beautiful pictures of our planet that I have EVER seen! The narration is spoken by Glenn Close, and what a wonderful choice she is: calm, but very intense. She makes sure that you will understand that there's not much time left to save our planet, and if we do not act NOW it might be too late. Watch this film and see how everything on our beautiful planet is interlinked. No species will survive on its own, and the homo sapiens is no exception whatsoever. It was us 'intelligent human beings' who created all of our current problems, and it only took us 50 years to do that. We can still save this planet, but it's high time to start doing that. Watch this movie, think, then ACT! I would like to thank everybody who took part in making this film! It's truly a wake-up call!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie explores the corruption of modern society in a very thorough manner. It explores the corruption in the agricultural industry, where in America we produce enough surplus food that we could end starvation around the world but instead we waste it on things like the meat packing industry.This movie demonstrates how the meat-packing industry wastes massive amounts of water, power, and food where the meat is about 5% of the food that was given at hand. They also describe how the meat packing industry is one of the greatest causes of air pollution because in fact many of the chemicals released from meat packing are worse then CO2 and the UN said that meat packing contributes more to global warming than the cars.They don't mention it but meat and other forms of processed foods are really bad for people's health which is why the more developed societies have things like Colon Cancer, Heart Disease, and Obesity, well poorer societies do not and it is extremely cruel to animals. This is why I personally am a vegetarian.This movie even explores how some people are using solar power to create a better life-style but that is not enough we need a government in the world that actually cares about this stuff instead of caring about pleasing the corporate bosses who are destroying the earth anyways.This movie also explains how we are cutting down the Amazon rain-forest and we have already got rid of more then 20% of it and if we get rid of the entire thing there won't be much hope left for humanity. Humanity will be doomed. Considering that I am less then twenty I might live to see the earth turn into easter island. I have heard that by 2030 we will lose half of the amazon. Who knows maybe in 2050 we will lose the Earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wake up call!..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really sad to see so few votes about something that was done by the people who actually feel responsible about our "home" planet Earth. Especially considering the effort it took for the ones who made this wake up call. I would love to be hopeful about the future of us humans. But the ratings on IMDb imply so much about how aware we are about what we've been doing to our home. This documentary was significantly meant to be on all around the world, in 90 different countries, the same day, the 5th of June, which happens(!) to be "World Environment Day".The purpose was basically to reach as many people as possible all around the world. Many things were done for the same call. But to be honest it's hard to say a lot has changed. For the ones who want to see it is in front of our eyes that our planet is responding to the things we've been doing, and the way we're dominating every living thing with the planet itself. But hey! We are nothing old compared to the planet's age. Our planet is 4.5 billion years old. It's seen lots of species before us. Some of them were wiped out. Not because they ruined the planet's own cycle. But because it is an ever-changing journey in a massive time scale. But we humans actually started a new geological era with the things we've been doing, effecting the very environment that created us. This documentary tells us "the story of us" leaving the ending for us to conclude. And to be aware -as Dr. Iain Stewart once said- that "planet Earth doesn't need to be saved. Earth is a great survivor. It's not the planet we should be worrying about. It is us". But the end is near. I think no one will deny it when it happens. I just hope people actually wake up, and start saving "us". Watch this documentary, people! And tell people to watch it. Because it is for all of us. Including the things we love. Thanks to everyone who took part in making it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious and inaccurate documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is terrible. At times I felt like I was watching The Lion King but without the lovable, funny characters. At other times it felt like a high school science class documentary. Other times it feels like a National Geographic film but without the top-notch awe-inspiring action shots of animals in their natural environment. Other times it feels like some kind of Zen, inspirational film but without any actual insightful words of wisdom. The female narrator tries too hard to make her voice sound soothing and calming in the beginning - it sounds like you're in a bad massage parlour. The writing is sappy. At one point early in the film the writer says something like "Sharing is the way of nature" and I blurted out "Sharing is caring!"The first 30 minutes is very tedious because they don't really tell you anything you don't know already and it leaves you wondering where the film is going. Then at about the 25 minute point they show some flames from oil wells, and switch away from their massage-parlour narration and soothing soundtrack to a more tense narration with a sinister-sounding soundtrack. It's all so rudimentally transparent it actually makes you laugh. The rest of the movie has some valid points, but is so filled with hyperbole that it's hard to take seriously and sift through the scare tactics to get at the actual facts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The images are awesome. And, yes, you should do something about climate change.What bothers me is the proposition that earth would be in 'perfect balance', if only humans learned to behave.No it isn't. And it never was.I was prepared to let this slide. The people who wrote this clearly haven't gotten over their eighties new age hangover yet. No problem. We all have our hangovers.But what really gets my genetically unaltered goat, is the sentence at about 23 minutes into the documentary."The first towns grew up less then 600 years ago".WTF?Firstly, if this is a bad mistake by an inebriated Glenn Close, I am ready to forgive her. But I am not ready to forgive the editor for missing this, especially so soon into the film. Come on! Seriously! I live in a city that is more then twice as old. And it's not even biblical! Imagine how hard the Iraqi's are laughing right now. (some of their cities go way back before the bible, and still we bombed the crap out of them, so far goeth the lesson in civilization)But then I got thinking. What if the script said 6 thousand years ago. There is no archaeologist in the entire world who would support that date. Cities are thousands of years older than that. Let alone towns.60.000 years? That would be a bit of a stretch. So where does the number come from, people? Can anyone clarify?It gets a 11 on imagery, a -7 on accuracy and credibility (rather essential in a documentary, I would think). On the whole, that makes a five.

		<fullReview>When Al Gore starred in An "Inconvenient Truth", it was so shocking that he was even invited by Oprah Winfrey to give another presentation on her show. Although Gore's work in that film brought out some very ugly "truths" addressing our current state of environmental affairs, his documentary/weather-man styled message seemed a tad bit on the lines of a college lecture. Even though Gore's pie-charts, statistics and scientific data all pointed towards the stark reality of "Global Warming", it pretty much does not address other issues that go hand-in-hand with our planet's destruction. Yes, Al Gore along with director Davis Guggenheim did an exceptional public service with "An Inconvenient Truth", but that was five years ago, and the polar ice-caps are still melting at a rate of 10% a year. Today, a billion people don't have water to drink. 20% of the world's population consumes 80% of its resources. 13 million hectares of forests vanish every year. It goes on and on. But this is where Home differs. Written by Isabelle Delannoy and directed by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, this indie film is a bold and sometimes thematically brutal narration of where we came from and where we are headed. Speaking for mother Earth is Glenn Close; systematically narrating how in just two hundred thousand years of existence, humans are changing the face of a four billion year old planet. This is shown through some of the most stunning and colorfully vivid aerial footages I have ever seen of this planet we call home. For this visual impact, Arthus-Bertrand uses high-definition cameras for mostly air-borne cinematography, capturing some rare images of people and places in abstract composures framed in 50 odd countries. And while our eyes have a feast, the haunting score becomes more than just music to our ears thanks to Armand Amar's original score played by the Budapest Symphony Orchestra. Perhaps his greatest intention from capturing Earth's spectacular imagery is to lay in plain view what we have now, and what we are likely to loose in our current trend to over indulge; making what we see a haunting dream, just 15 years from now.Speaking of over indulgence, in her narration, Close boldly names a few cities that are currently at the peak of plundering the planet. New York, Las Vegas and Los Angeles (USA), Shenzhen and Beijing (China), Mumbai (India), Tokyo (Japan) and Dubai (UAE), are used as examples and are not spared as world cities caught red-handed wasting food, water and energy. But this is only the latest. The damage though severe, has been dealt by humans like slow poison throughout our 200,000 years of existence. While we scientifically search for our missing link, we dare to place ourselves on top of the food chain. In the name of survival, we may be forgiven for thinking so. But how does the planet as a whole, survive in harmonious balance without any one species assuming superiority over all others? How profound is the thought that we as a species are actually the weakest link in the chain of a four billion year old evolution? That alone raises further questions as to whether or not we are really self-sufficient or whether we are evolving from hunters and nomads into explorers and conquerors being that humans are the only species with a will to dominate. Before showing how some countries are working at repairing the damage, the film really drives the message home with some more frightening questions. In just 15 years, can we undo what we have done in the last 200,000 years? In just 15 years, can we stop what we have been doing for the last 50 years? Even if we all try together, will Earth forgive us? Or is it too late? The answers, believe it or not, phenomenally rest in the way we address the words "we", "you", "I" and "they". It also lies in the thick line differentiating needs and wants. What is the need of three cars in a household of four? What is the need of an eight-cylinder gas guzzling SUV used by one individual? How nutritious are all-you-can eat buffets when a billion people are starving? Again, the answer is balance: take from the earth what is strictly necessary and only when it is needed.Released simultaneously on June 5th 2009 (World Environment Day) in 181 countries, this has to be the single widest film release in history and has already broken the world record in doing so. With a lowly budget of just $ 12 million, the intent of the film is not to entertain, but is a desperate wake up call to anyone who considers this planet a home. Moreover, what makes this film truly unique is that it can be freely downloaded and/or burned onto DVDs as it is copy-right free. That means this is a non-profit film that does not fall under Federal piracy protocols. If you do intend to buy the DVD (and you must), all proceeds will first cover the cost of production, thereafter, everything will reportedly go towards the "Good Planet Company", a non-profit red-crescent society for the planet. According to the film makers, "The benefits of this film cannot be counted in dollars, but in audience figures". More than anything, "Home" is a powerful lesson in humility. Its time to get our act together and tear down our socio-political walls; and only TOGETHER can we repair a planet that geographically has no boundaries.This is a must-see for all good citizens of Earth. As a reviewer, I would recommend watching this title in BD format just to see it the way it's meant to be seen. If that is out of reach, a DVD should be almost as effective. And just in case I haven't mentioned it already, my salutations to Mr. Yann Arthus-Bertrand and his filming crew for bringing out a film that is much more than a mere documentary, rather, an artistic masterpiece that sirens Earth's cry for help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't think of the last time a film inspired me to watch it four, five, six?I don't know how many times. The images and the message in "Home" are that compelling.With dazzling photography that seems taken from a balloon wafting around the world, above the hurly-burly of homo sapiens ("wise human"), this film chronicles the history of life on Earth and man's threat to this miracle.We see glimpses of places like Iceland, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Palm Springs, Borneo, Haiti, Easter Island, Greenland, and Mount Kilamanjaro. And we come away extremely concerned about how our profligacy threatens man's ability to inhabit the planet.I caught this incredible film on the TV channel of the City University of New York, which ran the credits in such minuscule script that I could not tell who did the mesmerizing voice-over and the enchanting music. Both were superb. So often I was reminded of Coppola's film about the Earth, the little-known movie whose title is something like "Koyanaskquotsee." The only complaint I have about this compelling work is that far too few scenes were identified by country. I wanted to know where these magnificent panoramas could be found. In addition, the filmmakers made the egregious error of stating that the Grand Canyon is in Colorado. Even my 8-year-old (who also was dazzled by this film) found this statement ludicrous! We are told at the end of this movie that we can help by visiting goodplanet.org. I'd like to try to follow up. It seems the least I can do. I learned a lot from "Home"; I just hope I remember it, and I hope I treat the planet with more care as a result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange, I didn't rate 'Home' higher, as I never seemed to want it to end, even with its 2-hour running time. It was freshening to see new shots all over the globe verses the typical 'Planet Earth' or 'Earth' stock footage. Most, if not all, shots were from the sky and most were breathtaking. Hence one reason I rented this. The other was to learn more about the past, present and future of man's involvement in our 'Home.' And I did learn some new facts and I did see some great aerial shots. Unfortunately, some went on far too long, and interesting enough, those were the scenes that were the least spectacular. If not for the great narrator ? I love Glenn Close, even if it's just for her voice, I would've fast-forwarded some of it. Another huge negative, as this was another "wake-up call" on mankind's destructive environment behavior, was the lack of resources available to help. Granted, as you finish the credits (by the way, make sure you stay through them; as the credits rolled, you were reintroduced to the numerous locales used, again with a different POV ? i.e. France with wind sailing and not the Eiffel Tower) you get one, ONE, website referral on how to make a difference. After a strong and finally positive closing on solar, wind, etc technology, I was expecting numerous resources to help. Obviously, I could do some research myself, but just ONE? My job as a credit/housing counselor at a non-profit agency is to distribute resources, websites, phone numbers and definitively education to those with identified issues. I have numerous thoroughly researched, secured and helpful directions for clients. This movie could've gone one more mile than the thousands it went. Nevertheless, it's definitively recommended, if not just for Close and the beauty.Side Note: Where's the DVD extras? So much more could've been explored, like learning more facts (as 'Transformers' pushes products such as Mt. Dew, this too could've pushed its agenda a little further,) things about the aerial shots/photographer and how they filmed a lot of the shots, histories of the places visited, and again, more resources on where we can help people in need or the Earth as a whole. I think either they dropped the ball, or plan on making more money off a re-release. If that's the case, it absolutely would lose it's creditability.Side Note 2: I don't have the time or energy to look up, verify or research most of the facts/labels stated in this film are true or false (lazy American, I know) but as someone that lives in Arizona and someone that hears "Colorado's Grand Canyon," I thought how many other statements were incorrect. Though the Colorado River flows through the Grand Canyon, it's still in Arizona, not Colorado. Well, thank goodness, I did take the time to research this, as I never have heard of another "Grand Canyon" so close to our State's. I admit my ignorance: another does exist just outside AZ. (I'm never ashamed of my ignorance, however. There's always a lot more to learn out there.) I will have to (drop the lazy American stereotype and) visit this seemingly wonderful spectacle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is a very good interpretation of what mankind has done over the last century. Modernization, urbanization, the increasing demand for more raw material, fresh water and oil will not cease. What can be done instead is to rethink about the way we live now. The movie begins with a soft introduction about how the planet came to be and gradually it starts introducing the humankind factor. Compared to "An Inconvenient Truth" it is more visual telling, it's not only about the global warming factor and if it helps some people who think that "An Inconvenient Truth" was politically motivated then they should check out this movie. The fact is that we just started giving a damn, we did not give a damn 15 years before at all but now maybe some of us would understand. We made a habit of changing the world we live to suit our needs I think we should spare no effort in giving back some of what was taken form our planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some will have reservations regarding this movie both in terms of the narration and the scope of what it tries to explain, even though most people who actively choose to see this will already now most of the information presented...Still the visuals is THE redeeming factor here and it makes it the best successor to Koyaanisqatsi (1982) since then. And yes i HAVE seen a lot of the other recent environmental and nature documentaries and I also liked Al Gore's "truth" :-) .Consider several shots where you cannot immediately figure out what on "earth" you are watching other than some beautiful colors that might as well be an impressionist painting and then the camera slowly zooms out to reveal for instance the plastic covered fields in Almeria or rice fields on a mountain or suddenly some humans appear floating into the frame in the distance and the camera rises to show them in a boat on a canal... It is just stunningly breathtaking and it is like that ALL THE TIME in the entire movie! For people who knows Bertrand's still photographs this is not surprising, but seeing it in moving form and presented as a narrative does actually increase the impact considerably.So yes this is a definite 10 in my book, purely because of these visuals - As for the politics, I however don't see a way out of this mess unless we get some serious decrease in the worlds population and soon..., which is a point that this movie really does not want to address. Highly recommended, but do yourself a favor and watch it in HD 720p or more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually stunning aerial photography of the Earth in a two-hour film with an ecological education agenda. Visually, this film is on a par with Baraka, Blue Planet, and Planet Earth, and seems to have been filmed largely with the same type of aerial video apparatus (Cineflex V14 HD Gyro-stabilized Aerial Camera System). Interestingly (and sadly), the film appears to have been adulterated by increasing the color saturation in many scenes.Watch out for factual errors in the narration ("600 years of human habitation in cities and towns" should be "6000" years) and mispronunciations in the narration ("climactic" vs. the correct "climatic," occurs TWICE!) Also, the Grand Canyon is in Arizona -- NOT in Colorado, as stated, 'tho it is the Colorado River that created and flows thru it.The narration seems to have been done over-hastily. Glenn Close obviously was not well-coached nor was her narration work reviewed or edited properly. Perhaps - like March of the Penguins - this film would be better viewed and appreciated sans sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This so-called "documentary" is so awfully propagandistic, and so full of outright lies and bad and twisted arguments, that one could almost call it a "muckumentary" if it weren't for the fact that it has no ironic touch whatsoever! Obviously, the filmmakers rely heavily on a public being stupid and almost total ignorant of the subject matter. And suffering from short memory since one argument contradicts another only minutes later.The only reason I don't give it 1 is because of a lot of beautiful pictures. So one could mute the film and see a lot of lovely natural scenes without it being destroyed by dumb propaganda.If a team of scientists, taking their field seriously (not sold out to First Earth "hate people" ideology), should make a tedious and accurate discussion of all that is false in some way in this film, the report would probably be between 5000 and 10000 pages!! 35 lies and flaws were found in Gore's "An Inconvenient Trugh". In this film there are several hundred! Obviously a lot of people like this bad stuff since it scores 8,4 (at present). Also there are a lot of positive reviews. That only shows the degree the lack of education in both fact and ability to judge arguments, and a scaring willingness to let oneself be brainwashed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great documentary on a grave matter: ourselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Home' is the title of an incredible documentary that tries to make ourselves understand how it came to the catastrophic situation regarding our planet. (the picture can be watches online for free: http://www.youtube.com/user/homeproject).5 times Academy-Award nominee, Glenn Close , narrates the 90 minute-long picture that illustrates the worst of our fears: the decay of our planet. Several times throughout the picture, it is underlined that in the past 5 decades, human kind has changed the face of our planet more than it has in it's 200.000 years of existence. In the past 50 years has the Planet been depleted of some of it's most precious minerals and soil treasures - including the most precious of them all: WATER.One of the reasons I loved the documentary so much, is that it names a lot of names; it doesn't only name the reasons why our planet is suffering, but it also tells the viewer who is responsible for it. Tokyo and Lagos, (2 of the most developing cities worldwide) and India, Bangladesh and USA are named to be the greatest consumers of our resources - the cost to sustain the lives of the hundreds of millions of people are so incredible huge, that in only a few decades we will have depleted all the available resources.Another reason I truly recommend this documentary is, that it gave us an example of what could and eventually will happen of the human race. Apparently, there existed a highly educated and developed civilization on the Easter Islands. Although they were struck by famine, riots and natural catastrophes, it always survived because of the human mind. However, the people depleted the island of all of its resources until they starved to death.The documentary states several times that we became dependent of oil, petroleum and the several other forms of the 'black gold'. We are reminded that although we have already run out of oil in some of the corners of our planet, we still drill, dig and try to find more and more. Impressive images of Arabia and Africa are shown to let us know that we also ran out of under-earthed water supplies. Water is used for almost everything in our daily routine, from washing our cars and watering the tropical paradise of the desert located Las Vegas to cultivating grain for the life stock we depend upon.The human greed, its quickly development and the impossibility to sustain life as it is nowadays (without destructing its own planet) damages permanently the balance of nature. "We are living in exceptional times. Scientists tell us that we have 10 years to change the way we live, avert the depletion of natural resources and the catastrophic evolution of the Earth's climate." (quote from the Homeproject Youtube channel - the link is above).I recommend the documentary to everybody who still believes that living the American dram of heaving a big house and 2 cars is still the way to go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My rating: 4/5 I think I was late. I should have watched 'Home' the year it came out in 2009. But after nearly 2 years gone the documentary starts to make more and more sense. After so many natural disasters occurring around the world in more frequently than before and in most areas where 'Home' hovers above, I think we are yet to experience the worst. Don't get me wrong. 'Home' is not totally a pessimistic look at nature's destruction by human hands. It's quite more than that. 'Home' addresses the world's critical issues which as nations we all turns a blind eye to or give a lesser priority. Nothing in this planet comes for free and nothing is limitless. 'Home' is the story about nature and its interdependence. It speaks of how this wonderful planet we live in was a blissful arena for the human kind and how we have become so unkind and ungrateful towards it. 'Home' speaks of water, air and resources which bounds all living things as one and the crucial cycles which were active for billions of years which now having a threat of breaking. While revealing some heart shattering facts 'Home' shows few of the most unforgettable cinematography that I have ever seeing on a documentary. While covering 56 countries from air, there is not a single shot made from eye level of a human which vastly gives the gods view of what's truly the planet earth looks like. Scene by scene 'Home' is a visual extravaganza and a treat to the brains furthest of corners. And the mesmerizingly wonderful sound track by Armand Amar just purely satisfy the senses and speaks to the minds in deep. There is a very strong message embedded throughout the whole 95 minutes of 'Home'. And it's a message which none of us can dare to forget. I sure will cherish it and do whatever I may do to keep the balance of nature and be grateful towards it. (If you enjoy 'Home' then there is a strong chance that you will also like powaqqatsi and Baraka which is one of my favorites. And then you can try Blue Planet and Planet Earth from BBC)Read more of my reviews at flickshout.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning visuals served alongside dumbed down quasi-spiritual environmentalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stunning and unique all-aerial visuals, great emotive soundtrack, and an admirable attempt to raise awareness about the interconnectivity of Earth's ecosystems; But anyone with even some basic education in biology and ecology should feel conflicted enjoying this documentary.This doc presents and promotes a quasi-mystical outlook upon our planet's ecosystems and our place within them. First, the fact that our growth is "faster and faster" as the narrator harps on (while ominous music plays) isn't something evil, unique, or something we should feel guilty about. Nor does "every animal have its place", nor does huge wealth disparity (shitty though it may be) have much to do with environmental problems (or at least it certainly isn't explained here). Humans are organisms, and like any other organism we will follow exponential growth in ideal conditions and infinite resources. Our expansion and over-exploitation of resources is also not a product of modern society or even the industrial revolution (timber and game in pre-industrial Europe was heavily overexploited as an example), and hunter-gatherer or horticultural civilizations (ex. Native Americans) were also not more environmentally wise than us (they simply expanded to the extent the carrying capacity of their technology allowed for). Humanity, as every other species, does not owe anything to any other species because we are not apart from them. First we must understand that we are another species, and subject to the same natural urges to consume and expand as any other species.The goal of promoting environmentalism is good, as is showing some great examples of our devastation upon the Earth. I just wish the documentary wasn't dumbed down with spiritual drivel for the masses. There are plenty of good practical reasons to try to preserve ecosystems and prevent global warming without invoking guilt about how we've destroyed some holy balance.Still, the doc is worth watching for the visuals alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Look at Our Earthly Home!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is about our planet Earth told to us by narrator. Glenn Close in the English language version does an excellent job in reading somewhat poetry with enlightening information about how to handle the Earth, it's resources, and wealth without destroying it. Over the last several years, there have been arguments about the planet's capabilities. Unless we have another planet out in the nearby solar system, it is very likely we will never leave our earthly planet but don't fret. There is plenty to see around the world. The photography or cinematography is as first rate as the National Geographic editions. That's what I think of with this documentary is the beauty captured by the camera overlooking land. There are no interviews or experts talking. Yes, I would highly recommend this viewing for everybody to show the beauty of the earth and to celebrate our time here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning and cerebrally stimulating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting an 'inconvienient truth' style shocker here but from the outset the photography of the project really came through. This suddenly made sense once I realised that it had been directed by Yann Arthus-Bertrand. His book 'The Earth from above' had the same feel and the super slow motion of 'Home' made you feel like the books had suddenly come to life. A real visual treat throughout the documentary and then the hard facts about humanity's impact on the bio-diversity of our planet over a short period of time hit home very well. I was so glad at the end when some solutions came to light about the work people are doing to sustain energy sources and use the land better. I believe a start would be to halt the development of desert areas such as Dubai and begin weaning Americans off Las Vegas in order to save the water table. Again another big point was the amount of water it takes to produce meat. I'm going to look at local option and attempt to eat vegitables where ever possible. A great watch for a Sunday afternoon though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chicken consumption causes Global Warming! - watch this to find out why...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Everything on Earth is interlinked". The film gives us evidence that the consumption of chicken is one of the major causes of global warming! There are many more such links that it points out. The film focuses on the evolution of the Earth and it's resources and how man over the last 50 years has altered the balance of the Earth more than in 200,000 years of his existence. The facts that the film conveys are presented with stunning images. The film contains the best ever aerial photography I've ever seen. The soundtrack is beautiful. There must be much more publicity for stuff like these as the average man does not have access to such important information. A must watch for all those who feel responsible for the sake of the Earth. "We can no longer afford to be a pessimist".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great modern documentary for the masses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never knew that the major half of grain we grew were to produce energy or to feed the animals to make produce meet, while the major half of people in this world suffer from hunger. What an irony fact.The footages used in this great documentary are of very high quality, beautifully edited to illustrate a simple idea: save the earth.The elegant music tenderly melt with the pictures, somehow reminds me of Kubrick's 2001.I watched the film with English VO, Glenn Close's voice is very warm and convincing.A great modern documentary for the masses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful plead to mankind to save the Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a collage of Yann Arthus-Bertrand's aerial shots of the Earth, with a commentary about how mankind is spoiling our beautiful home planet.Yann Arthus-Bertrand is famous for his amazingly beautiful shots of the world, and "Home" is no exception to his previous work. His footage of the Earth constantly amazes me. I often wonder how he found those places, and how he got those amazing shots with the right angle and altitude.The commentary highlights all the problems that mankind do to the environment. I have to say I am converted though, as I kept asking myself, "So what's the solution?". Though offering solutions is probably out of the scope of this film, I still think it is unfortunate that it did not offer any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zero vince sates that HOME is not a documentary because it doesn't document anything.This is an absurd comment because most of the movie is of real life scenes that are not set up.The editorial aspect is in the script and to a lesser extent the editing. This is no different than a photojournalist documenting life, then the pictures being laid out in a magazineEvery frame is a document, the the same way a still photographer documents life so can a motion picture camera.Mike</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The waste it set out against</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>YBA , makes wonderful and bestrangening photographs of our Earth.. these framed images give you a sense of awe. However.. filmed and moving above these images don't work at all.and especially when they are overdone with all kinds of digital techniques to emphasize their abstractness.the constant camera move over these landscapes becomes extremely boring.Accompanied by an awful uninspiring and unsurprising new-age-like-music score , digitally compressed , mastered and whatsoever..the whole form of the film is veeeery predictable.the montage of the film is sooo un-inspiring it sometimes made me 'puke '...how can it be that creativity works in one field , but absolutely fails in another? Well i guess creativity needs skills to work.That creative skill was not here when this film was made. the constant flow of helicopter images bored the hell out of me... the digitally pumped-up landscape images did nothing to me. I don't have to say much about the message embedded in this ' Film '... totally in accordance with the climate-change lobby crusade , where it probably will be engaged with laud applause.... How many tons of oil did Yann Bertrand Arthus and his crew spoil on capturing these images while filming at different locations all over the world flying hundreds of ours in airplanes , helicopters and hot air balloons capturing landscapes in order to bring they'r message of a spill-sick humanity across?This film is exactly what it pretended to set out against.a massive (maybe even toxic ) waste !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NASA has corrected its US temperature records, the hottest year on record is no longer 1998, but 1934.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theory of man made global warming is now nothing more than propaganda, an agendabeing supported by political groups. Science does not conclude that humans are the cause of a slight rise in the earth's temperature over the past 30 years. There is no consensus from the scientific community that man is thecause of global warming.doubt or go against the global warming theory is unthinkable. Now many of you may consider yourselves liberal, maybe not on all issues but at least on environmental ones. So as liberals, you are supposed to be open minded. Man-made carbon dioxide is only 0.117 percent of total carbon dioxide in the air and contributes only 0.0047 percent carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The average person has been misled and is confused about what the current Global Warming debate is about, greenhouse gases. None of which has anything to do with air pollution. People are confusing Smog, Carbon Monoxide (CO) and the pollutants in car exhaust with the life supporting, essential trace gas in our atmosphere, Carbon Dioxide (CO2). Carbon and CO2 (carbon dioxide) are fundamental for all life on Earth. CO2 is a colorless, odorless, non-toxic gas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do they have this film without embedded NWO's BS preaching?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great picturesque video with stunning camera operator's work... But there is always a catch that can spoil any kind of beauty: in this case it's unbearable BS-propaganda from nice NWO guys who want to exterminate human population of this planet. They're just desperately looking for good excuses to gently sell their agenda to the public. There are some: 1. Global Warming. - Fortunately it stopped by itself, because of naturally occurred Solar circle. Human produced CO emissions has nothing to do with it. 2. Fresh Water Depletion. - Give me a break! Every kid in every school knows about The Water Cycle. You can't deplete the water no matter how you try. Our air contains 4,000 cubic miles of constantly renewable fresh drinking water at any given moment. Every person who use air conditioner knows how extract fresh drinking water directly from air. 3. Planet's Deforestation and Environment Pollution. - Who actually pollute the Earth? Who are responsible for deforestation, chemical pollutions, endless wars and other crimes against the nature? What is the source of the Earth's problems? NWO Elite - bankers, owners of mega-corporations and politicians.Therefore there is a solution: if you want to save the Earth then start eliminating the source of its problems - NWO Elite and their tools of power.
