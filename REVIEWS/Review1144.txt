		<shortDescription>Traded should be traded for a root canal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rating currently on IMDb is so out of wack on this terrible movie, I'm questioning if this site is now really worth checking prior to watching a movie. Those that rate this trite as anything other than awful should be avoided, they either did not watch this so called movie or they may be investors or have some skin in the game and are trying to artificially inflate the rating.The story is so predictable I wonder if the writer has ever had an original idea in his life. Well then, you say if the writing is terrible, how about the acting? I've seen better acting at grade school productions, wooden stiff unemotional go through the paces so called acting makes this almost unbearable, but wait it gets ever worst, the dialog is so corny and unrealistic the only answer is to hit the fast forward button.To say this is a complete and total waste of your time, money, and brain cells goes without saying, Traded should be avoided and movies like this should be barred by law, have a wall built around them, and banded from entering the USA, your movie theater, or TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review but, trust me when I say I am an avid movie and film watcher. I love anything historical, period films and the Westerns are at the top of my list. This film had a good story line and some good and strong acting but, it also had many terrible aspects as well! I will never forget the short speech by Mr. Kris Kristofferson at the bar about feeding the wolf! It reminded me of the last film by the late great Mr John Wayne telling the fatherless Ron Howard during a pistol lesson in the "Shootist" on the rules a man must follow to be a real man...never forgot that speech and never will! All in all, this is a typical "made for TV movie" with a few rated "R" words and moments. If you love westerns and don't care if they're a couple of great actors, a few good actors, and a cast chocked full of bad ones, watch this film. If you're looking for a film the caliber of "The Outlaw Josey Wales","The Shootist","Tom Horn(with Steve McQueen)","Stagecoach","Shane", "How the West was Won" or the likes of the late great Sergio Leone's famous "Man with no Name Trilogy" spaghetti westerns, and the TV mini series from 80's like "Lonesome Dove" or "North and the South" the old James Michener mini series "Centennial" from 78...This movie,in my humble opinion, this movie has it's moments isn't in the same ballpark...or should I say rodeo? I would however like to say, great work to Mr Trace Adkins and Mr Kris Kristofferson. Those two made this film totally worth watching. Especially Mr.Adkins. I don't want to spoil anything but, the pure "Non-Stop Go Power" that comes from a deep place within all real men and woman, that kicks in when family is involved...I believe that Mr. Adkins would/could be this character in real life! I'm just giving you all out there my honest opinion...and you know what they say about opinions and A holes, everybody got one. So watch it yourself and post what you think. Thanks for your time and consideration... Respectfully submitted, from the North Coast of the USA, Forever searching for MY holy grail, Mike J. P.S. A special thanks to "Notagoodguy44" for helping fix what's broke even when I didn't know it was broke to start with! thanks again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's so sad when people write in saying that this is the best western they have seen or even the best movie ever. Since the start of the twentieth century many thousands of westerns have been made with hundreds considered classics and works of art. Will Traded still be watched in fifty or sixty years time? No, probably not even next month. It's great to be loyal if you're a friend or relation of someone in the cast or crew, but don't send movie goers off thinking they'll be seeing a Peckenpah, Ford, Stevens or Eastwood. There is nothing better than a good western, but nothing worse than a bad one and this is bad on so many levels. The direction, (if I slow it right down it will appear more arty) script, (must hold the world record for how many times the phrase 'son of a bitch' is used. Acting often very amateurish (apart from the actress playing Girl), and costumes and props straight from the hire shop. So many shiny new guns. Will the director be kind enough not to make any more. For me and countless others, westerns a too important and you're giving them a bad name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do we begin... I am a fan of westerns. Just picture Clint Eastwood with that dirty look in his eye, the dry landscapes, the unforgiving wild frontier which rewards the bold and brave but mercilessly kills off anyone too weak to pull their own weight... Traded starts promisingly enough with building a bit of character backstory, introducing us to the happy family living on the ranch. The playful young son who idolizes the strong and silent father, the "soon to be of age" daughter who yearns to be treated like an adult although she has no idea what that means, and the mother - the supportive and hardworking wife, devoted to her family and man. Sounds good so far? it gets worse. Son dies, daughter runs off, wife turns on husband and so begins a horrible and rushed "TAKEN" style western which feels completely inorganic.After about the first 10 minutes character development stops all together. The father beats up the lying clerk at the train station and is apparently a legendary sharp shooting quick draw, he trolls through whorehouses across towns looking for his daughter, encountering tough- guys who all point guns but never shoot. He kills the "bad" guys, becomes best mates with bartender Kris Kristofferson out of the blue, and battles with poor dialogue and fake action scenes throughout the movie. The other characters in the movie such as Ugly girl, Head Honcho Bad guy #1 and his less-than-average IQ gang of misfits make this movie almost cringe worthy to watch. A shameful attempt at a western. How on earth did it get 7/10 on IMDb??? I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, well maybe a blind and deaf person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would appear that often people are motivated to write their first review here out of admiration for the way a film moved them, or shock at how badly it was made. Unfortunately I'm here because of the latter.Just to preface, I'm not a critic, I have no agenda other than someone that just likes to enjoy the escapism that is provided by a movie. I love to be entertained, and I admire a wide variety of genres, so I'm certainly no film-snob.This film doesn't deserve the rating it currently has on IMDb. Overall it's pretty bad. Whilst the plot isn't terrible, and it all starts off quite nicely for about 20 minutes or so, it all goes downhill into quite a mess. The supporting actors are terrible, and the dialog makes you want to cringe. Overall it's not the most horrible experience in my life, but I do wish I had just mopped the floors or something else instead of watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Budget Western - Lots of problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't often critique films unless they're so good (since I believe it's nicer to be positive and ignore the negative), but I really enjoy westerns and this one was terrible. First, the story was weak at best since it's a western version of taken. Character development was so weak you just didn't care about any of these people. But what got me over and over was the seriously screwed up sets and props. It starts with the house. Look around and you'll see windows with flawless glass, stamped oak chairs (bad cheap modern reproductions), a flawless table, and a floor nothing reminiscent of what would have existed in the late 1800's.. or even into the early 20th century. Later on in the movie, you see clothing that's clearly not from the period and even the dad's holster and gun look totally modern store bought. Maybe the set clincher was seeing a plywood floor (in the scene where the guy is polishing the bell). Plywood?? I don't think so!! Make-up on "woman" (a character) that looked like rubber latex poorly stuck on. Even script where the writer(s) just didn't know how to make it sound convincing (e.g. I "recon" there are so many times I can say "recon" in a few sentences when "I recon" it's going to be easy to "recon" the writer "recons" he doesn't know what the heck a cowboy would say except "recon". Sheesh! A weak story. Acting that simply wasn't good (like the actors were trying to act like actors from REAL western movies!). Extremely poor sets and costumes. It was just a bad, low budget, cheesy movie. Sorry to all the people I know who are involved in this movie's production who worked hard, but it really was a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly bad film. It's just all over the place. I haven't seen a film this bad in ages. It's like a cheese teen movie. I don't know why, it's just so bad it made me angry. On this, every thing that can be wrong, is wrong. I have to put in more lines on the review to get it passed, so I will because I want to share my infinite dislike with everyone. If You are just bored, do anything else, anything. Even staring at the wall is gonna be more productive than watching this picture. The characters, the conflict, the scenic action, the you name it, is a disaster. the director seems to be a young kid, no doubt he'll get better but on this one he didn't know what he was doing.Cheers-</fullReview>

Boy was that a mistake, this movies has to be one of the worst westerns I have ever seen, just plain awful. Obviously the high ratings came from people associated with the movie. Don't waste your time on this one, I could not even finish watching it, it's that bad.The acting was simply terrible.The story and plot was full of gaps and the filler content added to lengthen the movie did nothing to add any value to an already bad film.Take my advice, save your money and your time as you will never get either back.This is not even worth a watch on a day when you have absolutely nothing to do...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's "Taken" on horse back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Liam Neeson's 'Taken' franchise, this is a 'father-chases-daughter's-kidnapper' movie. Funny enough, I could not even tell the difference between the two other than the costumes and weapons used. So the verdict is simple - if you like action movies where the goodies always win the day (and get to take the daughter home), this is for you.Sit back and enjoy. Forget about comments made by others that there are acting, stories etc, this is not a film for awards, and I nearly forget ... the veteran actor Kris Kristofferson. He did not even appear for more than 5 minutes. So don't buy your ticket because of him. Other than all that, it's a pleasant film for a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Acting, direction, script, dialogue. You name it, it's wrong. It is almost worth suggesting to friends as a nasty joke. One particular scene sticked to mind and that was when the mother takes off for the neighbour's house to ask where her daughter was. She was so hilariously uncomfortable with riding a horse it was crazy. The horse was practically crawling I bawled myself laughing so hard I think I cracked a rib. If you are going to watch it as a fan of horrid movies then watch it until that scene and stop. that was the highlight of this movie. This movie is a total and complete waste of time and if ever there was a movie that deserved a negative score this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting story idea. Appalling execution! Instant Turkey!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a strange mix of beautiful scenery, well dressed actors, great story concept but appalling acting. The acting, or lack of it, and extremely bad pacing of the movie just makes this hard to watch. I did watch the whole movie, the beginning to Middle being extremely slow, so something is there in the concept to claw at my interest. But, and it is a big but, the appalling acting quality and extremely bad pacing, due to bad editing perhaps, has completely ruined the feel and style of this film. Not one character, or actor, stood out in this movie. This is a very bizarre situation when the story had some real interesting ideas. I wish this was more of a Clint Eastwood type or 2010 True Grit type of movie. This is well below a TV movie standard, this is just none stop wooden acting and extremely bad pacing/editing from start to finish, a real shame. 3 stars for the story and concept but the execution completely makes this movie an instant Turkey!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to like this movie. I really tried. Yet another western that fails on an epic level. Poor plot, poor writing, bad acting followed by only more bad. What happened to the days of hard and dusty westerns that left you pining for a horse and six-shooter?Rancher and ex-sharpshooter Clay Travis (Michael Par?) loses his son in an accident and his daughter runs away from her angry distraught mother. Clay pursues his daughter to Dodge City only to find an evil brothel owner named Lavoie (Tom Sizemore) and, with the help of Billy (Kris Kristofferson) set out to destroy Lavoie and his henchmen and rescue his daughter.I like Michael Par?, Kris Kristofferson and Tom Sizemore but they all should have skipped this film in their careers. If you came here to find a tough, gritty western, like those spaghetti greats of the 60's, hit the next button and forget this title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So another pointless movie makes it out on the shelves. A family live on a ranch and the son dies from a snake bite , the mum looses the plot the daughter runs away to escape and gets caught up in a prostitution ring. The heroic dad goes after her , checking out a few towns and saloons on the way , has a few conversations , easily kills a few people and eventually gets his daughter back. The story is very weak and for a so called western action / thriller I wasn't thrilled once throughout the movie. The killing scenes are all quick , unimaginative and boring. It's another western that has been let down by lack of depth in the story and just a lack of guile in the so called action scenes .I wouldn't even bother giving it a watch, if you want to watch a recent western watch bone tomahawk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very rare that I have the depth of feeling to write a review for a film either good or bad but after watching this effort, I just had to. On every conceivable measure of the film making and writing art, this is a crime. Kris Kristofferson must be facing bankruptcy for him to be involved in this epic failure. Every possible cliché, from every western, ever made, is unashamedly copy and pasted into the script. I must admit, I had a semi masochistic urge to watch this through to the end. Much like watching a chimp with a hand grenade, you know it will end badly but just how will it reach it's denouement? In both cases, predictably and messily. Some films are so bad, that they are funny and earn some redemption in that. This film is so far off the scale in bad it even fails in that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traded is an Ace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently had the pleasure of viewing the film traded. The 19th century Western stars Kris Kristofferson, Tom Sizemore and has an appearance by Quinton Aaron. I was happy to see Quinton Aaron of whom I wondered what he would appear in after starring in The Blind Side.The film was fun and entertaining. Normally I am not a fan of westerns as I find them repetitive with the same characters, theme and action. Traded is the exception to the rule. Intelligent writing has caused interesting and believable characters. The dialogue is unique and not sleep inducing. The plot is well thought out and unfolds on screen seamlessly. I could not take my eyes off of the screen.I recommend Traded to anyone who is a fan of good film. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a "bad" film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I don't know if I agree with all the slander against this film.The reviews (cept for the fake shill reviews) and the message boards clearly show the hatred for this film, and they use the usual wide variety of IMDb slander. Some of our esteemed IMDb members wrote: "How do movies this bad get made""All that time spent making fake accounts to 10 vote this thing could have been put to better use on the script.""This movie insults your intelligence. Might have been better as a comedy."But I must ask, it is truly a "Bad" film? What makes a film bad? Are these people just difficult to please? Do they simply have such high standards that living up to them would take a near-masterpiece? I don't know if I can honestly call this film bad. Bad, is a strong word. As is Love. As is Hate.Also, come to think of it, so is Diarrhea. That's a really strong word too. Probably, because of all the images, memories, feelings, and embarrassment which is recollected when you hear it. Most especially, if it managed to make an appearance at the wrong time, at the wrong place. It only takes one horrible (and messy) public incident to leave you with a fairly indelible mental scar.Speaking of, we knew a guy who actually moved away, because he couldn't live with the nickname "Mr. Poopy Pants", given to him after an incident which he clearly regretted enough to go through the incredibly long and involved task of relocating to another state. People can be really cruel. The nick-name was almost instantaneous, showing up on our company website and social media within 24 hours of the unfortunate event, which happened at a work pool party. I think your imaginations can fill in the details. He ate the wrong thing the night before, and foolishly decided to swim in his employers large and expensive pool. The rest, is a badge of shame which was pinned upon him faster than you can get a callback from Tom Sizemore's agent, despite your film being produced for less than the catering budget of an average motion picture.But, shame on me. This isn't about Mr. Poopy Pants, it's about Traded. A film which boasts:"A Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western Meets Taken"Sounds great, right? I was really looking forward to it, since some of my favorite actors are in it, and doubly so because it is a Western.However, just a few minutes into the film, I noticed that it had a very un-westernly look to it. As if the usual sepia tones and desaturated film stock had been replaced with a consumer digital camera, with little attention given in post and grading towards achieving a pleasing look. A real bummer. But, does that make it a "bad" film? I vowed not to be such a judgmental and pretentious piggy. There are plenty of other Western classics which look great, and aren't going anywhere. Let's give this one a fair shake, shall we?However, just a few more minutes into the film, the acting was noticeably amateurish. And additionally, quite profoundly un-westernly. But does that necessarily make it a "bad" film? I say, nay! Not everyone has world-class acting chops, right? (though, it does call to question the casting process of this film, and why this director was literally unable to gauge how horrible some of his actors were). But, I continued to watch.However, many minutes later, the dialog, action, gunplay, direction, set-decor, audio, continuity, lighting, framing, staging, were all noticeably amateurish as well. And additionally, immensely un-westernly. Even the acting from otherwise great actors was miserable. Who can be faulted for that, if not the director, and also the screenwriter? I cannot in good conscience say this was a "bad" film. But it DID manage to fail in every single area of production by which a film is judged. Some would indeed call that "bad", but I wont. My dear readers, there are far too many unkind and vicious reviews at this place, but I am a kinder, gentler, sort of reviewer, who understands, loves, and is so empathetic that every single ludicrous and 1st-year-student type of mistake this inept director made...hurt me deeply. I cried at many points. And by the end, there were no more tissues left to dry my eyes. His pain, became my pain. If I could hug him/them, I would.So despite this film not falling under what I'd call the "bad" category, it does indeed suck hard, long, and deep...by the standards of everyone else. I can see why they think this director should not only keep his day job, but perhaps be demoted in that unrelated job, simply due to the bowel-shakingly profound lack of talent, skill, savvy, style, and vision.But I'd never say such a thing.In conclusion, this film is not unlike having explosive/projectile diarrhea, in a pool, owned by your boss, at the company pool party, surrounded by nearly every person you work with. You'll be wearing the shame of the event forever, since nothing can erase the past.And these things which I've just mentioned,...make me cry a thousand tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid I loved watching western movies, and that didn't change much so far. The only problem, it is hard to find a good western these days. Luckily "Traded" is one of them. First, to all the people that didn't watch the movie, don't listen to the critics... if you are a true western fan you will like the movie. It has a little bit of everything, Kris Kristofferson!!! as a retired gunslinger, revenge, nice western ambiance, suspense and awesome actions scenes. Even Trace Adkins (famous American country music singer) acts in the movie making him more authentic.

		<fullReview>Oh, where to start?? script: awful, acting: awful, direction: awful. Every stereotypical cowboy character you've ever seen! It's 'Taken' wild west style! The film has no flow, the pace is dreadfully slow and badly edited. No dramatic music - what you get is supermarket shopping music. Every actor says 'son of a bitch' constantly, sometimes twice in one sentence. "If it was my daughter, I'd kill that son of a bitch - now go get that son of a bitch" Great script-writing! The best actors were the horses, who conveyed that "and I missed going to the knackers yard for a part in this?" look superbly. Trace Adkins tries to pull off an impression of Clint Eastwood throughout the movie, right down to the gritted teeth, which isn't believable - but then none of the characters are. As for Lavoie's son, played by Michael John Long Jr, it's the dumbest attempt at a character development I've ever seen. Long Jr simply sticks his tongue into his bottom lip and a comedy character is born! Watch out for the girl with orange teeth - her character's look is comedy gold too. Swerve this movie at all costs, unless you have already stuck all your pins into your eyes and don't care about wasting 1 hour 38 minutes of your life - I'd rather have the plague and have a root canal, without anaesthetic, than watch this movie again!</fullReview>

Apparently I have to submit at least ten lines so I'll expand, the cinematography is OK, the plot is not dissimilar to a western version of Taken, the acting is not good but that may well be down to the dialogue that the actors were given to deliver.

		<fullReview>Can't go wrong with Kris Kristofferson in your western, too.In the same premise as the movie Taken, a man, who just lost his son to a snake bite, loses his daughter to white slavery and has to use a particular set of skills he retired 15 or so years before to bring her back.The movie gives this speech at the beginning of the film that talks about how slavery has just ended but white slavery still existed. It put me in the mood to see a whole movie about white slavery, but the movie was made very personal as we just followed this cowboy on his journey to finding his daughter. Although Tom Sizemore is in the movie as a pimp trying to create the best whore house on this side of the Mississippi(his words) which made for a more insightful look at prostitution in the wild west. Michael Paré does a great job as a lead actor playing a cowboy. silent but deadly and a real talk is cheap type of person. He's traveling all over the west looking for his daughter who was sold and traded into being a whore.The concept of the movie is really dark, especially when the fact that through the movie you never know exactly what's going on with the daughter as the movie is all from the lead actor's point of view. Although I must admit, the film itself is not as dark as the concept. I feel like I should have been more on the edge of my seat concern about the whereabouts of this child, rather than how bad ass the cowboy is.Well overall, I wish this was the Taken for the prequel with Liam Neeson</fullReview>

The resulting drips form this sorry excuse for a film.The screenwriter also owns a food delivery service. He should continue to only deliver bologna to Angelenos too stoned to shop for themselves instead of trying to feed it to viewers. Oh, wait. He did write that "Brady Wives" episode.Trace Adkins would never leave the confines of a paper bag if purposed with escape through acting. Michael Pare? Really? Is he still alive? It's difficult to determine as he zombie-walks through this role to give 'phoning it in' a new definition. It is again good to see Kris Kristofferson's trademark face screwing and teeth gnashing. This Director, like all others Kris worked for, couldn't tame these tics either. When did Sizemore get released from prison?Oh, the plot. I haven't seen a film plot like this in a good fifteen minutes. Yada yada daughter kidnapped. Yada yada track kidnappers down. Yada yada bang bang kill kill. Nothing new. Nothing original. Thank me now for saving you from this - the softest word I can use without expletive - snoozefest. Okay, POS. You figure it out.Who puts up money for dreck like this? I suppose when you're Michael Pare and offered a few ducats you take them. Good thing he found time with all the buzz about his tour-de-force performance in the TV remake of "The Philadelphia Experiment."It rankles bux are put into useless celluloid as this when there are thousands of scripts far more worthy of entertaining an audience. This film is not only bad, it's a tragic indicator of a deal regardless the outcome. Wake up money men. You're going to lose your underoos on this. Have some cojones and mount better films.Bah!NOTE: IMDb delayed this review until opening weekend was over, and there's noting more desperate than filmmakers who plant reviews from users who've just joined (and consider this the best film ever made) or are either obsessed with, or work for, Trace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Won't stand along side modern classics like Open Range or Tombstone but this is definitely one of the better ones to come out lately</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kansas soil is full of fools who thought they were quicker." Clay (Paré) is a loving father but after his son is killed something changes in his family. Not wanting to live in depression any longer his daughter decides to leave and start her new life. When Clay realizes that something has gone wrong he will stop at nothing to find his daughter and bring her home safe. There have been a ton of these cheaply made westerns and most are almost unwatchable. While this won't stand along side modern classics like Open Range or Tombstone this is definitely one of the better ones to come out lately. That being said, this is essentially a western version of Taken. Adkins is a little over the top in this, but it works. Paré does a great job of carrying the movie and adds something to the movie to keep it from becoming too cheesy. Western fans will definitely enjoy this one. Overall, one of the better westerns to come out in a while. I liked this. I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trade it for another movie !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I can say is that I actually laughed during this movie !! Acting was mechanical, emotionless, jerky and below poor. (Not to be crude, but I have seen better acting in a Porno movie !!) editing is choppy and confusing at times, the story line is predictable and you can 'See it coming' like a train on a clear day !! There is no suspense nothing to make you sit on the edge of your seat, there's no connection with the characters, you don't feel anything for them! Well, I did actually feel sympathy for them, I was sorry they decided to make this movie !!! It was a total and complete failure on every level. I can honestly say I have watched made for TV movies that surpass this by leaps and bounds. As far as the positive reviews posted here, all I can figure is that the posters must be friends or relatives of the actors, director or producer. If you really feel the need to see this movie I strongly suggest you wait till it comes out on TV or is in the .99 cent clearance bin at Walmart. Then you won't feel so bad for having watched it. It was a waste of 98 good minutes of my day. I cannot think of one positive thing to say about it, not one!! I'm very sorry to have to write such a poor review, but that's just the way it is. I actually sat here for 15 minutes trying to think of something positive to say and all I could come up with was, the horse were very handsome. The only reason I gave it a 1/10 rating was because the scale doesn't allow for negative numbers, otherwise I would have honestly rated it at -8/10. It gets +2 negative points because the horses looked good!! Don't PLEASE don't waste your money. If you have money to throw away, which is what you will be doing if you buy a ticket to watch this, you may send it to me! I could use it and at least it will go to a good cause. Spending a single dollar on this movie is going to make you hate yourself afterwards. Sorry Kris, Michael and Trace, you guys could have found a much better project to get involved in. Kris and Trace definitely, at least they can act with a good script and director, Michael should maybe stick to made for TV stuff, which by the way I have seen made for TV movies that look like Academy Award contenders when compared to this !!! Hope this helps you save your hard earned dollars, don't waste your money or your time, seriously !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Western I have seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw trailers for this western over the past couple months. 2 of the actors Trace Adkins and Kris Kristoferson I am a fan. Trace Adkins is a country music superstar AND also a veteran actor. Trace Adkins with a 20 year career in country music and climbing has millions of fans worldwide! Yes I did watch this movie because both Trace and Kris were in this movie, however, wow this is indeed the best western I have ever seen! action from beginning to the end! trace was flawless in this movie he definitely went above and beyond! I have to also mention the casting for this movie, excellent choices! If you like westerns you will enjoy TRADED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Western films I have ever seen, Fresh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great acting, great script and some amazing direction.If I could think of one film that sums up everything I ask for when I see a movie, this would be it. Not only is it the greatest Western ever made, but with sincere honesty I would say it is absolutely the greatest movie I have seen so far. Traded has no flaws or room for disagreement. It is a movie that anyone and everyone can enjoy and appreciate. You don't have to be a fan of westerns or even a big fan of movies for it to be enticing to you. Enough saidNow go on and enjoy this movie you Cowboy Maniacs.</fullReview>
