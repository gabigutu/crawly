		<shortDescription>The truth about the Exorcist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of anxiety that goes into viewing The Exorcist, "the scariest movie ever made", for the very first time. And with that anxiety comes a lot of expectations and preconceived ideas about what The Exorcist *should* be. Especially for someone born after the film. Then on top of that waited years before finally seeing it.I love the Exorcist, and after exposure to God knows how many horror films, the Exorcist remains my favorite within the genre. And even from a die-hard fan I have to admit, I hate hearing "scariest movie of all time" associated with this movie.First of all, there's no reason to compare fright factor of films, so forget that anyone ever called The Exorcist "the scariest movie ever made." Take any movie ? I don't care what movie ? and stick a "greatest/scariest/best" whatever tag next to it, and you'll have audiences investing in what they *think* it should be instead of letting the film present itself for what it is. And all they see is that it is not what they expected (expectations, I might add, that are shaped by the current gimmicks and trends in Hollywood).I love the Exorcist because it dared to defy my expectations. This is not a wall-to-wall, credits-to-credits montage of scary imagery inspired by a mere scenario that's supposed to pass as a plot. This isn't a movie about that long dark corridor and something waiting to jump out of the darkness and attack (which is always preceded by a false scare featuring a cat). It's not about that cheap gimmicky scenario of X amount of people isolated from the rest of the world, with a killer/monster/ghost/whatever on the loose.The Exorcist is a very slow movie that actually features a full blown plot, its characters, and their associated arcs. The original ambition of The Exorcist was to scare the world with imagery and concepts never before seen in cinema. Shocking moments that the audience of 1973 could not believe they would ever see on the silver screen (from a major studio, no less.) After 30 years, the movie isn't so shocking because times have changed, and the success of the Exorcist has guaranteed countless imitation in all forms across all boards. However, the Exorcist is still one of the most ambition horror films ever made, because (are you ready for this?) ? the Exorcist dares to tell a story.Everyone remembers the pea soup, the head spinning, the vulgarities spewed from the demon's mouth, the stairs, the infamous cut (now restored) spider walk. But I adore this movie for the things no one seems to bring up ? I love the setup in Iraq where Father Lancaster Merrin detects the signs of his final showdown, and how these abstract scenes on subsequent viewings give the movie a more epic feel. I love the transition from Chris MacNeil to Father Karras walking across campus that's reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock. I became absorbed watching Father Karras caring for his aging mother and the close relationship they have, seeing him depressed and sharing a drink with a fellow priest as he discusses his own issues with faith.And what impresses me most about a movie named the Exorcist is how it seems to reject the possibility of possession and exorcism as its ultimate and final solution. The characters in the movie don't want it to be true, and in fact don't really even know about the possibility of Exorcism, thus they explore and exhaust all other possibilities (both medical and psychological). I smiled with delight (after all the hospital scenes) in that priceless moment when Chris MacNeil asks Karras, "And how does one go about getting an exorcism?" which stops father Karras in his tracks as he, a man of the church, looks at her as though she's lost her mind.The fact that the movie resists the temptation to jump right into the acknowledgment that Regan is possessed continues to build up the epic Good versus Evil, God versus Satan, the exorcist versus the demon, feel. Like the characters, the movie doesn't want it to be true, it doesn't want to go there and embrace that possibility, but we the audience know what must inevitably happen. And it's almost magical how the movie finally acknowledges Regan's only hope. There's no glorious fanfare nor is there boastful ultimatums, instead the movie lamentingly and silently surrenders to it as we watch Lancaster Merrin walking up the sunny garden path, staring down at a newly delivered envelope. He doesn't have to read it. He already knows what it says, as do we.The imagery then fades to an ominous foggy night as a taxi pulls up to the MacNeil place in Georgetown, then we're treated to the haunting imagery that inspired the cover art. What must be done, must be done. I love how the movie implies that Merrin has faced this very demon before through its imagery, and through the dialogue as Karras explains he's identified at least three manifestations to which Merrin answers, "No. There is only one." I can address more ? the acting, the beautiful cinematography, brilliant makeup ? but I'll stop to keep from sounding like a raving fan who over hypes every inch of everything. I'll close with these thoughts: I'm not the type of person who will watch the same movie over and over and over. Most movies I see, the specific imagery and specific ideas don't make a deep enough impression to stick with me for more than a few months. I remember the Exorcist, not because I thought it was the "scariest movie ever made", rather because of the wonderful craftsmanship, the fact that it dared to tell a story, and it defied my expectations.When Friday the 13th, the Grudge, Skeleton Key, and Cursed are reduced to vague memories and general ideas, I will still clearly remember the Exorcist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil Made Her Do It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In late 1973 and early 1974, women and men were lined up for blocks. People were known to become ill watching it. Some fainted. Some ran out of the theater in tears. There were reports of people having to be institutionalized, and at least one miscarriage was attributed to viewing it. No, it wasn't a Rolling Stones Concert. It was a film called The Exorcist.The first time I had heard of something called The Exorcist was on late night television when the author, William Peter Blatty, was a guest on The Tonight Show. The conversation centered around how horrible some of the things in the book were. I had also seen the novel listed on The New York Times Bestseller List, and it seemed as if it would remain there forever. After having been on the waiting list for what seemed like an eternity at the local library, I was finally able to obtain a copy. It was the first book I had read in one sitting since probably Nancy Drew and The Hidden Staircase quite a few years earlier. And yes, for it's time it was filled with gut wrenching details of what happens when for some unexplained reason; an innocent girl is possessed by Satan. While reading the book I was sure that if it ever made its way to film, most of the details would certainly be either `cleaned up' or omitted altogether. As you know the film was made and it spared the movie going public absolutely nothing in the way of details.Certainly many of the people who lined up to see The Exorcist did so to watch some of the more gruesome scenes, the worst of which involved Regan's masturbation with a crucifix. Yet, the hysteria went well beyond the fact that such scenes were so vividly depicted. I think one needs to look no further than Mel Gibson's The Passion to find the answer as to why. I'm sure most of you have read the story of people leaving Mel's film in tears, some to the point of being hysterical. From most articles I have read, it seems that the majority of the audience that was moved were those people of strong religious beliefs. For many others, the depiction of the brutality in The Passion may have been uncomfortable to sit through, but weren't emotionally effected to any degree. Much of this same feeling can explain the hysteria surrounding The Exorcist. Those who had a definitive belief in Heaven and Hell, of Good and Evil, of Jesus as The Savior and Satan as the epitome of pure evil were affected by The Exorcist far more than those who were agnostic or just never had a strong belief in spiritual matters. There is no doubt though that much in the way The Passion did, The Exorcist caused many to reconsider how they felt about their faith. The Exorcist made the prospect of Satan being alive and well and a life of eternal damnation a very uncomfortable prospect. The fact that Blatty claims his book and screenplay were based on a true story seemed to give the film even more credibility.For me, The Exorcist has always been more about the never ending conflict between pure evil and pure innocence than about being an average horror story. There are many more levels to this film than what initially meets the eye. There is no doubt that while the main story revolves around an innocent young girl, Regan McNeil (Linda Blair), being inhabited by Satan himself, Blatty enhances it greatly by adding different characters in various stages of conflict. Regan's mother, Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) obviously cares deeply for her daughter. Yet she is not beyond reproach. In one scene when Reagan's father hasn't called on Regan's birthday, we see her desperately on the phone doing battle with an overseas operator. The problem is not how vicious the phone call is, but that she does it within ear shot of her daughter as if to drive the point home to Regan how worthless her father is. When, she finally does seek the aid of Father Damian Karras, we don't feel that she believes in exorcism anymore than he does, but is desperate enough to accept the fact that it is possible and will take any and all measures to save her daughter.Father Karras (Jason Miller) is a priest torn by conflict. He is ridden by overwhelming guilt for having abandoned his mother to enter the priesthood. He is torn spiritually by the confessions of those priests who seek his help as a psychiatrist, so much so that he now questions his own faith. When he states to the Bishop that `Regan's case meets all the criteria,' we know that even more than Chris, he doesn't really believe in the power of Satan to inhabit a living being in the manner that it has taken over Regan. Yet, he will do what is required of him as a priest concerned about the health of a child.Jack McGowran gives a terrific performance as the alcoholic director filming Chris's latest film in Georgetown. Kitty Winn is Sharon Spencer, the secretary who works for Chris and always seems to be in the line of fire when Chris is angry. She is always there but for all the horror she witnesses, Winn appears too bland and emotionless and her performance is probably the weakest in the film.Max Von Sydow as Father Lancester Merrin is a no nonsense aging priest. He has done battle with evil before and he shows us its effect in every scene he occupies. One could pass it off to being just good make-up but it is so much more than that as Sydow demonstrates all the nuances that brings to life a man who has faced Satan and lived to tell about it. He knows what he is up against, understands he must do it again and the consequences of what that battle may be.If I have a small complaint with The Exorcist it is in regards to the character of Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb). I have never been able to buy into the character. It is not the fault of Cobb who is his usual stalwart self in the role. The whole character should at best have only been necessary for a few brief scenes yet; he has several that go on way too long and do not add anything to the story. Even in his scenes with Chris or Damian, Kinderman is so odd that he distracts us too much from their characters and it is Chris and Damian's reactions that are more important to us, not his investigation. For all you trivia buffs out there, Blatty once sued the producers of Columbo, stating they based Peter Falk's character on Kinderman. If memory serves me correctly Blatty lost that one.As for Director William Friedken, although he won the best director award for The French Connection, for me The Exorcist will always remain his defining film. The Final half hour of The Exorcist are still as dynamic today as they were 31 years ago, French Connection car chase be damned.It seems that to many of the younger movie audiences of today, The Exorcist has become more of a joke than anything else. That's not surprising considering how many times it has been lampooned, even by Linda Blair herself in Repossessed. Yet, if they were to view the film in a more serious vein, not as just another creature feature, they may just find that there really is more to this film than a little girl spewing pea soup and spinning her head around 360 degrees. It is the ultimate battle between Heaven and Hell and Good and Evil. It is the story of the complete and total degradation of innocence. It is a study in character, and whether a man torn by the forces surrounding him, can regain his faith and his belief in God and mankind to save the life of a little girl, caught up in forces beyond her control.Call it a horror film, call it a religious film, call it what you want. For me, The Exorcist is and will always remain a classic in every sense of the word. And if I regard you as a classic of any kind I have no choice but to leave you with my grade, which for The Exorcist is an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE EXORCIST---A PERFECT FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people complain that this movie's too slow but those are the kind of folks who only like 80-minute splatter films with characters so dumb and one-sided, you pray for the bad guy to kill them. This monster of a drama is both beautiful and bold. It has CHARACTERS and not simply LAMEBRAINS lined up for slaughter. It has class and purpose. It takes the audience into the darkest recesses of humankind and then brings them back through a message of hope and self-sacrifice. The movie is NOT anti-religion, it's anti-evil. Anyone who likes smart, clever, meaningful horror-drama should see this film at least twice. It is surprisingly touching and amazingly powerful.That said, the cast deserves a hand for their wonderful performances. Ellen Burstyn perfectly conveys the tension of a mother of the cusp of tragedy; Max von Sydow is hauntingly perfect as the story's ray of light; Jason Miller embodies the sadness of a defeated man; and Linda Blair is far above average even at her young age.Once again, see this movie. You won't forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unmatched brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason for the hysteria and mystique surrounding THE EXORCIST. And it's called genius.Never have I seen a film matched in shock, terror, writing, or performances. This isn't a horror movie. The film itself is both a moving and terrifying drama that takes a realistic look at what would actually happen if a young girl were possessed in modern America. William Peter Blatty's script is amazing, bringing depth to the characters, and presenting the mystery of faith that they all deal with. Is Regan possessed? Is she insane? And most importantly, Is there a God? In the course of two hours, we see a sweet and innocent young girl become a cross masturbating, head spinning, murderous, creature. We see a successful actress overcome skepticism to save her daughter, and we see a brilliant psychiatrist struggle with his devotion to God as a priest.Friedkin's direction is marvelous, with wonderful uses of light, dark, and color throughout the film. Jason Miller (as Damien Karras) is beautifully subtle in his first film acting role. Max Von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb provide engaging supporting performances as the experienced priest who senses his impending doom, and a detective who senses something sinister is at work. Ellen Burstyn gives a brutally honest performance as a grief stricken woman trying to save her daughter. And most of all, a 12-year-old Linda Blair gives one of the most terrifying, convincing, and beautiful performances ever shown on film. Her range of emotion and connection to Regan are astonishing. She deserved that Oscar!THE EXORCIST presents to us the mystery of faith in it's most raw form--the battle of good and evil. It is an incomparable masterpiece of film, done without the aid of computers and special effects. It relies on story and performances to give us a marvelous and terrifying piece of work. In the end, it makes us ask ourselves what we believe, and keeps us wondering and shuddering at exactally what might be out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense and very terrifying movie that will make you sleep with the bible a few nights in a row</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is one of the best movies to come out of the 70's and deserves better than slowly descending down the top 250. It's one of those essential films you have to see in order to understand what a movie truly is and this is more than a horror film. Unfortunately there are so many people who are saying they got bored, I think because they expected a terrifying movie, people! This isn't a slasher movie, this isn't some scary Michael Myers that you can shoot, this is a story about normal people in a normal house and upstairs there is a little girl who happens to be possessed by "The devil himself". Faith is so strong and when it's shaken, anything in your imagination can run wild.First off the actors: Ellen Burstyn plays Chris McNeil, an actress working in Washington, D.C. on a film. She is the mother of Regan, the little girl who is possessed. I felt such sorrow for Chris, when she begs Father Karras to help her with Regan, I almost cried for her. Her daughter is not sick, this is nothing she can give Regan a pill and she'll be better. Her speech to Father Karras later on in the film: "You show me Regan's double, same face, same voice, everything. And I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut. Now, I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter, except in her mind. You tell me for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!" sent shivers down my spine, this woman knows what Regan needs and will do whatever she can.We have Linda Blair who plays Regan and she was so great for a 12 year old actress. This little apple faced girl became one of the most frightening images of the 70's and still to this day. She's not scary because she's swearing, this little innocent girl has been taken over by forces that she shouldn't even know about. Jason Miller as Father Karras, for a man who had never acted professionally before, he was quite amazing as a priest who just lost his mother and his faith has been shaken up. Max Von Sydow as Father Merrin was so strong and he was like in his 20's playing a man in his 90's. He was robbed of an Oscar, he was so believable and just amazing during the exorcism scene.The effects? People! This was the 70's and they made a bed float! They turned this little angel's face into a hideous creature! If you watch the documentary "Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist", Ellen Burstyn gets slapped by Regan in the film and she had kind of a rope tied around her waist. When the stunt man pulled her back, Billy the director told the guy to let her have it and he YANKED her back hard causing real pain in Ellen's back and that was an actual scream in the movie. They froze the room to the point as were moisture got into the set and there was a layer of snow in the morning they were shooting. There was no CGI, this was the real deal and I believe could truly help the actors. Linda Blair was being thrashed up and down during one of the possessed scenes where the bracing came loose and caused slamming of metal to her back repeatedly and her screams were also very real and bone chilling.William Freidkin is the director of The Exorcist, and there was no better choice. This guy took this picture seriously, so far as to shoot a gun offstage or scream obscenities to get an actor's shocked reaction on film. He slapped almost punched Reverend William O'Malley who played Father Dyer to get him to shake during his reciting the Last Rites to Father Karras. He almost would have killed to make this picture and anyone doing it.Weither or not the set of The Exorcist was truly cursed with a total of 9 deaths linked to the film, a fire on the set with no apparent reason, and the total feeling of evil around the room, we'll never know. But The Exorcist is a true motion picture never to missed or deserve no more than the true compliments it should get! This is the film that should be shown to any aspiring film makers. It's a masterpiece of a film that's more than a mere horror flick.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The scariest movie of all time". Some movie goers agree and some disagree. I belong to the former group, though I would like to rephrase it to "One of the scariest movies of all time". For those of you who have been living in a cave for the past twenty two years, the story is of a pre-pubescent girl, Regan (Linda Blair), possessed by a demon whom purports to be the Devil himself ("Now kindly undo these straps!").In this day and age of schlock fest horror films being relentlessly released (or spewed out for want of a better term) by the big wig studios on a quest to cash in on the latest teenage trend, this premise for a horror story may not seem so scary to most. However, it's the road we take to arrive at this supposition that makes this film stand out from the rest.The seeds of dread and fear are planted early with screen legend Max Von Sydow's Father Merrin receiving disturbing and familiar Omens of what is to come during an archaeological dig in Northern Iraq.We're then taken to the setting where the real horror will begin in the Georgetown home of Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), a successful divorcée film actress living with her daughter Regan. We're initially presented with a Regan who loves horses, has a close and loving relationship with her mother, is uncomfortable with the strained relationship between her parents and has the innocent demeanour and narrow vocabulary of every normal young girl.The carefully crafted and ever so gradual change in Regan's personality, the strange drawings and figurines she creates, the emergence of Captain Howdy (Regan's imaginary friend) and strange outbursts ("You're gonna die up there") and so called physical convulsions force Chris to turn to doctors and eventually psychiatrists to try and get to the bottom of Regan's ever worsening behaviour. Her vocabulary becomes quite extensive with spine chilling, sudden maturity and her outbursts more terrifyingly violent. After exhausting all the "somatic" possibilities for Regan's troubles Chris desperately seeks help from world weary Jesuit Psychiatrist Priest Father Karras (Jason Miller) requesting an exorcism.By the time Karras meets Regan, any semblance of the innocent young girl has completely vanished. Karras is grappling with his faith and subsequently doubts she is truly 'possessed'. Finally convinced that an exorcism is the way to go, he seeks permission from the Catholic Church, who grant him with the condition that he perform it with the help of the experienced Father Merrin.Merrin arrives like a knight in shining armour for the ultimate showdown! A great screenplay by William Peter Blatty (based on his book), intelligent directing from William Friedken and outstanding performances from all the cast, particularly Ellen Burstyn as the traumatised mother make for a classic piece of horror that will stand the test of time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of The Exorcist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For as long as I can recall, I've always possessed (no pun intended) an innate feeling that there exists outside the realm of our established dogma things that defy conventional logic. When I was in the sixth grade, I read the book, "The Exorcist," which scared me senseless. The idea that the Devil could infiltrate the delicate core of one's being called a soul absolutely terrified me at such a young age. After seeing the movie, I was speechless. Have been ever since. William Friedkin's transformation of the book to the movie was superb, in my opinion. (Not all adaptations are.) Dick Smith's special effects, in contrast to today's make-up advancements in the film industry, are still able to stand the test of time. The acting was splendid, from Lee J. Cobb &amp; Jason Miller, to Ellen Burstyn and Max von Sydow's limited appearance in the piece. Friedkin's slice-of-life direction enhances the essence of the fear-factor in an oddly subtle fashion, as though the viewer were actually alongside the characters in the film. Lending to the creepiness of the film is the fact that there exists a minimal musical score (Mike Oldfield's "Tubular Bells" does accompany two nuns strolling gingerly down a Georgetown street in autumn, their robes billowing slightly in the wind). The palpability of what happens to a young Linda Blair has astounded me for over three decades. Having been so taken with the notion that inhuman entities DO stalk the earth and have never existed in human form, I've written a couple of novels on the subject matter, myself. I liken the new version that had been released a few years ago to the last nail in the proverbial coffin of effectiveness, making this one of the best horror-genre films of all time. Simply put: I've never seen any film that remotely comes close to what this movie has done to me (in terms of frightening me senseless). Linda Blair's cute Regan MacNeil is utterly transformed into a beast which is flat-out disturbing to behold. The movie has moved me ever since I had seen it at age fourteen, and I suspect will always. Put simply, at age forty-three I still have a difficult time watching it on my own. Great job, Mr. Friedkin and crew!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist....more than a mere horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is the best horror film ever made and there is one reason for this,the subject matter is treated with dignity and respect,too many "horror films" are made today that just don't try,it's as if they give up half way through and fall into self parody and amusement.the Exorcist is an exception and one of the very few good horror films around.the film works on a number of levels and is one of the few films I know of to do this i.e subliminal imagery,multiple storylines. a lot has been written about this film drawing mainly on sensationalism surrounding the films release that it would be hard for someone who has not seen the film to not have any preconceptions,but if you have not seen the film do try to keep an open mind because it will scare the hell out of you.this is also one of the rare cases where a film could arguably be better than the book it was adapted from.in my opinion the film could not have been made any better,the cast throughout are superb, the locations and production are second to none,all the characters are totally believable and there are points in the film where you think all this could really happen and it is for that reason the film is frightening and continues to frighten people to this day....a true shocker and one that has not lost any of its impact over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Genre Renewal movie: The Exorcist - Horror with no Crime, instead Horror with Spirits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two terrible sequels and one irrelevant remake were never replaced with the original, the 1973 version of The Exorcist; and no other version will never be any more. Written for the screen and produced by William Peter Blatty, both The Exorcist movie and the novel are incident driven basis of the actual happenings from 1949.Looking at the most remarkable movies of 1973, there are 3 other important ones that the history of cinema will remember: -- A slow and touching movie from Ingmar Bergman "Cries and Whispers" -- Bernardo Bertolucci's depressive movie, a study of love "Last Tango in Paris" -- A crime story with Redford and Newman "The Sting". Among all and all the other movies that are produced in this year, The Exorcist stands one step further than the rest for its uniqueness on genre renewal. It's not the first movie that features the Demon in its content, yet in the Exorcist the Demon is introduced in the human level. The idea of being possessed by a spirit is used for the first time ever on the silver-screen. Horror genre featuring spirits didn't need to refer to Crime any more like it used to be in Hitchcock ages. Thus crime became a separate genre, and mostly acted conjointly with thrillers from now on.This uniqueness profits from its sound mixing, great lighting techniques and of course a perfect screenplay. Director William Friedkin was lucky to find his producer Blatty, being also the novel-writer and the idea creator. The plot and the story development goes very smoothly: From Father Merrin's encountering with the Demon Pazuzu in Iraq; to Ellen Burstyn looking for the cure for her daughter's disease, going for visits to every type of doctor... From the noises in the attic, to Regan's peeing on the rug... From decoding the Demon's speech of speaking English in reverse, to the arriving of Merrin... Both the editing and directing gave high qualities to this film.The 25th Anniversary edition DVD is in my movie collections. It's a must to have for horror fans. Either you have this version of DVD or the year 2000 version; you should check out the special features that reveals the real-life 1949 incident, the missing and the deleted scenes including the Spider-walk scene, sound mixing and sound effects tests show how they created the demon's voice and the BBC documentary: The Fear of God, all in the special features.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who watched this film on the big screen when it was re-released and thought it was 'comical, funny, not disturbing nor scary' are just do not understand the complexity that surrounds this movie. Back in '73, no one was expecting a film of this kind, and I know it has been said many times but it WAS way ahead of its time. A time where cinema was in its infancy, religion was practiced on a larger scale than today and showing such violent, graphic and disturbing scenes was not thought of as being possible, one can understand why it has been banned for so many years.I recently watched this movie (at night, before bedtime) and it really left me thinking of how such horrifying scenes could be shown and portrayed in such a way. There were many scenes that would not get out of my head (for those who have seen the movie would know what scenes they are). I could not sleep that night and that hasn't happened since I saw Nightmare On Elm Street Part 1 when I was 6!What makes things worse is that there are well known cases where people have been possessed by the devil or a supernatural being, which leads them in doing evil deeds.When you mix a horror movie with religion on such a large magnitude, things can heat up and become very unpleasant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never really been much of a fan of horror films because I've never been able to suspend my belief long enough to let a monster scare me. To me psychological demons are much more effective than overdone makeup jobs. I prefer The Haunting with Claire Bloom, or The Shining with Jack Nicholson. But the all-time classic has got to be The Exorcist. One of the reasons The Exorcist always scares the bejesus out of me is because it treats an epistemological subject very seriously, even when the one character you'd expect to step forth willingly, young priest Father Karras (Jason Miller), does his best to dissuade Ellen Burstyn that her daughter is possessed by a demon. Of course, by that time Karras has already confessed to a fellow priest that he's started to lose his own faith because he realizes that the problems he has to deal with of his congregation are too much for one man, especially a man who keeps neglecting his own mother during the last days of her life. I think one of the reasons this is such a successful film is that the concept of a demon is treated as intangibly as our imagination's reach: How WOULD the devil deal with us if confronted? By reading each of our souls, finding whatever carefully hidden secrets there are and spewing them back in our faces as spiritual ammunition. Not only that, but when you see Regan (Linda Blair) in the opening scenes gently horseplaying around with her mother and her sister, the charm and goodness she radiates leaves you completely floored when she finally does become possessed and turns into a creature so horrible that you forget all about Regan. The lynchpin is having Max von Sydow cast as the aging priest who comes to finish off the work that Father Karras has started. Von Sydow who has been Ingmar Bergman's spiritual warrior for so many of his films dealing with the epistemological nature of the universe. And credit must go to Mercedes McCambridge for supplying the voice of the demon.I think The Exorcist is one of the best "lit" and photographed films of all time. The use of shadow is brilliant; very low key (simple things like showing a lit hall, yet having the far stairway at the END of the hall not lit...very subtly eerie stuff) yet incredibly evocative. I mean, the shadows damn near have colors. Director of Photography Owen Roizman, whose work can be seen in "The Addams Family" and "Grand Canyon," shot "The Exorcist." Roizman's credits include such famous titles as "The French Connection," "Network," "Tootsie," "Three Days of the Condor," "The Electric Horseman" and "Havana." In a movie that took 180 days to make (three times the average), the exorcism alone took three months-and on some of those days the crew felt lucky to get one shot. That was because director William Friedkin wanted to make it visually clear that the satanic spirit inside the possessed girl had made the room unbearably cold. A refrigerated set representing her bedroom was constructed on a sound stage, and air conditioners worked all night to lower its temperature to 40 degrees below zero. "When we set up the lights in the morning, that would raise the temperature to around zero, which was necessary if we were going to be able to see the frost on the actor's breath," Roizman explained. "We also kept the humidity very high. It was an unbelievably uncomfortable way to work."Look closely using stop-action laserdisc to reveal the flash-frames of Satan's face, which Friedkin inserted almost subliminally at two places, and to reveal a subtle double-exposure in which the evil spirit seems to peer out through Blair's eyes. There are semi-subliminal single-frame shots in this film: when the priest is dreaming of his mother coming up out of the subway, there is a single frame shot of a face (Eileen Dietz), painted black and white, grimacing. There are two other places where this image is supposedly displayed: when Regan, lying on the bed, turns to look at Father Merrin and Father Karras, and just after the head-turning scene. Do not watch this alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a powerful film, more than thirty years on...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than thirty years on, The Exorcist remains a very powerful film and was a cinematographic milestone in 1973. Repeated duplication of the genre has, no doubt, 'desensitized' a new generation of movie-watchers, though it remains an unnerving masterpiece. It is not difficult to understand why the film generated such a seismic global impact all those years ago, since it imposed an unprecedented sensory attack on the viewer. Regan's vile physical appearance, combined with her vile language and blasphemous diatribe sent a shock wave around the world. Moreover, many people seemed to believe the claims that the film was based on a true story and could therefore actually happen to them. Electricity consumption must have soared for several months in 1973 as people who had seen the film slept with their lights on! It is still not a film I would feel comfortable watching before going to bed. On another level, I found parts of it profoundly moving and actually cried at the end when Regan was finally released from her possessor and wept in the arms of her mother and Father Damien, having lunged himself through a window and down a precipitous flight of steps, managed to find just enough life in himself to indicate that he had retained his faith and repented of his sins by motioning his fingers in the sign of penitence when comforted by a distraught colleague. Possibly the only thing that lets the film down if one really sits and thinks about it is the underpinning concept that an ancient demon which had existed since the dawn of time should wish to possess the body of a twelve year old child and emit a string of juvenile profanities. But then the film was designed to shock all along!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense , mystery , shocks and grisly horror is this classic terror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This known story concerns about a mother (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter (Linda Blair), the latter is possessed and two Fathers , Karras (Jason Miller) and Merrin (Max Von Sidow) attempt to free Regan MacNeil from possession by the devil . Meanwhile , a Police Inspector (Lee J. Cobb) is investigating the weird events . And the priests suffering incredible risks trying to unravel mystery of demon living inside Regan .This is a fairly suspenseful and horrifying story, based on a supposedly true flick . The movie begins well and grows more and more until the scary and eerie finale . Top-notch picture, thanks to fine acting , tight pacing , well mounted edition and skillful special effects with magnificent make-up by Dick Smith . Creepy acting by Linda Blair , due to death threats against Linda Blair from religious zealots who believed the film "glorified Satan", Warner Bros had bodyguards protecting her for six months after the film's release . On the first day of filming the exorcism sequence, Linda Blair's delivery of her foul-mouthed dialogue so disturbed the gentlemanly Max Von Sydow that he actually forgot his lines . The script is awesome , the acting excellent and the direction by William Friedkin plenty of good pace and conviction . Enjoyable secondary cast such as Lee J Cobb , Kitty Winn and Jack McGowran who died at the time finished the movie and added a legend about Exorcist's curse . Dark cinematography in sinister and mysterious atmosphere by Owen Roitzman and frightening musical score adding Mike Oldfield's soundtrack ¨Tubular bells¨ . The tale is rated ¨R¨ for graphic violence and profanity but contains gore and guts . Reiussed in 2000 by means of a special edition by director with ten minutes approximately additional footage with new amazing scenes as Regan downing stairs .Followed by two sequels and numerous imitations , in 1977 ¨the Heretic¨ by John Borman with Richard Burton , deemed awful and in 1990 titled ¨The Exorcist III¨ by William Peter Blatty with George C Scott, Brad Dourif , Ed Flanders and Nicol Williamson . Furthermore, spawned two prequels starred by a young Father Merrin , Stellan Skarsgard , and set in Africa , both of them directed by Paul Schrader and Renny Harlin .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Godfather of Horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is simply a masterpiece. Great Cinematography darkens the atmosphere and a superb screenplay enhances the dialog. There is plenty of excellent actors in this film as well. Loads of great performances from actors such as: Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max von Sydow. I pressure you to see the re-edited one. Trust me, it's not a remake. It's a better editing of sound and picture, and even some NEW footage that is of the same quality.If you enjoy horror movies of any kind, and/or like a good drama, this film is for you. A Head-spinning performance from Linda Blair makes it even more horrific, seeing a little innocent child getting possessed by a horrid demon. Ellen Burstyn give another great performance, as a mother going through shock and worry about what is happening to her daughter. This acting is all together very powerful, realistic and leaves for a better cinematic experience overall. Other great notable parts of the movie, are the satisfying amount of good dialog, quotes, and scenes. Gut-wrenching horror conjoins with gritty drama in this absolutely awe-inspiring movie. See it for yourself if you haven't yet, you must; because it is definitely a memorable film.4 of 4 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very highly rated horror movie for a good reason, when it was realised it broke the mould of everything that preceded it, and set the standard for the horror genre for decades to come; because of this it should retain its place Movie history forever.The sheer terror this movie instilled in people, during the year of its release is even today unmatched by anything. Time, however has altered its effect on its audience, we simply are not as easily shocked as we used to be.For anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet, my advice is this, approach it with an open mind, and remember when it was made, this is the only way you will appreciate it for what it is.Difficult for new audiences to appreciate, but it is still a classic, time won't change that.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I almost feel ashamed for not liking this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a very frustrating scene from Jaws 2 where Brody walks into the selectsmen's meeting carrying the photograph that the two divers took as they were being eaten. Brody sees the outline of the mouth and the eye. And he should know what a shark looks like. But when he passes it around, Harry saysSeaweed?" Verna Fields says, "it's under water isn't it? That's why it's so dark?" They can't see something that is so obviously and that is bothersome. That is how I feel about my reaction to the Exorcist. Everyone has told me how frightening it is and how it is a psychological trip. And I know the reaction that audiences had towards it in the 70's. But as much as I try, I just can't see it. It is not a scary movie and it is not even an enjoyable one, and I would even go so far as to say that it is not even a good movie.First off, there are so many parts of this film that have nothing to do with what the film is about. The first hour is nothing. It really has no relevance to the rest of the film. And for the life of me I really can't understand what the beginning is about. Why do we need the background of the Exorcist in Iraq? What does that have to do with the film and how does it further the plot? I don't get it.Secondly, this is a very poorly editted film. There were times that I cringed at some of the editting. It was such a blatant cut that you felt like you could see the editors crazy gluing the film together. And I am not saying that to be cruel, I really mean that.Thirdly, and this is the big one, what is so scary about this film? Really, all Regan did was get her face scarred a bit, vomit a lot, yell out obsenities and blugeon herself with a cross. Now that is interesting in the fact that this must have sent a shock wave through the religious community because you are not supposed to say or do anything bad towards the church. But in terms of scares or chills? No way, they just weren't there. I can admire a film like Halloween and Blair Witch for being innovative enough to scare us but no this film. Frankly, I was bored. I really was. There were times that I wanted to turn this off and watch the baseball game, and we all know how boring baseball is on the tube. But this film moved at a snails pace. And if they would have cut it down by about thirty minutes, it may have been better.The other element that I can't get past is the fact that this was the devil himself. Okay, let's just say it is. Why does it allow himself to be tied down? Why does it jump at water that isn't holy? Why does it possess a girl when it can come onto this Earth in human form if it wanted to. When Lucifer was kicked out of Heaven, he was abolished because of greed and a lust for power. So for an angel to be that despised must have been considered dangerous and powerful. If that is so, then why all the scenes of Satan being dominated by humans? Are you saying that the best he could come up with is making a girl puke, levitate, and throw a few things around the room? That sounds more like he was just having a bad day because he couldn't get his own way. That doesn't sound like the personification of evil. You want to see real evil, watch DeNiro in Angel Heart.The Exorcist is a film that has it's place in history and I can admire it for that. And to be honest I almost feel like someone that doesn't like The Blair Witch Project. I can't understand why people can't like that film, that is true fear for me. So when I say that this film is really not that good, I can understand why people may think I'm ignorant, but when you compare this to A Nightmare On Elm Street or Halloween, can you honestly say that this has more to offer? And if you can say that, well, I just don't see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply, the greatest "Horror" film ever made ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What scares us more than anything? The answers are multiple : the dark, the evil, a mysterious presence, death ultimately; in fact, anything incontrollable. And when you think about it, all these elements have something in common: they refer to an unknown force whose presence is palpable. Indeed, the unknown scares, because it can't be seen, can't be controlled, therefore, can't be fought.These are the primitives fears that tortured the life of people since the dawn of humanity, and we inherited this fears in the same unconscious way our children will. We're aware of our mortal nature, and each of our fears is driven by this awareness, which is due to the biggest fear, the fear of the unknown. And the genius of "The Exorcist" is that it perfectly plays on these primitive instincts of ours, to provide the greatest Horror film ever made, a thrilling masterpiece of realism that'll haunt cinematic memories for ever. As soon as the Tubular bells start ringing, the film is inhabited by an atmosphere that will never desert it, a fearsome and gloomy ambiance absorbing any place we're watching the film in. Everything is directed with such confidence and meticulousness, the thrills almost come precociously. Indeed, before anything happens, we feel something WILL happen, but we don't know what. It seems like a cinematic trick, but not any director has the guts to let you wait more than almost half an hour before the oddities happen. The set-up is slow paced in "The Exorcist" because it's a movie that respects our intelligence, and doesn't try to provide cheap thrills. William Friedkin who had just made another realistic masterpiece, the Best Picture Winner "The French Connection" is so confident he gives us enough time to discover the characters, to get into their daily life, patiently waiting for the pivotal point that will join their fates. The direction, the writing are all in subtlety, and work because even though nothing happens yet, we keep our guard up, we know there's an evil presence somewhere, we can feel it.This is an old cinematic device started by directors who hadn't enough money to portray credible monster-type villains: they understood that sometimes, the scare is more efficient from the suggestion of a presence than its explicit depiction. When you see, you know, and if you know, you can control, but in "The Exorcist", the villain is here, but we never see him, he's like the shark from "Jaws" or "Alien", with a slight difference, he's not visible because he controls the body of a poor little girl. Linda Blair, as the demonically possessed Regan MacNeil , is so convincing, it broke my heart to see how the evil can have so devastating effects on a pure little soul. And the tragedy of Regan is the torment of her mother, Chris, Ellen Burstyn, perfect as a totally helpless woman, incapable of saving her little girl. And this is the fascinating aspect of the film, more than a horror drama, it also works as a thrilling mystery. A mystery where the Lieutenant Detective Kinderman, Lee J. Cobb in one of his great last roles, is the one who investigates about the strange phenomena that occurred and acts as a bridge between the victims and the priests.So many questions are raised in the beginning, we understand that sooner or later, we'll have an exorcism. Well, it's the title, isn't it? But the set-up is necessary. The parallel stories where we're transported into the universes of Father Damien Karras, portrayed by Jason Miller, and the iconic Father Merryl, Max Von Sydow, challenge our patience: we can't wait for the exorcism ... but without the build-up, the climax would be worthless. It's a movie where any flaws can be caused by an impatience from the director, an eagerness to distract the masses with thrilling moments, but a big impatience could have ruined such a magnificent and ambitious project. And "The Exorcist" would never have been the masterpiece it is without this patience. However, this would never have been such an iconic horror masterpiece without the few horrifying moments that punctuate the movie between the set-up and the climax. And by horrifying, I won't give any clues, let's just say it works on every level: visual, sounds, atmosphere, cinematography, dialogs, special effects, and of course, timing, since all these effects come at the least expected moments, provoking reactions in total symbiosis with the characters. We feel and fear for them, as the realism implies that it could even happen to us. This is no Hollywood, this is true horror.Lately, the American Film institute listed the Top 100 movies and I must admit I was shocked not to see "The Exorcist" in the list... it's a classic, probably the most horrifying horror film ever made. It has everything, a dazzling cinematography incarnated by the iconic shot of Father Merryl's shadowy silhouette coming from the mist, an unforgettable villain, and of course shocking moments where the make-up, the visual and sound effects prove how vital they are for such a genre that relies so much on realism. But this realism would have been nothing without the genius of the script and the masterful direction, that could finally let the film exude all its greatness in the last act, one of the most unforgettable climactic sequences ever, putting "The Exorcist" among those films that transcends the simple act of watching, becoming more of experiences.And this is why I waited for years and years before finally getting to watch "The Exorcist", one of the few movies that scared me even before watching it. And all I can say is that it met my expectations. And watching it at night (with someone, I would recommend) gets more hypnotic and absorbing after each viewing ? "The Exorcist" is a must-see and ... be careful, any second, it can surprise you, really ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a milestone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 'The Exorcist' 32 years too late. This was not the kind of films to be allowed in the Communist Romania of my youth. It's really a milestone in the horror movies genre.I dare say that if 'Exorcist' was made today it won't go controversy-free. In the current moralistic climate, and with the on-going debates about the role of the Catholic church, a film about Catholic exorcism would generate some debate. The thing is that three decades passed and as we got used with this one, we can argue now about the 'Da Vinci Code'.The art of the movie is to take the very un-believable story of a pre-teen-age girl with a deteriorating mental health and make us believe that the only logical explanation is that she is possessed. We would not believe it in real life, we truly believe it on screen. The means to achieve this artistic truth are mostly classical cinema, good story telling and solid acting but at the same time the film is revolutionary by bringing to screen for the first time elements of the horror genre that have become routine since then - levitation, psycho-kinetic capabilities, and especially the make-up that transforms the angelic Linda Blair into a demonic kid-monster.Director William Friedkin had 'French Connection' in his record when he did 'The Exorcist'. This was to be his last great film, unless the future will bring us surprises - he is still working, now in his 70s. But these two movies are more than most directors do good in their whole lives, and well enough to book him a place in the history of the seventh art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad; Just Overhyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe the furor that was apparently caused when this movie was first released. I was just 10 years old at the time and never saw it in the theatres, and, in fact, only just recently saw it for the first time. It struck me as a pretty standard horror movie about a young girl possessed by the devil. I didn't find it shocking or horrific, and have seen movies that were far more frightening than this.The highlight of the movie, I would say, was the absolutely brilliant performance by young Linda Blair as the possessed Regan. She has apparently said over the years that this movie was the end of any real acting career for her, because she became so deeply associated with this character in the public imagination. That's the price, I guess, when your first movie performance is so brilliant and so controversial. With no body of work before to balance it, Linda Blair became Regan MacNeil. Jason Miller was effective as Father Damien, but was overshadowed by Blair. It was also, I thought, a good study of a priest who had become a psychologist more than a theologian (far too common in all Christian denominations, even today.) Max Von Sydow's performance as Father Merrin (called in by the Church to confront the demon) was quite good.I got lost a bit in the beginning of this movie, which dealt with some of Merrin's background, and there was also no real explanation of how this girl got possessed (which, however, is probably making a point: evil can strike anywhere for no obvious reason.)In the end, I just found this to be a decent horror movie, but I didn't think there was anything spectacular about it. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep Archetypical Contrasts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the documentary on the DVD, von Sydow says that if you are open to it, this film will scare you and perhaps affect you spiritually. Certainly true. Why this and not the many other similar films? Keep in mind that essentially all the rest of Friedkin's work is mundane, worthless.A large part of the question, I think, is that the creators of the film have stumbled into a rich field of archetypal conflicts, stuff deeper than just a sweet kid cursing and masturbating.The film is set in a Jesuit University. Even today, if you go there, you find a very strange vibe. The notion of authoritarian faith being crammed down from above certainly has a place in society, but such a brotherhood running an academy of open inquiry is a puzzling, disturbing mix. And that's underscored and mirrored by a similar (though less militant) conflict around psychiatry. Here we have the priests of `medicine' torturing this little girl to confirm their theories.The priest is the center of the film, and embodies all this: Arcane `faith' versus modern inquiry; Taking direction blindly rather than acting on knowledge; Understanding the mind versus understanding the soul; Serving the weak (his mother) versus battling powerful evil. Friedkin increased these ambiguities wherever he found them, usually against the positivist stance of Blatty.Interesting in this context are two tricks, one conscious, the other I suspect not.The conscious one is the self-referential wrapper. This is film about a film star, making a film. What triggers the possession are the visits by the director who probably had some deviant intent or action. He is the first victim. Thus, Friedkin places himself in the action and himself openly exploits Linda Blair. Meanwhile the actor playing the director dies in real life.The unconscious one is the Persian reference. Best scholarship has Judaism coming from Zoroastrianism flavored by Egyptian superficialities. A lower form of Zoroastrianism devolved into the much more widely adopted Mithraism, characterized by the warring of good and evil. This is sort of the professional wrestling of religious belief, both in style and substance, and continues today to be the root of `fundamentalism.' So in a very real way, Satan was invented in northern Iran, and any student of religion will end up `digging' around there.How sad and strange that this film seems to have bolstered the Catholic church.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Event Movie (Marketing Over Content)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Purists may enthuse about the lack of modern day special effects but what they fail to mention is that without these, The Exorcist captures all the excitement of an insurance seminar without an interlude. To dispute with the purists, not all supernatural movies are spoilt with the dabbling of special effects. With a premise not entirely different from The Exorcist, Poltergeist succeeded in enthralling an audience with the discerning use of "garish" effects and yet still managed to work up searing tension in the quieter moments.Not that any amount of editing would have brought this decaying carcass to life but the movie would have been better served missing the entire prologue, where we were treated to Max Von Sydow ambling along dusty passageways whilst looking horrified at finding some cheap bauble from a Christmas cracker.Without doubt, this so called masterpiece has surpassed all others in exploiting the "event movie". It seems that by succeeding in getting a film withdrawn on it's initial release, in time it can become regarded as a classic - however underwhelming it may be. Simply by throwing in a few blasphemous expletives by a minor, this movie has been hailed as an icon of the horror genre. Classic status should only be awarded to pictures which have stood the test of time. Judging by the laughter from the audience at my screening, The Exorcist has not been able to sustain any fear factor 25 years later - if it ever did at all! For those salivating over their first screening of this horror behemoth, prepare yourself for the fact that it plays about as frightening as an episode of Scooby Doo. In the case of The Exorcist (re-issue), the event is undoubtedly bigger than the movie.Please don't consider these views solely a ranting from an upstart of the MTV generation. There are many horror movies made in the pre-Wes Craven era which have maintained classic status through the test of time and are still capable of terrifying today's audience - not just those who saw it way-back-then and still harbour fond memories. With that in mind, special message to Gus van Sant: You didn't need to waste your talents on a shot-for-shot remake of Psycho. If you really wanted to challenge yourself, you could have concentrated on creating something resembling an effective chiller from this overhyped pap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Shocking After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few movies shocked people like this one when it came out. Almost 35 years later, it will still shock you if you've never seen it. It's definitely recommended, but beware of some very gross scenes, brutal language and a sordid and genuinely frightening story. The special effects still hold up. They don't look dated and they are just as creepy. The story starts a bit slowly, but once in kicks in, it's tough to put this DVD on pause. This is still an intense, repulsive and scary movie filled with memorable scenes as a demon takes control over a young girl's body.Two things bothered me in the film that probably don't upset most people: way too much usage of the Lord's name in vain - almost all by the girl's mother, played by Ellen Burstyn. The second - and I am not Catholic - is the pitiful portrayal of yet-another Hollwood weak priest. This priest is smokes, drinks, swears, steals, etc.. etc, and is a pitiful excuse for a cleric: just the kind filmmakers love to portray. One priest - get this - says his idea of heaven is to be a nightclub performer for eternity and have everyone like him. Obviously, people who makes films have NO clue about "religion." Not a single clue. But, this was '70: the most irreverent film-making period in our history, so it's no surprise.However - to its credit - the film does an excellent job of convincing even the most ardent atheist that demons do exist, that there really is a devil, and that he is not to be taken lightly. It's no joke, and the shock value of this film might have gotten some people to start thinking there is something to all this "spiritual stuff."Whatever your theology, or lack of it, this movie is one you will never forget. It is beyond anything seen before it or since. I recommend the DVD that advertises this as "The Exorist: The version you've never seen." That's the best and most complete version of this terrifying film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's remarkable about The Exorcist, especially when you compare it to other horror films, is its patience. It takes the time to calmly develop the ordinary home life of a modern postnuclear family, letting you get comfortable in the setting, and then things slowly get stranger and stranger, until eventually everything you knew has been upset or overturned.There's a fear of the future here, of a new deviancy that the older generation can neither understand or control, which very much positions The Exorcist in the social battles of its age, possibly even as a backlash against the youth revolt of the 1960s. But there's also a more universal fear here -- the fears of parenthood, and the unshakable notion that your child might turn out to be a monster and you would be responsible.More than this social commentary, what stands out is the excellence of execution -- the note-perfect direction, pacing, cinematography, and acting. None of this is very flashy, but it all has a kind of technical skill that makes The Exorcist a terrific movie, and one of those rare gems that can be admired for both ideas and craftsmanship. It's considered a classic for a reason, and should absolutely be included in the canons of not only the horror genre but the New Hollywood era of major studio art films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You're telling me I should take my daughter to a witch doctor, is that it?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I reflect back on the movies of the 1970's, I'm struck by how many of them helped reinvigorate their respective genres. There was "Star Wars" for fantasy, "Alien" for sci-fi, and "Jaws" for the shark crowd, though I don't think that's really a genre. For horror fans, "The Exorcist" was the one that had everyone talking in 1973, and not only talking, but lining up around the block to get a chance to see it. In fact, the first time I tried, the person directly in front of me in line was the last one allowed in for that showing.When I finally did get to see it, the experience left a marked impression. It was fascinating, horrific, sensational and scary all at the same time. Having read the book, I wondered how much liberty would be taken with the story, but it was pretty much all there. At the time, hands down, it was the most frightening film I'd ever seen.The movie played last night as part of AMC's Halloween Fest, and though largely sanitized for TV, the impact of the film is still alive and well. It's a movie that plants a nagging seed of doubt in one's mind - what would happen if Satan himself could take over the body and soul of an innocent young girl? The gradual unfolding of the parallel stories in "The Exorcist" are built on credible real life situations, so that by the time Linda Blair's demon face appears on screen, you're ready to grab the holy water and say a prayer.Now if you're a younger viewer born of a more recent era, I'll grant that the film might not have the same effect. Though Blair's possession makeup was visually stunning at the time, special effects since then have far surpassed that effort. But it had to start somewhere, and as a precursor to virtually everything that followed, this was the one to top. And when Regan's head spins, yikes!, but I thought mine would too. For 1973, that was an incredible piece of work, with visuals that stay with you long after the film is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unconvincing Demon Possession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the intentionally disturbing nature of this film, I find this story about a "possessed" girl to be somewhat confused and half-baked. Well, what could I expect? The makers of The Exorcist certainly weren't aiming for plausibility here. No. Their goal was to gross the audience out like it had never been grossed out before and make a huge pile of money doing it. I'm sure we'd all agree that they succeeded very well on both counts.As far as Reagan's "possession" goes, I think it was a really screwy one and kinda wimpy, too.To begin with, since she seemed to be fortified with an incredible amount of physical power, this left me wondering why the hell she would allow herself to be confined, like a prisoner, to her own bedroom. I would think that whatever it was that was possessing her would be itching to go out on the town and, you know, turn a few heads around on Main Street, or something wickedly-fun like that. But none of this kinda thing happened. There were no aborted escape attempts, either.All-in-all, it was a kind of stupid "demon". Boring and unadventurous, if you ask me. But apparently Reagan did get out once (or did she?) to desecrate the virgin Mary icon in the church. And her desecration was so artistically done, too. It was an amazing piece of art work for a mere 12 year old whose previous examples of clay figures were lumpy turtles and the likes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Exorcist" (1973 - Hell yeah, it's that good, scary!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Friedkin has a reputation in Hollywood as one of its great directors of fast-paced "chase movies." "The French Connection" (1971), the controversial "Cruising" (1980), and "To Live and Die in L.A." (1985) come to mind. "The Exorcist," his 1973 masterpiece of horror, is a chase movie in that regard, albeit a rather "contained" one, in that the "chases" all occur in one place, and don't involve cars, guns, or explosions."The Exorcist" has a reputation as the scariest movie of all time. I'm inclined to agree. I've never seen such horrific imagery from a movie in my life. Much of the ghastly imagery and scenery in "The Exorcist" still remains fresh in my mind. On top of that, I've never been so thoroughly unsettled by a horror film before. Before watching this movie, I knew (knew is italicized) that "The Exorcist" was the scariest movie of all time; I just needed to confirm it with my own eyes, and ears.The chase elements in this movie come into play in its second half, when Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) and Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) work together to save Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) from possession by the Devil, and to "chase" it back to Hell. Regan is the daughter of actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), who at first thinks her daughter is suffering from some sort of strange mental disorder, but is forced to face the horror herself in that fact that her daughter is possessed by unholy forces intent on dragging her kicking &amp; screaming into the darkest depths of the demonic underworld.Based on the controversial novel of the same name by William Peter Blatty (who also wrote the screenplay), "The Exorcist" is THE horror film, and essential viewing for any true fan of the genre. Some will agree, some will disagree, but I don't think that lessens the film's impact. I've never been so thoroughly shocked by a motion picture before; all the warnings I've received beforehand proved out to be true. The film relies on realistic performances, Friedkin's precision direction, innovative and ground-breaking special effects, mood, horrific imagery, and disturbing bits &amp; pieces of dialogue for its effects on the viewer (basically anything uttered by then-14-year-old Linda Blair while under the effects of demonic possession).I don't expect many of today's younger viewers to probably understand the significance of this picture, and its lasting effect on horror movie-making. They're too accustomed to gore and special effects. I should know, I'm one of them; I'm only 24, but I know powerful film-making when I see it. "The Exorcist" is the scariest horror movie I've ever seen. Don't believe me? Just watch it for yourself.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was influenced into watching this film after maybe the 100th listen to Mike Oldfield's masterpiece "Tubular Bells" (the full, 48-minute album, not the 4-minute edit!), which was used in this movie's soundtrack. I wasn't exactly frightened or scared by the movie. I was expecting something gory and gruesome in this movie, but oh, was I wrong. And that's good, because I don't like movies that are gratuitously gory and gruesome. This movie is anything but gratuitous. I wasn't scared, but I was amazed and fascinated by the atmosphere, intelligent story and masterful filmmaking. It feels really genuine, and there are maybe 2 or 3 movies I have seen that felt genuine. It's a beautiful story about faith, and deals with the "good vs. evil" scheme in an unusual way. There are so many layers to the story, it's difficult to discuss them all in one or two paragraphs. Suffice to say, all of those different elements come together seamlessly. The story is beautiful. The build up of tension is truly gripping. It is not scary, it's disturbing. Those looking for gory scarefests should look somewhere else. I was truly intrigued by the movie, and the glorious resolution was both shocking and uplifting. Did good defeat evil, after all? That's up for the viewers to decide.A haunting movie, this is - especially for Mr. Oldfield, whose "Tubular Bells" would haunt him for 30 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read the novel, but this is the first time i've seen The Directors Cut, (the movie) which contains extra materials, such as removed scenes and so on. Due to i read the novel, i have never cared to see the movie, for the reason that the movie use to be not that good as the novel.Over all, this movie wasn't scary at all. I cannot prevent myself from making parallels to the move REC, where everyone also freaked out and kinda overreacted. Does people know what a horror movie is? Or have they just forgot how a real horror movie shall be?Anyway, if we looking at this particular move, The Exorcist, we still have too keep in mind that this movie was made of it's time "best" special effects. So it got its own charm. At 1970 the computer wasn't Rock And Roll in every scary movies, that they are these days. However; the story is perfect for a horror movie. A demon taking over a little girls body and turn her into some kind of a monster. The problem starts when you're suppose to visualization the plot into a movie. Stephen King's movies, to take one example. His stories only works on book, but not on the screen. Same thing here. Folks saying; "This is the scariest movie of all time". Well, maybe a bit too much saying? A girl who runs on her back downwards a stair, and rotating her head around and masturbate with a crucifix. Those was the three climax scenes during the whole movie; and the Head-Spinning thing just left the biggest hole in the plot ever; sure, it may work on paper, but, honestly, that girl would be so dead afterward. It isn't a sci-fi movie after all. The thing that scared me most in this movie was the short scene cuts where they show the devil, or his face. Except that, this movie was a regular horror film, where people overreacting (like for REC), but it think it has to do with that this movie theme considering the Religion in some way.I give The Exorcist a rate of 5, because i like the story, and the acting where also good. In overall it is a 5, but the scary score will sink to just 2/10. The Novel however; is like ten times better than the movie tho!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the scariest movies of all time. The first time I watched it, I was 12 years old and I was with some friends and with my brother. We all were pretty scared with this story of possession and horror of the poor girl named Regan Teresa MacNeil,specially because all the time they were showing the connections with demon's statues, figures and faces. Reading the trivia section, I can see that many things were quite spooky and hard even for the actors and actresses, like when they say that the '' Director William Friedkin went to some extraordinary lengths to abuse the cast. He fired off guns behind the actors to get the required startled effect. He was said to have slapped one actor across the face before rolling the camera. He even went as far as to put Linda Blair and Ellen Burstyn in harnesses and have crew members yank them violently.''But Linda Blair, even know until today for her role as Regan and almost with her career ended, was an amazing actress who was spectacular in the role of a possessed girl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decades Later, The Exorcist Still Scares the Devil Out of You!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Georgetown, The Exorcist narrates the tale of a glamorous household in the neighborhood, where the 12 year old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) of a popular actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) begins to exhibit bizarre behavior and suddenly grows sullen and incredibly foul-mouthed, leading to her transformation into a deformed and dangerous imitation of herself - a scar-faced, burning- eyed, profanity-spewing monster. After numerous medical examinations come up with no explanation for her condition, Chris in desperation turns to exorcism and a Jesuit priest Damien Karras (Jason Miller) who is going through a crisis of faith, must determine if the child is in fact possessed and requires an exorcism. After learning about the case from Chris and avuncular police detective Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) and after seeing Regan's head-whirling, crucifix- abusing, green vomit routines, he is convinced that inhabiting poor Regan's body is none other than the devil himself and calls in an elderly, experienced exorcist, Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). The core of the movie is Regan's subsequent exorcism, so cold that plumes of frost expel with every breath and so rancid with terror that audiences even today tremble at the sight.This jolting tale of a 12-year-old girl possessed by the devil might sound like your run-of-the-mill horror movie, but The Exorcist, with its hypnotic narrative grip, deepens the emotional pool. Based upon the acclaimed 'true life' novel by William Peter Blatty, who in turn adapted it into a screenplay; it was brought to life with uncompromising force by director William Friedkin, going all out in this portrayal of purity possessed by demonic forces. Here, Friedkin does not rush the proceedings, but rather he takes his time establishing mood, character, and heart thumping suspense which leads to some truly terrifying and effective scares - a bloody medical procedure, the sight of putrefying flesh, a blasphemous child stabbing her crotch with a crucifix; the subsequent 180 degree swiveling of her head; and a spider walk down a staircase which concludes with a blood curling scream. Today, it's not only a pop-culture conversation piece but a bona- fide classic, a finely crafted thriller that benefits immensely from its controlled direction, a thematically fruitful script, startling makeup designs, amazing special effects, an eerie score and an incredible cast that registers uniformly bravura performances. Its philosophical slant drives a deep wedge between it and other films of its ilk, which do not have the intelligence or substance to tackle such themes, as this movie so cleverly does. For this reason, The Exorcist not only tops the horror genre but transcends it, resulting in a profound experience. Decades later, it continues to exert its demonic spell!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dangerous mix of religion, superstition and movie monsters. If you're just in for a good scare this movie is perfect. But all I'm saying is don't take this movie to serious. I admit I'm not a religious guy, I don't mind religions, but this one brings it out in a very confusing way. For the first Exorcism is of course only superstition and movie fantasy, but the religious tie-ins in this movie may confuse you. Also you may have heard from people that this is based on a true story, now of course that is just to scare you a little extra. This movie is nothing but a pure horror movie which uses religious symbols and special effects to scare you. So take my advice when I tell you, don't take this to serious.Now as a horror film, this is brilliant. I'm pretty used to horror movies, and when it surrounds the supernatural it normally don't freak me out. This one did. If you're not used to horror films, don't watch this, you'll not be able to sleep for days. If you already is a fan of horror, I highly recommend it. Don't forget, it was this movie which for the first time presented the monster as a child. It was as creepy then as it is today, and it has became a horror phenomenon.The special effects in this movie is damned good for it's time. Honestly there are sequences I don't think we could have done better today.So if your squeamish stay away from this. But if you like horror, you've missed out if you haven't seen this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Influential Now as It was Then</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still consider The Exorcist the most influential movie I have ever seen as it had me question, as those involved intended, what it is that I believe. I grew up in a mixed home in that my mom was a devout Christian and my father was a devout atheist, and I dated a Jewish girl through most of my high school days. I never knew what to believe. My parents always wanted me to make up my own mind, but both attempted to influence me with their individual beliefs. I viewed The Exorcist on its re-release in 1975 (or so) when I was around 12 or 13. It scared, forgive the pun, the hell out of me, but more importantly, it made me THINK! I began to both read The Bible and books on the occult. In addition, I bought many scientific books as well to see what they had to say on certain religious themes. I am thankful for such an influential film as The Exorcist which began a five year journey for me to discover what I believe in. There are very few films that make one think about such heavy issues as life and death, heaven and hell, science and God, and so forth. Some films have a way of staying influential inspite of time and some go way beyond what their genre typically entails. While this is a movie, it much more than "just a movie". In addition, this film is definitely NOT just another horror story. The Exorcist belongs right up there with other influential classics such as To Kill a Mockingbird, Natural Born Killers, Roots, The Killing Fields, and Platoon, and other such thought-provoking films that either make a statement or ask us to make one. The very fact that after 30 years this film still has the power to move us speaks volumes to its importance and influence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Version You Didn't Need To See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist ? The Version You've Never Seen is also the version you probably shouldn't have, adding almost nothing to a fine original but running time, some clumsy additional 'subliminal' images digitally grafted on with all the subtlety of a 1980s New Romantic music video and a poor new sound mix that adds music cues and sound effects far less effective than the original mix. Most of the restored footage is taken up by an extended additional medical tests sequence that feels a little out of place since Regan hasn't been acting particularly oddly at that point in the film, as well as the odd bit of padding in the run-up to the exorcism and a redundant scene of Karras listening to a tape recording of a pre-possession Regan. Worst of the new additions by far is the infamous spider walk, a scene abandoned during shooting and here accounting for two rather laughable shots that take the film too far too soon.Other additions are somewhat more esoteric ? a brief pretitle shot of the Georgetown house and street, Father Dyer keeping the St Christopher at the end after Chris hands it back and the disastrous addition of a screeching airplane sound effect in the segue from Iraq to Georgetown that makes you think Pazuzu must have travelled to Washington by Pan-Am (although this does echo Lalo Schifrin's far more effective rejected scoring for the sequence). What's most curious is what's still missing: despite including the weak Hollywood ending with Kinderman and Father Dyer, the exchange with Chris over whether she still doesn't believe in God is gone. The big bone of contention between Blatty and Friedkin, the idea that if you believe in the Devil because of all the terrible things that happen, you must also believe in a God even if he, unlike the horned one, doesn't advertise, seems the only justification for extending the section at all, but as if to spite the writer it's still pointedly removed. Only the brief discussion about the Devil's motives for possessing Regan in a break in the exorcism feels like it adds any substance to the proceedings (although it could be said the possession is more disturbingly arbitrary if left unexplained), the rest being motivated purely by the need for a marketing hook to secure a US reissue.The end result is a film that feels much longer and slower but still eventually grips. Aside from the overlength, the strengths and weaknesses are much the same: the at times almost documentary style of film-making grounds the events in a recognisable real world, the shock effects are fairly sparingly used and only after a long build-up, the characters well-drawn and their despair convincing: the real horror in the film doesn't reside in its special effects or horrific set pieces, but in a mother's anguish over being powerless to help her child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist (1973)*** (out of 4) William Friedkin's classic about a concerned mother (Ellen Burstyn) who goes to a young priest (Jason Miller) after fearing her daughter (Linda Blair) has become possessed by a demon. There's no question about it but THE EXORCIST is certainly one of the most loved horror films ever made. To me, technically, it's one of the most flawless dramas from this era and I think this is where it's strongest material comes from. The film perfectly captures a mother's horror of witnessing something attacking her daughter and at first no one really knows what it is but her fears keep getting worse and worse with each new attack. I think this is a perfect set-up for some real-life drama and director Friedkin does a tremendous job here. Of course, when the demonic stuff begins to happen is when most viewers will turn away from being so frightened or perhaps they won't even bother watching because it scares them so badly. For me, the film has never scared me. I'm not sure what it is but perhaps it's due to my belief that good defeats evil. I'm not sure but it's always amazing to me that I can enjoy something so much yet it's main "thing" is something that doesn't work on me. In some ways I see the demonic stuff as somewhat more exploitation than anything else. I mean, the profanity, the self harming and other vile things that happen were obviously going to shock a mainstream crowd in 1973. These things just really don't effect me and I honestly think they're the weakest stuff in the film. Even during the exorcism some of the most striking moments aren't exactly what we're seeing happen but instead the more psychological stuff that the demons words are having on the priest. With that said, there's no question that the film contains some of the greatest performances you're going to see from a film like this. Burstyn is remarkably strong in the role of the mother and Miller is also terrific as the troubled priest. Blair perfectly fits the part of the loving child but the real key to her is once she starts to become possessed. Max von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb are such strong, fierce character actors that seeing them in a film like this just gives the movie more strength.I will say that the "Director's Cut," as it's now called, is a lot weaker than the original version people saw in 1973. The infamous spider walk might have been a good idea on paper but seeing it here just makes me certain it should have remained on the editing room floor. The various Satanic images that pop up throughout the movie are more distracting than anything else. I also didn't care for the added ending or the extra scenes involving Regan's doctors. In reality, I'd say nothing added to the picture helped it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this brief - most every horror fan has seen The Exorcist and all of them have an opinion of it. While many people would most certainly list The Exorcist as THE scariest movie ever made, there seems to be a growing number of fans who find humor where it was not intended. I don't get it. Maybe it's a generational thing, but The Exorcist remains as effective today as it was in 1973. If the story of a young, helpless girl being turned into a snarling creature isn't horror enough, add to that the desecration of sacred religious symbols and you've got something quite shocking. Beyond the story, the strong performances by a good cast really help put The Exorcist over the top. Max von Sydow was never better. And the performance of an incredibly young and inexperienced Linda Blair is nothing short of remarkable. Add to that the excellent lighting, sound, cinematography, and special effects, and you've got not just a scary movie, but a very well made movie as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not too many movies which have the power to achieve the unique status of Classic after it's initial showing in theaters. This is one of them. This film, " The Exorcist " written by Peter Blatty, enter the hearts, minds and souls in 1973 with so many opinions, reviews and predictions that nearly every media outlet was flooded with them. Upon entering the modern theater in that time and place, gave everyone a unexplained sense of foreboding. Potential audiences were warned not to see the film alone. The story is based on the mounting and unexplained hysteria of the time called manifested phenomenon. In simpler terms it was called 'possession.' The idea that a beast, demon or satanic monster could posses the body of an innocent victim sent shivers through the spines of believers. In this story we have the Vatican calling on an expert in demonology, one, Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). He is assisted by local priest, Father Karras (Jason Miller) who originally investigates the strange happenings. The investigation attracts the eye of the local police who send Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) to acquire more details. But it is the young actress Linda Blair playing Regan who brings such bestial reality to her character, that in one scene I was terrified at what she could do with her head. I was forever affected and believed. The film garners many accolades and praises that it is unlikely that the film is anything but a true demonic classic. *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success of The French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to make The Exorcist as his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from his controversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is racked by satanic dis figuration. One of the most frightening films ever made with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curl your blood, The Exorcist was mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers.

		<shortDescription>Classic horror tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the all time great horror movies. Time may have rendered some of the scenes unintentionally funny, but it still provides a terrific template in how to construct an adult horror movie.There are a few different versions of this movie around-three, I think. The last time I saw this movie (some years ago) might have been with the anniversary edition. You'd do well to avoid the version with the silly subliminal flashes (that might be the extended version of the movie).Anyway, the movie is about a single parent family...a mum and her young teen daughter (the daughter is played by Linda Blair). The daughter slowly starts acting more and more alarmingly. What is so terrific about the movie is how the mum acts rationally to help her daughter...taking her to doctors in a desperate bid to cure her daughter.Eventually, the daughter's behaviour becomes so disturbing that she eventually consults a priest in a last desperate attempt to cure her daughter.The movie contains a lot of graphic language and has some disturbing sexual imagery, so it isn't really suitable for young teens. Also, if you are a Christian, you may find this movie disturbing too.Like I've said, the movie may have lost some of its power in this secular day and age, and some of the horror that was so shocking for the 1970s seems a tad ludicrous now, but the extremely intelligent way that this movie is constructed is a master-class for modern day horror makers who think that jumping straight into a gore-fest is some how scary or satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 30th Anniversary of one of the all-time greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More so than Alfred Hitchock's "Psycho",more so than Roman Polanski's "Rosemary's Baby",William Friedkin's "The Exorcist" expanded the limits of what was acceptable terrain for a commercial horror film. This classic shocker of the supernatural,and one of the scariest films of all time,which notoriously contains a sense of a demonically possessed 12 year-old girl masturbating with a crucfix,shocked critics and even frightened its audiences when it was released more than thirty years ago. When it was released in 1973,there were reports of people fainting or succumbing to hysterics. Movie theater operators confided that they were standing by with paper bags and kitty litter for the piles of vomit in the aisles. Also,some even ran for their very lives out of the theatre and movie operators had to even call in the local law enforcement to calm down individuals who were out of control. It's ver hard to see or even imagine today's audiences having such visceral reactions to a current films such as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre","Jaws", "Halloween","Friday The 13th,"Alien","A Nightmare on Elm Street",and "The Omen",to name a few. As extreme as the reactions were,audiences couldn't get enough of it making it one of the top ten films of 1973 and one of the highest grossing picture of its day beside boxoffice contenders of that year were "The Sting","Enter The Dragon","American Graffiti","Serpico",and "The Way We Were" all were released in 1973.It also beat out its competition for the highest grossing film as well,dethroning Francis Ford Coppula's 1972 crime epic "The Godfather",and Irwin Allen's 1972 disaster epic "The Poseidon Adventure" to reign supreme as one of the highest grossing horror films of all time,until 1975's "Jaws",dethroned "The Exorcist" off the top spot. But in this case,the outrage that cause a political and social debate over this picture mabye seems quaint today,but in the 30 years since William Friedkin's "The Exorcist" scared the bejesus out of everyone,we've inmbibed so many violent movies that it is very hard to be shocked since advance technological achievements in filmmaking his come along. While moralists and psychologists may debate the effects of this progressive desensitization,the passage of time does have one benefit,it is easier to evaluate "The Exorcist" on other terms rather than its shock value. Even after all those years,Linda Blair's character of Reagan will give some individuals nightmares that will haunt them for the rest of their natural lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was much too young to read this William Blatty novel. At the ripe old age of nine, I found it lying around and read it. I had to hide it. I instinctively knew that if my mom had found me with it, she would have been quite disturbed. But I had read more advanced works already, and understood most of what I read. What I did not understand, the dictionary was readily available to assist me in my quest.I didn't sleep for about ten days. I would go to sleep, but I would not stay there long. I finally had to confess my trespass to my mother, who countered the book's nightmare-like qualities with a "good, healthy dose of Disney." I honestly understood Joel, Wednesday, and Pugsly's horror in "Addams Family Values" at receiving the same treatment. Somehow, my dreams went from Exorcist-like nightmares, to beloved Disney characters doing horrible, unthinkable things to me, and one another.But I digress.This is still one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I recently purchased the Director's Cut on DVD and THIS is the movie I remember from the book...if that makes sense. The movie, until they re-added the lost footage, was NOT as scary as the book. This version very much IS.This movie also shows you where Dee Snyder got the idea for the name of his character in his movie "Strangeland," another very disturbing, if not scary, movie. Captain Howdy is the name of the entity with which Reagan speaks through the Ouija board. The Ouija board is the device which opened her to the possession in the first place, by the way.Very good movie; strong, solid performances by professional actors; excellent effects; and a story line which is unsurpassed in the genre of horror.Excellent work.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of The Exorcist Compels You To Watch it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost 40 years has passed since "The Exorcist" was released and it still is a haunting, exciting, thrilling and frightening horror movie. Lists after lists are made to elect the best horror movie of all time and this film always manage to get to the Top of almost every single list. Not only that: it's also an very complex dramatic film with a compelling story. A story of a devoted mother to save her teen daughter of a strange possession.After finishing the filming of a movie the actress Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) finds herself with an awkward situation after her adorable daughter Regan (Linda Blair) starts to behave differently. She is taken to all the best doctors but nothing is found and doctors suspicion is that the kid may have a brain tumor. But after all the medical treatment fails and when Regan's starts to move frantically Chris is told to get a bigger help: a priest to exorcise what possessed her daughter. Father Karras (Jason Miller, incredible acting in his film debut) is called, but he himself is a tormented man, who has recently loss his elderly mother, almost faithless and with few skills to perform an exorcism. Even with all that he agrees to see the girl who has increasingly gone worst. She vomits, masturbates with a crucifix and says countless bad words and profanation. Karras's verdict: she's possessed by Pazuzu, a mysterious and powerful demon. But this demon has a weakness and this weakness is Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow in a very aged makeup), or better saying The Exorcist. Father Merrin knows everything about exorcisms and demons and he knows how to fight it. Even with all this knowledge (as it is showed in the beginning of the movie when he's in Iraq investigating an occurrence) you can feel that he has some fears, (his hands shaking) but he'll do everything to kill the demon and save the poor girl. The last 40 minutes with Karras and Merrin together performing the exorcism in that freezing and haunting bedroom is priceless, scary and the best horror moment of the 1970's. I must salute director William Friedkin for his efforts on present us a movie greater in its genre different of everything seen before. He was mean with actors to create realism but he get what he wanted and the audience was terrified by those images (Ellen Burstyn's face when she was thrown to the floor; Jason Miller's face after the vomit comes right into his face which wasn't supposed to happen). On the technical side of "The Exorcist" an interesting thing must be noticed: all the horror moments are shown without music. This works really great, it's not a manipulated movie where a soundtrack must be added to create tension. And without the music it was much more scarier and fun to watch, listening to all the strange sounds created by the sound group (Won Oscar). Makeup effects and visual effects are stunning and many of it it's not dated or old-fashioned. Impressive! About the screenplay: William Peter Blatty writer of the original book and the film's writer created a whole new thing here. The drama, the horror and even some humor are perfect. Although I think that some scenes, characters and clues aren't well explained, there's too much mystery. For example, we heard that the film director (Jack McGowran) died on the long stairs. This scene isn't showed and if it was it would be too frightening and unforgettable. After that the movie lover detective Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb, very good and funny) starts a investigation about the event. Then he gets some clues about many things he didn't even saw. The public may wonder how did he get to that evidence or clue. Two moments I would like to see or questions to be answered: Who puts the crucifix under Regan's bed? And what happened to Father Merrin in that bedroom after he leaves Karras and exorcise the girl alone? Not only the technical team worked well. All the actors have fantastic performances: Burstyn, Cobb, Miller, Sydow, Blair, even not professional actor the Reverend William O'Malley has a great performance here, and at last Mercedes McCambridge who plays the devil's voice (one thing I hated in the Portuguese dubbing version is that her voice was made by a man). Even being the biggest blockbuster of 1973 it only won 2 Academy Awards (Adapted Screenplay and Sound), and it deserved the award of Best Picture cause it was greater than "The Sting". And it must get a higher rating on IMDb's Top 250 list. This movie is awesome, one of the very few horror movies to still shock me, to not be dated or cheesy. If you haven't watched yet or didn't find time to watch it run and buy it if you can. The power of this film compels you to watch it now and over again. Must see film for horror fans and for movie lovers just like Lt. Kinderman. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Food for thought for faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist remains one of my all time favorite films, along with "It's a Wonderful Life", "The Godfather", and "The Sound of Music". The Exorcist treats the whole idea of exorcism with respect, in my opinion. It does address the requirements of possession, according the to the rules of the Catholic church. I love the struggle of Father Karras, which is so common to so many people of faith; their logical mind, and what the eye can see, and the invisible world, which follows it's own rules. Karras is a scientist ( doctor ) and a very well-schooled one at that. I love how he thinks of himself as so lowly, so lacking in faith, when in fact he is shouldering such responsibility and the pain of others, and in the end of course, is completely redeemed, by giving his own life to save an innocent. However, it's hard for me to view the movie through the eyes of someone who has not read the book.The book is fantastic. You see what Father Merrin represents; complete spiritual superiority to so many of us. Yes he has his own little struggles, such as his huge intellect and therefore prejudice of small, trivial minds. And so, what does he do? Does he surround himself only with intellects, where he can freely share his knowledge in the rewarding game of idea exchange and professional validation? No, he puts himself among the most humble, poor and uneducated people he can find, in order to overcome a flaw which he acknowledges within himself. I'm talking about when he is working in Iraq. As Jesus taught, he gains spiritual growth through humility, not high positions and the material gain of this world. He is an awesome character. He beat the demon once before, and I love how he just wants to get to business, as soon as he arrives at Chris MacNeil's home. What time is there to waste? A little girl is dying. In the book, Chris finds safety and comfort, as she opens the door and sees his face, and I think the movie did a pretty good job of conveying that too.There is some essential dialog missing in the movie, which is in the book. It's during the brief break that the priests take from the exorcism, when Karras asks Merrin about the state of Regan's soul. "There is no sin" Merrin explains. He goes on to say that even though the demon has possessed Regan, and is a threat to her physical life, that the true victims are the ones watching this event, and the terror, anger, doubt and despair which the demon gives, is the demon's intent. The demon wants to hurt everybody, making them turn away from God, and of course Regan is simply his vessel. She, however is completely innocent. As a young Catholic, I was taught that baptism would prevent any demonic possession of that sort. I always felt very safe in that knowledge. ( "Honey, Regan was not baptized" ) However, now as an adult, I know that baptism does not prevent one from Willingly becoming a monster; simply look at the case of Himmler, Hitler's right hand man ( head of SS )to see that. That person was baptized, so that shoots that theory to heck and back.One thing that bothers me is when people say that the "devil" possessed Regan. No, it was a demon. Big difference. Any Catholic can tell you that there is a hierarchy here, with little demons working for their big guy ( Satan ) and Satan pretty much holding the same position in hell, as Archangel Michael holds in heaven. Keeper of the door, if you will. Satan is a fallen angel, made by God, not the "opposite" of God. If Satan has an opposite, it would be Michael. So it's not "God versus the devil". Just a little peeve of mine. Also, it's interesting how ( in the book ) Chris is still somewhat a committed atheist, in the end. She allows for evil spirits, and forces, being real. However, she still cannot acknowledge the existence of God, and the power of Christ. I always thought that was very interesting. If ANYONE would be converted, you would think it would have been her. And, in that way the story is so cool, because it just showcases the existence of religion and faith, and the enduring wisdom contained within, while the rest of the world goes on faithless, scientific, skeptical, and lost. Way to go, Exorcist!! Great movie, great score, cool message. two crosses up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Movie? No Way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason why I wanted to watch 'The Exorcist' was because I heard so much about it. For me this film is slightly over-hyped. It's painfully slow and at times very boring. It may have been great for its time when films of this genre were quite limited. Personally, I didn't find it scary at all but I don't hold that against the film. There have been numerous 'horror' films that haven't scared me but which I still like because of how the concept was presented, the ideas it raised, technical aspects etc. 'The Exorcist' is not an all bad film. The characters (except that of the devil) are very well written and the acting is very good, especially that of Jason Miller, Ellen Burstyn and Max Von Sydow. The story is not bad either. On the technical side, cinematography and background score are superb. I also liked the use of lighting, darkness that create the gloomy setup. The visuals and imagery are also impressive and the special effects do not look out of date. The scenes I liked more were those between Karras and MacNeil, especially the one where they meet for the first time. The 'horror' scenes did not do much for me (although they were well shot). To sum it up, while liking so many things about it, the pacing is lethargic and I was almost dozing off at some point. Perhaps it was the time of the day and if the plot was a little tighter I may have enjoyed it more. However, all things considered, for me 'The Exorcist' is a decent flick at best. I wouldn't put it among the best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert! I just recently saw this movie and heard it was the scariest movie of all time. Honestly for the time it was the scariest movie but now in time, it really isn't all that scary. The reason I say that is because here some of the effects looked ridiculous. When compared to movies like Shutter I think that is a truly scarier film then this because that had more scarier moments. Here though the only thing really going for it was the whole 2nd half of the movie. Truthfully, I thought it was kind of boring halfway through mainly because I had no idea what was happening. I'm still shocked that people would call this the most terrifying horror movie of all time I mean the only thing that really sticks out is some of the not so great looking effects. Overall I didn't really care for it but decided to give it a 6 out of 10 because I know if I didn't give it higher than a 7 people wouldn't even bother to read this. Seriously though if you are looking for something even scarier than this watch the Thailand movie Shutter, trust me you will at least jump once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing horror film that easily stands up today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an exceptionally made movie. I got to see it theaters too, which only made it better. The film might be a tad slow in the beginning, but it picks up quickly once Reagan gets possessed and starts doing weird things. During the scenes where Reagan is flipping out, the special effects are incredible, especially for the time. They'll have things flying across the room, the entire bed shaking furiously, and of course, the projectile vomit. All of those look extremely realistic and they add to the super creepy atmosphere this film has. The voice they gave the possessed Reagan is perfect. If I had to choose a voice for the devil, it would have been that one. It really gets to you and makes every scene that has it way more frightening. The movie does have issues though. In the very beginning, they have this backstory about this little sculpture of the devil being found and I found it to be both unnecessary and kind of confusing. It isn't really clear if the devil got released because of that statue or what. I couldn't find a correlation between that statue and Regan either. Only other problem I have is the devil being very picky about how he uses his power. I don't understand why he just didn't break the straps and leave. I know they tried to explain it, but it doesn't really make any sense. Damien Karrass asked him that and he responded with "that would be a display of too much power" or something like that. He says that, yet he'll throw stuff all over the place and throw up on people, and even kill people. How is breaking some straps too much power? I call bs on that explanation. Other than those 2 problems, fantastic horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Good Truly Triumphed Over Evil?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "The Exorcist" was released, it was a phenomenon. It did what all great movies do: Spurn discussion. Some Christian condemn it, others supported it for making the devil real to a new generation. Even the critics were divided, some considering the film vulgar trash driven by shock value. Forty years later, "The Exorcist's" status as one of the greatest horror films ever made, if not the greatest, is well established. Few challenge this opinion. It's hard for me to declare any film the greatest anything but "The Exorcist" is clearly an incredible film.The story behind "The Exorcist" is well known. William Peter Blattey, a screenwriter best known for comedy, was inspired by the supposedly true story of a young boy possessed in 1950s Baltimore. Using this as a basis, he wrote the novel "The Exorcist," which became a great success. Hollywood came calling not long afterwards, as you'd expect. Blatty adapted his own book. Accordingly, "The Exorcist" is an extremely close adaptation, following the book on a nearly scene-by-scene basis.William Friedkin, who just won an Academy Award for "The French Connection," did not approach "The Exorcist" as a typical horror film. Friedkin shoots the movie with a docu-drama intensity. Though the film is famous for its chilling use of Mike Oldfield's "Tubular Bells," there's very little music in the movie. As we watch the McNeil household go about their days, and Karras' isolated existence, this creates an acute sense of reality. One the film slowly subverts. A sense of chilly unease is created in a simple scene of Chris walking down the street or Karras serving communion. This is best illustrated during Karras' nightmare, which is not outwardly disturbing but still unnerves the viewer. Or the long sequences of Regan in the hospital, focusing on her discomfort during the procedures. No matter how normal things appear at first, its apparent things are going to go very, very wrong.The creeping feeling of discomfort and established realism leaves the audience for the film's stabbing sequences of shocking behavior. The moments are well known now, widely parodied and referenced. Regan bloodily masturbates with a crucifix, pushes her mother's face into her bloody crotch, screams profanity, spews a torrent of green vomit, and cranks her head around in a circle. Even lesser moments like Regan speaking with the murdered director's voice are well known. Yet Friedkin's rooted-in-reality approach makes these moments creditable. Chris being attacked by her own daughter is shot in an intimate style, placing the audience in the character's shoes. What makes these moments horrifying is not that they're happening. Far more explicit scenes existed before and after. What makes them effective is that they are happening to this girl, in this house, in this way.The film builds towards the final act, when the titular exorcism takes place. Father Merrin's arrival brings a graveness to the already intense situation. The camera remains focused on the priests as they do their work. The girl blares profanity, moans blasphemy, and floats above the bed. The room shakes, the actors' breaths visible before them. These are special effects but the movie's total commitment to verisimilitude makes them seem plausible. The last third of the movie is still shockingly directed and completely effective. Every time it gives me chills.It's notable that "The Exorcist's" conclusion still triggers debate. Father Merrin dies, succumbing to his poor health. Karras convinces the demon to leave the girl's body and enters his. With his last ounce of free will, he flings himself from the window, dying. Has good truly triumphed over evil? Has Karras' crisis of faith been resolved in his act of self-sacrifice? If demons exist, God must exist, right? "The Exorcist" doesn't provide easy answers. What catharsis the ending creates is undermined by the scars still visible on Regan's face, the lines of aging on Chris'. These events will haunt them forever. Moreover, the eerie opening has Merrin, in Iraq, starring strangely at a Sumerian statue. The demon recognizes him upon his entry to the house. This is but one battle in a long, on-going war between demonic forces and those of human faith. Is it a battle we can ever truly win? Whether "The Exorcist" is faith-affirming or existentially unnerving is a matter of personal interpretation.Finally, "The Exorcist" is bolstered by a fantastic cast. Ellen Burstyn at first appears likable. As the events go on, her thread-bare emotions are bravely acted out, showing no sign for movie star vanity. Jason Miller's Karras is darker, more uncertain and troubled then the character in the book. He does a great deal of acting with his face. Max von Sydow's booming voice makes Merrin a figure of immediate respect. Despite only being 44 at the time, he appears much older and carries a lifetime of knowledge and regrets on his shoulders. How much credit Linda Blair can take for her performance is still debated. Blair is great as the cherub-faced Regan, a happy, mischievous child dealing with her parents' divorce. Once possessed, the voice of Mercedes McCambridge and Dick Smith's legendary make-up takes over, creating a disturbing, incomparable portrayal of demonic arrogance and vicious sacrilege. The only performance I'm not too keen on is Lee J. Cobb as Lt. Kinderman, a subplot that didn't entirely work in the book and seems even more extraneous on-screen.The best horror films are not the ones that simply set out to scare an audience. "The Exorcist" does that. Boy, does it ever. But it also discomforts us, presents us with difficult questions and themes about complex, real life issues. About faith, guilt, the existence of evil and the question of good. The film is a triumph of direction, sound design, and tone but also of writing and creation. To say "The Exorcist" is the greatest horror film ever made is too presumptuous. It is, however, clearly one of the greats, in this genre and any genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good effects, mood, and general acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate horror films. I don't generally get scared that easily, and true enough I did not think The Exorcist was scary while watching it, but when you're alone at night in the dark trying to sleep, it's a whole different story. I had to sleep with a light on the first night after watching this, because all I think about when I try not to think about it is the film and the ugly demon's face and whatnot. Even now I'm dreading writing this review. But putting the horror aside, this film was very well made.The acting once I think about it, is actually really good. Ellen Burstyn as the mother has really great expressions and her reactions are on point. I'm not actually sure how Linda Blair as Regan acted as the demon, but if that was her then she did a really good job too. (I try not to stare at them ugly horror faces, but the expressions and actions did seem demonic) Karras was another main character in this and he played the part of a distraught son and priest really well, torn between his duty and the loss of someone he loved.The effects is also very good for its time. Made in the 70's, the shaking of the bed to the make-up and telekinesis of objects seemed pretty real. Except for the vomit which just looked like green goo from Nickelodeon.The mood of the whole film was also very well established with the beginning scene in Iraq/Israel? It laid the foundation for something ancient and kind of supernatural to come into the film. Also, Regan's room is constantly cold and getting colder, I read somewhere that there was actually a layer of frost in the room due to them filming in real conditions.And of course, let's talk about gender. The daughter has to be the one invaded because 'girls' are vulnerable and open to penetration, and to being invaded. The demon entering her body is, if you think about it, kind of like rape. And the mother is a single parent who can't do anything, and needs the help of men to save her daughter and her family.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Film Of All Time? In A Way, Yes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the sheer magnitude of unrelenting terror that The Exorcist unleashed on its unsuspecting audience during its theatrical run back in 1973, the tag of "the scariest film of all time" sits perfectly well on this horror masterpiece. After all, there has never been an example in motion picture history which has affected the viewers as strongly as this film did for many fainted, threw up or went hysteric in a manner unlike anything witnessed before or after it.Looking back now, countless imitations &amp; parodies over the years might have diminished its scare factor by a great deal but there's no denying that even today The Exorcist remains in a league of its own &amp; is yet to find an equal. Succeeding not just as a genre-defining tale of demonic possession but also as a remarkable piece of superb storytelling with great character build-up &amp; groundbreaking special effects, The Exorcist is very possibly the gold standard of horror filmmaking.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of The Exorcist takes place in the Georgetown area of Washington D.C. &amp; concerns the 12-year old daughter of a famous actress, who begins manifesting some strangely disturbing behavioural changes in her personality. When science fails to offer any rational explanation, her mother turns to superstition in a desperate attempt to save her daughter's life &amp; enlists the help of a troubled priest, who is struggling with his own faith.Directed by William Friedkin, the film opens with one of the most powerful, sinister &amp; perfectly crafted prologues which apart from serving as a warning for things to come also sets up an extremely eerie mood for the rest of the film. Friedkin's work here is perhaps the finest of his career as the extent to which the director went in order to bring out the best from his cast &amp; crew is well documented plus he left no stone unturned to make the experience as emotionally shattering as possible.The screenplay is penned down by William Peter Blatty, the author of the novel, and it is expertly balanced in all storytelling aspects. Cinematography makes brilliant use of slow zooms, panning, close-ups &amp; sharp focus to immerse viewers into its demonic tale, use of music is effectively carried out, make-up &amp; special effects end up adding a whole new chapter to filmmaking manuals and as far as editing goes, it paces the film ingeniously but is also marred by heavy amount of continuity errors.Coming to the performances, The Exorcist features a talented cast in Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Max von Sydow &amp; Lee J. Cobb. One amazing thing here is that the characters are wonderfully fleshed out in the script &amp; the actors simply build their act on an already solid platform, delivering some high quality performances. Each character is properly introduced, their arc is elegantly handled &amp; unlike most horror films of today, we do grow to care for these fictional lives on the screen.What continues to separate The Exorcist from most examples of its genre is that despite its extensive gore effects &amp; disturbing premise, the main emphasis remains on telling a story rather than revel in its extremity, which ultimately makes the final showdown all the more bone- chilling &amp; unforgettable. The horror it unleashes is absolutely brutal, difficult to watch &amp; too heavy in content yet the extent to which this film pushed the boundary of horror cinema by exploring subjects no one before ever dared to venture in is no mere feat in itself.On an overall scale, The Exorcist is one of the most influential, unnerving &amp; faith-shattering films ever made which opened the doors to our deepest fears back when it was released and is still capable of surprising the newcomers with its discomforting ambiance &amp; themes, if not the now dated visceral horror. Immortal for its contribution to cinema &amp; pop culture, memorable for the mass hysteria it caused, and admirable for its uncompromising &amp; undeniably effective take on demonic possession, "the scariest film of all time" comes strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello fellow readers I am Davorin Lonac, mostly known for my James Bond reviews, today I'll be taking a different genre being horror and will be exploring the depths of what seems to be "The Scariest Movie of All Time." Well, what can I say, as a child I had heard of this film and was keen on watching it, many people had told me it is very scary. I'll admit that it is but not a scary as i thought. I can surely accept the fact that when this film came out, it was the scariest but nowadays really isn't, for me that is. I quite like the parts before the girl actually gets fully possessed by the devil himself. There are scenes in the film which are quite funny, like when the exorcist swears at Lord Jesus Christ. Other scenes include the priest punching the girl in his final attempt to make the devil depart for good. The film certainly made me a little scared to go to bed the following night and the one after but the feeling soon changed. The Exorcist is a phenomenal horror film and indeed is very good.Be sure to view my other reviews!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audience Reaction Helps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's said that one thing which enhanced Hitchcock's now famed 10:00 a.m. "Psycho" premiere in New York was the extreme audience reaction of shock.Like viewers' laughter for comedy, horror films often depend upon audience screams, gasps and general "anxiety vibes" which sweep through the house.Certainly such was the case for "The Exorcist" when it first made its showings back in '73. It's impossible to re-create that reaction today and part of the film's initial success was how effective Friedkin (like Hitchcock) was able to manipulate his audience. It's constantly intriguing how each audience tends to take on a personality of its own (watch a film several times in a theater and note how variable and distinctive the reaction becomes from each group.Thus, when one sits alone today to watch a DVD, it's a world of difference from those initial screenings of "The Exorcist" in the 70s, when folks were experiencing it for the first time. Friedkin's film has held up pretty well, thanks to his painstaking production values. But true impact of "The Exorcist" is forever part of filmgoers' past history. A hard-working cast was apparently pushed to the breaking point to finish this production, which ran way overtime. Like many tortuous film shoots, the extra effort has paid off, making "The Exorcist" one of the top films in the horror genre. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, hmm....What to say...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't you hate when you really love a movie, and you think it's amazing and enthralling, and then read a really negative review for it? Doesn't it make you think, "Oh, what do you know!"? That's what it does to me. For example, I'm a huge "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" fan, and I hate when people say it's a cheesy b-movie about a guy with a chainsaw chasing some dumb blonde who can't stop screaming. That's NOT all that movie has to offer.What's my point?Well, I am just saying that so you won't be angered when I say I didn't like "The Exorcist." (In other words, I can appreciate the movie for what it is, so don't think I'm being mean.) I mean, there were some scary parts, yes. Well, creepy parts, at least. But the pace was so slow, and took it's damn time to get going!There were some okay points. Some atmosphere. The suspense was built well when the screams of the devil would be coming from Regan, and Chris would run to check to see what the hell was going on. And the ending was pretty good. But there are a lot of bad points. To me, not a lot was explained. What was the point of the first ten minutes, in Iraq? I honestly didn't get it. And why was Regan being possessed? I just wasn't seeing the connection in some things. And how did her head spin around, and her neck not break? And if it did, how could she still be alive by the end? (That is not a spoiler! We all know there's a sequel, with Regan.) Sure, some of you may think, "You think 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'is a great movie, what do you know about cinema?!" But that's a battle of what is scary and what isn't.A few more comments would go to the possessed Regan's almost comic demeanor. Her devilish self said a lot of funny things, and was pretty amusing. Still, Linda Blair did a good job in her role, and was impressive. Ellen Burstyn was a bit hammy at times, but still quite strong and moving. Jason Miller did quite well in his role, and I thought he did quite well. And of course, the music was pretty good, if a bit sparse in showing up, and it seemed to show up all of the sudden, then fade off really quickly. I think this could have taken the "Halloween" approach and used it's great music for some much needed atmosphere at the dull scenes. (And there are many.)Still, to be a true horror fan, I guess you have to see this movie, so I do recommend it. To see if you like it. And if anything, there's always "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," a true experience in unrelenting terror. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea what I was thinking when I decided to do a project on "The Exorcist" for college. I don't like being scared, and avoid horror films religiously (pun unintended). I am scared of my own shadow. So the proper course of action when told I had to do a presentation on something, of any medium, that showed tropes of the American Gothic, was to go ahead and do it on what's considered by many as the scariest film of all time.My boyfriend (who will be addressed always as Himself), was delighted at the prospect of watching me squirm through a horror film. So we watched it on Valentine's Day. How romantic."The Exorcist" is based off the best selling novel of the same name, by William Peter Blatty. Blatty also wrote the screenplay and won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his efforts. It tells the story of a little girl named Regan McNeil (Linda Blair), who appears to be possessed by some malevolent demon. Her mother, actress Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is beside herself with worry, and, at the advice of medical professionals, goes to a trouble priest named Damien Karras (Jason Miller), to request an exorcism.The film is frightening, but not conventionally. The only jumpscare is that of the demon's face for a split second. No, this film is psychologically chilling. Yes, chilling. It effects you, deep down. One sees themselves within the demon, as the little girl struggling to cope. We identify with Karras, who is on the fence about his faith. We are in that freezing room covered in vomit; we are the strong priest who does not balk at the terror before him, we are the troubled Jesuit who does not know where to turn. We are the little girl in the bed, screaming obscenities; we are monsters.Father Merrin (Von Sydow) says to Karras upon him asking why such a malignant source would infect an innocent girl "I think the point is to make us despair. To see ourselves as... animal and ugly. To make us reject the possibility that God could love us." Roger Ebert also said that the film sits on the fence between cinematic escapism and reality, that it makes us look inside ourselves. This is what makes the film terrifying; the fact that it shows us humans at our worst. We are, at some stage, the demon and the conflicted priest, the frantic parent and the tortured girl.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get it. I really don't.At the very beginning of this film's grotesque and bleak story (at an excavation site in Northern Iraq), a small, ancient effigy representing a devil-like figure is uncovered amongst the ruins.This discovery somehow unleashes a demon-spirit which then inexplicably transports itself all the way over to the USA where it, for whatever reasons, takes possession of a 13 year-old girl, living in Georgetown.What I don't get is this - In Iraq the principal religion has always been Islam - So, with that in mind - What the hell good would Catholic priests performing a Christian exorcism do to help rid a girl of a demon that comes from a religion which doesn't even recognize Christianity? Eh? What good would it do? If nothing else - This decidedly heavy-handed horror story certainly made a total laughing stock out of the Catholic religion. For example - Here we had to contend with the extremely volatile and guilt-ridden character of Father Damian Karras (a real boozer) who was the chosen one, supposedly best suited to perform the exorcism ritual which was intended to de-demonize Regan.Personally, I cannot see why so much fuss has been made about this particular fright flick over these many years. Now 40 years old, The Exorcist has definitely lost a significant amount of its initial clout. In fact, I'd say that it was pretty laughable, in the long run. Especially that whole nonsensical business of Regan being able to completely spin her head around without tearing her skin or snapping her spinal cord.... (Spare me!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a dirty little confession to make?I never actually saw The Exorcist in its entirety until one week ago. Taking this long to see what many consider to be the horror movie to end all horror movies is a travesty; trust me, I know. Over the years I had caught bits and pieces of it on television, but for some reason I just never took the time out of my oh-so-busy schedule to sit down and watch the whole thing from start to finish.After making a hasty decision to watch it very late one night via my Netflix Instant Queue, I found that all of the hearsay surrounding this 1973 classic is true. It's extraordinarily creepy, unsettling, and well done.Max von Sydow plays Father Merrin, a Catholic priest who moonlights as an archaeologist. It turns out that he's also one of the foremost experts on possessions and exorcisms.When Reagan, the daughter of a wealthy actress who resides in Washington D.C., is possessed by an evil spirit that claims to be none other than Satan himself, a long and winding road develops that will eventually lead a weathered old priest and a demon-possessed child to a meeting that is nothing short of bone- chilling. I'm getting a little ahead of myself, though, so let's back things up.Reagan, a 12 year-old who lives with her mother in a Georgetown area townhouse, gradually begins to exhibit increasingly erratic (and wholly bizarre) behavior. Her mother, Chris MacNeil (played by Ellen Burstyn), consults a large variety of medical professionals to try and determine what's causing the strange outbursts?which, by the way, entail sporadically cursing God and inflicting brutal physical damage on herself and others.Part of what makes The Exorcist work so well is the realistic handling of this situation by Chris (she immediately contacts a wide variety of medical professionals). Very few people would immediately think, "Okay? my daughter is possessed" and consult religious authorities as a primary reaction. The doctors who try to treat Reagan all approach this from a very scientific, logos-oriented standpoint too; their initial diagnosis is that she has a legion on her brain that's causing the erratic and violent behavior. After undergoing a series of gruesome tests to try and identify the location of said elusive legion, the doctors find that, physiologically, she's in full working order. Frustrated and baffled at the lack of competence these physicians have displayed, Chris starts to enter panic mode. Reluctantly, one doctor eventually suggests that Reagan is the victim of supernatural influences, and, as a last resort, Chris gets in touch with a local priest by the name of Father Karras. Karras is a well-educated man who is immediately skeptical of the supposed possession of Reagan, but he agrees to visit her and assess the situation himself. After a series of harrowing encounters with demon- Reagan, Karras, with the blessing of the Catholic church, teams up with Merrin in an attempt to drive away the evil spirit.The plot, as you've no doubt noticed, is pretty bare bones, but, like any truly scary tale regarding the paranormal, it works because it's handled with thoughtfulness and sincerity. All of the actors display a true sense of urgency in regards to the seriousness of Reagan's situation, and the acting of Blair (who, of course, was only a child at the time) is phenomenal. As Father Karras repeatedly visits and tries to learn more about who (or what) has taken over Reagan, said evil influence begins to bore into Karras' mind. Slowly, it's revealed that Karras is plagued with guilt in regards to his recently deceased mother. She passed away after he made the decision to place her in a nursing home, and Satan (or whoever is in Reagan) methodically mines that guilt until Karras is on the verge of completely losing it. The psychological horror utilized in The Exorcist is supremely scary, and this, along with many other things, helps elevate it above any other "possession" movie that's ever been made.Added to the effect of this is the fact that The Exorcist builds tension better than almost any other horror movie. As people approach the door to Reagan's bedroom, the sense of foreboding terror that lurks just beyond what you can see is palpable?you'll literally find the hair standing up on the back of your neck as you're pleading for whichever character to just hurry up and throw the door open so you'll be able to breathe again.And, of course, The Exorcist has many scenes that exist for no other reason than to totally freak you out. The head-turn sequence comes to mind first, and is closely followed by the stomach-turning pea soup vomit scene and the crab-walk-down-the-stairs bit that's found in the director's cut.I feel immensely guilty myself for not having scene this until the ripe old age of 27. If you consider yourself a horror aficionado and have never seen it, then go out and rent it right now?just be prepared to keep a crucifix and a vial of holy water next to your bed after you've developed a legitimate fear of the thumping sound coming from your attic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film. A memorable and shocking impacting classic. Psychologically scary, a question and test of faith.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember growing up as a kid and my mother telling me about a film called "The Exorcist" and how that when she watched it that she had nightmares for months. My mom was even afraid to go asleep. So finally after several years later when I got into my early and mid twenties I decided to do several viewings of "The Exorcist" so I could feel the effects of it. And I must say it's a very powerful film maybe one of the best ever made. It's a film that's subject matter demonic possession left me psychologically frightened and really if you felt like me asking about faith, and it really proves that great forces of evil exist in the world. The first couple of viewings alone had me worried about nightmares only believing positive and having strong faith helped get me thru and with more viewings the effects aren't as bad."The Exorcist" based on similar real life events was adapted also from William Petter Blatty's novel. Directed by William Friedkin his portrayal of images and depiction of scenes are really shocking as he behind the camera really pushed this work beyond the limits. Set in Washington D.C. in the college town of Georgetown actress Chris MacNeil(beautifully done by Ellen Burstyn)has just arrived to act in her latest film she's divorced and she's brought along daughter Regan(Linda Blair in a very harrowing and near perfect performance)who's so sweet and innocent. Yet gradually Regan starts to feel different as things start to happen inside her body and her surroundings are shaken up. But medical experts can find nothing wrong.It becomes clear this is no medical problem this is a bad case of devil possession! Interesting is a subplot involving a young local priest Father Karras(wonderfully done by Jason Miller)who's a man who is battling his own personal demons aside from faith he feels guilt from not being in New York when his sick mother passed away. Ironically Miss MacNeil will turn to Karras(a conflicted man who has doubts about priesthood) for help as his education in psychiatry of the spiritual nature will be the best way to battle Regan's demons. Plus with the help of Father Merrin(played blunt and to stone perfection from Max Von Sydow) an expert on possession that is the best way to battle the demons of this badly haunted little girl.And many scenes in the film are frightening and grossly harrowing from the green vomit and bloody cross masturbation scene many viewers that watch especially religious will be highly disturbed. It was reported that the role of Regan had such an impact on a young Linda Blair that she required help from a psychologist during filming and I can believe that due to the films subject matter and the many mature scenes that the young girl had to deal with. A nice side dish is the supporting performance of one screen veteran Lee J. Cobb as the straight arrow and folksy Lt. Kinderman. Overall the entire cast of the film is superb.Really what more can I say "The Exorcist" is a powerful film it came along in a decade and time(the 1970's)when motion picture was at it's best. The scenes though disturbing were harrowing and affecting to one's mind and Linda Blair was over the top probably one of the better performances in film history for a youth. "The Exorcist" proved that evil really does exist in the world and demonic possession can happen, as many people will tell you after watching this film it has them thinking about their soul. As really this picture is a test of faith. I took from it everything will be okay just remember have faith in god then you don't have to fear anything. "The Exorcist" is a powerful work a strong film with a haunting theme a classic that's memorable, frightening, and visually shocking and haunting forever. It's clearly one of the best pictures ever made a truly defining work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of its Notoriety -- A Monument of American Cinema and the Horror Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally saw this infamous piece of cinematic history; saw "The Version You've Never Seen" edition, with which I am very satisfied, so I'm not sure if I'll go back to the original theatrical cut. From what I've read, there are some pretty radical changes in terms of previously-cut scenes being included in the film as well as changes to the soundtrack. I can't speak to any differences between these versions but I'll talk about what I did see.This version clocks in at nearly 2 hours and 15 minutes, and its pace could certainly be described as "deliberate" (or "slow" or "snail-like" if you're a little lacking in the patience department); but this is just fine with me, because I tend to find horror films with a deliberate pace and atmospheric build-up of tension to be more effective and unsettling. And this film is both of those things. I was consistently amazed by the subtlety, tightness, and intelligence of the cinematography. Many films from the 60s, 70s, and even 80s fail laughably at the notorious test-of- time -- but "The Exorcist" does not fall into company with these films. The camera work and editing is throughly modern; the special effects are surprisingly tasteful and realistic and still look good nearly three decades later; the score and soundscapes, unlike the often heavy-handed and even goofy musical choices and arrangements of early 70s horror (think Last House on the Left), are sparse and intentional, adding to the tense atmosphere and refusing to play the role of crass emotional cues; the acting is raw, honest, and believable -- all the lead roles (Burstyn, Blair, von Sydow and Miller) are impeccably and genuinely acted, and without this the film would not have worked. The intensity of the film relies on development of the characters and their relationships with each other; believable acting is a cornerstone of this film's punch. Bolstering this is the deft handling and juxtaposition of opposing feelings through the pacing of the film: at one moment we are seeing Burstyn's character in emotional distress as her motherly heart is torn by her daughter's insane behavior and the doctors' circular discussions about psychological disorders or Miller's young priest character struggling with how to use both his faith and medical knowledge to handle the strange case of Regan -- the next moment we may be accosted by the possessed Regan, violently clenching men's genitals without warning, spewing green vomit into a man of God's face, or emitting demon-voiced insults that won't be reproduced in writing here. The manic-depressive nature of the film is a psychological roller coaster that keeps us on the edge of our seats until the ultimate, gripping climax -- an extensive spiritual, psychological, and even physical battle between our heroic priests and the devil-child, as the fullness of the stylized exorcism ritual is performed in attempts to save the life of a young girl."The Exorcist" was ahead of its time in nearly every way imaginable. Whether it is pragmatics of filmmaking or the more esoteric--the questions about God, science/medicine, religion, society--this film confronted the audience with unease and uncertainty. Though many films since "The Exorcist" have followed its formula and taken freely from its milestone-setting creativity and ingenuity, few if any of them have approached this masterpiece: where "The Exorcist" plays with tropes without using them as a crutch, other horror films in this vein can't help but come off as contrived second- rate films attempts to be as effective as this unsettling tour de force of horror. Amid all of the controversy, boundless praise and damning criticism, this film stands as a monument of American cinema and of the horror genre. And it will get in your head like the devil himself. For best results: watch alone in the dark!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I went to see this movie when we were still single and in college. She fainted about a third of the way through it and we had to leave. It was just as well, I had given that idea some thought myself before she finally decided she'd had enough. This movie was so bad, it doesn't even deserve a rating. This is another example of a good story idea, but they went just a little bit too far to get the message home. Why did that little girl have to pee on the rug after telling that astronaut "You're going to die up there"? The statement in and of itself was chilling enough. Wetting the rug was a bit of overkill. In fact, it made it look comical and spoiled the effect in my opinion. We left when poor little Regan was doing sit-ups on her bed at turbo speed and sprouting profanities in a voice about six octaves lower than her normal voice. I really think that the only reason they made this movie was to see how far they could push the envelope. Like many seventies movies, I think it was made for shock value. Too bad. The premise for the story was pretty good. Just way too much overkill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Max Von Sydow has made a career out of playing religious figures. Besides a number of religious allegories in Sweden with Ingmar Bergman, for English-speaking audiences he was Jesus in "The Greatest Story Ever Told," an over-zealous missionary in "Hawaii," and, on the other side of the spectrum, he was the devil in "Needful Things." Whichever side he's on, you know that Von Sydow will be the big boss man: his commanding presence and natural air of authority make it impossible to see him as an "average Joe." His Father Merritt is a reassuring figure: you know we're in good hands when he arrives at Regan (Linda Blair)'s bedside. This movie raises some interesting questions. Although it was made a quarter-century before pedophile priests became fodder for "Oprah," I can't help wondering just what kind of problems Father Karras (Jason Miller) was dealing with as a psychiatrist to his fellow priests. Throughout the film there's a sense that something is amiss in the world . . . and in the Church. If a twelve-year old virgin can be possessed by the Devil, who is truly safe? Conversely, why should the Prince of Darkness invest all his powers in claiming the soul of a movie star's quite ordinary daughter when he could just as easily possess the President of the United States or the Premier of the Soviet Union? Nevertheless, this is a great movie with an air of moral seriousness that prevents it from being merely exploitative. It's hard to understand how Christians like Billy Graham could say the movie itself is evil when if anything it reaffirms Christian values without being as shrill as later examples of "Catholic horror" like "The Omen." William Friedkin's direction has the same gritty authenticity that distinguished "The French Connection": his priests are believable as priests, just as in "The French Connection" his cops were believable as cops. Even after thirty-three years, this film still packs quite a wallop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of a horror story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist has often been called the greatest horror movie ever made, and for a good reason. It was revolutionary during its release and the passage of decades has not dulled its impact in the slightest. It's still an uneasy film in the best possible meaning of the word, tapping into several sources of fear simultaneously, while still telling a coherent, captivating story. You get the creepy atmosphere right from the start as we follow an old priest in the desert and find out with him that something wrong has slipped through the cracks into the world of man. Something old and ancient, something that does not belong.But we've seen many creepy films since then and if that was all the movie had, if it was all promise and no payout, it wouldn't have earned its reputation. Luckily, the film is more rounded than that. Many "horror" movies nowadays rely on jump scares, easy wrights that momentarily spike our adrenaline levels without scaring the mind. It's physical, instinctive and ultimately leaves no impact. This movie and other films like it, however, do utilize shock value as a mean to create horror, but the imagery they use goes deeper than something that merely looks scary or unsettling. The sight of Regan (Linda Blair) being slowly corrupted by a demon is jarring on an emotional level. It touches the nurturing side within us. It's wrong, it's taboo and because of that it's something we will remember, something we automatically oppose. It's adult fear, to use the technical term, something quite different from being afraid of the monster under the bed.Furthermore, it's a film that shines in execution as well. All the actors do a magnificent job of portraying ordinary people that have to face the unthinkable, the impossible. The movie doesn't shy away from reality in order to make the story seem more plausible. Rather it freely acknowledges the implausibility of the situation, contradictorily making it a more believable film. Add in brilliant sound design, masterful use of music to create atmosphere, stunningly effective practical effects and great lighting and you have a film that quite effortlessly convinces you that yes, a small girl can become possessed, easily in fact.I don't think it's out of line to say you're not a true fan of horror before you've seen this film. It does so many things right and gets so little wrong that it's no wonder people still flock into theaters to see reruns of it, that people still talk about it, discuss it, lose sleep over it. Greatest horror movie of all time? Quite possibly. At the very least it's right up there at the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects in The Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin and premiered in 1973, is well-known for its special effects. It won the Golden Scroll award for the best special effects in 1975. In the movie they use many different techniques to manipulate you into believing Regan, is truly possessed. The director used some extreme techniques to make the movie especially convincing. One of them was that Friedkin used some real emotions of the actors for his film. An example of this is that he fired a gun without warning on the set to elicit shock from Jason Miller (Father Karras).We think that what Friedkin has achieved with the techniques that were available in the seventies is simply amazing. Computer imagery was not fully developed yet. Therefore, he could only use optical and mechanical techniques to make his movie as realistic and effective as possible. This makes it even more admirable that he has made a movie that got (and still gets) so much attention because of its great special effects.Optical effects are methods with which you can photographically create images or different film frames. Mechanical effects are techniques using things such as props, the scenery and different atmospheres. These effects are accomplished while recording the movie.Examples of interesting optical effects in The Exorcist are Regan's floating in the air when the two priests are performing an exorcism and the 360 degree turn of Regan's head. Examples of mechanical effects in the movie are the shaking bed and the flying objects in Regan's bedroom. We think that these effects make the movie very interesting. Because all these things just cannot happen in real life, the effects convince you of the fact that there must be some kind of supernatural power involved. Things do not just start flying around after all.Another remarkable aspect of this movie is that the special effects build up throughout the movie. In the beginning, when the girl is doing fine, there are very little special effects used. After a while, more and more special effects resemble the demon getting more and more power over Regan. At first, the bed shakes. Then, things start flying around in the air and in the end, Regan herself is floating around. As the special effects become more unnatural, you get more and more confused by the strange things that happen.The way Friedkin uses special effects to manipulate you, the way he builds up the tension to the climax of the story is excruciating. It starts with small noises upstairs in the attic, the place where things almost always start to go wrong, then the daughter who is behaving strangely and the doctors who cannot do anything about it. He wants to show you something strange is going on, trying to make you wonder: what is really going on and who is causing it? Compared to our modern-day movies, we could quite easily see how all the special effects were created. The techniques used are not too complicated: some only require a bit of easy film editing. As we mentioned above, Friedkin did not possess the possibility of using all the techniques that directors can use nowadays. The techniques of the special effects are therefore not too impressive, but this does not make the way Friedkin applied them to the movie less effective.So what about the rest of the movie? The special effects are the most important aspect of this movie's success. We think that the rest of the movie is nothing much. The story is quite good, but there are many stories similar to this one and we think that the plot is quite slow. The acting is fine, but we have seen movies in which the actors performed way better in our opinion. We do have to admit that the movies that we think of as being better than this one have been produced years later. For a movie that was made in the seventies, The Exorcist is an exceptionally good movie.A good aspect of the movie is that there is a certain air of mystery throughout the whole story. The beginning of the movie seems to demonstrate that it might actually be Father Dyer to have caused the problem, with the strange coin he found and the statue the Father visited, which stood out due to the special effect with the light from behind and the wind suddenly setting in. Nevertheless, at the end of the movie the Church turns out to be the solution to the problem. The Church is the last chance for finding a cure for Regan.The Exorcist has been the source of inspiration for many other horror movies. Many producers have imitated the atmosphere of Friedkin's movie. After watching the movie, all you can do is agree with the producers: the atmosphere of The Exorcist is really horrifying. Many scenes in The Exorcist are frightening and disgusting, but have a certain thing that makes you laugh nervously. An example is Regan's spider walk off the stairs: she runs off the stairs on her hands and feet, upside-down. Her face is covered in blood. You hold your breath because of the immensely dangerous trick that the twelve-year-old performs, but you laugh nevertheless because it is so bizarre. The idea of these frightening but ironically comical scenes has been copied by many other directors, because these scenes give the movie a certain tension: as a watcher, you want to laugh and cry with fear at the same time. The mix of those two emotions makes the horror movie more effective. After a while, you notice that you are on the edge of your chair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful and Novel Approach to Horror Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oddly, it's sometimes the repulsiveness of imagery that surpasses "horror," becoming captivating in its revoltingness. This contrary advantage of primeval effect is the core of Friedkin's vision. Regan's thrashings are ugly, ferocious, but they've such effect on us since it's seen: Friedkin directs the viewpoint of these moments from the point-of-view of those seeing.And each setting's especially natural. This is also what made Jaws so exciting. No Transylvanian mansion with thunder, lightning. Throughout the whole scene between Burstyn and Cobb's detective, there's a deathlike silence. Just their voices, the sporadic tinkle of a cup. This amplifies our sensations. Burstyn's agitation becomes ours. Seconds after Cobb departs, Friedkin stuns the tautness with a piercing clatter and Regan's shouts. Burstyn dashes inside the room to terrified astonishment as books, papers, records, toys orbit hysterically.Visually plot items are realized with that contrary entertainment. Friedkin augments the authenticity of these scenes by not underscoring them. The dialogue, sounds, images bring the effect. And Friedkin knows how to develop to that dreadful pragmatism. Firstly, Regan says her bed shakes. We glimpse a black-and-white photograph of her, adding plain uneasiness to her pose. When she urinates on the floor at the party, the abnormality becomes visual. Seeing's believing.Friedkin intensifies each new shock, culminating in the masturbation, surely the most powerful moment due to the degree of debasement. We're constrained to watch, as Friedkin's wicked advantage is the lure of unspecified dread brought alive. Friedkin creates apprehension with his first image, black-and-white sunrise dissolving to an overwhelming orange. One practically feels the gleaming surges of heat. At the archaeological site, picks strike soil, sounds intensifying, shriller still when Von Sydow trembles finding the talisman.Apprehension becomes conflict. Von Sydow informs the keeper that he must leave. Then, he's almost run down by a black horse and carriage, a malevolent forewarning. Friedkin visually achieves a sensation that something horrific's impending. Von Sydow searches through the ruins, and faces Pazuzu's massive, menacing statue. Dogs fight ferociously, the effigy rigid versus the wailing winds while Von Sydow's bowed figure stands in bold resolve, action illuminating character.The feeling of dread and fear lives not just in the shadows but in broad daylight. Friedkin dissolves to barking neighborhood dogs in the damp gray over Georgetown, the bedroom of Burstyn, who hears bizarre scraping from her attic. Friedkin's taken us to a climax, a fearsome, unrestrained world, then deposits like a ride, gets underway again to the next climax. In illustrating the bizarre but accurate, the biological and cognitive potential justify the possession, also utilized to exciting, vile effect.As each medical option's reduced, the tension mounts as we see the possession intensify, causing Friedkin's attaining our surrender, agreement. Burstyn's sure Regan necessitates a priest. Burstyn's portrayed, basically, as an atheist, though her passion in this situation persuades us that she's certain her daughter's definitely possessed. The horrors begin in ordinary settings. Once we behold the cross masturbation, Friedkin's taken us from leg-pullers like attic scratchings to Regan's vicious, outlandish doings.Screams intensify tension, topping scenes emotionally. Friedkin employs sound as character. We're pacified fleetingly by silence, then the scream shocks. The distinction from tranquility to disorder in the dream sequence has the upshot of thrashing us instantaneously from relative comfort to a animal anxiety.Moreover, the handling of light contrasts is effective for its paradoxes. As in the dream, silver medal strikes black rock, cut to Regan in a vibrantly lit examination room, an icon of righteousness descending onto blackness, contrasted with Regan's hideous exploit in the barren luminosity. Familiarities such as tennis-playing students juxtaposed with Inspector consulting Miller about church defilements and McGowran's bizarre demise. Even in the daytime terror of the masturbation a gloomily shadowed image crowns the moment before the subsequent luster. Friedkin's most dazzling paradoxical disparity's in Von Sydow's re-emergence, a black outline in the lone gleam, wearing all black, invigorating the impression of wickedness Friedkin's founded, handsome visualizations assuming threatening connotations.The possession's cruelty is directly counter to Miller's vulnerability-become-power-via-selflessness. When he's introduced, he's visiting his mother in a dilapidated apartment. Her delight at seeing him is unadulterated, but he's swarming with self-reproach. He advises other priests but thinks he's losing his faith. When his mother dies, his remorse crushes. Nevertheless, despite private difficulty and misgiving, he does battle for a stranger. While he's not swayed it's a possession, Miller acquires the bishop's consent to do an exorcism. To Miller's disenchantment, Bishop thinks it best to have a man with practice: Von Sydow exorcized a demon years ago in Africa. Friedkin again expresses that Von Sydow and the demon are deep-rooted enemies, from their confrontation in the ruins to Regan's manifestation intensifying with Von Sydow's entrance.Friedkin advocates no principles, just illustrates the dismay defeated via fierce eradication. Nevertheless, it's the majestic shock of Miller's ultimate revelation and sacrifice that outdoes "horror," becoming enlivening. It's all the power of a twilight sky observed through a nihilistic lens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a pure horror classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist (1973, Dir. William Friedkin) Something beyond evil is happening in a little girl's room. Regan (Blair) has brutally changed both in the way she looks and the way she acts, with violent outbursts on everyone who comes in contact with her. Her worried mother (Burstyn) gets in contact with a priest (Miller) who comes to the conclusion that Regan is possessed. The top priest who can deal with an exorcism, Father Merrin (Sydow) is called in to help save Regan from the demon inside her.Although the scare factor it once had has decreased since then, this freaky and bizarre horror uses all the successful horror conventions to make a successful horror film. The effects are brilliant and the acting is so realistic. This is a pure horror classic.Mother? What's wrong with me? ? Regan (Linda Blair) It's just like the doctor said. It's nerves, and that's all. You just take your pills and you'll be fine, really. Okay? ? Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn)</fullReview>

It starts off in some country in the middle east, what relevance is this too the rest of the movie? What was the point of that scene? This film is vile, disgusting, anti catholic filth. I don't know how anyone can watch this! It's not scary in fact it's terribly boring. I couldn't wait for the end of the film so I turned it off. Nothing could have saved this terrible film. 0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist - A personal perspective.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was eight years old when The Exorcist came out. The stories in the playground started almost immediately, about parents throwing up in the cinema or of ambulances being called out to distraught patrons every night. I was into horror films already thanks to Hammer and Universal. My bedroom walls were adorned with pictures and posters of Cushing, Karloff and Lee and my younger sister was too scared to ever venture into my bedroom. So, of course, I wanted to see The Exorcist desperately. I read about it at every opportunity in magazines such as World Of Horror or Monster Mag. But in those pre-video/DVD years I had to wait until I was old enough. When I was sixteen I had a friend a few years older than me, Jim. He was an adopted orphan after his parents were killed in a car crash and paraplegic, paralysed from the waist down after a pole vaulting accident when he was thirteen. He had seen The Exorcist and told me it didn't live up to the hype and was 'nothing special'. Eventually, when Exorcist 2:The Heretic came out it was being shown close to me in a double bill with The Exorcist. After much perseverance I eventually persuaded Jim to accompany me to see it. For some reason they showed Exorcist 2 first and I started to fear the worst, was this any indication of what the Exorcist was like? I needn't have worried. The Exorcist blew me away and when my friend and I emerged from the cinema, into the cold night, he eventually admitted to me that the real reason he didn't want to see it again was because it had terrified him that much that he hadn't slept for weeks. I felt guilty for dragging him to see it again. Years later we watched it again on video for old times sake. Not long after this Jim committed suicide with no warning or indication. I miss him and every time I watch The Exorcist I think of him. So apart from being one of the best films ever made it also holds a special place in my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most well-known horror films, one of the highest-rated, and obviously a classic."The Exorcist" is exactly what the title implies. A demon has possessed a young girl in Georgetown, and two priests are set with the job of exorcising her after experiencing the horrifying proof of the demonic presence in the young girl, Ragen McMeil. (Linda Blair)This has got to be one of the most dramatic and saddening horror films that I've ever seen, and it's got to be one of the very best. In the religious area of horror style, it probably IS the very best, and is likely to be for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Horror Films Series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist (1973) was one of the greatest horror films ever made. It scared the nation and the people wanted more! The movie made a lot of money and it launched William Friedkin's career beyond the stratosphere (he was already a big name thanks to the French Connection). William Peter Blatty's novel was already a big seller when it was optioned for a silver screen adaptation. The conflicts between the two over how it would be presented as a film could make a movie by it's own right. There was as much action behind the scenes as there was in front of the camera.The story is about a priest who's at an ancient Sumerian archaeological excavation site. Father Merrin has been following the presence of an ancient evil deity named Pazul. He confronted it some time ago and is still haunted by it. At the same time, a young adolescent Georgetown resident is communicating with someone named Captain Howdy. Is their a connection? Meanwhile a middle aged priest is having disturbing dreams and doubts about his chosen profession of living a life of poverty as a priest. Are all these stories in some way connected? One must find out when watching The Exorcist!I am a fan of this classic. The behind the scenes tensions made this movie. The cast was excellent and William Friedkin was on the ball (Unlike most of his films after this one). The creepy "Tubular Bells" was an appropriate choice for the film's soundtrack. The Exorcist revived the career of Max Von Sydow and made a star out of Linda Blair. Watch it and you'll find out why it scared so many and stirred up a lot of emotions from the religious right and the moral majority. A true classic!Highly recommended!Like all successful films that came out of Hollywood, the Italians and a lot of lower tier American studios couldn't resist and cloned this movie to death. Some are good and others are pretty atrocious. The Italian film industry was saved by making knockoffs and parodies of this movie. I guess the so called "spaghetti westerns" were dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, there's always somebody........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Exorcist when it first came out. I didn't really like it and really didn't want to see it again, but when I heard that there was a definitive cut with eleven additional minutes, the temptation was too great. I had to see it again to see if I thought differently about it. And I wanted to see Lee J. Cobb in particular, one of my favorite actors (the line about John Garfield in his first scene is ironic, as both of them were part of the Group Theatre).Sorry. I gave it my best shot. I don't think it's much of a classic.Friedkin certainly did a good job, and the story was interesting. The graphic nature of the film and the language didn't really bother me as it did others.Burstyn is fantastic as she always is, but Blair is remarkable, and that's my real problem with this movie. Anyone who didn't let their child play the role of Megan has my full respect. The fact that Blair's parents let her do this movie was simply unconscionable. A teenager has no maturity to handle what she is asked to handle here, and it should not have been a surprise that her childhood was destroyed as a result. It is no wonder that her career became a non-career. No one was going to offer her a role as a 'normal' girl. She is still beautiful, and deserves another chance to show what she is truly capable of as an actress, but I don't think anyone has the guts to do that in Hollywood today.I can't say that I wasted my time watching this, but I'm not likely to want to see it again.</fullReview>

I have never been so disappointed and mistaken. This movie is equal to sitting and staring into a wall for like 2 hours. Absolutely nothing happens,no scares at all. The possessed girl looks retarded. The plot is horrible,acting is horrible,i guess you could say that everything about this movie is horrible. I can absolutely not understand why everyone says this is such a good movie,as it has absolutely zero to offer the viewer. People who call this horror must be really easy scared and i suppose they get nightmares from watching Mickey Mouse and Donald duck as well. Its about as scary as that.</fullReview>

It's easy to see that films like the Conjuring were inspired by this movie cause of the good use of horror, dialogue and also direction. The ending is pretty much the ultimate sacrifice and it's kinda touching since The Exorcist became such a huge success it got 2 sequels and one prequel and i have to be honest i didn't mind the Prequel it was pretty good but the 2nd one was so so i never bothered with the 3rd one.

		<fullReview>Okay, so this movie is a masterpiece. This is one of the best horror movies of all time, but its not the scariest movie of all time! It says that on the cover on all the physical copies, but thats not true at all. I can agree that it might was horrifying when it came out, and you went to see it, and had no idea what this movie was, but now its not so scary, except for a few scenes. Its more disturbing and mysterious, but i would still consider it a horror movie because of the darkness in the movie. The movie is about a 12 year old girl, called Reagan. She gets possessed by a demon called Pazuzu. In the start of the possession, they think it is the nerves and signs of puberty. But they are horribly wrong! A absolute must- see for horror fans, and one of the best movies of all time! Enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An instant classic that redefined its genre...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist was the 1973 instant classic that broke box office records, broke all the rules about the horror/terror genre, angered religious leaders all over the world, made theatergoers physically sick, generated some innovative techniques in the art of visual effects, and IMO, was robbed of the Oscar for Best Picture of 1973.The film is based on a novel by William Peter Blatty from which Blatty fashioned the screenplay and was directed by William Friedkin, fresh off his Oscar-winning work on The French Connection. This is the story of an actress named Chris MacNeill (Ellen Burstyn) who has recently moved to Georgetown with her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) in order to make a movie. Seemingly out of nowhere, Regan begins exhibiting bizarre behavior which Chris finds out that doctors and a barrage of tests cannot properly explain. Chris is dumbfounded when it is finally suggested to her that Regan is the victim of demonic possession and the only way to help her is an exorcism, a religious ceremony that hasn't been performed in decades. Enter Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller), the priest who is going through a crisis of conscience due to the death of his mother, which the demon inside Regan seems to know about and uses it against Karras to fight being driven from Regan's body.This film terrified film audiences all over the world, even though most of the scares in this film are more repellent than actually scary. Friedkin and Blatty do know how to tell a compelling cinematic story that unfolds slowly without playing all its cards right away. It starts with noises in the attic and then Regan's urinating on the floor in front of Chris' party guests as clues that things are not as they should be, but doesn't really foreshadow what's going on either.Ellen Burstyn was robbed of the Oscar for Best Actress for her bewildered and angry Chris MacNeill and playwright Jason Miller made an impressive acting debut as Karras, a performance that earned him a supporting Actor nomination. Linda Blair became a movie star and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her Regan, a performance that a lot of people thought was cosmetically constructed through makeup and special effects and that might be why she didn't win. Max Von Sydow is properly creepy as Father Merrin, the priest who helps Karras with the exorcism and Lee J. Cobb is fun as Lieutenant Kinderman, the detective who becomes involved with the story when the director of Chris' film (Jack MacGowran, who actually died during production) is actually murdered by the demon inside of Regan. The voice of the demon is provided by Oscar winner Mercedes Macambridge.This is a once-in-a lifetime cinematic experience that has to be seen to believed. It spawned many clones and imitations but this is the granddaddy of them all. Followed by two sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one has lost none of its power to shock or terrify.You've heard of the head spinning round, the green vomit, probably even the crucifix masturbation scene.That doesn't prepare you.It's not the material itself that makes it so shocking, although, over forty years later, even the language retains an edge. I've still never heard that variation of the c-word in any other movie, I don't think. It's the direction, which always takes you by surprise, which lulls you into a state of security it punctures again and again until finally letting the horror take over like a bad dream you can't wake up from.It's the screenplay, too. This is a movie about people. About people suffering an unspeakable trauma. About people driven to the edge where the supernatural meets them.It's not about special effects or shocking violence.The characters live and breathe, you feel what they feel, even the disbelief.The Exorcist carries you along. It takes you to places you don't want to go, working its magic in ways you can never fully understand.And it remains shocking and terrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good As It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Friedklin directed this film in the early 1970's, and it was one of my earliest exposures to classic cinema. There is something that permeates the film from its early frames. It's cinemas at its purest form, with images telling and enhancing the story. If one can believe it, emotions are perfectly conveyed, and one is both a witness and a participant, almost being able to feel the protagonists' feelings, the temperature in the room, the psychological disturbances in the universe.This is a movie that couldn't have been made by another director. He connected to the material, whatever personal background or experiences helped him, we might never really understand, but in his hands, he fashioned an adaptation of a tale that was already controversial and which dealt with the primal forces of almost any culture. He gathered a remarkable team of actors and technicians, giving enough weight to every element, respecting his material, and allowing us to become an integral part of its success.As almost everyone knows the basic story of possession of a young girl in Washington, DC and how the event is just a step which leads to the reunion of two opposing forces, a priest and an old demon. In the middle is an innocent girl who opens a pathway to a dark world that nobody really understand but few want to be exposed to. It is complex, mysterious, challenging, threatening, stifling, devastating, and pretty scary. It feeds on our fears and anxiety, and it won't stop until it draws you into its realm.Faith is at its core, with the old guard, still strong enough to fight the powers of evil but losing the battle because of physical limitations. The new generation is also in shaky ground because faith is a commodity that is hard to maintain, to she must and modern life is corroding its foundations. A priest wants to believe, but he's having second thoughts and feels helpless as he can't assist himself and the ones he loves.The film builds its momentum as one's able to see how the evil forces will use every possible weakness to conquer the other. It's full of dark moments which involve theology, history, mysticism, faith, and the arrival of invasive technology. In one of its most upsetting moments we forget the old horror as the young protagonist must be subjected to a new kind of torture, and we can't help but recoil as we're witnesses to what she must endure while people find a possible solution to what is ruining her life.In the end, the film is as perfect as it gets, with Blair and Burstyn doing superb work as the mother and daughter in the center of the storm. Von Sydow and Karras also shine as the warriors who attempt to restore normalcy to the poor young girl's world. What makes the film so good is how it has kept so well, 40 years after its original release because of its solid writing, acting, and the technical achievements of a team that brought to life a text that was a force of its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considered a classic for good reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just realised a couple of weeks ago that The Exorcist is probably the only horror classic I haven't seen. I mean I've seen Dracula, Frankenstein, Psycho, Halloween, The Thing, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Thing, even stuff like Friday The 13th. So when I heard how many people considered it the scariest movie ever made (and even after I told friends I watched it they said they couldn't get through it) I was intrigued. To this movie's credit while it isn't my favourite horror movie, I will say it definitely makes my top 10 and maybe my top 5.So the plot, an actress is in the middle of a film shoot and despite problems she has a loving 12 year old daughter and paid people to help around the house so things, while not perfect I'll say they're pretty good. Until her daughter begins acting strangely by one minute being... well, herself and another minute being a borderline psychotic brat that uses profanity frequently, she has her bed shake and sometimes loses control over her body from peeing on a rug to violent spasms (sorry that's the best way I can describe it) and her crab walking down stairs. The mother, when this starts and only the profanity, psychotic brat personality change, bed shaking and bodily problems are present decides to consult medical and psychiatric help and all the doctors help go nowhere with finding out what the f#ck's going on and as things worsen and get stranger even from what I've described they decide to suggest exorcism (which looking things up I'm shocked is actually used medically).I'll say what my problem is with this movie. Every scare is parodied in some way by pop culture. I'll say I was on the edge of my seat while watching it but I knew the head spinning, the projectile vomiting, making stuff move and all that would be coming at some point in the movie and it's a shame because while it does give off a creepy tone regardless, I don't think there's much left in terms of scary scenes.Okay, my compliments. First of all, having me buy a realistic depiction of Demonic possession is something that the screenwriters should be congratulated for (which looking at the awards... they were). It does well in easing people into believing the situation by having the reaction to the Demonic possession not be something that they just leap onto. The make-up should congratulate themselves not just for Reagan's Devil face but for making a 44 year old Max Von Sydow look almost exactly like he would in old age. That and I really love the sound design, in most of my favourite horror movies there's usually an uncomfortable silence in some scenes that builds on the suspense and fear and while that maybe apparent here they add so much more to it.If you want to see it then I'll say do it. It certainly has reasons for being considered a horror classic and it has a lot to it that I would say would be worth the look even now after pop culture has parodied most of the scary scenes. I heard people ran out of the theater screaming and while that might be lost a little bit over time (although to be fair I didn't watch it in complete darkness on a huge screen so maybe that's the reason) it still has a lot to offer if you're looking for scares and to add the fact that it does do a good job in making a demonic possession in the everyday world seem believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist (10/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where is it to even appropriately start with a film like The Exorcist, it transcended the horror genre and is often regarded as the scariest movie to the majority of casual viewers. The film's pacing is excellent having the advancement of tension and buildup with incredible pay-offs. The character development and story are so detailed and entertaining that the first half of the film left no dull scenes of dialogue. The latter half of The Exorcist was nothing short of amazing. Normally, the payoff scenes are shorter quick pieces of reel towards the end but The Exorcist had long drawn out Exorcism scenes with terrifying moments. All the actors and actresses themselves performed phenomenally. Linda Blair playing the most innocent girl to start really leaves a lasting impression when the voice of the demon comes out of her character. Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller however, go often under the radar with the film, which is too bad since they really brought the real fear of what they saw to life. The Exorcist is without a doubt a top five horror film in my book and in my top twenty across all genres.</fullReview>

I guess that first 45 minutes or so, nothing happens and that the story and the introduction to the characters is a bit unnecessary. I think I wanted 2 or 3 times to stop watching it because I was kinda bored.The thing with the old coin from Northern Iraq is not quite explained. It is obvious that it has something to do with the devil but ...that's all you get.Also, the ending with that coin / bracelet which the mother gives to the priest, who returns it, is kinda ...what? Does that mean that he will be possessed?

		<shortDescription>The things that make The Exorcist such a special horror film .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, Friedkin creates this very normal and upper class liberal American milieu - the last place where you would imagine an exorcism to take place. He does this through a lot of character build up. It is to his credit that he did not leave out any of the characters in the book like the immigrant housekeepers or the alcoholic movie director. You would think something like a demon invasion or exorcism would never happen to such happy, rich, normal and successful people. The characters are the sort you would find in a Woody Allen film and into this milieu enters Demon Pasusu. Hence, Chris' (Ellen Burstyn) shock at the gradual changes that her daughter undergoes is very believable.Secondly, Friedkin manages to portray the limitations of science (in the form of the doctors) in a very scathing manner - the doctors come across as completely banal with their ridiculous explanations as to why Regan (Linda Blair) is going crazy. Through this veritable negation of scientific explanations for Regan's condition, Friedkin lends credence to the presence of an unexplainable evil. Thirdly, Demon Pasusu's antics are scary but Friedkin only shows us some of it. In fact, he does not even show some of it, it is only when the doctor tells Chris that her daughter has been using foul language that we realize that something is seriously wrong with Regan. The impact of Pasusu's personality on Regan is very gradual. It is one of the best build ups in a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of Faith goes up against Misery and Despair !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is pretty useless to start this review by summarising the basic plot of 'The Exorcist', because let's face it, even people who haven't really seen the film know what it is about in a cursory way. Everyone knows that this film has a girl supposedly possessed by a demon named Pazuzu, but people who read between the lines, will know that this is not just a horror film with scares(which are there),it's also about existentialism and it deals with bigger issues.I think 'The Exorcist' is extremely layered. It is open to literally infinite interpretations. I am pretty sure my interpretation of the meaning of this film might be radically different to some other viewer's. Personally I think, this is a horror film, but it's not about the supernatural from a thematic standpoint. I think all the scenes involving supernatural elements and antics are supposed to be metaphorical. Friedkin has to be really appreciated for making a film that says so much without showing a lot. I watched the director's cut and was really impressed by the fact that so many things were merely hinted at without Friedkin giving you details about them. Those subtle hints and their implications can completely change your view of the film and your perspective. I completely agree with Roger Ebert's opinion that 'The Exorcist' is a very Begmanesque existential film that deals with questions of faith and despair. The most significant thing that the film talks about is the relevance and importance of faith in this cruel, hopeless world filled with misery, despair and cynicism. The film says the world is a cruel place where with every passing day our faith and belief in God will be questioned, but at times of great trouble, we will have nothing else to resort to apart from faith in humanity and God, irrespective of whether you believe in God or not, and that faith can help us get the better of our demons. William Friedkin brilliantly captures the existential feel of the William Peter Blatty novel and also Blatty's screenplay. Linda Blair as Regan is probably one of the most iconic horror film characters of all time and her 'possessed' face is something that has scared people through generations. Ellen Burstyn is also good as Chris, the mother who feels helpless at the prospect of finding a cure for her daughter's problem which she doesn't understand. Max Von Sydow has dealt with existentialism and faith throughout his acting career because of his frequent collaborations with the legend Ingmar Bergman and he is brilliant and very convincing in the short,but very significant role of Father Merrin in this film. But having said all that, I should say that this film belongs to Jason Miller as the Father Karras. Miller comes up with a heartbreaking performance portraying the inner struggle that his character is going through. We are shown that events in his life, particularly the ones involving his mother and all the misery in the world that he has seen due to his constant contact with the general people as a priest has led him to gradually lose faith in God and religion. I think thematically, Karras is the most significant character in the film and his character's arc helps Friedkin to end the film on an optimistic note.This is without a doubt Friedkin's best film. Although 'The French Connection' and 'The Exorcist' are completely different films both plot-wise and theme-wise, however I still could see some similarities between them in the way that Friedkin uses the two colours- blue and red artistically to give them a meaning and to visually imply certain things. Friedkin brilliantly raises tension in the film without using jump scares(there is one of them though). Some stills and shots of the film are breathtaking and almost goose bump-inducing. 'The Exorcist' is one of those films that leaves the door wide open for endless interpretations. Every person's take on it can differ. It is artistically shot, brilliantly acted and it has a deep, meaningful thematically rich script thanks to Batty. I repeat, as far as I am concerned, 'The Exorcist' is not about ghosts and demons in the literal sense, but it still is one of the greatest horror films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blair Gets Exorcised!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist (1973): Dir: William Friedkin / Cast: Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb: Terrifying masterpiece based on the book by William Peter Blatty. There are many Biblical accounts where Jesus himself drove demons out of people, so an exorcist is obviously someone who rids what doesn't belong. Ellen Burstyn stars as an actress whose daughter is possessed by demonic forces. After the shocking image of her daughter screaming atop a shaking bed, she seeks professional help. When doctors fail in finding answers it is suggested that a Priest see the girl. Intelligent, shocking with a sense of insight where Burstyn asks the right questions regarding exorcism. Quite an accomplishment for director William Friedkin who previously made another masterpiece in The French Connection. Burstyn brilliantly mirrors frustration mixed with fear. Linda Blair is both sympathetic and commanding as the possessed victim. Jason Miller plays a troubled Priest whom questions his faith after his mother's death. Lee J. Cobb steals moments as a police inspector. Then there is Max Von Sydow is compelling as the exorcist who sensed the demonic force in the film's opening and ultimately understands the standoff he will eventually face. A masterpiece in horror with excellent makeup and spellbinding measures of faith. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I still like it, but my partner laughed all the way through it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That summary may be the best way to review The Exorcist in a modern context, as its effectiveness is possibly dependent on the demographic of the viewer.I first saw this in the late-90's shortly after reading the book. Both mediums shocked me, and I enjoyed them thoroughly! Rating it before the recent rewatch based on memory I'd be giving it a 9. As it is the film's dropped to an 8 because some of the narrative jumps felt clumsy, and the addition of cheesy scary-demon faces really dampened the feeling of dread.I think The Exorcist Director's Cut I just saw (as opposed to the original cut I watched all those years ago) suffers from the same problem as Blade Runner's Final Cut, in that scenes are added which don't flow well with the narrative. Ridley Scott's film also lost a point because of this. Add the tedious experience of Paranormal Activity's extended cuts (over the thrillingly-paced original edits) and I'm beginning to lose faith that Director's/Extended/Final cuts are in any way a good idea to watch a movie.Still, an 8/10 is in my book a very good film, and this it remains. Linda Blair is brilliant in the role, and props to the FX make-up: it looks awful (in a good way!). While the ageless Ellen Burstyn is competent in the role of concerned mother, it's the two priests who almost steal the show, especially near the dramatic end.But people watch The Exorcist to check out the demonic possession highlights, and I for one was still shock&amp;awed by them, tho' the big caveat is my younger partner was just laughing her ass off at these scenes. We both enjoy the subtle chills of Paranormal Activity, alas it seems 70's horror driven by make-up FX seems to be too silly for her. Suffice to say rewatching old favourites like The Omen is off the cards for now.Conclusion: highly-recommended for almost anyone interested in classic horror, but avoid the Director's Cut. Some of you may find the film too daft to be taken seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For along time I hadn't watch horror movies.because it became full of scenes of blood .I liked that movie as it's taking about the devil and the power of faith. I liked so much the beginning of the movie with the sound of Azan to represent being in northern Iraq.The searching process for ancient cultures which which reveals the whole mystery of the movieAlthough..In some cases people who don't believe in God .. When they are in a real trouble and can't find any way..they finally find the answer at the door which they refused to knock . The stupid human nature that make us do the same mistake over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Demon: "Your mother sucks c''ks in hell!".The film is about a little girl is possessed by a demon. Can the Catholic church save her.This movie is pure creepy and pure gross. That image of the demon that you see not a lot, that face is just so freaky and it makes me jump every time I see it. The movie left a scary and a chilling in me after I finished watching it. The movie has its problems like the film at times does slow down a little bit. But overall The Exorcist is a horror movie that sticks with you after it's over. Leaving a uneasy feeling on you that a lot of people had back in 70's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think The Exorcist has been sidelined in the recent decades by its reputation. Legends abound about moviegoers who ran screaming from the theater and needed psychiatric counseling after the experience, but those who refuse to revisit the film (or who avoid it completely) are missing the reasons that the film works.Friedkin takes this bizarre story seriously and grounds his characters in absolute reality so the horror of the possession bubbles up out of their lives and doesn't come into the film as a stunt. Their reaction is much the same as ours would have been. I revisit the film about every five years or so and I always notice something different. This last time I was struck by the film's leisure pace. It takes a long time before we get to the actual possession itself and in that time, we get to know the characters whose lives will be torn apart by these horrible events.I appreciated the slow passages early on in which little Regan (Linda Blair) is taken to doctors who subject her to medical treatments, MRIs, spinal taps and finally hypnosis. I liked a brief moment in which her mother Chris wakes up and finds her daughter lying next to her. The child moans "My bed was shaking." I appreciated the moment when the mother tells Father Karras that her daughter might need an exorcism. His reaction is completely reasonable as his eyes widen and he says "Excuse me?" He then tells her "The best way to obtain an exorcism would be to take a time machine back to the 16th century." He informs her that the church doesn't grant exorcisms without strenuous investigation because information about psychiatry and mental illness have long replaced such rituals.There's something else I noticed upon revisiting the film recently: there is never an origin or purpose given for the possession. The demon has possessed the body of this young girl, but we are never told why. There are several theories: there's the reappearance of a strange statue of Pazuzu (a Assyro-Babylonian demon) that Father Merrian finds in the Iraqi desert; there are some early scenes the suggest that Regan has been communicating with a certain Captain Howdy through a Ouija board; but we are never given an explanation of what exactly has taken place. We only see the results. I think that's wise because it give the movie a slant of unpredictability and doesn't waste time bogging down the plot in overwrought exposition.The climactic scene, which has become movie folklore, is where the special effects and makeup come to light but not in a showy way. The scenes involving the actual exorcism are so unpredictable because up until that point, we've been kept mostly in the dark about what this demon is capable of. We've seen the head swivel, the crucifix masturbation scene, we've heard the graveled voice of the demon, but it is only setting us up for the pure battle between the priest and the evil the dwells within this little girl.The Exorcist is a horror movie that got it absolutely right and spawned a generation of worthless imitators who believe that the best way to make a horror film was to hurry along to the scary stuff to give the audience its money's worth. Friedkin wanted to make a film that made sense, a film that found a foothold in order to make the material much more terrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist is one of the scariest films that I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a teenage girl is possessed by a mysterious entity, her mother seeks the help of two priests to save her daughter. A visiting actress in Washington, D.C., notices dramatic and dangerous changes in the behavior and physical make-up of her 12-year-old daughter. Meanwhile, a young priest at nearby Georgetown University begins to doubt his faith while dealing with his mother's terminal sickness. And, book-ending the story, a frail, elderly priest recognizes the necessity for a show- down with an old demonic enemy. It really is an intense and very terrifying film that will leave you on the edge of your seat. It still is a very powerful film, more than forty years on; it still manages to terrify audiences today just like it did back then. Whatever your belief system is, or lack of it, this film is one you will never forget. It is beyond anything I have seen before or unlikely to again. It is one of the most atmospheric films I have ever seen. It is full of a brooding tense atmosphere that lasts for the entirety of the movie. I personally love this type of film because it leaves you on the edge of your seat. The Exorcist is one of the scariest films that I have ever seen. It takes a lot to scare me but this film scared me in different ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless. But....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched it I was very effected by it. Mainly because I was watching it on a computer where I could turn the volume down if something scary happened. But watching it with a audience is just great and it shows the intense impact the movie had on people 40 years ago. But... I just feel that the characters you cannot relate to.Ellen Burstyn, the mother has a extremely short temper and does not listen to anything the doctors say and instead decides to scream at people because she is a huge immature child. I don't care about Sharon because she is barely in it, Reagan is just there to shock people which the actress Linda Blair does a excellent job at. The effects are also frightening. The head spinning scene is one of the most memorable scenes in movie history.Even though some characters are filled with hate and the movie might be too much for some, The Exorcist is a timeless classic and every horror film fan should see it.88/100 B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist will always be one of the scariest films in existence because, along with its technical qualities, it preys on people's innate fear of "the devil" and all that kind of stuff and what it represents. Its subject matter isn't something that's completely recognized as fantastical, but something that's socially suggested as "real". Pretty every scene with Linda Blair is iconic for a reason. Nothing's more disturbing than watching a little girl pee on the carpet in the middle of a dinner party. Escpecially when she's peeing for an "evil" reason. The sub story of the young priest is highly disturbing. And this movie proves that profanity and crazy insults are crafts of the devil. Watch with the lights off while playing with a Ouija Board. It's the only way to experience this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were born in the late 80's or the early 90's, you won't like it. There are scarier movies now, and when you see "The Exorcist" you think that is trash. When everybody talked about this movie, I thought it was really scary, but once I saw it, I wasn't that scared, I was expecting a lot more. When the "Never Seen" version was released in theaters, everybody was excited and afraid, but like I said, there are scarier movies now and teenagers didn't like it that much. There's a lot of talking and not that much terror scenes. Maybe the movie was really scary in its time, but time goes on and changes have to happen, everything is now "MORE" than before...anyway it's a good movie, it's a classic, it's "The Scariest Movies &gt;From All Times", let's keep it that way, if you like to watch classics this is for you, if you like to watch from 1995 till today, you won't like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't take nothing way from this movie. It is thirty years old and might stir up some fright in people. As for myself I can look at this movie in the dark alone and not be afraid. When I first saw this movie I was a kid and had some sleepness nights,but now that I'm older it has no affect on me. A young girl possessed by the devil and a priest performs an exorcist. Come on! If the devil had that much power why didn't he killed the priest and had many opportunities to. Looking back at this movie it's kinda funny especially when the possessed girl gets freaky with the priest. How sick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Satan some credit, why don't they?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you know absolutely nothing about this film possible spoilers are here within. You have been forewarned!I just saw "The Exorcist" for the first time, after having it recommended to me by several people. It was a bit of a letdown.Perhaps I didn't find it interesting because I have never been introduced to a Catholic belief system, and the whole idea of a "devil" has always seemed extremely silly to me. It seems to me that if Satan existed at all, he would have better things to do with his time than waste it on a small group of boring middle class Americans. And furthermore, why does he find it necessary to speak in a fruity English accent?The thing that bothered me most about "The Exorcist" was that it was just so OBVIOUS. There were really no surprises here. Instead of trying to subtly influence the people around him, 'ol Lucifer chooses to reveal himself quite blatantly. He could have spent years disguised as an innocent young woman, but no, he chooses to bark and vomit and scream at people so that everyone knows his business. The Prince of Darkness, often attributed to being sly and cunning, is portrayed in this movie as being crude, oafish, and sometimes just plain laughable. Give Satan some credit, why don't they? He supposedly commands the nine levels of Hell and is responsible for every kind of sinful temptation imaginable, yet he shrieks in terror when someone waves a little flask of holy water at him? Come on!The only thing that saved this movie for me were the performances of Ellen Burstyn and the young Linda Blair, an actress I have never seen in anything else but is really quite fantastic in this film. The loving mother/daughter relationship was the only thing that made me decide to stick it out until the end, because I cared about what happened to their characters. Too bad the script wasn't as good as the actors deserved.</fullReview>

I couldn't close my eyes.I just watched it again, and it was still the scariest movie I'd ever seen. Mainly because of Linda Blair's performance, and Friedkin's exceptional direction. Even when I watched again I felt giddy afterwards. It will mainly work for horror fans, like me, because most people don't believe in that devil shit. Be prepared if you rent this one out.

		<fullReview>Having heard all the hype about this film I was very surprised at how slow paced it all seemed, there's bags of time spent creating characters background and building up suspense. Characters and dialog are very real with nothing moving from the standard story until well into the film. Once the Green Pea soup hits the fan you suddenly realise why this was banned when it was, but I must point out that in the context of the story it never seems over the top, just very disturbing. Despite the re-release, it still seems like there are two gaping holes in the storyline, as though there are still some serious edits remaining. The acting is believable, Linda Blair is very convincing and Jason Miller portrays well a Priest with failing faith, a very good human portrayal. Very enjoyable and slightly unnerving, it almost lives up to its reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Interesting Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite this film's several flaws (A lengthy introduction and a bunch of unnecessary characters), "The Exorcist" is a very good film. Often it is regarded as "The scariest movie ever," and while I personally was not terribly scared, after the aforementioned introduction my attention rarely wavered.Good performances, especially by possessed Linda Blair, and great effects. I don't even think I need to add "for its time" because the movie hold up pretty well to this day. One last minor complaint: Does anyone else feel this movie should have been called "The Exorcism" and not "The Exorcist?" The movie is largely an ensemble work, and the titular character is actually not a big as others (mainly the mother and younger priest). Still, a spooky, disturbing, interesting flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put: The Exorcist is THE modern horror masterpiece, bar none. Don't believe the MooCow?? Just ask the millions of people who, moore than 25 years later, STILL refuse to watch it on tv or on video. The Exorcist helped re-define the modern horror moovie from the psychological angle, and sports some of the moost famous, disturbing, and downright disgusting scenes ever put to film. Ellen Burstyn stars as Chris McNeil, an actrees in DC who'se daughter, Ragen (Linda Blair, in her only good performance ever) just may be host to a demon named Legion - or is she just schitzophrenic?? Max Von Sydow, in a glorious performance, leads the team of priests, each with a past, to take on the demon. There is a darkness to this film that few other films have ever even come close to capturing, and the intelligent, captivating screenplay is superbly handled by Director Friedkin &amp; his cast. Friedkin previously directed The French Connection, but then all but vanished, except for a couple of little-seen, unknown moovies. There are sooo many excellent scenes in this film, the MooCow has difficulty selecting just one, but perhaps the scene where Fr. Karras get the tape-recorded voices translated - mooocho creepy. In fact, the MooCow is getting scared now thinking of the film... :=8( Anycow, this is the perfect moovie to put on late at night, and snuggle up with your cuddlebunny to. DVD version is even moore glorious. Cud be the best horror film ever made. MooCow says go get it now!! :?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatic and powerful!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A famous actress's adolescent daughter is possessed by a demon.Her desperate and frantic mother decides that her child's only chance lays on a old, seen-it-all priest. Horror film that revolutionized the gender and caused great polemic.Director William Friedkin transformed the William Peter Blatty's story in a powerful and frightening visual show about possession and salvation, and changed the conception of how to construct a really scary movie.At the time "The Exorcist" was filmed, horror flicks were in frank decadence and reduced to Frankenstein and Dracula's films, but Friedkin made the difference with this memorable motion picture and i believe that after Friedkin ,the only movie maker who reached such quality of fear and tension was Clive Barker with "Hellraiser". If "The Exorcist" is in some moments dramatic, in others violent, "Hellraiser" is a psychological thriller with almost unbearable cruelty ,and as Friedkin, Barker also could count with a terrific cast, beginning with the great and talented english actress Clare Higgins. Good part of "The Exorcist" quality resides in the cast's dramatic and true actings (to begin with young Linda Blair,who was nominated by the Academy for her role) and to the great special effects, that even have been done through simple and old techniques, surprise and help to show the exorcism's scenes in a faithful and raw form."The Exorcist" is not a film recommended for sensitive people. This great public and critic's success had two inferior continuations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary on a psychological level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie two times. The first time six years ago when I was sixteen years old. I had nightmares for a week. I had only heard that it was scary and didn't know anything else about it (being Swedish, I of course knew that Max von Sydow had a part in it), so it *did* scare me. It isn't scary in the special effects 'body-parts are flying'-kind of way or anything, it's scary on a psychological level which is a thing I don't think people who say that this isn't a scary movie can see. They obviously wants more blood and maimed bodies. This is horror with *class*. More of a Silence of the Lambs-"scariness".However, I have now seen it a second time and I have to say that I don't find it as scary as I did when I was sixteen. But it is still a great movie and didn't William Peter Blatty say that he based his book on an article he had read as a student about an exorcism that the Catholic church *had* allowed for a young boy. I don't know if that's true, but if the Catholic church allows an exorcism then it must be... serious.Great and intense movie. I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist is a brilliant horror classic, from bestselling author William Peter Blatty, who scripted. The movie stars Linda Blair as a young girl, who is possessed by the devil. Her mother who's an actress, doesn't find this out, till she finds her bed shaking and moving by herself. Then after awhile, she becomes looking almost like a demon. Her mother, enlists the help of a young priest, who tries to talk to Regan (Blair) and get the demon out of her. Instead she also terroizes him, driving all of them out of her bedroom. They live in an apartment, to which has become legendary now, and the demon is trying to make Regan do stuff she doesn't, hurt even kill people. The pea-soup regurgitation scene is the best, and has become a memorable and famous scene, of the whole horror genre. The voice over is done by Mercedes McCaimbridge (extremely creepy), and some spectacular make-up effects. The acting, is also very well-done, with an extremely well-acted role by young Blair. Everyone else in the film, also does a great job. Although this isn't a movie for everyone because of the whole possessing thing, I do think, everyone who even if they don't like horror will like this. I must say, I was impressed with this film, even dealing with the Devil, you won't be offended or anything. The ending finale, is very intense, as is the whole entire movie, which will keep your stomach in knots from beginning to end. See it it's a classic. A 10. Rated R for violence, language, and brief sexuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Horror Film Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undeniably, "The Exorcist" is the greatest horror film ever made! It gets better with each viewing! This is the only horror film that has not only scared me out of my wits, but it also provoked me and the audience. There will never be a better horror film! It's too bad Linda Blair got typecast (similar to Bela Lugosi", but I don't think she cares that much. Her amazing performance as Regan makes other actresses look wussy by comparison! And the imagery used to envoke the idea of evil, still manage to make me shudder. I'll never forget Father Merrin staring at the statue of the Devil in the desert. It says that the Devil, or the Evil, is really the ultimate beast or the monster. It is something we will all have to face at one point in our lives. Plus, despite what others may interpret, it has a triumphant ending! The evil is exorcised and killed by Father Karras, while sacrificing his own life. The devil wanted Karra, and yet, he did not succeed, because Karras took his life with him. This idea was stolen by "The Devil's Advocate", and some other movies. No matter, just get this on a dark, stormy night, and be scared out of your wits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prototype "blockbuster" a dazzling cinema achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That The Exorcist is among the most imitated films of its kind should be evidence enough of its lasting power and value as a motion picture experience. But what so many of those pretenders fail to offer is what Exorcist expert Mark Kermode points out in his BFI study and the 1998 documentary that accompanied the "special edition" DVD release of the film: Blatty and Friedkin made a movie that intelligently and thoughtfully examined possibilities that no person, atheist or believer, wants to imagine -- that something evil could desecrate and profane the most basic and precious commodities of our lives: the home and the child. If you are only after cheap thrills, ignore The Exorcist, since what you will find here is a movie that requires you to think about the nature of good and evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film that is truly frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is a film that works on many levels. It has scared audiences for 25 years and they still come back for more. Nowadays we have films that give us a good jump, but The Exorcist has something that those films don't have, a true sense of dread. The film has its moments of "boo!" The vomit shot or the head turning, but what you really remember from the film is the sound and the imagery. Early in the film when Father Merrin visits a temple in Iraq, he confronts the statue of a demon. Below him are dogs fighting, as he stares into the statue the dogs sounds become distorted and grotesque. They don't sound like dogs anymore. The voice of the Devil haunts you for days after viewing the film. So full of malice and vulgarities, it would be comical if deep in your mind you could separate the voice from the face. Put them together, and you'll still be making sure your windows and doors are locked tightly. The final thing that follows you around is the ghost white face that appears in Father Karras' dream and in the exorcism of the Devil from Regan. It only appears for a second, but that face lingers with you. It is not grotesque, but it is evil. And it will haunt you, just watch the exorcism scene. Karras looks the Devil in the eye, and you can see his face over Regan's. It is not a face you will soon forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Next to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this is the most frightening movie I've ever seen. I saw it when I was 14 and I couldn't sleep or eat pea soup for a week. Some very vivid cinematography and graphic demonic imagery make this a movie not to watch alone in the dark. An excellent, but scary piece of movie making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evocative and definitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films have as much of an emotional impact on viewers as The Exorcist. The film certainly is frightening, but it goes so much beyond that in a strictly horror film sense of that word. The film is oppressive and makes viewers feel hopeless, which is why it is perhaps the ultimate example of good triumphing evil in film. Upon multiple viewings, I'm mainly struck by how effective the introduction is and by how resonant Burstyn and Blair are together in their tender moments together in the beginning. One of the reason this film transcends the horror genre is because of how rich the characters are, coupled with the incredible performances. Also, I was realizing how easily this film could have been almost laughably ridiculous in the wrong hands, but thanks to Friedkin's directing, it somehow works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie defines the meaning of being possessed, where teenage girl Regan (Linda Blair) is being controlled by a mysterious supernatural being. As a result, her mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) desperately seeks the help of two priests to save her daughter.This is an iconic and great piece of horror cinema with a lot of tension and thrills, from Regan acting bizarre and displaying out-of-character behavior to her being fully controlled by the demon, while her mother watches helplessly. The scenes where the priests, in a fit of frenzy and determination, try to save the uncontrollable Regan from the unholy creature will give you a frightening, yet edge-of-your-seat excitement.Filled with great acting, spectacular make-up, and a good dose of horror mixed in with tense, spiritual drama, this is a must-see for any horror movie fans.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most disturbing experience I've ever had</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is a terrifying, shocking and well acted film by William Friedkin. This is horror at its finest and an incredibly disturbing experience. It was very upsetting to see this sweet innocent girl slowly turn into the devil itself. Another interesting aspect is how the mother desperately seeks for help, trying all possible alternatives for a cure before finally reaching out for the priest and consider the exorcism as an option. There are different kinds of scares in this film and that's what I really appreciated here. Not only we have shocking moments where the possessed girl does horrendous and disgusting things, but there is also plenty of creepy subliminal imagery that really sticks with you while you're watching it. This is an extremely powerful horror film and certainly hasn't lost any of its impact over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Horror Movie of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie a couple of years ago I had to turn it off because I crapped my pants, but now i've watched it I can now admire it but at the same time fear it. Winner of 2 Oscars and has been called the Godfather of all Horror movies this is truly one of the scariest and greatest movies of all time. The acting is fantastic and the storyline of the movie is just pitch perfect. I couldn't believe my eyes watching some of the brilliant special effects, even though it was made 40 years ago. Let's face it a lot of great movies came out in the 70s and the effects weren't as good as they are today, but they some how amazingly the effects were fantastic and one of the highlights of the movie. It has been called the scariest movie of all time and to be honest I can see why because I don't scare easily. A lot of jump scares and lasting scares (which I explained about in my review of The Conjuring 2013)and the scares are well timed and made out brilliantly. Now hear me out DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE ALONE or you will be sleeping with the lights on your the rest of your life.'scream out loud' scares and shocks at times when you expect and least-expect it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Legendary Work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked on the top 250 list on this site and found that this masterpiece is down around the 200 mark. Either people are idiots, or they have been accidentally hitting the wrong number of stars.This movie is a Horror classic and among many it is considered the best ever. The story is an actress's young daughter becomes possessed by an evil spirit, after seeing the girl a charismatic young Priest, who at times questions his own faith, enlists the help of an Exorcist to save the child. This is one of the scariest movies of all time. DO NOT WATCH THE EDITED FOR TV VERSION. It is in no way close to the chilling original. In it's day this was a masterful, ground breaking, controversial movie, with its portrayal of the possessed child (Linda Blair) spouting all sorts of obscenities as her head spun around shooting pea soup out of her mouth.This movie has often been imitated but never really matched. The sequels were fairly bad but the original still stands the test of time today. This is a work of art!Like my reviews? Hate em? Comments, or want a particular DVD reviewed?

		<fullReview>"Now, I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter, except in her mind. You tell me for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good. You tell me that!"Definitely one of the most well-crafted horror movies that I've seen. Lots of time is given to developing the characters and atmosphere, which leads to a pretty fantastic payoff in the end. There's a clear sense of expert care taken with every aspect of the movie; there are no slapdash efforts or cut corners, from the script to the acting to the music. This story of young girl who may be possessed by a demonic entity is full of shocking imagery, but never once feels exploitative. The themes of doubt, faith, and sacrifice are clear, but not the least bit heavy-handed. The practical special effects are still impressive today, so I can only imagine the impact they had back in 1973.&nbsp;Frightening, disturbing, and ultimately, even a bit uplifting. The Exorcist is one of those classic movies that's still just as good today, and that every horror buff should see.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The exorcist, best horror movie ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist, considered as 'the scariest movie ever' by a large number of people. This gives a lot of expectations about what The Exorcist should be. Especially for someone born after the film. We love The Exorcist, we have seen a lot of horror films but we consider The Exorcist as the best horror film. I first heard about an exorcist on TV, I became curious about what it was and looked on the internet. While I was searching on the internet I found out that there was a movie about it, The Exorcist. I bought the movie, watched it and learned more about an exorcist. The Exorcist starts with a group of people searching for artifacts in Iraq, the archaeologist father Merrin finds a small stone resembling a strange grimacing, bestial creature. Some strange events happen and Merrin thinks he has brought something evil in the world. Far away, in Georgetown Chris Macneil (an actress) hears strange noises in her house and strange things happen with her daughter (Regan). She changes from a nice and cute girl into a girl whom hates everyone and curses all day long. One time on a party she pees, in front of some people, on the ground. Chris goes to the doctor but they can't find what is wrong. Meanwhile, Father Damien Karras a young priest at Georgetown University doubts his religion when his mother dies from a terminal illness. Chris Macneil thinks her daughter is possessed by the devil. When all medical explanations are exhausted, a doctor recommends an exorcism, suggesting that if Regan's symptoms are a psychosomatic result of a belief in demonic possession, then perhaps an exorcism would have the effect of ending them. In desperation, Chris consults Karras, since he is both a priest and a psychiatrist. During a period in which Karras observes Regan, she constantly refers to herself as the devil. Karras initially believes her to be merely suffering from psychosis, until he records her speaking in a strange language which turns out to be English spoken backwards. Despite his doubts, Karras decides to request permission from the Church to conduct an exorcism. The same father Merrin who found the strange creature is an experienced exorcist, he comes to Georgetown and together with father Karras they conduct an exorcism. The spirit taunts and threatens the two priests both verbally and physically (he uses the voice of Karras his mother to frighten him). Father Merrin eventually gets a heart attack and dies, father Karras succeeds in driving out the spirit from Regan's body. He absorbs the spirit himself and throws himself out of the window, he dies and the spirit leaves. Chris leaves Georgetown with her daughter and leaves the trauma behind.I think the movie was very good, especially for that time (1973). The special effects were good, example of that is; the scene where Regan comes down the stairs like a spider. The film was very good constructed and formed for that time, it was a new type of genre in the film industry, it was the beginning of horror in the film history and it was and still is one of the best horror films ever made.The storyline of the movie was also good. You get a good impression of how it happened and you can really find yourself in the movie. The film maker wanted the people to really think about the film and used good techniques for this. He gave the characters a lot of emotion and made the movie sad in some aspects, of course the main sad part is about Regan, but also father Karras is very sad because he lost his mother. This made the movie better and it helped to keep the watcher's attention throughout the film.In conclusion, you could say that The Exorcist is a really good film for the time it was made and still is a very good film. It is the base of any horror film and helped the genre to develop. I would really recommend the film to you, because you will be entertained throughout the film. The filmmaker used good techniques to keep the watcher attracted and made the movie scarier which is the principal of a good horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a "fright night" a few months back where me and my girlfriend would watch a bunch of scary movies. So neither of us had seen The Exorcist and watched it. Wow, very raw and gritty, even for today so I can't imagine how they took it back in the 70s. When she started masterbating with the cross, I think I said "holy crap" out loud. The special effects were good. It seemed a bit slow at times and I really didn't quite grasp the opening desert scene, but fairly solid movie. Not a fan of tragic or unexplained endings, and this one had both, but still a good movie and would recommend it to anyone else having a fright night of their own.</fullReview>

I did a little trivia research and although the director did an amazing job, I can't help but wonder what Stanly Kubrick could have done if he had accepted the picture.This film is pure horror and a large part of that is due to all the effects and makeup. Linda Blair goes from a cute little girl to a figure that will haunt my dreams days after watching this film. The effects made this movie so much more memorable with the head turning, body floating, and the famous pea soup vomit scene.This film is an iconic masterpiece that needs to be viewed at least once a year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is truly terrifying about this movie is not the effects of the pea soup, or the make-up of Linda Blair, but the unknown. What the person doesn't know will terrify them. In this movie, the characters do not know what is haunting them, and therefore make it more difficult for them to fight it. Amazing acting from 10 year old Linda Blair. The act of possession alone is terrifying, but to hear an innocent 10 year old girl swear and curse they way she did as well as speak and use the cross the way she did was much more terrifying than any effect or make-up. After watching other horror movies, this movie did not scare me as much in effects, especially the scene were Reagan's head spun all the way around. Because I live in a world where any special effect is perfect and flawless, it did not affect me as it did with the people viewing it in the theaters for the first time. Extremely haunting movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Excorcist Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horror flick you can actually call scary. It entails both religious themes, as well natural psychological focus in order to evoke reaction from viewers, making it a truly horrific display of demonic forces. Linda Blair, only a 12 year old actress plays dual roles, playing the innocent and soon to be the vessel of the very demon who she becomes. He claims to be the devil, when all he proves in the eyes of the doubtful Father Karras (Miller) that he is in fact a demon. To shine over the light of confusion on viewers, the Demons name is Pazuzu. This all becomes clear in the very odd, but still silently suspenseful introduction, as Father Merrin's discovery of certain artifacts points into the direction of that very monsters arrival. The discovery of a few small little statues resembling the beast, thus leading him to the very statue resembling Pazuzu. He probably knew it, but could not act enough to find him. His only option seemed to be to rely on the patience of waiting, hoping that in time he'd once again face this demon. In the time it took for the Exorcist to prepare, the demon preyed well, poisoning the mind as well as the very actions of his latest victim, Regan MacNeil. Regan, a sweet 12 year old, with little possibility of any evil lurking with in, has astonished her mother Chris (Burstyn), time and time again in the wake of this new persona. The awkward silence, blasphemes towards others, and the powerfully vibrating bed all pointing to various medical explanations. Doctors call it a lesion, a Psychiatrist will call it a spilt personality, others will simply call it an overreaction to her depression towards her absent father. A very desperate mother seeks answer after answer, only to feel more doubt, and less hope as she finds failure in every option given to her. In desperation and own reluctance towards locking her child up, Chris turns to exorcism, begging for the help of Father Karras, a priest/shrink who's own faith has been going down the drain slowly in the wake of his own losses. At first the Father doubts this persona to be demonic, only to learn more of this monsters true clarification as he witnesses the supernatural aspects of Regan's tormentor. Green vomit, a chilling room brought on by the demon's very presence, and a talent of various languages. The film's title character the Exorcist arrives upon the wake of his presence, giving believers and non believers out there a showdown worth shouting, "Holy Mother of God". Father Merrin, having experience in this very ritual, as well as being personally known by the demon, lashes every religious weapon lethal to the creature. A combination of holy water and uninterrupted prayers drive the demon to feeling excruciating pain, giving the hope that the very power of Christ can compel this so called devil, and save this servant of God. Alas that is not our end, because everything in life comes with sacrifices surprising both the good and the bad. Regan's life is spared, but at the cost of a sickly old man, and priest who's faith is further restored as he takes her curse, only to end it all in his own suicide, dying with both dignity and with the hope of forgiveness for his own trespasses. "The Exorcist" can be called many things, inspiring, horrifying, disgusting, disrespectful, and even maybe contradicting, however what makes it genuine is the very authenticity of its characters. As well as the haunting tone of it's direction, particularly in it's lead character Chris, as the mother of a girl who has become all but a complete stranger in her eyes, as she witnesses the demonic possession of her young child. I have to say though, by the performance of Linda Blair, I was both shocked and impressed at how she could just revert from the very innocence and charm that defines Regan, and then reverting to the very impure persona that defines the Satan wannabe demon. What makes the movie itself different from most horror flicks is, that it focuses it's inspiration of horror on the religious elements of God and demonic possession. It isn't afraid to show viewers just how impure the demon towards challenging the idea of God and his eternal love for us all, thus having the conclusion serve as both an inspiration of Gods own mysteriously sacred will towards the forces of evil. This film can also be considered a test for it's viewers in the lessons of comparing the concepts of actual demonic possession, and medically explainable psychiatry, giving us the chance to not only tell them apart with our own instincts, but with also our own belief in the forces outside science.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the best horror movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: **** out of 4.THE EXORCIST is still one of the best horror movies ever made, not because it's still "The Scariest Movie Ever" made as its now famous tagline suggests, but because it expresses the horror not present in most genre efforts today. Horror nowadays is misinterpreted as mere shock and scares, but some of the best horror movies out there are really about far greater horrors: The horrors of life, be it guilt, grief, or the simple study of fear.Despite the film's success, its director William Friedkin felt that the movie was misunderstood because he didn't really intend the movie to be an outright horror outing. He wanted to make a movie about faith; about the belief not just in God and The Devil but in what good and evil really is. Today, more open-minded moviegoers will look at the film as much more than a scare show or as a movie that turned pea soup into the most disgusting and horrifying special effect ever. Many will audiences will focus more on the story of its lead characters than its roller-coaster ride of gruesome special effects (although that was one of the reasons why the movie was memorable). The story of Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn, in an exceptional performance) in trying to restore her faith when her daughter Regan (Linda Blair, in the role that made her a star) goes out of the ordinary in her behaviour. Doctors throw in their theories of mental illness while a priest named Damien Karras (Jason Miller) believes that the Devil is within her.This is an even more intriguing film about the battle between good and evil and about faith in both than it is an outright horror movie. The performances are terrific, especially by Max von Sydow who only appears briefly on screen but is able to show his importance to the story. The creepy voice provided by Mercedes McCambridge (which was probably the one that got the Oscar's attention, but in the end actress Linda Blair got the nomination for her "physical" performance of Regan) is memorable. Even some the film's shock effects have more potent power than the usual shock-for-shock-sakes moments in most recent horror movies. Now THIS is how horror movies are done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie. Its a brilliantly intense and visceral experience. Pay no attention to the lame publicity that surrounds this film. Things that try to enhance the scares. "THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE". This is all stupid crap designed to force feed you the idea that this is the most frightening movie of all time. Its not. It's a very good and very intense film but don't believe the hype. It will only scare you if you believe in the subject matter, if not it'll still provide a worthwhile experience. This film took guts to make. Considering the fact that this was a major studio film, it has balls. The things that happen in this film hit you like a ton of bricks. The scene with the crucifix or the scene with the statue of the virgin Mary are enough to leave almost anyone's jaw dropped in shock. The camera work is great, it leaves a lot of stuff out of frame and up to the imagination. The lighting is great because sometimes it doesn't try to obscure the scary images with shadows, it shows you the horror in natural light. It enhances the world in which this film takes place. It feels real. The acting is solid, you have some really Oscar worthy performances in a horror film. Everything comes together perfectly in this film to create a solid horror experience. It's a horror movie that feels like a character drama that feels like a horror movie...if that makes sense</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intriguing And Thought-Provoking Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having viewed this movie many times over the years in various forms, and reading many reviews both negative and positive, I felt compelled to share my own views.Firstly, in my opinion it is incorrect to categorize this movie in the "horror" genre. Granted the events that occur in the movie are disturbing and downright scary at times, but to me the classic "horror" movie formula consists of gratuitous slicing and dicing with a one-dimensional plot. And while some of these movies can be enjoyed superficially, The Exorcist delves deeper and attempts to unsettle the viewer on a more psychological level. Willam Peter Blatty's script is based on a true story from an incident in 1949, and is a true masterpiece of creativity and imagination showing the effects these events would have on a normal family. When compared with today's modern releases, his writing style shows the inadequacies of today's movie script writers.Due to the fact this movie has been available to watch for so many years, the majority of people reading these reviews would have seen it in some form or another, so I don't feel it's necessary to document the storyline yet again.The slow pacing of the movie is extremely important, which of course goes against the conventions of current cinema releases. This is one of the points that draws the most criticism from the modern audience, most of which may have only seen the movie once, possibly twice. The exorcism scenes at the end move along fairly rapidly, and the manner in which the first half on the movie is paced is necessary to establish the "normal" surroundings of Regan and her mother. This gives the movie credibility rather than a slow pace, and the necessary violent and graphic scenes are crafted into the script perfectly by Blatty, rather than an incoherent blood-fest which seems to be the norm these days for movies now classified in this genre (again I still don't believe The Exorcist should be classified as "horror", but unfortunately in this day and age, everything needs a category).I first viewed a heavily edited TV version of this movie in my early teens, and still found it disturbing, but highly intriguing. After viewing an uncut version years later, it still had a similar impact. Again modern audiences now feel the need to apply a "scare factor" to any material that is classed as "horror", and due to the fact there was no CGI in 1973, they instantly dismiss the older effect techniques as dated, or laughable. If you are paying that much attention to the effects and not the storyline of the movie itself, then you are bound to have an extremely insular and limited understanding of what an intelligent movie actually is.Linda Blair is exceptional as Regan in the lead role, and from all accounts, this movie took it's toll on her and other members of the extended cast. The results show on screen, and William Friedkin did an outstanding job constructing some of the most memorable scenes and imagery to ever grace the big screen.Having viewed both versions many times now, I still prefer the original in most respects. The new ending is a source of constant debate, again I feel the original ending was much more appropriate to the overall direction of the movie. Having said that, the Spider Walk scene was a welcome addition.Overall, this is an extremely intriguing and thought-provoking movie, and some of the imagery will stay with the viewer years after first watching it. This will always be one of my favourite movies, and is unfortunately extremely underrated by many modern viewers today.</fullReview>

'The Exorcist' is about a young girl dealing with the demonic possession and her mother's desperate attempts to win back her daughter through an exorcism conducted by two priests respectively.William Friedkin is a proficient storyteller, and his body of work proves that. 'The Exorcist' is his finest attempt as a storyteller and observer. More than being a horror cult-favorite, it's a film that questions our beliefs and disbelief's. It has an outstanding start, middle &amp; end.Linda Blair's portrayal as a possessed soul, is exemplary. A legendary performance that not only haunts you, but also makes you empathize the person suffering within. Ellen Burstyn is superb as the desperate/shattered mother. Jason Miller is fabulous in his part.On the whole, This Truly is Hallmark Cinema! An Outstanding Cinematic Achievement! Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist: It's Fine, But Far From Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regularly labelled as the scariest film of all time, and considered by many to be the best, the infamous stories surrounding the release of The Exorcist and the reactions of its audiences ensure an impressive reputation precedes the viewing of this classic.Concerning 12 year old Regan MacNeil, the film details her possession at the hands of the demon Pazuzu. After the subsequent psychiatric and medical treatments prove useless, her mother arranges an exorcism, hiring two priests to drive the demon from her daughter's body.With such a reputation, I was either going to be disappointed, or discover a film I would love. Sadly, the former was the case. Good performances compliment the film, an interesting concept and storyline give it a solid foundation, but it just turned out to be overrated. It features an interesting and compelling theme, and one I see most effectively in the character of Father Karras. His was the plot line I was most interested in, and one which I feel was particularly well developed, Jason Miller giving a wonderfully stoic depth of emotion to his character. In the end, I certainly enjoyed the film, but it was nothing to the reputation it enjoys. Certain scenes seemed rather unnecessarily violent and inappropriate and included simply for the shock value, detracting from the film's effect and making me question its true intentions. It may be the case that the film has not aged particularly well, and I do wish I had seen it on its initial release, but as I did see it, it did little for me beyond a standard quantity of entertainment.The Exorcist supports itself for its running time, its thematic shadow lingering throughout. Father Karras is the film's best facet, but he's not enough in himself, leaving the film somewhat unbalanced. In short, it's fine, but far from brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This horror film about a girl possessed by the devil became a box office blockbuster. The acting is pretty good and Friedkin creates a chilling atmosphere. However, the story is quite silly. It is not so much a horror film as an exercise in gross effects, with pea soup playing a prominent role. In fact, some of Blair's antics are more comical than scary. The expository scenes are not very interesting, and the prologue in Iraq, while well filmed, does not fit in with the rest of the film. The plot has some holes, and even if one accepts the premise of possession, there is no logic to someone turning her head 360 degrees without dying. It's simply cheap thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but pretty flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after all these year, I finally got around to seeing this picture, to see what all the fuss was about.What I found was, it was a pretty good horror movie, but nothing all that outstanding. There was a lot of good stuff, but some pretty bad flaws too. There seemed to be an *awful* lot of extraneous stuff in the movie that should've been just left out, to make a tighter story. For instance, what was up with that whole opening scene in Iraq? What did that have to do with *anything*? Yeah, it provided a little exposition on the exorcist character, but not really that much, and by the time the dogs are barking and the weird guy is staring at him, the whole thing starts to make no sense and asks more questions than it answers. Or the prolonged story about the shrink-priest's mother, that seemed to be done in vastly more detail than was warranted for its importance to the story. Or, really, the *entire* character of the cop, which ends up going nowhere. And I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out the relevance of the drunk guy making Nazi accusations.There's also a fundamental problem here of motive. What on *earth* was the demon trying to accomplish by possessing the girl? With the power that the demon clearly possessed, you'd think it could've found better ways to cause havoc or do evil or whatever the heck its goal was, than just by tormenting a little girl and her family. That thing could've caused trouble on a vastly larger scale than that! And I still can't really find any method to its madness. First clanking around in the attic, what did that accomplish? Then taking a LONG time to possess the little girl, why the painfully slow approach, when he was able to take over the priest instantaneously? (yeah, the priest invited him in, but still. The girl was pretty much helpless to resist) In short, the demon's character is very badly contrived; it conveniently does whatever will lead to a gradual build-up of suspense and shock in the film for the convenience of the director, rather than having any logical or consistent motive for what it was doing.Still, while rather slow in developing, it did hold my interest, and I did care about the outcome, and it was pretty creepy, if not exactly terrifying. Again, a pretty good horror flick, but no great masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest Movie Ever Made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born in 1972, a year before they released the movie, and I was about 13 years old when I first saw the rated ''made for TV'' version of The Exorcist. Although I had watched many movies about possession and haunting - which have always been my favorite - I had never seen anything like it. So revealing and sincere, yet incredibly disturbing, completely destabilizing. The truth is, it almost made me sick! At one point, I even thought I could never ever watch that movie again in my life. I thought the movie was simply... intolerable! Many years later, I finally got to see the unrated ''Never Seen Before'' version of the film. The one thing even more interesting about this edition - and way beyond the uncut extra scenes - is the audio commentary by Director William Friedkin. To this day, and after viewing more movies on the subject, I am still amazed, fascinated and profoundly touched by The Exorcist. And while the 1971 novel is a pure enchantment, the screenplay is a masterpiece: an incursion into the human fragility and innocence, a journey into people's most inner fears. Not to mention the cast and locations, which are absolutely perfect. Scariest movie ever made? To my own and personal opinion, the best, for sure. And yes, definitely intolerable! Gee, I'm glad I survived it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best horror movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1971, William Peter Blatty's novel "The Exorcist" was published and soon became a bestseller. Shortly thereafter, Blatty (who also worked as a screenwriter) adapted his own novel for the movie of the same name. In the capable hands of William Friedkin, the movie became a box office phenomenon that also managed to garner 10 Oscar nominations (resulting in two wins).The story (which was inspired by actual events) concerns a teenage girl whose personality undergoes a transition that suggests the onset of a mental disorder. However, her symptoms intensify to such a degree that demonic possession seems to be the only possible explanation. After exhausting all conventional avenues, the girl's mother desperately implores the church to aid her in performing an exorcism.Besides being particularly scary, "The Exorcist" is also dramatically powerful. The story is presented in a realistic way with finely drawn characters whom we can empathize with. The Oscar-winning script is vague enough to be mysterious without obscuring the narrative, while also inviting multiple interpretations.It must be said that the acting is well above average for a horror film. I was particularly impressed by Jason Miller as Father Karras. The always reliable Ellen Burstyn also delivered an excellent performance. Both were rewarded with Oscar nominations, as was young Linda Blair, whose performance was enhanced by some memorable voice work from Mercedes McCambridge. Max Von Sydow's relatively small role as the titular exorcist is also iconic.Another reason why this film rises above others of its kind is the direction of William Friedkin. Not only is it technically impressive, it also shows a deep understanding of the building and maintaining of suspense. The editing &amp; cinematography also deserve high praise.The fact that the film won an Oscar for Best Sound is no surprise since the sound design here is truly outstanding. The soundtrack is also well done, famously featuring Mike Oldfield's "Tubular Bells" along with some well-chosen classical music.On a final note, it's debatable as to whether or not this is 'the scariest movie of all time', as Warner Bros. is wont to claim. That doesn't mean that it's not a great movie; I'm just saying that although it is arguably the best all-around horror movie of all time that doesn't necessarily make it the scariest.By the way, these comments are based on the original version of the film. 'The Version You've Never Seen' is worth watching as well but I feel that the original cut is slightly more cohesive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's About Faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time in my life like 4 years ago, the afternoon of Halloween. It was a hard experience, i was only 12. In spite of that, this was a unforgettable experience who makes me ask to myself. William Peter Blatty's "The Exorcist" was and is promoted as the "Scariest Movie of all Time!", and yes, is one of the scariest movies that anyone can see, but not in the way that much horror films make you fright, the real scary thing is about the spiritual, the good and evil, is about your believes.The story is about Damien Karras, a middle aged priest who live a life full of questioning, but he have some doubts about his believes and his life. For other side is the famous actress Chris MacNeil, who lives a divorced life with her child Regan. Something weird is happening to Regan. Her behave is a novelty, she never said bad and incoherent words. Never make strange moves and never feel harassed. Is she getting crazy? She needs a doctor? She needs a operation? I she possessed? ... Her mother don't think this things ... but something is happening and is really serious.Much who have live in that time or love horror films knows about this one. This film, although, is exclusive in the horror genre, because this movie not have the typical horror (Of course that have some gores and disturbing scenes) but is the meaning that give you the scare and disturbs you, at least for a little while, and this is the reason of why "The Exorcist" is a must see. The movie develops each character in a psychological and spiritual way. The scare is their same frights, they same fears. Damien Karras have a spiritual problem, and this is develop more to any fact that happen in his life (The death of his mother, the solitude, the supernatural and question about good and evil), this is one of the most important characters (Even more than Regan). Is of course the mother of Regan (Fabolous Ellen Burstyn, if you remembered her in "Requiem for a Dream") and the conflict of religion, she don't believe in God, but doesn't matter of that, she needs help. Is of course Regan MacNeill (Outstanding Linda Blair who appear then in spoof "Reposessed" ) the center of the attention, where their action of possessed offers us a view of the evil represented in a body possessed by a supernatural force. And at least is Father Merrin, who is another perspective of view of religion and believes, that too reflects in Father Karras. Each of their feelings are essentials to understand, and most of all, feel this movie.Is the fight of good vs. evil without mercy, as is in real life, of course that "The Exorcist" is about supernatural, but that is th question of believe in God or not. Believe in the devil or not. There is evil in the human beens, but is very worth to watch a supernatural view, that, of course, is the topic of much horror films, but here is an encounter between reality and fantasy, can you noted this in the views of Karras and Chris thoughts. And of course there is the religion, but Please! ,note that this is not a religious film is a spiritual film, the religion subject is another fact that is necessary to analyze as a Cultural phenomenon, but you have to know that the Religion represents faith and believes too. Is for this that "The Exorcist" is a great must see movie. You don't have to love horror films to love this. It's a spiritual as disturbing experience that you never going to forget."The Exorcist" was a phenomenon in 1973 as in it's re-premier in 2000 and undoubtedly, going to cause the same effect, not for a long time ... Always going to be remembered. After its original release, the film begin with 2 sequels ("The heretic" but that was just a waste of time and "The Exorcits3" that was in a big part, better that "The Heretic" of course), the third sequel was "The Beginning", a prequel for the original film. And the success covers too in comedy field with marvelous, misunderstood "Reposessed", with the same Linda Blair as a possessed married woman (This film is essential although you don't believe it, for Linda. This was an scape for the suffering that this movie made to her, maybe you heard about the this phenomenon affect too to it's young actress. She was damned for a long time named as a sick child, but you think again, Linda was very prepared for its character and "Reposessed" was a scape for her, a way to laugh out the devil and all the suffering that she lives in her adolescence).This is not a film of fun, is a poetic but hard and disturbing which going to puncture you in your hide fears, and going to makes you wonder about your believes. You could find more disgusting films with more gore effects, but this is a horror film that, besides of scare you, that scare is a fear about question and believes.*Sorry for the mistakes ...well, if there any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A winner in any version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: In any version available, THE EXORCIST maintains tension, shocks and indisputable drama. Even famous horror icons of today like "The Ring", "The Grudge" and even the prequel "Exorcist:The Beginning" is inept to "The Exorcist". Even through all this years, even in these times where "horror" means more gore than story, it's still very convincing.The Performances are excellent. Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb and Jason miller give performances that deeply highlights the story's essence. But Linda Blair is the real star of the show as the possessed girl of the story, a role that she will be deeply remembered.The script is well pressed into William Peter Blatty's superb novel. While William Friedkin directs with great talent and creativity.This film really deserves its title as the "scariest movie of all time.". "The Exorcist" really deserves to be the highest-rated movie in the horror genre.The film is either distributed on DVD on a restored original format or the "Version You've Never Seen". But in any way, both versions sum up an excellent movie that has, well, words hardly can explain.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After nearly 35 years,"The Exorcist" still remains the scariest and the most shocking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no questioning about it.No ifs ands or buts.This film belongs in horror film history.I first experienced a scene from this film back around nineteen seventy nine.That scene terrified me.Twenty years it took me to watch this film straight through without blocking my eyes.I have no trouble watching the film now.But I still think of this film as the scariest in film history.We all know what the film is about and we all seen it a thousand times over the past thirty years.Copied by other films such as "Beyond the Door" and the awful "The Antichrist","The Exorcist" has not lost its power to shock due to the cinematography.Its documentary film style seems to add a sense of realism to the film.The special effects are as unique now as they were around thirty years ago.This is the ultimate in cinematic horror.Director William Friedkin's power is that once he goes to far,he doesn't stop.He keeps going.The film is also effective because we get to know the characters rather than go straight to the scares."The Exorcist" begins as a humanizing experience and then we are lured into a nightmarish experience.It's kind of like the film is happening to us.There is no mistake about this film."The Exorcist" pulls no punches and may victimize some film goers.A horror film is a horror film."The Exorcist" is not only a horror film.It is a reminder to us all of what fear means to us.A classic in the horror genre,"The Exorcist" doesn't just frighten,it disturbs on a high level.I respect this film and still believe this to be the scariest film ever made.Perhaps more frightening then I can imagine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Classic - Sleep With The Lights On!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The all-time classic tale of demonic possession, based on William Peter Blatty's bestselling novel. Linda Blair is Regan MacNeil, a twelve-year-old girl who becomes manifested by a truly malevolent spirit. Her mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), an agnostic, seeks out help from a young Jesuit psychiatrist, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, God rest his Irish soul!)who has demons of his own, and is tormented by the recent death of his mother, and his loss in the faith that he sought refuge in. After confronting the demon within the girl (and himself), Karras, although skeptical of demonic possession, is given permission by the church to assist during the exorcism. The priest selected to perform the ritual is a mysterious, elderly Jesuit, Father Lankaster Merrin (Max Von Sydow) who has seen such devilish work before. As the two clergymen face off against the demon, a police detective, Lt. William F. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) finds some links connecting the girl with a puzzling death and desecration in the local Catholic church.William Friedkin brilliantly directed, and Blatty adapted the screenplay (receiving an Oscar for his efforts) and produced. The cast gives extraordinary, sensitive performances (Burstyn, Miller and Blair were all nominated for Academy Awards) and the special effects are breathtaking and still pack a punch, with veteran actress Mercedes McCambridge providing the voice of the evil entity. (The film also won for Best Achievement In Sound). The underlying theme of much of Blatty's work is evident, his philosophy being, if there's all this evil out there, why is there so much good? Metaphorically, everyone fights there own demons, and even in his last self-sacrificing moment, Karras finds his faith again and heroically gives his life to save this innocent child. How more meaningful can it be? A truly terrifying, engrossing and ultimately touching film dealing with faith and human frailty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain scenes in "The Exorcist" that have a great power to them (the exorcism itself is a masterful set-piece) and others that are a bit shaky (including the drunk, unfunny director cracking Nazi jokes in the presence of a German butler); but overall, it is a film that mines genuine fear from a pervasive sense of vulnerability. In dealing with the possession of a young girl (Linda Blair) by an unseen, inexplicable force, we feel as if nothing is safe, therefore making the potential of horror that much greater. I suppose the story is probably the most familiar in the annals of horror at this point, but to recap: actress Chris MacNeil's (Ellen Burstyn) daughter, Regan (Blair) comes under the spell of a vile, vulgar demon (at one point implied to be the Devil itself), and when the most well-paid psychiatrists and doctors come up clueless, the Catholic ritual of exorcism is suggested. While the performances of Burstyn and Blair aren't revelatory (Chris often seems like an overly dramatic starlet in need of a Xanax, and Regan is confined to heavy make-up), the thread of plot dealing with Damien Karras (the Gabriel Byrne-ish Jason Miller), a priest who suffers the death of his mother and is afraid he's losing his faith, adds a believable, consequential depth to the tale--the visible doubt he conveys during the exorcism finale (alongside the brilliant Max von Sydow) makes the tension resonate on a higher level. "The Exorcist" is cerebral, plausible, and compelling...in my book, it may not be 'the scariest movie of all time,' but it unlocks an undeniably gripping fear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist is by far a film that is taken in the wrong way. I am someone who has the highest respect possible for a film like this. A lot of people in my age gap which is 18 to 21 really don't like The Exorcist. They say that they laugh at it more than like it at all. I can't see why anybody would want to laugh at this. I am not trying to be really delicate and serious but this is a story which can happen and has happened in the past. It starts off brilliantly with Max Von Sydow on his dig. When first watching this I was quite surprised by it as I didn't really understand what was going on. Because of all the hype that the film received I expected to see projectile vomiting straight away but it doesn't really kick off till the last 25 minutes of the film. For the first hone hour and a half we get to see this story unfold into it's huge climax. What makes this film amazing is it's question of faith and belief. They could have easily made a whole film about the shenanigans behind the scenes of what happened to a lot of people including the creepy parts. A great film with great acting, great directing, great music and the most intense finale of any film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow you could write a book on this film dont worry iam not going to.Ok so it was 76 or before and an audience was just sitting down to watch the film ,remember all the horror films they were used to are at that time is hammer horrors and John carpenter and Tobe Hopper great film makers.And then came along the exorcist and totally destroyed the audience both mentality and physically.The problem was this film was about twenty years ahead of its self, and twenty years to soon for the big screen as well.The general public at that time in are history had suffered also from viewing this film.Some had died of heart attacks or killed themselves after viewing the film, babies had been lost through shock and stress and reports of other health issues relating to the film ,no wonder back then there was religious groups handing out leaflets warning people not to view this film.The mystery of these causes did not stop there.I think it was about 8 or 9 members of the film crew died of unknown or un- natrual causes as well while in the making of the film.Images appeared on still photos of the set and film.The most disturbing scene in the film is the spider clip of linda blair coming down the stairs, why this was not included in the film is beyond me that had to be the best scene ever used in horror film cinema history.You can see this clip and other really interesting info in the fear of god, a documentary on the exorcist film as well as the film lts self, but this may only be available in england iam not sure.One of the younger priests who was shooting a scene went for lunch a small restaurant was across the road from the set there the actor sat down to have some lunch ,there he had got talking to a real priest,the real priest warned him the devil does not like to be shown the way the film was portraying him to the world he will seek retribution on all those that portrayed him this way said the priest, true stuff honest!!.I actually watched the true documentary story on a satellite channel a few years ago a story of a young boy that had become possessed.The exorcist film had used one or two pieces in the film.This documentary scared the pants of me.A summary of this film is the exorcist is as dark as it can get it is based on a true story just to make matters worse.If you have not seen this film you must off been dead or in space for the last 25 years sure it was banned for some time, but its out now the question is are you ready to watch it, be advised watch it with caution!!!!.As one councellor said in a reveiw of the exorcist in a british horror magazine called the darkside" know person can sit through this film with out it having some sort of effect on that person viewing such material".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THEE Classic Modern Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Exorcist" is a film that goes full-circle from modern Twentieth Century medicine to the church exorcism of the middle ages, all within the two hours that it's on the screen. The movie revolves around three characters in it: Father Merrin, Max Von Sydow, Father Karras, Jason Miller, and Regan MacNeil, Linda Blair. Father Merrin unsuspectingly releases the devil from an ancient archaeological dig that he's in charge of in northern Iraq which ends up possessing little Regan MacNeil in Georgetown USA. Father Karras is the priest who suggested that an exorcism was warranted after examining Regan, with Karras being a trained psychiatrist, and seeing that she's beyond all known psychiatric and medical help. Father Merrin seems guilt-stricken in the beginning of the movie when he realized that he released a demonic spirit into the world by unearthing it from the ruins of his expedition. When he's contacted by the church later in the movie to preform an exorcism Father Marrin sees his chance to correct what he unwitting did by driving the evil spirit out of little Regan's body that he feels that he was responsible for.Father Karras, who is losing his faith in his religion, who's also guilt-ridden over his mothers death sees in saving Regan from her demonic possession, which he became convinced of after examining her, as a restoration of his faith. Karras also feels that the exorcism will make up for him not being more attentive to his mother who died and wasn't found in her NYC apartment until days later. Regan MacNeil, who by being the innocent victim of demonic possession, brought both priests together in a common case to exorcise the devil out of her body and in that way redeem themselves of their guilty consciences. The final half hour of the film "The Exorcist" is one of the most memorable as well as heart stopping chapters in movie history. Both Fathers Merrin and Karras heroically succeed is casting the devil out of Regan but at a frightful price to themselves."The Exorcist" is truly one of the greatest horror movies of all time even with some awful drawbacks. The dubbing of Regan's voice as that of the devil comes across like the very bad dubbing of English dialog in a Japanese monster movie. Regan's head-turning scenes in the movie are more comical then scary. The ending of the movie leaves you up in the air to who won the battle, in Regans bedroom, between good and evil?the priest or the devil?. Still if imitation is a form of success then "The Exorcist" which had hundreds of imitators over the last thirty years is undeniably one of the great, as well as influential, films of all times.</fullReview>

It is far scarier than TheCurse of Frankenstein (another landmark horror movie) and stillbeats off all its imitations (including all of its sequels and naffrip-offs like The Devil Within Her). I can't make it clear in merewords just how spooked I was after seeing this film for the firsttime. I'm equally hard-pushed to describe how disturbing it is tosee a young girl possessed by the Devil, inflicting sexual pain onherself and spouting out obscentities. Any good horror film needsto make you think, make you believe and disturb you enough topush you out of your "comfort" zone. This movie dfoes all of thosethings and a whole lot more. It is the yardstick by which I measureany modern horror film, and so far I have yet to see a film whichsurpassed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ground breaking, starkly filmed thriller stands for many as one of the most terrifying films of all time. (Conversely, a faction of agnostic viewers are left with a less jolting experience, sometimes even finding the film funny!) Quite explicit for its time, it raised the bar in film-making for gore and realism and adult horror and has been emulated many times. However, it is set apart by its well-written (Oscar-winning, in fact) script and realistic performances. Burstyn is an actress who begins to sense unusual behavior in her preteen daughter (Blair.) The bizarre symptoms (open sores, violent thrashing, etc...) escalate as Burstyn seeks help from all conventional avenues. Finally, she determines that Blair is possessed by Satan and must be exorcised. Miller is a troubled priest whose own problems pale in comparison with the dilemma facing Burstyn. When things get worse instead of better, it is up to legendary priest Von Sydow to attempt to rid the child of the demons inside her. The sense of fear and dread is aided by the cold, claustrophobic settings and the use of the music 'Tubular Bells' during key moments. The visuals are primitive by today's standards, but still provide jolts, notably Blair's explosive green vomit. Her celebrated 360 degree head turning has lost it's punch now. The film is packed with gross-out moments and shockingly blasphemous episodes which work to upset and disarm the viewer. Mercedes McCambridge helped provide the raspy, vulgar voice of the possessed Blair. A disastrous and heavily panned sequel "The Exorcist II: The Heretic" starred an older Blair and Richard Burton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, sigh! What a waste of my time! What an absolute freakin' waste of time. If ever there was a movie that tried to be scary- this is the one that goes home with the prize.Here's the plot- A little girl is possessed by the devil, and a priest tries to save her.Well, big deal!I admit, it does have one cool special effect (the writing "HELP ME" on her stomach)but overall this movie is just using the same old tiresome plot of a posessed human being. The most laughable scene is when she stabs herself in the hoodads repeatedly screaming "Let Jesus **** you!" is just plain stupid. All this movie shows is a director's attempt at trying to make a creepy movie. And Captain Howdy? Jeez! What a poor assed choice for a name for the devil! The idea of a profanity belching, pea soup spewing youngster just made ME want to projectile vomit! If you want a genuine fright fest see The Omen or Stigmata. This movie is a poor excuse to make a movie in which someone can swear a lot, be extremely horny, and attatch nylon strings to things to give them the appearence of flying about the room.This movie royally sucked, and when the Director's Cut came out, I thought, "Oh joy!

		<shortDescription>One of The Scariest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Exorcist' to many movie fans is the answer to the infamous question said to poor Sydney in the `Scream' trilogy = `What's your favorite scary movie?' `The Exorcist' did scare me. However, it did not possess me enough to declare it the scariest movie of all time. I give that honor to `The Amytiville Horror.' For those of you who do not know, this horror flick is about a pre-adolescent who inhabits a bit of a behavioral problem. I loved the theme song of the film `You Spin Me Round' by Dead or Alive. Ok! I will quit exorcising I mean exercising my sarcasm. This new version, which includes some old deleted scenes from the original, will also make you sleep with the light on. Linda Blair's haunting performance is one of the best of all time by a child actress. What could have possessed her to take crappy roles afterwards? A new scene to this renovated version is a shattering staircase flip by our protagonist Regan that is very reminiscent of those done by russian gymnasts in style and appearance (ever seen a pretty russian gymnast? Or russian athlete for that matter?) Anyways, make sure that `The Exorcist: The Version You Have Not Seen Before' is one that you will end up having seen before. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I the only one who sees that this film is empty? I'm 18, sure, but I know a good movie with a story when I see one, and this isn't one. Maybe it's because of the added scenes, but there are so many plotholes that I lost interest.Of course, I wasn't one of the people laughing at everything like other teenagers (I saw many adults laughing more than the kids). The film lacks intelligible pacing and and continuity - at one point, Reagan is stabbing herself in her privates with a cross, later, she seems okay and cleaned up. She's in no pain?And what exactly is possessing her? Is it the Devil or is it some crazy Latin priest? The movie makes absolutely no sense and I was ready to fall asleep. Some scenes were scary, but without a structured story and intelligible story, I got lost and bored pretty fast. By the way, what in the hell is that little dragon toy thing. I know it has something to do with the possession, but of course I don't know what it has to do with the possession. That's the problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its just good, thats about it, I dont agree that its the "Scariest" movie of all time. Sure maybe back in 1973, it was scary but this is 2000-times r changing &amp; this movie should stay in the 70's where it belongs. I've seen many horror films that r scarier than this. I'm not saying its bad, it is disturbin but I just think that it should stay where it belongs, in the 70's. Just like Freddy, Michael, &amp; Jason should stay in the 80's.If u want 2 see a much scarier movie, I suggest u see: 1. The Thing - 1982 version 2. Demon Knight 3. The Shining - 1980 version 4. House of 1,000 corpses - R. Zombie's new film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reissue of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2000 reissue of this film adds a number of scenes that really don't do much for the story. In fact, they slow things down, making it clear why they weren't in the original version.The story holds up well, and the confrontation between Max Von Sydow and the demon are especially good. Von Sydow has played Jesus in THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD and Satan in NEEDFUL THINGS. Here his portrait of an aging but determined priest is strong and is essential to the believability of the final act which seems to indicate that the devil and the priest have an old score to settle.The effects are good although somewhat tame by modern standards, yet it was this film that led the way for the more vivid horror films that followed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge horror movie fanatic! I hear a lot of people talk about how "scary" The Exorcist is, telling me I wouldn't want to see it because it was just too scary. The movie wasn't scary to me, but I wish I hadn't seen it. I don't see what was so scary about this film. I just can't imagine somebody being scared of this film; if so then that is a shame! I couldn't understand the plot. When the movie ended, I was like, "What? That's it?!"But I guess the real reason I wanted to see The Exorcist was because I kept hearing people talk about the "head-spinning" scene. So I was at least expecting that part to be good. WRONG! I was so disappointed! I rented this movie about a month ago. I will never, ever see this movie again! My review: 0 out of 100 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Chilling....Quite Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Known more for its more lurid aspects such as a young Linda Blair vomiting green pea soup, spinning her head completely around, committing various acts of sacrilege and blasphemy, and spouting forth an incredible amount of graphic verbal vulgarity, The Exorcist is so much more than just those trademarks. It is a disturbing psychological essay on human nature when confronted with a crisis. It is a philosophical debate between evil and Religion. It is an indictment on the world of science and what it supposedly knows, and a supporter of the supernatural, not only in the world of demons but also in the world of Religion. It is above all a thinking picture fraught with visually nightmarish visions, strident and disturbing sounds, words and phrases, and ghastly contexts in which we the audience can examine our own beliefs both in the realm of the logical and the spiritual.The film boasts so many strong points such as a well-developed script that allows us to know each of the characters with some degree of intimacy. We share in the pain of Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller. The acting is first-rate. Blair is very effective as the demonic child. Mercedes McCambridge does an outstanding and incredibly eerie job voicing the demon. The real stars of the film are the two priests, played with dedication by both Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller. Miller is the real catalyst in the film. The music is superb; the sets and shooting of Georgetown add both class and familiarity to the film. Lee J. Cobb also does a real nice job playing a movie-loving cop. Despite the thinking elements in the film, the film is a shocker in many ways....bear that in mind as you sit down to watch.</fullReview>

The beginning of the film may drag for some, but it is an important element to the story, so try and stay tuned. The cast is awesome. Burstyn is flawless as the mother constantly in peril. Miller, Von Sydow and legend Lee J. Cobb are also in top form. Blair is menacing, but it is the voice of Mercedes McCambridge that adds the horror. The special effects send constant chills up your spine throughout the entire picture. Followed by 2 sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: The Mother of Exorcism Movies!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist. The cult 1973 movie is the mother of all movies made over the same subject over the years. Why it stands apart? I think because it treats its subject and characters with utmost sincerity and care. All characters ranging from the possessed girl, the helpless mother, the saviour priests and even the demon himself have been sketched with high level of detailing and given the back stories so that you care for them. Scenes involving demon torturing the possessed girl are terrifying and leaves you haunted. The conversations between devil and the priest are delicious to listen. The movie talks about possession and exorcism in so much detail as if you are watching documentary on this subject. Acting by all lead actors is top notch. The movie requires your patience in first half an hour but then there is no letting back as unpredictability takes center stage and you are glued to the screen to know how it will end. Movie succeeds in ending the horror in satisfactory manner. For all horror movie lovers, don't miss it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie of It's Genre! What Is In Second Place?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always cringe a little when I read some people's review of the 1973 classic the Exorcist. There is simply no second place movie in the horror genre that even comes close to this ultimate classic. The Omen?, Rosemary's Baby? The Amityville Horror? the Blair Witch Project? The Exorcism of Emily Rose? Psycho? The Rite? Not even the sequels Exorcist II, III, Exorcist The Beginning 2004 hold up to the original. There is nothing currently even close in second place!!! I have often thought how modern computer technology in 2011 could improve the 1973 classic. Other than inserting additional subliminal images, it might be close to impossible to improve on what was depicted in the 1973 movie for the following reason: What an audience member saw in the 1973 movie ACTUALLY HAPPENED. William Peter Blatty and William Friedkin physically created what the audience saw. It would be difficult to improve on reality. I admit, the head spinning 360 degrees might be improved upon slightly. This is really *only* part of the 1973 film that could stand some minor improvement; the movement looks a little 'mechanical'.Again, I ask: What is in close second place to the 1973 Exorcist? A better question is: What has surpassed the 1973 classic? In almost 40 years, there is nothing to even come close to surpassing the original Exorcist. Without belaboring the point, I respectfully rest my case. Purchase the BluRay release and turn off all the lights and turn up the sound... This movie is simply a brilliancy without peer at this time in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May have been horrifying in 1973, considerably less to in 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never known of any other movie to be so notoriously regarded as The Exorcist, surpassing the hysteria of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Evil Dead as a film that was just too horrifying for mass public consumption. It had been "banned" in the UK for decades (actually, Warner just never submitted it to the then very strict BBFC) and finally saw the light of day around 1999. I liked it at first, but now, viewing it older, wiser and a lot more jaded I can't imagine why people took offense to this.It's useless reciting the plot, you all know it. But I'll just boil it down to a single sentence "Little girl possessed by low-rent demon". That's right...Demon, not Devil. Said Demon (Pazuzu) apparently has psychic and telekinetic powers but never uses them to escape from the confines of the bedroom for some reason.Doctors are baffled as to why little Reagan is acting up and recommend an exorcism. A grief-stricken priest pops round to have a look at Reagan for himself but isn't immediately convinced even though her face is unnaturally contorted and her eyes have changed to an inhuman color. Good detective work there!My main problem with The Exorcist is that it keeps cutting away to side-stories which deflates whatever tension Reagan's suffering generates. It almost ends up being a movie of subplots with no main narrative.I appreciate it from a film-making perspective in regards to the sound design and editing, and the fact that obnoxious amounts of CGI and intrusive music are not needed to create dread and mystery. But the story leaves too many open ends and just didn't satisfy me.It's hard to scare movie audiences these days. The only trick any filmmaker has left is to make them believe it's real. But The Exorcist fails on this. 1973 audiences were clearly just a little bit more naive and innocent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is a classic horror movie, nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture which I understand was rare, and it actually won an Oscar for writing. My main regret is that I've never seen the movie as it was in 1973- the dominant version on DVD is the so-called "Version you've never seen." Not that it doesn't have its own charms.This movie is scary and intense, depicting an innocent 12-year-old girl acting increasingly strange and violent, and then demonic. She says she's possessed by the devil, but that's likely a lie (isn't Satan's schedule too busy to target one little girl?). It's more probable that it's a regular demon.Still, ever since I first saw The Exorcist, I've always toyed with the theory that maybe the possession wasn't real. Regan may have been just mentally disturbed and obviously lost control of herself, but not to a demon. As characters in this movie themselves say, psychology is powerful and the exorcism may have only had the power of suggestion. I realize the fact that things around Regan move by themselves may be evidence that the possession was real, but it might not be- if you believe in the concept of psychokinesis. Similarly, her knowing information about the priest may be explained by telepathy. The doctors also explain how it might be possible that she could become stronger. And this may explain why the demon reacts violently to tap water- Regan thought it was holy water, and in her mind it became true. Of course, her head turning around may be the best evidence that something supernatural is happening, but still I think this matter can be seen as being up to interpretation.Either way, The Exorcist achieves its power because we can be concerned about Regan and we can feel the damage this does to her mother. Seeing the possessed Regan stabbing her own vagina with a crucifix is appalling and terrifying. Her speech is obscene, her appearance becomes grotesque. This movie isn't afraid to take on what a possession might really look like. For a religious person this movie might be seen as having a good message- indeed, I heard the voice actress behind the demon took the script to her priest who approved. But even for a secular person like me, The Exorcist is one hell of a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard of this movie through my entire life, but I had not seen it until a few a weeks ago. For a movie that is almost forty years old, I'm still thinking about it. There are many words that can describe "The Exorcist". Enchanting. Brilliant. Frightening. Intense. Powerful. Creative. Disturbing. Shocking. These are just a few words that come to mind. The story is simple enough. Innocent girl possessed by a demon. But what makes "The Exorcist" different from any horror film is that it's not about blood and gore like most slasher films, and there are characters we care about, rather than just a bunch of airheads in which we tend to find ourselves rooting for the villain to slaughter them. Yes, there is plenty of disturbing scenes throughout "The Exorcist", but it's a character-driven film. That's what I really enjoyed about this movie.All the performances are brilliant. Ellen Burstyn perfectly conveys the tension and fear a mother would experience during such a horrific supernatural event. Max Von Sydow (who's only in the movie for about twenty minutes) gives a performance that should've won him an Oscar. He conveys the sense of hope in the film. His words, "The power of Christ compels you!" still rings in my mind.Jason Miller expresses the sadness and imperfection that every person experiences, which is particularly unique since his character is a priest. And I can't forget Linda Blair as the little girl who's possessed. Even though Mercedes McCambridge did the voice of the demon (a voice that I will never forget), Blair's facial expressions and actions throughout the film as she transforms from good to evil is nothing short of perfect. And the fact she did this role at such a young age should've also garnered her an Oscar.The other aspect I cannot overlook in this film is the technical feats. As an individual whose just finished learning video production, I found the works of cinematography, editing, and sound design to be top-notched, even by today's standards. I mean, the filmmakers made a bed float in the air before the invention of CGI! That cannot be beaten. And the whole "Exorcist" sequence, well, I'll just say I could not keep my eyes off of the screen. I've now have come to appreciate William Friedkin as a legendary director for pulling off such a brilliant film.This movie won 2 Oscars back in 1974 for adapted screenplay and sound. Yet again, another superior film has been screwed over by the academy. I try not to put much stock in awards, but "The Exorcist" is a rare jewel that should not have been so sourly overlooked. This may be a horror film, but it's not like any other one. There's plot, characters, symbolism, and important messages of self-sacrifice and the presence and triumph over unimaginable evil. Of all the words I've used to describe this film, there is one that can sum it up. Unforgettable.****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God vs. Satan, Good vs. Evil and The Old vs. The New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is deserving of its title as "the scariest movie of all time". Unlike its many imitators, it doesn't have a party atmosphere, and takes its subject seriously: the ultimate in good vs. evil.Chris MacNeil is a fairly successful actress, separated from her husband and living with her daughter, Regan, in Georgetown, Washington D.C. She is horrified at Regan's abrupt change in behavior and consults teams of doctors and psychiatrists, to no avail. One night, Burke Dennings, the director of the film she is starring in, is killed in a fall from Regan's window, bringing in Inspector Kinderman, perhaps the most likable character in the film. One doctor suggests the Catholic practice of exorcism as therapy (even though the Church regards it as a sacred rite, not therapy). Mrs. MacNeil, an agnostic, is incredulous at the suggestion, until another outburst by Regan, one that nearly kills Mrs. MacNeil, convinces her to consult a priest. She is also convinced that it was Regan, by way of Satan himself, who killed Dennings.Father Karras is a liberal, modernist priest, who is more at home in the field of psychiatry than Holy Orders. His aged mother is dying, and he is struggling with his faith. When Chris asks him about exorcism, he seems to think she's nuts, and tells her it isn't done anymore, even though he's aware that the practice has never been abandoned. Chris has had enough of psychiatrists, and so Father Karras agrees to see Regan as a priest. After a few visits, he sees that, even though he himself doesn't believe in demonic possession, Regan's case meets the criteria set forth in the rite of exorcism. He obtains permission for the exorcism, but he will only be an assistant. The Bishop prefers someone with experience (and faith, with which Father Karras is struggling). That priest is Father Lancaster Merrin.We first meet Father Merrin at the film's beginning. He is in Iraq as part of an archaeological expedition, his way of escape after an earlier exorcism that nearly killed him. While in Iraq, he tells a friend, "there is something I must do". We see him seeing two dogs fight, and looking at two eerie looking statues, symbolizing the fight between good and evil, a battle which he must go back to the U.S. to rejoin, even though he has yet to receive an assignment. The assignment is delivered via a monk, and he knows it's time to get back to work.After he arrives at the MacNeil residence, where Father Karras is waiting for him, we see the contrast between the old and the new in the Church. Karras still thinks of the assignment as more psychiatric therapy than a battle against Satan, but Merrin is under no such illusions. As they prepare for the exorcism, Karras tries to bring Merrin up to date about Regan's psychiatric history. Merrin's terse one-word reply is, "why?" That isn't so much a question as a statement to Karras that this is the real thing. A bit later, Karras attempts to inform Merrin of Regan's three distinct personalities (he still thinks it's a case of schizophrenia) that he has detected, provoking another terse response from Merrin: "There is only one!" We know who that one is, even though Karras, who apparently fancies himself as too sophisticated to believe in Satan and demons as real beings, still hasn't gotten with the program. Karras is clearly out of his league in the exorcism, and wouldn't know what to without Merrin. Merrin, in spite of a bad heart condition, which requires constant medication, appears confident, while Karras seems in awe at Regan's levitation and such. It appears to dawn on him at last that this is indeed the real thing. Neither man survives the exorcism, but there is a satisfying ending.At the epilogue, as the MacNeils prepare to leave Georgetown (Sharon, Chris's assistant, stays behind), we see Karras's close friend, Father Dyer (played by a real priest) seeing them off. Regan stares at his collar, and gives him a big hug. She sees goodness and hope in his collar. After they leave, we see Dyer walking away after looking at the deadly steps where Burke Dennings and Father Karras met their demise. In the restored version, Inspector Kinderman joins him for lunch, setting the stage for The Exorcist III.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is widely considered the scariest movie of all time, and for good reason. The year is 1973, and the scariest movies up-to-date are just monster movies for the most part, like The Trollenberg Terror and Night of the Living Dead. However, this movie soon outdid them all. This movie starts off normal enough, an actress (Chris MacNeil) living a happy life with her daughter(Regan). A priest (Damien Karras) dealing with his estranged mother and his loss of faith. Then suddenly things start to turn for the worst. Things go downhill and eventually leads to Regan being possessed by Pazuzu, a demon lord. This is where the movie is seen as the scariest movie ever, her actions, language, everything was just shocking to people at the time since no movie before it had done things this way. I read that people were hauled away in ambulances from the theaters because of how shocking it was. When I saw this movie, even in 2007 I was surprised by her actions. I can only imagine how scary it was back in 1974. This movie was great, if you want a classic horror film, this is the one for you. Beats the Poltergeist any day. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One True Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1973, a comedy writer and a car-chase director got together to tell a psychological mystery, based on an actual incident the writer heard of when he was in divinity school.Yeah, sounds like a real thrill-a-minute.Every studio passed. When Warner finally gave in, the writer/producer seemed to go out of his way to do everything wrong. He hired priests to play themselves. He hired a 40-year-old to be an 80-year-old. The female lead went to a virtual unknown, and the male lead was given to a Pulitzer Prize winning playwright who originally thought he was being hired to write the script. The professionally composed score was literally thrown out the window, and replaced by bits and pieces of obscure music. A maniacal director was allowed to torture and terrorize the cast. A barefoot illiterate peasant was hired to do the sound effects.During the first showing, the producers were certain they'd blown it when a large part of the audience walked out.They debated whether to release the film at all, and some studio chiefs considered it an obscene embarrassment. But as they left the theater, they noticed something odd.Every single member of the audience, including the walk- outs, was still in the parking lot. Not one person had driven home. They were gathered in a huge mob, discussing and debating and arguing about what they'd just seen.In the following months, the results were unprecedented. In New York, the joke was that you had to get in line in New Jersey. Today, we would call them "Star Wars" crowds.But "The Exorcist" came first.Like "Citizen Kane" or "2001: A Space Odyssey", it is one of those rare moments in film history when someone does something totally different, yet somehow, by luck or sixth sense or divine guidance, seems to know exactly what to do.Right from the start, the off-rhythm pounding of the Iraqi blacksmiths gets under our skin, a beautifully subtle way of suggesting something is not right with the world's heartbeat.The indecipherable right-to-left Arabic writing also plays a role here, a relatively strange sight to American audiences, and a prelude to the backwards speech, backwards heads, and backwards nature in scenes to come. Reversal and conflict are constantly reinforced thematically, through juxtapositions of incompatible images: the sacred and the profane, the light and the dark, the natural and the unnatural. But it's not all subtlety. The prologue sequence ends with a heroic shot straight out of High Noon, as the exorcist suddenly finds himself face to face with the statue of a grinning, reptilian demon. Human flesh against indestructible stone.Then a marvelous transition. Old to new. From Iraq to Georgetown. A movie actress switches on a light in a dark bedroom. And the sound of rats in the attic, even though the home's caretaker insists quite believably, "No rats." Scampering rats. Shrieking gulls. Lions devouring prey.All the sound effects are chosen with a merciless attention to human instinctive psychology. They set the stage for evil.Science alongside superstition. As a young girl becomes progressively sicker, her behavior ever more bizarre, there seems little difference between a medical laboratory, with its bloodletting and its whirling x-ray machines, and the rituals of a witchdoctor. We meet our young hero, the suffering priest/psychiatrist, further blurring the line between magic and reality. And he brings in yet another paradoxical combination: faith, and the loss of faith. By the way, his name is Karass, which is Greek for "cross". At least I think it is. Anyway, it should be.The film's most powerful oxymoron is undoubtedly the most shocking, most horrible scene in the history of cinema. It makes one inescapable point. This is not a disease. This is not a dream. This is not even a lower-echelon evil spirit from some haunted house movie. Only the Devil can do this.An interesting sidebar. During this scene, Ellen Burstyn is supposed to be sent flying by a vicious backhand blow. Of course, this was before the era of digital wizardry, so she had to be physically strapped into a harness and then pulled across the room. As the rehearsals wore on, she warned director Friedkin that she was starting to get hurt. Friedkin agreed that the next take would be more gentle. He lied.He covertly instructed the special effects designer to "let her have it." She went flying like a rag doll, screaming in agony as she thudded to the hard wooden floor. And Friedkin, the consummate artist, dollied in to get that last close-up, before calling the paramedics. Now that's what movies are all about.This movie is what movies are all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist is based on a true story of a boy who became possessed and had to be exorcised by a couple of priests. William Peter Blatty heard about this and decided to make a book about it, he changed certain things like the child being a girl instead of a boy. Then they decided to make a movie based on the book and Willam Peter Blatty who wrote the novel adapted it into a screenplay and it got made into one of the most famous horror movies of all time. The Exorcist has some memorable scenes like the head spinning scene and the vomit scene, the film does have some creepy scenes like in the attic. The white face of Captain Howdy is also pretty creepy and effective.The Exorcist is a horror classic that has some great atmosphere and creepiness, this film should be seen.

		<shortDescription>Prolonged Agony Which Buries Itself Deep Inside One's Subconscious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the most widely controversial mainstream film ever made, The Exorcist has been terrifying viewers for more than thirty years. In 1973 people would flock to view the film which was reportedly "the most harrowing motion-picture of all-time." Although the content of the film might not shock viewers of today, the irrefutable nature of the traumatic events that unfold are likely to silence even the most hard-bitten viewers. Instead of bringing "low-key thrills" through shock-tactics, The Exorcist establishes horror through the progressively distressing notion of an innocent girl becoming demoniacally possessed and therefore undertaking sacrilegious acts.After winning Best Picture at the Oscars for The French Connection, William Friedkin became one of the most talked-about Hollywood directors. From this success, Warner Brothers decided to allow Friedkin to direct William Peter Blatty's novel The Exorcist. Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay (Blatty adapted his own novel) were the two Oscars awarded to The Exorcist. The academy is notorious for their bias stance towards particular genres, but Friedkin's masterpiece is one of a handful of horror films which the academy did in fact recognise as a genuine triumph.Twelve-year-old Regan MacNeil (played by a teenage Linda Blair) is living in Washington D.C. with her mother Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn). While in Washington, Regan begins to develop bizarre symptoms of what-seems-to-be an obscure, psychological disorder. Distraught and becoming more worried by the day, Chris decides to take Regan to a clinic. After numerous tests the doctors cannot define what is wrong with Regan and eventually resort to suggesting a so-called means of "shock treatment" a.k.a. exorcism. Chris decides to seek help from the Catholic Church; eventually hiring a sceptical priest to examine Regan's violent behaviour. Opening in an archaeologist ground and finishing in the suburbs of Washington D.C., The Exorcist conveys many varying transitions; including, science vs. religion and the fundamental theme of good battling evil.Littered with subliminal (demonic statues/faces) and metaphorical imagery (the subway staircase as a descent to hell) and scenes of blasphemy, The Exorcist is a deeply religious film which expertly applies a method of crawling under the viewer's skin. Building an ambiance for approximately 40 minutes The Exorcist resists the temptation to spew lashings of extreme gore and alternatively takes a subtle approach towards a touchy subject. Slow, boiling tensions can be noted near the very start of the film when there is a shot of Father Merrin (Max von Sydow's character) standing opposite the statue of a devil. The dessert sands roll and a greying darkness spreads over the screen, this shot symbolises the conflict between good and evil, while foreshadowing the events that Father Merrin acknowledges but are yet to come. The uncompromising methods of film-making used in The Exorcist question the viewer to such an extent that analysing almost becomes a lost-cause. Drawing parallels between science and religion (in the film religion is shown as a last resort) the unrequited sensation broke barriers of how spirituality could be portrayed through art. A persistent theme is the infiltration of the body, both by medical science and possession, which also drives the fundamental element of desecration. Nonetheless, the performances in The Exorcist are unquestionably persuasive because of the eloquent delivery that each actor abides to. Max von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair and the most underrated of them all, Jason Miller, all showcase the utmost talent and bestow their most matchlessly penetrating performances. The sheer audacity and belligerent disposition makes every aspect all the more satisfying. Edited in a manner which utilises the environment, The Exorcist never fails to keep the attention of its viewers. Much of the film resembles a polished and distinguishable example of pristine film-making, which engulfs and drains all sentiment. This leaves an impressionable level of numbness long after the credits have rolled.The Exorcist ranks as one of the most challenging and evocative works of art to be released in American cinema. Nothing can prepare you for the overwhelming experience of William Friedkin's exceptional mélange of humanistic drama and staggering horror. It may traumatise, so be wary, but do not be put off from viewing a film which questions one's perception of religion, and can easily be stated as a definitive masterpiece of cinema. Summarising my respect for The Exorcist is an impossible task to perform, so this is merely a futile attempt at nailing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't take it too personally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had great anxiety going to this film because I had heard so much about it. I was somewhat justified. I don't know when I've felt quite as uncomfortable in a movie theater. The interesting thing was that I didn't buy into any of the supernatural elements in it. I don't personally believe in a Dante like hell where devils take over our souls and can spin their heads around and burn us for eternity. Yet, the makeup on this young girl, the use of the most base profanity, the special effects, that rumbling voice, hissing, the fog, masterful. The crude, sacrilegious displays were really over the top. This is a truly frightening experience from beginning to end. The first time I saw the face of Regan, I nearly left the theater. Then my curiosity was piqued by images of ancient horrors. I am not squeamish when it comes to movies. I was ready for the vomit. But I guess I have to ask myself, "How much can you put up with?" I know I will never watch this movie again. Once is enough. Am I cheating myself. I don't think so. But it is quite an experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's solely because of this movie that Friedkin remains in Hollywood. 'Connection' let him to pass off his lazy method as "documentary-style", but the last 30 years have flaunted his ineptness. All he will likely be remembered for is his minute contribution to the ever-changing world of car chases and this. Everything else is insipid trash.This is your only spoiler warning...This is his best work for two reasons, both related to film as an art form. There is so much detail in the subtexts. The Catholic church is shown as theological gangsters and the doubting priest is a total product of the late 60s counter-culture. Strange, from anti-religion to part of religion. Of course, it all boils down to superstition versus science. It took 'Ghostbusters' to change that mentality in the favor of science and nerds.Secondly, I believe movies didn't become worth listening to for sound design until the 70s (I'm not referring to noisy trash like 'Star Wars' and 'Close Encounters') and this is one of the better examples. It isn't as effective as 'Catch-22' and 'Apocalypse Now', but it forges a bridge to the mastery of audio in the 80s. Also, I should mention the Iraqi desert in the opener. Why do so many visual narratives use deserts whether the Leone Westerns, 'Close Encounters', 'Hulk', and even RoadRunner cartoons? What is it about that environment? I love it! At least Friedkin didn't screw it up here even though his camera is all zoom, zoom, zoom.Something should be said of the presence of Islam in this movie. Few horror films, let alone religion-associated ones, include this in any form; so it's fairly unique. Also, compare Burstyn's single mom character to any Spielberg associated horror film: one is dark, the other is optimistic.Funny, the one-eyed blacksmith sees all and the crude director's head gets reversed. Meanwhile, the Kinderman character critiques everything.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film ever - Horror, Religion and the Faith in it all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, how times have changed.I saw this movie when it was first released widely in 1974. Back then in Hollywood Films, children didn't SAY or mouth the words the possessed Regan spews,(today many children say these words and more on TV and in film, so it's not so shocking) Priests were looked at as wise-old religious confidants, and it was rare to see a 'celebrity' single Hollywood Actress raising a child to boot! Challenging these norms is what makes "The Exorcist" film scary, the materialization of a demon/demons taking over a body of a pre-adolescent child makes it horrific and the real scriptures from a Christian Holy Book being conveyed with such force with the scary (again, for its time) special effects in a mainstream film made it spectacular.Before "The Exorcist", the epic Hollywood mainstream religious films with scripture and subsequent lessons were "Ben Hur" and "The Ten Commandments", "Samson and Delilah", "The Robe". Uplifting, true. But here was the start of, as many religious people put it, "Satan getting more box-office than Jesus". And not only was watching this child becoming slowly possessed was a problem, but so was watching the lives of those around here who would ultimately come together for not a happy ending.Make no mistake, this was a first in mainstream Hollywood film history. You had a man of the cloth who--sure--was questioning his faith, but you also saw he was as human as we all are. This Priest had problems with his family, problems with his faith, problems with how he was educated!! Wha--??!!You had an "working actress" trying to raise her child and be a good, attentive single mother at the same time.You had the hero of the film, an old Priest who retired to archaeological digs which in his young priesthood ago had a battle with a demonic spirit in Africa that he thought he ran off the face of the earth only to realize that it had re-located to a little girl's body.Then, you had a little girl who had problems of her own. She's growing up with no one to relate to, for her parents divorced, her father never continued a relationship with her, she's aware that her mother is having a "relationship" with the director of her film. She's changing... and the best solution they can come up with is grueling, seemingly barbaric test after test on her body and mind which would probably take its toll on anyone young or old.You put all this together with excellent direction, and an excellent script adaptation from its book, layers of STORY and character development and you have one of the best films of all time, "The Exorcist".Now, some 30 years later, one would consider 'scary' and 'horror' in film only so if it contained a lot of blood and guts and computer enhanced special effects. For its time, The Exorcist did it all by hand and it was spectacular. The Special Effects may look "rinky-dink" by todays standards, but its the religious inferences and WHY it was occurring on top of the effects that was horrific. I mean its one thing to see a child floating above a bed, but why she is, is what scares you.I do feel the more connected you are in the Christian Faith, is what may make this film horrific than most. Horrific good or Horrific bad. You have several battles here, you as a film goer pick and chose which one or none you care to believe but the bottom line is for all that this film presents, it does it well, provokes discussion and thought and I still haven't seen a film to match what "The Exorcist" has.One of the top 5 Films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist stands firmly among the greatest films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is widely regarded to be the scariest movie of all time. Personally, I would put it a little differently. Instead of calling it the scariest movie of all time, I think that it would be more accurate to say that it's the best horror movie of all time. These may be just two different ways of saying the same thing, but I think that there is a notable difference. I just watched The Exorcist again, and I experienced the nervousness and tension and fear that it was meant to cause and I jumped a few times, but I've watched several other horror movies that have caused those same feelings ? The Shining, Pet Sematary, The Sixth Sense to a certain extent, even the remake of The House on Haunted Hill had a few quality scares. But I think that the thing that sets The Exorcist apart is that everything was just done right. The acting was great, the story was unique and well presented, the gruesome special effects were skillfully crafted, even the gore and the sickening profanity were put into the film with good reason and with good results. It's so rare to see a horror movie come along (and it gets rarer and rarer as time goes on) that is actually worth watching, and when one comes along that is absolutely ground-breaking, like The Exorcist, then it's a huge cinematic event. The Exorcist is just as timeless as horror films get, and it should be noted for its style and its effectiveness. There have been so many imitations of this film that have popped up over the years (which is to be expected, because it created so many possibilities), but none of them, not even any of the sequels, even come close to the greatness of the original. Not only is it original and unique, but it also contained some stunning performances, particularly on the part of Linda Blair as Regan, the 12-year-old girl who was the subject of the exorcism. There were some frankly shocking things that she did for the film, and the brilliant special effects and make-up added to that to make Regan's possession amazingly realistic, which is probably the most remarkable thing about the film. Another thing that was done especially well in The Exorcist was the sound effects. Probably one of the main reasons that the movie is so scary is because it is so unexpected and therefore so unsettling to hear some of those noises come from a little girl. William Friedkin's skillful but relentless directing style clearly played a large part in the convincingness of the final outcome, which stands as one of the definitive films in cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It doesn't matter if you believe OR not in God and Satan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't praise this movie enough. I am proud and lucky to have watched this movie on theaters. I watched it on it's re-release back in 1999 with the "new" scenes. The experience was amazing. I mean, watching the scariest and most popular mainstream Horror movie of all time is something that has no price."The Exorcist" deserves it's almost heavenly status (no pun intended) because it's truly a movie that deals with one of the most scary and prohibited topics in modern civilizations; that is, The Devil.The story is simple but effective on every aspect. A young girl has been playing with an Ouija board and soon after strange things start to happen to her normal life and her surrounding. Her house is being attacked in lower portions by demonic spirits, for example. It's until her physical form is completely possessed by Pazzuzu, who is the ancient demon that takes physical form of insects. Pazzuzu, according to the history of humanity, has only been able to possess a few persons. Reagan McNeill is one of them. Her mother hires the best doctors, psychiatrists, scientific that money can buy but none of them can give a solution to Reagan's condition. That is until a priest takes on the case and recommends an exorcism. The roman ritual is applied to Reagan and the demon Pazzuzu finally leaves Reagan in the name of God.But the story is more complex than that. We, as the audience, are taken into another level of faith and beliefs towards The Devil and God. The story also deals with clinical terms and methods. So it's up to you to believe if Reagan was actually possessed or had a sickness. Of course, the director does the necessary to make you believe that truly a demon possessed the young girl. Also, Father Karras who is an active part in the exorcism has issues with his faith for God and is truly a tormented soul for some events displayed in the movie. On the other hand, Father Merrin who is a veteran of exorcisms and once defeated The Devil has his faith at top level and manages to command the ritual. But the complexity of the story does not ends there. There are many references to Reagan's possible possession. It's mentioned that her family is Altheist and do not believe completely in God. We can assure that when Chris McNeill gets really angered when the Austrian home worker puts a crucifix under Reagan's pillow. Also, some strange events make the audience wonder if actually The Devil had something to do for example, with Burke's death.My advice is : be objective with this movie because it will intrigue you, it will make you think, and if you give permission to it, ; it will scare the hell out of you. It has nothing to do if you believe in God or not; the visual experience is powerful and with the aid of a clever script you will experience something that no other movie can deliver. That is, justified fear.The production values of this movie are excellent, impressive. The acting is top notch. This movie carried Academy Award nominations for Elen Burstyn in a powerful, dramatic performance as the mother who tried everything in order to cure her daughter. Her performance is impressive and truly demonstrates her acting skills because acting this character is sui generis. Jason Miller also delivers a powerful, sentimental performance. First, he cries the death of his mother and then he recovers his faith and faces The Devil in the roman ritual. A performance like none other. Max Von Sydow has little on screen time but delivers a solid, believable performance as the elder Exorcist who fights Pazzuzu for second and last time. Linda Blair will always be remembered for this role. Her performance is also impressive. Lee J. Cobb delivers a delightful performance as the clever witted detective who follows the murder of Burke and little by little gets intrigued by the demonic connections.Please, watch this movie if you haven't or watch it again if you didn't like it. It has a lot to offer and truly has proved through time that it's one of the most influential and powerful movies of all time."The Exorcist" is more than a Drama Horror feature. It's almost a religious experience if you watch it with enough seriousness.Some memorable scenes: Father Merrin's first encounter with the statue of Pazzuzu, Father Merrin's last battle against Pazzuzu, Pazzuzu making an appearance in the final exorcism; the statue is truly frightening in that scene, the infamous crucifix masturbation, the head spinning 180?, the dialogs between Karras and Pazzuzu, the bed that gets elevated, Father Merrin's demise, Karras' possession, the nightmare sequences, etc.God bless this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit it, I'm in a rare position as just a few of the people who does not think that THE EXORCIST was all that great a movie as most critics &amp; a lot of fans claim it to be, don't get me wrong, the Exorcist had some interesting things in it, the acting &amp; directing was good &amp; the special effects &amp; scares terrifying, but I just had trouble seeing it as others do. As everyone by now knows, a 12 year old girl is possessed by the devil &amp; soon a Priest who's losing his faith &amp; another elderly Priest named Father Merrin are forced to confront the demon &amp; exorcise the entity from the little girl. The first half of the film is slow moving &amp; boring, with people just walking around &amp; talking, while the last half of the film deals with the possessed girl, but by the time the film reached the possession theme, I was already half asleep, like I said, I'm in a rare race of people who didn't think this film was all that, but I still suggest you check it out, chances are you'll like it...unless you just happen to be one of those people like me, who didn't see it as that great a horror film. Based on the novel by WILLIAM PETER BLATTY who based it on an actual incident. After the films premiere, the whole cast &amp; crew was the subject of a stalker who threatened to kill them all, &amp; although they ended within time, he was never caught. Followed by two sequels &amp; a prequel starting with the dull EXORCIST 2: THE HERETIC *** (stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scary.. At Least For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it really depends on who you are and what your beliefs are in regards to religion/demonic possession etc. How easily you're offended or scared by obscene language/shocking or disgusting visuals. The major themes, the idea of pure evil corrupting the innocence of a child, struggling with faith and sacrifice etc. Then you might find this movie shocking/scaryI dunno, I know that when this was released in the early 70's all of the things I listed above were much more controversial topics, and feel that to a certain extent they were kind of floating around in society and in the minds of people attempting to individually grapple with these kind of issues in their own ways. To have all of this stuff thrown at you, would have been at the very least jarring and possibly horrifying, and at the worst personally terrifyingIf you're an atheist, that laughs at the superstitious/moralistic sensibilities of traditional society being offended, have grown up seeing truly disturbing stuff online and in books etc. Then chances are you're just gonna end up either bored, or laughing.The only thing I found even slightly creepy was the few glimpses of Pazuzu (the white faced devil) that you get when he flashes on the screen for a second or two.Good special effects, fine acting, decent direction, but if you're unable to connect with the subject matter then none of that will matter. It's like somebody making a horror movie about a jar of pickles; If you don't have an irrational phobia regarding pickles you won't find it frightening/shocking in the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just watched it for the 4th time, it's an evergreen Horror Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the perfect horror film which works on many levels. From dealing with demonic possession, to commentary on loss of faith, to maternal love for a child, to psychological aspects of mind and the most effectively the family drama!Each and every character has his/her own depth and their own approach to the situation. Here we see Regan becoming victim of the demon Pazuzu as he possesses her and her mother Chris' subsequent breakdown and desperate attempts to save her child. We also see Karras handling Regan while dealing with his own faith and loss of his mother and Father Merrin who already knows where and when he is going to meet the demon.Talking about the technical aspects, the film succeeds. Cinematography is great and so is the lighting technique.The screenplay couldn't have been better.The sound mixing is excellent and disturbing.The background score is really creepy and atmospheric.The direction... Hats Off!And performances... Extremely Realistic! The scene where Chris meets Father Karras for the first time and asks more about him, she comes to the point of why she called him, and then she mentions that someone really close to her needs help, and then the way she says that the 'someone' is her daughter sent creeps down my spine and brought tears in my eyes.It felt like William Freidkin didn't visualize the script; it feels like he is capturing the moments in camera and editing it to deliver us the most realistic and magnificent horror film of all time.When I watched it for the first time, I literally passed out for some seconds and remained scared for the next two months. I was 14 at the time and now I am 18. After watching it for the fourth time and this time with subtitles, the drama portion of the film with lots of character depth surfaced. So it is more than a horror film that has passed the passage of time and is and will always remain evergreen Horror Film.10 out 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know, I know, those are some bold words. It's absolutely true though. Everything is perfect; the pacing, the shots, the subtle ambient noises, the casting. It's literally flawless. I hate religion and a lot of the BS that goes with it, but it doesn't matter. This film is so well done (as is the book it's based on) that I can look past all of my anti-theisim and recognize a masterpiece. William Friedkin has done some other excellent things, but nothing as good as this. Blatty's another example of a person who can not only write great scripts and tele-plays, but can also pull a pretty darn good novel out of his posterior when needed. Max von Sydow is amazing in everything, and to think how much makeup they used to make him look that old, especially for a picture made in 1973 it's incredible. Coincidentally he just now is actually starting to look that old. Fantastic. Anyone not into this clearly has no taste.</fullReview>

Every horror film after The Exorcist was made either directly or indirectly in its image. That is due to the fact that The Exorcist changed horror forever. In its time it was the scariest and the most obscene. The Exorcist is remorseless - it gets under your skin psychologically while creating the scariest on-screen journey to date. Regardless of opinion, every horror fan needs to thank The Exorcist for bringing its bloodcurdling levels of darkness to the screen for generations to come at a time when it was truly a risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So often cited as "the scariest movie of all time", this is not only a horror masterpiece, but a great film in general. There are 3 different character story lines that eventually intertwine. One is a priest in New York who is losing his faith, another is an elder priest searching for a demon around the world, and lastly, a young girl named Reagan who becomes possessed by a nefarious entity. The acting is top notch, the direction is masterful, and there are lots of truly terrifying moments. This is not like today's mainstream horror utilizing cheap jump scares every few minutes. The Exorcist slowly builds tension using atmosphere invoking dread, and dark, morbid themes that linger in your mind long after the credits roll. The possessed Reagan scenes are truly unnerving and as a whole any fan of horror or movies in general need to see this. Director William Friedkin uses controversial themes of sacrilege and shows us some very taboo, disturbing images to tell a story of mystery and intrigue instead of for exploitative reasons. Despite being such a cultural phenomenon, this is a dark film and its still as scary as it was in 1973. Even though I was a horror fan since I was a kid, I didn't actually watch it until I was around 20 because of the horrifying reputation this movie has!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic among horror movies. Clever, well-planned plot. Solid direction by William Friedkin. Friedkin builds the tension masterfully. Incredible suspense and a very sinister and eerie feeling. Great shock value tooThe result is a very scary movie, and one which reminds you that horror movies don't have to be b-grade schlock, they can be works of art.Good performances all round. Three of the cast got Oscar nominations: Ellen Bustyn (leading actress), Linda Blair (supporting actress) and Jason Miller (supporting actor). No nomination for Max von Sydow but his performance is spot-on and the movie made his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few films to actually have sickened me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I couldn't miss the opportunity to see this horror classic in the cinema, or I'd have to wait another 25 years till the 50th anniversary. So I went along to the cinema, where it was playing in an original version (none of this remastered malarkey, I'll thank you very much). And suffice to say, I was impressed. Very impressed. In fact the film lived up to all expectations I had of it.From the opening prologue set in Iraq, we know something's wrong. There's a sense of dread in the air as we all know what's coming. However, it takes a long time for the possession to actually occur, which may be surprising to some, but it instead concentrates on characterisation, which is a strength and makes THE EXORCIST stand out from other run-of-the-mill stalk and slash affairs. Jason Miller's character is the most thoroughly explored, and all of the normal everyday situations shown simply make the demonic events even more horrific when they occur. The Tubular Bells music is great too, and brings chills with it.Once they occur, they do not disappoint. Regan's actions are still suitably graphic, even by today's standards (the crucifix scene for example). However her obscenities tended to provoke laughter rather than fear, such language is sadly common in this day and age. Things build to the great climax and, I feel, one of the greatest moments in cinema, that is when Karras confronts the evil. Excellent.The special effects still stand up, despite being a bit creaky. Still, they're much better than the CGI nonsense used by blockbusters today. THE EXORCIST remains a remarkably intelligent exercise in horror, and everybody has to see it to see what all the hype is about. While I wasn't scared by the film, it did actually make me feel quite sick and disturbed, so perhaps there was something really evil about it after all. Then again it's only a movie, so we can but wonder. THE EXORCIST is a great film, not easy or enjoyable viewing but extremely horrific and effective. See it and see what everyone's talking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually wouldn't call this the most horrific film I've ever seen out there. That is because I didn't find it scary but rather mysterious and addicting to watch. You honestly would want to see what the demon in Linda Blair's body does next. It can leave you with questions in your head such as - why did the demon chose to take over that young girls body? What lead it to become more angry with people around the young girl? We won't ever know but like those statues that Father Merrin found, were not found nearby. How did the demon get from Iraq to the state's? Gosh this movie gave a lot of questions in my head than any other horror films I have seen!It was a really good film to watch, it was rather long but at the same time, I get why it was such a box office hit then and the fact, religious nutjobs were planning to kill poor Linda Blair! Christ that was shocking but you get any character's of this world! The poor child was acting, it has nothing to do with being the devil for real like! I definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Horror Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic. One of the greatest 3-4 horror films of all-time and should be in IMDb tops 150-200 films of all time. Many people either consider this the greatest horror film of all-time but a few claim it doesn't hold up to time. Most classics don't hold up to time either mostly because of taste. Just look at art and music, which even more radically changes taste over the centuries. So some criticism is undeserved since the claim is its subject isn't believable or it can't capture the shock value of more gory or twisting plots. However, this film isn't really about twisting plots or simple gore. For its time, it carries a shock in the vulgar language spoken by the demon possessing Regan (Linda Blair). That's at a time when censorship was becoming more relaxed. It was a measure of the impact of the 60s to 70s transition in movies from Mary Poppins to Midnight Cowboy.The movie hails in realism and more psycho-drama than simple horror. Our two central stars are Regan and Father Karras (Jason Miller) who is a modern priest trained in medicine (psychiatry) with doubts as to his place in the church. Max von Sydow plays Father Merrin, the expert in exorcism who maintains a semi-mysterious role. All three thespians were beyond excellent which adds to the value of a horror film. Lee J Cobb plays Kinderman, a police detective investigating a related possible murder, perhaps unevenly and unnecessarily. The weakest role is Ellen Burstyn's Chris McNeil who plays a histrionic mother. She overplays a somewhat spoiled actress who finds episodes of emotion rage unconvincingly. It's bizarre that Burstyn was nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe for acting since it was far weaker than Blair, von Sydow or Miller. Nevertheless, the film is otherwise superbly acted. The real strength of the film is really the directing and cinematography combination. Forever etched in cinema is the classic scene when the shadowy figure of Father Merrin arrives at the house at night emerging from the taxi and under the fog and lights of the house. The opening excavation scene was beautifully done. Or the underrated shot of Karras's mother on Regan's bed or the shadow of the howling Regan (is that a creature) with the demon shadow. That combination of the skills of cinematographer Owen Roizman and director William Friedkin were brilliant. I find those types of artistic statements have greater value than the head-turning of the cursing Regan.I give this classic a 9.3 in reality but a 10 here to up the rather low 8.0 IMDb average which really should be more like a 8.2. It's embarrassing to see what's rated at 8.1-8.3: V for Vendetta, Pan's Labyrinth, Die Hard...some good and not-so-good movies, but not deserving to be among the top 150-200 films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nightmare! It's an excellent horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You wouldn't go to sleep alone after you watch this film because it gives you nightmare.The script is OK and it's not that really good but it's a good horror film. It's a true story which it happened to a young boy many years ago. The sound and picture are good, seems so real.When I watched it on TV in early 2001, just before the film started, I watched the director's documentary about how he made it and what it was about. I tried to research online and I cannot find any information if the director did say that but I remember it quite well. Did you know that the whole original film was reshot? Because people made complaint that it was extremely scary and violence, so the director changed the scripts and tried to reduce the scary scenes. I saw a very short clip which you never seen it, when mother went to her daughter's bedroom and the ceiling's scene, they're rare version and never show on DVD or online but maybe on VHS if you still got them. I don't know the title of TV documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that bears your soul open to its wounds...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've wanted to write something about the film 'The Exorcist' for quite some time now. With over a thousand reviews I wasn't sure if I could add anything new or original, but perhaps there is.The Exorcist was a cultural phenomenon, appealing to and playing on the most primal fears of millions around the world. Only three other movies have been capable of attaining some of the levels of primal dread that infuse the whole of the Exorcist, and they are the 1963 version of 'The Haunting', 'The Legend of Hell House', and (believe it or not) the first instalment of 'Paranormal Activity'.The Exorcist was released back in 1973, and at that time I was a curious thirteen year old, but being a tall fellow, I passed for eighteen, so with 2 other friends and my then girlfriend, we managed to get into the cinema and watch the original theatrical release a week after it opened here in the UK. I was already a thoughtful and deeply internalising young lad. I don't mean to say that I had psychiatric problems or anything, I didn't, just that I have always had a penetrating observation and intuition. I suppose you could say both my girlfriend and I were equally intelligently sensitive, and we had both read the book.The Exorcist hits home on a number of levels, primarily because it is a visceral assault upon both eyes and ears. The director, William Friedkin, gave the film a pseudo-documentary realism, employing techniques of imagery and high and low sound that had not been fully utilised in movies before, but certainly some aspects of it employed in his earlier film 'The French Connection'.I wasn't to realise at the time, but the most poignant scene in the movie did not appear in the original theatrical cut, and only some 30 years later was it added in the Director's cut. I am writing about the scene with the two Jesuit priests sat on the stairs, just after the first part of the exorcism. Friedkin was wrong not to include this scene in the original cut, because it contains all the dread of the film, and also the required hope the audience craved for as relief, not just from the visceral assault on their senses, but also, as something to take home with them as protection and defiance against their primal superstitions and fears.Father Karras, asks of Father Merrin, why this little girl had been chosen by such an evil and chaotic force? The whole film rests on Father Merrin's response, which is itself an exorcism when he states in a very tired and world-weary quietness, "?that it is to get us to despair. To make us think that God could not ever truly love us." Perhaps, the reason why 'God is dead' as Nietzsche declared is because we chose the concept of God to be dead? Numbed and deadened into its rejection, and the vacuum it left could only be filled with all the aspects of despair and purposelessness, and an absence of anything meaningful in our lives. It places us in a limbo of emptiness, and today's modern world utterly reflects this. It is nothing more than a mask of glitter and sparkle, but on the inside, it is rotten and putrid and infested with malignant despair. It is sterile, but we pretend it isn't.At the end of the film the child is saved through the sacrifice of the lives of the two Jesuit priests, but there was no winner of the battle. It was simply one of many spiritual skirmishes, and such scuffles of the spirit continue today, and that is both fault and blame of all religions, because of their canons and dogmas. Religion highlights the one important aspect of humanity that it never actually teaches, and that is, humanity is possessed, both figuratively and metaphorically, and evil souls are running the world. Is there a ritual of prayer to answer such sickness?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a league of its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people ask me what my favourite film is, without hesitation I reply 'The Excorcist'. This is usually met with a shocked reaction and then questions as to 'Why?' and 'You like horror movies then'?. Well no I don't actually like many horror movies as the plot and acting are usually non existent and the dialogue is like something a 6 year old will write. So let me take you back to the early 70s when I was a kid and my 11 year older sister went to the cinema to see The Excorcist. She slept with a crucifix under her pillow for months. Forward to the 80s and The Excorcist was released on video. I and my school friends sat round our TV and Betamax video recorder, curtains closed and watched the then infamous Excorcist. I must put some substance to this in that I had previously watched many horror movies, none of which really scared me, so it was with bible clutched that I watched. In awe. And that is how I can describe this movie to people that don't know it. Its AWESOME. And you know what? It's NOT a horror movie. Nothing happens for at least 1 hour (more if you watch the recommended uncut version). What makes this movie special is a number of things: Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Chris is truly believable. She genuinely looks like she is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. There is a sub plot running that most people miss. This is a Whodunnit on a grand scale. Is she possessed? Only her mum, who is recently divorced and feels guilty about it sees anything. Only Damien, who has lost his mum and blames himself and is losing his faith sees anything. Only Lancaster Merin, an old frail ill priest that has a back story that nearly cost him his life and job sees anything. Carl the butler? Burk accuses him of being a NAZI. In all this madness are we really supposed to believe that Regan is possessed when all around her are having problems. Watch this movie without believing the hype about the scariest movie ever. It isn't ( That title might go to the first Nightmare). Its a drama with 1st class acting, amazing story, multiple sub plots and amazing effects (No CGI!). A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie to be Seen Many Times Over from Different Prospectives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the 70's and Vietnam is coming to an end, woman's lib furthers its manifestations, the sexual revolution is in full swing and Alice Cooper's domination of America are some of the big happenings at this time, along with church attendance being at an all time high. Out of the blue comes along a low key movie about a little girl possessed by the Devil and having to undergo a 14th century excorcism. The timing couldn't have been better for this movie's release and it caught the world by storm. The most interesting thing about this particular movie is that it needs to be watched a few times. During one showing it's outright horror classic at its best. In another showing it's a muder mystery case. In another it makes us reflect on the balances of good vs evil the existence of God and the Devil and makes us reflect on our own values. It's one of those movies that are a must see throughout one's life even if it's only once and will keep you up many nights especially after just seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist (1973) Reviewed by Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook. Over forty years since its initial release, William Friedkins' adaptation of William Peter Blattys' novel of the same name remains one of the most powerful and thought provoking films ever made. Based on actual events 'The Exorcist' tells the story of the demonic possession of a twelve year old girl, Regan MacNeil, played, in a remarkable performance, by Linda Blair. Opening, with scenes of an archaeological dig in northern Iraq, Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) finds an amulet resembling the statue of Pazuzu, a demon he had defeated years earlier, Merrin realises the demon has returned to seek revenge. The scene quickly shifts to Georgetown, where single parent Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is balancing a busy acting career with bringing up her daughter Regan. We are also introduced to Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), a young priest who is struggling with doubts about his faith. One night, after playing with a Ouija board, Regans behaviour suddenly changes. From an initial strangeness, it soon escalates into something far more violent and disturbing. Having exhausted all medical avenues, Chris MacNeil turns in desperation, to the Catholic church. Confiding in Karras that she believes her daughter is responsible for the death of her friend and film director, Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran), he agrees to help. With the churches' blessing, the exorcism will be performed by Father Merrin, with Father Karras assisting. Arriving at the house, Merrin is left in no doubt he is there to do final battle with Pazuzu. With the exception of veteran actors, von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb as investigating police detective, Lieutenant William F. Kinderman, the cast were, at the time, relatively unknown and the film has several notable performances. From Ellen Burstyns increasingly distraught mother to Jason Millers priest, burdened with anguish by his loss of faith and guilt over the circumstances of his own mothers passing to Linda Blair as Regan. Despite scenes and dialogue that are still shocking today, 'The Exorcist' is, at heart, a deeply moral film. Good can triumph over evil, even if it sometimes comes at a terrible price. Not a horror classic. Just a classic. Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook.</fullReview>

In particular, 12 years old regan (Linda Blair) really doing the role very well . I wish I was so scared while watching this movie as possible new movies ..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched The Exorcist for the first time, which is crazy. I'm 25 years old and just finally watched the masterpiece for the first time after all these years of knowing of it. It's epic really. It's one of those films that I first heard of before adolescence but never watched. All these years, mind blowing. I'm a filmmaker and film buff but this film just took me a long time to get around to, which is super surprising because I have a thing for meaningful "horror" films. This film is so distinct. There's just something about it that keeps my mind racing. What is it really about? Is the girl supposed to be possessed or insane or are there parallel story lines? What is the intended story or what are the intended story lines? Is it meant to be interpreted in a few different major ways or what? Spoiler Alert:I actually laughed during it and never felt scared. The reasons being that I think there very well may be a strong story line going on below the surface, mainly about the girl having been sexually molested and that the priests were too and/or committed such acts, and maybe even on the girl. If you haven't thought so then re-watch the film with that in mind and you should totally see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin with, this is my favourite horror film! 33 years on and in my opinion the Exorcist holds its own it set a precedents for many horror films that followed.I have heard many present day viewers of this movie say it is funny in terms of special effects, that's their opinion! I first watched this in 1999 on VHS, it took me 2 years to pluck up the courage to watch it again without someone else in the house!I agree that the movie begins slowly in Iraq and watching for the first time it's easy to think at this point, "ok what's all the hype about, an old dude digging in the desert... Ooh terrifying"... I did that and as the film builds into a frenzy it's time for jokers and doubters to retract the boring film statement as this reviewer did once regan began her rapid decent into possession.Some horror films can end in a lacklustre fashion such as poltergeist 2 did but the exorcist just kept going right to the finale, classic!With top notch direction from friedkin and writing from Blatty we are treated to only the best Hollywood has to offer, not forgetting the awesome eerie theme from Mike oldfield (tubular bells).... Awesome effects, acting and theme if you are still undecided then I say watch this film with the lights on and a full house!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since watching this movie for the first time in around 1976, I have held it up as my No.1 movie of all time, and have never wavered from that opinion. I have watched it many times since, and it never fails to , I don't know, Shock? Thrill? Scare? None of those adjectives do it justice. It affected me, and still does, at a basic, almost primal level. Melodramatic perhaps, but that's how I feel. I probably came across it at the right time, an impressionable 14 year old, having just read Stephen King's Carrie. Then the movie being banned made it even more alluring. One of the movies big strengths is the depth of character background it goes into. Almost half the movie deals with the build up to the actual possession. Father Merrin's middle east archeology, Karras' mother and his wavering faith. After over 40 years, the movie has dated some, mostly from a fashion perspective, but this never detracts from the story. The only thing that stops me from giving the movie a 10, is the feeling that the middle section of the film, Regan's transition from an innocent little girl to a fully possessed host seems rushed, when it should have been more gradual. Going through the battery of hospital and psychiatric tests just seems like a nod to trying conventional means to explain Regan's condition.I know there are time restrictions etc. but that is my only, minor criticism. A must watch movie, and not only a horror movie, BUT, the greatest horror movie of all time.</fullReview>

While when reading a book I can definitely find a lot of better horror novels out there in comparing with Blattys one - for example Bram Stokers Dracula, in the movie there is no real atmosphere whatsoever in overall. Only things worth mentioning are scenes with possessed Reagan but other than that movie has chaotic plot build up, weak dialogs and only mediocre acting. Definitely not something I need to watch again or even look for spin offs. For example if I didn't read the book I wouldn't know from the movie why there was a scenes in Iraq at the beginning and what are connections for further possession.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Powerful film, with strong visual effects which can be disturbing, although gives the film the extra bit of horror you've been craving for. Small continuity errors but nothing major at all. Can be emotionally terrifying and will keep you on the edge of your seat continuously. The slow build up of the possession has been produced in a very creative way, along with the use of voices to add to the fear factor. I also am pleased that this film does not drag on for a prolonged amount of time, and is reasonable with the length of the scenes. Perhaps could be difficult to understand the relation of the beginning of the film to the actual story line but can be sorted out by watching it a few more times.I would highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in the supernatural. I would 100% watch this again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 7 when the Exorcist was first released and even at that age with no chance of seeing the movie I was aware of it,such was the frenzy surrounding it,thus it was going to be immortalised in history as the most notorious of all mainstream horror films. When the bbfc decided to ban it from video release several years later not on the grounds of extreme violence like the so called video nasties,but basically because they felt it was to scary for the common man,then it's long term reputation was cemented. To live up to the hype was always gonna be a big ask,and unfortunately it doesn't quite make it but makes a valiant attempt. The scenes of possession,head spinning,projectile vomiting and especially the shocking scene with the crucifix truly must have been disturbing to an early seventies audience,and also the opening sounds and first scenes in Iraq are unsettling which create a real feeling of evil and are all responsible for the almost hysterical reaction to the film. But times have changed,people like me of a certain age have witnessed so much horror since then both real and fictional that the mystique of the movie just doesn't wash anymore,worse still when I lent a copy of the film to some younger people during the time of its ban they found it laughable,that was probably more shocking! Overall the Exorcist is a brave movie it is still a classic but unfortunately like many things in Hollywood it is not ageing well. By the way there have been several sequels to this movie and one of them is a hidden gem possibly the real scariest film ever made! Please look at my top ten scary movies.</fullReview>

I thought that this film was dark and some of the scenes were discombobulating. I thought that the darker lighting used in some of the scenes was nice and it defiantly helped create the tone. I also found the language used to be interesting because it used profanity. I thought a really cool scene was when the girl was screaming in her room and every imaginable object was flying around the room. I also thought that the actors did a nice creating a sense of despair and uncertainty. I can't say I enjoyed watching this movie because I'm not a fan of these types of movies or content.

		<fullReview>Where should I start?There are many things that make The Exorcist a truly unique film. A movie like this hadn't been made before when it came out, and it took everyone who saw it by surprise.Many things shown in this were past the lines that people thought had been drawn in movie-making: The girl's head spinning 360 degrees, the multiple obscenities spoken by the possessed throughout the film, need I mention the crucifix scene? Before The Exorcist, the only popular religion-based horror movie that I know of was Rosemarie's Baby, and in comparison, that wasn't even edgy.However, I personally think this movie relies on its shocks more than its actual scares. I find this movie more shocking and disgusting (green projectile vomit, anyone?) than scary. The actual scary scenes I saw in this were the spider-crawl down the stairs, and, of course, the crucifix scene. Other than that, it's mostly profanity and green vomit.I guess you do have to see this movie at least once in your life, though, because it has a GREAT soundtrack (Tubular Bells), and you will never find another movie like it.3/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is one of those movie that you have to see before you die. like titanic and Aladdin. although you don't really find out the reason behind some of those things, occasionally its good in a movie to have some unanswered questions. i think that its a classic. as i have NEVER been scared wile watching a movie it was purely for entertainment value it certainly delivered. i was pushed into hysterics and enjoyed every minute of it but the beginning of the movie??? i mean what was with that? i thought for a minute that i had got the wrong movie out and slumped back into my chair in a bad mood, but it definitely just gets better and better without a dull moment it keeps your eyes glued to the screen weather your laughing or crying at least you wont be bored! not really one to watch with the family tho, its a movie i definitely recommend! 10/10 thumbs up 4 sure</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't know if anyone has experienced this or not. First time I saw this movie, thought it was the best horror film. Still do. One of the reasons that supports that opinion is the crazy things that has happened to me every time I saw the damned movie. First time I saw it at my friend's house; later that night, his grandmother unexpectedly died. Later on, I saw it at my house. I kept hearing noises outside as if someone was walking back and forth on our driveway. i looked outside, nobody there but the noises continued. Me and my mom couldn't figure out where it was coming from. Last time I saw it, at another friend's house, sounds started coming from the oven, like tapping sounds. Then, at the part where Father Merin enters Reagen's house, my friend's sister shrieked really loud from upstairs, scaring the hell out of us. Could say it was just me going crazy if it had happened to just me, but my mom and friends all experienced this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a review of the 1973 version, but a contrast of the two existing versions. THE EXORCIST was completed in 1973 as a 140 minute film, and the studio asked director William Friedklin (THE GUARDIAN) to make it a two-hour affair. In 1998, the film was released on DVD as a 25th Anniversary Edition and it featured most of the deleted material. One was the spiderwalk scene, then there was the dialogue between Karras and Merin at the stairs, and then the alternative ending. In 2000, the film was re-released on theaters as "The Version You've Never Seen" featuring 12 minutes of extra footage and digitally restored picture and sound. I will list and analyze the major changes to one version and the other, and explain why I still prefer the original cut.-First, let me start with the major difference: This is the best THE EXORCIST has ever looked or sounded. The new transfer blows the 1998 one out of the water. The film looks like it was made yesterday. The new sound is well done and superior in every level and the recent (and improved) extra sound effects are welcome. THE EXORCIST broke new ground in sound recording when it was originally released, and the legacy is kept on.-The first big change is right before the opening credits. It is a rather effective tracking shot of the house the film takes place and then it follows to the rainy streets. What follows is a still shot of the church. This was done in order to make a beginning difference from the 1973 version to the new one, and to prevent the unfamiliar audience to think the entire movie will take place in Northern Iraq. This is a small, harmless change.-There are CGI-inserted subliminal images all over the movie. Most of them are shadow interplays or quick flashes of Reagan's deformed face in the shadows and they are followed by creepy music cues making their existence noticeable. There are more digitally enhanced changes: The first is a quick morph in Reagan's face when she looks up to the doctor while being hypnotized. Then, the morph of Karras' possessed face in the ending is improved from a quick cut to an actual on-screen morph. Damien also sees his dead mother's reflection on the window. Overall, these digitally inserted additions are well done but unnecessary.-Some moments of the original are cut. One of them is the F word. Again, harmless changes.-Now the first big change: The inclusion of the first visit to the doctor. This is when Chris takes Reagan for a check-up because she has been acting weird these days, and the doctor prescribes her the then-unknown Ritalin. The scene with Chris and the doctor at the office is effective and necessary in order to understand later parts of the movie ("the doctor said...") but Linda Blair's individual moments in during check-up are badly acted and should have been quickly trimmed.-The second is the famous "spiderwalk" scene. It takes place right after Chris learns Burke is dead. Now, this is not the real scene. Instead, the original material is played on fast forward and a new take of blood coming from Reagan's mouth was inserted. Fade to black. The original scene had Reagan turn around, move her tongue, and attack Sharon. Director William Friedklin wanted to cut this scene and it was a wise move. The scene feels gratuitous, out-of-place, and it was too early. It really breaks the downbeat feel of the scenes around it. I still have no idea why William allowed it to be here *cough* money *cough* and the new Friday the 13th-like "shock music" is terrible.-Karras now listens to an old tape of Reagan as she talks to her father. This is one touching new addition, because it shows how Karras is starting to feel sorry and connect to the girl. It is one welcomed change.-The dialogue between Merrin and Karras at the stairs is not really necessary but it doesn't hurt the film either. In fact, it is a rather well-written scene.-The new ending is, indeed, stupid. Sorry for such an immature take on it, but it is. Screenwriter Blatty defends this ending saying that it was necessary for the audience to feel that the goodness was restored. Friedklin prefers the old ending because he wanted THE EXORCIST to be an open-ended movie where it would be left for the audience to take their own conclusions and he didn't feel it was necessary to explain it. I agree with Friedklin, the original noir-like ending featuring Dyer looking down the Hitchcock steps and then walking away while Tubular Bells played was simply perfect. The new extension of it establishing a new friendship between Dyer and Kinderman feels forced. And why did Friedklin allow it back again?Overall, the original version is still the one to watch for. While it looks and sounds better, the new version is nothing but a cash-in. The spiderwalk and the new ending are drastic changes, and not for the better. The 1998 DVD contained most of these deleted scenes, a then-restored transfer (while it's not as good as this one, it is far from terrible) and excellent extra features to close it up. Still, the film itself is a masterpiece that will live on as one of the scariest movies ever made. Case closed, and I am tired of all these recent re-edits of modern classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a story about star LINDA BLAIR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I look in the mirror tonight and I remember this story, I remeber it like I was looking at myself in a mirror. (strange comment) After this film was released there was a incident in MINNESOTA 1973, in which the star LINDA BLAIR showed up with a boys grandfather who had connections to media and some others to see him after crime spree. Miss Blair talked with the boy for hours coming to see him several times during her brief stay. She had to leave at the end yet the incident was somehting she heard about and wanted to come see him. As I recall hearing this she was a very nice lady and talked on many topics primarily herself and a movie she did....she asked if the boy hated her...he said no. His logic being crimes happen...because some weirdos saw a movie and did somethings does not mean she was responsible or the makes. The incident was not publicized and not a publicity stunt. She got very personal with him..sometimes he would slip in and out of a coma like state after getting his ass kicked..some say saving another boy from a beating. There is more to this tale. yet, even at that age she had a maturity that rivaled some adult hollywood stars. the topics varied from herself to her life to her work..her family, school and type casting..also the nature of spiritualism. A interesting story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The super classic horror movie of all times??? Maybe. I haven't read all 300 odd comments, so if this repeats someone, sorry. One aspect that cannot be corrected about The Exorcist is the use of the music, or rather the non-use. There were numerous listings during the end title for various music that was "suppose" to be in the show, but wasn't. A joke by Director Friedkin. What wasn't a joke is the fact that Bernard Herrmann was slated to do this score, and was going to compose it on an organ in a cathederal in England. As a fan of Herrmann's music, I can only imagine what he would have done. For the un-enlightened: Herrmann started with boy-genius Orson Welles. Have you heard "Citizen Kane" or "The Magnificent Ambersons". How about "The Devil and Daniel Webster"? Okay, let's jump into the 50's. One of the greatest Sci-Fi scores: "The Day the Earth Stood Still". Many works for Hitchcock. How about the fantastic score assisting James Mason and party on their "Journey To The Center Of The Earth"? He did work on the "Twilight Zone" TV series. He gave us fantasy scores for "7th Voyage of Sinbad" &amp; "The 3 Worlds Of Gulliver". Still don't remember his work, try this the original "Psycho", which was re-used by Danny Elfman (Batman, Sleepy Hollow) for the re-make (Mr. Elfman is a terrific composer, and would have given us, I'm sure, an excellent score to accompany the movie, but, can you really replace perfection?). Again from the 60's, the original "Cape Fear", and, again this score was re-used by Elmer Bernstein (The Magnificent Seven, To Kill A Mockingbird) for the re-make. Certainly Mr. Bernstein was capable of giving a worthy score, but, chose perfection again. Unfortunately, Friedkin didn't choose perfection, and we all lost what would probably be the scariest score ever written. THAT would have made this movie perfect, and THAT would have REALLY made it scarey!!! Don't think so, check out the original Psycho (not the remake, please, no offense Mr. Elfman). This score was done entirely with string instruments. No percussion, no horns, no winds, just strings. IF that didn't help scare you, then nothing will. Would The Exorcist be a better picture for this? Your damn straight it would. I'm sure that Mr. Friedkin would put his own spin on this, he already did in an interview years ago with Elmer Bernstein. His choice is what we have to live with, and we can only wonder the possibilites that were passed on. Shame to you Mr. Friedkin. Your movie is good, but dry. A good score, or even better, a great score, a score that would grab you like an icy hand on the back of your neck (does that sound familar Mr. Friedkin) would have REALLY helped here. The Exorcist reminded me of the first time I saw the 1931 "Frankenstein" and "Dracula". No music, and tho both were well made and rather creepy, they were both rather dry, due to the lack of a good score. (Note: Dracula has been updated with a quartet score by Philip Glass, the problem that I have with it is that it's more chamber music, NOT horror music. Sorry.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The demon here is a great character. You aren't sure if you should be disgusted by his actions or amused. At least he keeps his promises. On a totally different level, if you don't buy the demon angle, you could say that 12 year old Regan was doing all this horrible stuff to herself... Imagine all the attention you'd get if you claimed you were possessed...To me, the scariest part of this movie wasn't anything the demon did. It was a scene right at the beginning where Father Merrin is in Jerusalem. He's sitting in a room and suddenly the clock on the wall stops ticking. Is evil present here? Has the demon announced himself? Or does the clock need new batteries? So much going on...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Exorcist" is one of the best horror films ever. It is one of my most favorite horror films to watch. The acting and direction are brilliant and Linda Blair is especially superb. She should receive top billing (she is 7th billed in the movie). Everyone basically knows the plot, about a 12-year old girl possessed by a demonic spirit/ while two priests try to rid her of the demon. The climatic exorcism scenes are classic and much-talked about--the cursing and bloody crucifix scenes are still powerful today. There are lots of little details in this movie that people don't notice, and an eerie score and beautiful photography. At times haunting, as well as gross, disgusting, graphic, disturbing...and lots of other things. It is, simply put, one of the best. I rest my case. Followed by two sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist is shocking. The movie starts off slow and builds in excitement until the very end. Some people say movies that make you think are the best. I disagree. The best are like the Exorcist where you don't think about anything. You just watch in amazement on what's going on. You are not thinking the movie would be better if or what's going to take place next. Your mind is clearly on the movie. For example, when Reagan turns her head around and says, "You see what she did?" I was completely glued to the screen and I think you will be too. In fact, from then on I was hooked. Even better yet, it's like riding a rollercoaster with each new drop even better than the last.Everything about the movie is first rate. Ellen Burstyn acting is excellent. The script is great. The special effects are great. The direction is superb. I seen thousands of movies, and the Exorcist is the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of you probably know alot about this film or you've read a lot of review about how great it is or how bad it is. I think it is a great film but I won't talk about that that much. I want to tell you about things that weren't used in the film that arguably would have made the film even better.2 things: 1) They cut out a scene where Linda Blair does the spider walk down the stairs. She is bent backward in a very "chiropractic" looking position and she crawls down the stairs. This is such a creepy scene, and it wasn't used for certain reasons.2) Composer Lalo Schifrin's musical score was thrown across the street, literally, by director Friedkin. With a recently released soundtrack you can actually hear Lalo's original music. It is one of the most creepiest and most original scores I have ever heard for a horror film and none of it was used. Instead we ended up with "Tubular Bells" which maybe works in the film but isn't nearly as good as Lalo's music. However the rest of the music that was used in the film, consisting of modern classical composers' music, composers such as Penderecki and Crumb, works perfectly well. You can watch cut footage in the 25th anniversary release documentary, and you can hear Lalo Schifrin's score in a recently released soundtrack.</fullReview>

I have to admit that I don't watch the movie very often because of it's length and simply because it scares the hell out of me (literally). You know that a horror movie is classic when it continues to astound and horrify you. The special effects are excellent and so is the script--though I've yet to completely understand the long, conversational, non-dramatic scenes. Because movies 30 years ago were not all necessarily that Hollywood extravaganza-oriented, The Exorcist was definitely of-it's-time and nothing less than a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The way the world changes and the way people look at their religion are two different things. The world has changed since the original release in which I was 10 years to be born. I'm sure people have heard stories of reactions to the film. Fainting,crying and a miscarrage.But the films tone and theme aren't to really scare but to look at your religion. When you have lost hope you must turn and ask your religion what to do. I think that theory will never change. I believe that is what makes this movie.True the movie did scare the be-jesus out of me. But it did more than that. It made me look at the love between mother and child. Father Damien Karras is struggling with the fact that he couldn't help his mother. Chris Macneil feels the same way towards her daughter. Theses bizarre things can't be explained. And in some way you know that Karras and Chris feel that they have connected in an emotional way. But as Karras realizes that he can't help his now deceased mother he feels he can do right by helping the young girl.People for whom say this movie isn't scary or it sucks don't see what this movie is really about. It's not a flat out horror movie. It's a movie about faith. That is what scares people the most. Their faith in their religion and that they have turned their back on it. Such as Chris and Regan. So it tells you to give everything you deny a second chance. Look closer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time seems to blunt the effectiveness of some horror movies, but The Exorcist isn't one of them. The real day-to-day feel of the movie (i.e. we're not in outer space or something) only feeds the fear. If you're a religious person, or were brought up Catholic, there are definite religious overtones that can definitely get under your skin (the quick shot of the defiled Virgin Mary really got under mine). The visual effects are stunning and repulsive, but what I noticed this time around (again) is how important the sound track is in setting the horrifying mood of the movie. Got to see the DVD 25th anniversary edition, which has some extra scenes (I know it has a second subliminal vision of the scary-as-hell face of one the demon). No ordinary movie, watch it if you dare (seriously).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the misfortune to be allowed to watch The Exorcist while I was very young. Needless to say, it scared me a lot. Although the movie haunted me for the rest of my life, it was just the horror part of it that stayed with me. But recently I read Blatty's novel and watched the movie again, and this time I came to a much better understanding about the book and the movie. The book does a superb job of explaining the inner conflict. While the movie did not focus on this conflict, it is left to the discerning audience to identify the conflict and relate it to their own lives. Notions of Good and Evil should not be limited to the realm of church and occult: They are the part of our everyday existence. The Exorcist, to me, is not about possession or salvation. It is about our inner conflicts in everyday life. One must read the book to fully understand the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still can turn heads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The difficulty with waiting 27 years to see a film like this is that you can lose perspective. The original can seem like a copy of the copies, and special effects that were state-of-the art at the time can seem amateurish. That said, I found the film to be much better than I'd expected. It's well acted and genuinely scary. I watched it late on a rainy night in a cold room and when I went to bed, I was a little freaked. More than I can say after catching Halloween 20 years after its release. Weird though, Linda Blair reminded me of the girl in the Pepsi commercials, speaking in deep male voices. I always thought that Pepsi kid needed a good exorcism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>provocative, unsettling, much documented cult horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is an impressive film for the reasons one might least expect. The effects now appear antiquated; heads on poles, doddering wardrobes, grotesque make-up, organic spinach soup for vomit etc. Meredith McCambridge's growling echoes childhood nightmares of ?things that go bump in the night', teamed with the rumblings of a disgruntled stomach. The exorcism scene is a transparent attempt at fulfilling all fifteenth century documented accounts of such spooky goings-on. The swearing is the laughable stuff of eighteen certificate Manga cartoons. So, why the uproar?Why the dear? Why the fainting, puking and spontaneous flooding of churches? Because, this film plays on our ?What If?' insecurities. What if this is all more than pure cinema and exploitative publicity? And if so, what does this imply? Forces of good and evil form the basis for all cinematic classics - just watch come Disney or Lucas - but in such abstracted ways that theory seldom eclipses theatre. The reason the Exorcist still speaks to an audience now familiar with the power of computer generated fear, is that one always has this question mark of spirituality hanging over their dusty halos or polished horns. The fact remains that the Exorcist will remain disturbing for as long as the majority of us remain unsure. Ellen Burstyn (the mother) agreed to appear in the film, only on the condition that her line ?I believe in the Devil' would be cut. Think about it. Accepting the existence and/or possibility of an omnipotent dark force invading your merry little quiet life requires not only courage but also belief. Shock tactics involving bloody crucifixes and four-letter words fail when their likelihood in reality equals zero. That is why ?The Exorcist' is so terrifying. Special effects means nothing when your belief is suspended?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So genuinely horror, and still so much more than that!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning of the movie I wasn't so pleased, but what it became turned out to be not only one of those storylines told so fluently and conclusively that you can surely watch it again and again, but also really scary. I was kind of excited when I watched it (on TV), and afterwards I was shivering and couldn't stop.A problem was that I had to watch parts of it with my mother in the room who kept asking questions like whether I don't believe this crap or whether this isn't pure s**t in every commercial break. But that's because she doesn't see that the movies is more than just your all-day pleasant neurotic romantic comedy. There are so many possibilities, among them getting scared, getting angry, getting disgusted. I love these unpleasant emotions in movies if only they are strong enough, and "The Exorcist" is disgusting and scares the crap out of you.So I was stunned and caught myself thinking it was perfect, though there were innumerable things about it that bothered me.(*) It's actually a very cheap means to create terror, having a little girl uttering the words "f**k me" repeatedly in a strange, masculine voice.(*) The ending is way too fast to make sense.(*) The horrible emotions the mother must feel with her daughter having become such a THING are a bit overlooked.(*) and so forth.But after all the movie is a horror movie and what it achieves is just great. The impact on the viewer's emotional state is devastating. All performances are superb, though I don't really see why Linda Blair received an Oscar nominee, but she wasn't bad at all.The peak of insanity, that makes this a horror flick, is left for the last couple of minutes, before that the storyline goes through normal every-day issues (medicine, death), keeping the viewer interested and also with that certain quality of pain, anguish and spookiness. There's a great second storyline with the Ellen Burstyn character's Hollywood friends; and along with the terror comes some enjoyable ridicule on the Catholic Church.Not definitely, but probably a 9 out of 10 in my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one film that truely deserves the title Best horror film ever. It has everything that a good horror film should have, Suspense, Tension, Shocks and Characters that you actually feel for. I only saw it this year as it has only just been released on video in England after being banned for 15 years but it still disturbs and the bits that do aren't the 'Crucifix' sequence or the Head spinning but the brief flashes of images like the Demons head and Karras's Mother as well as the overall evil atmosphere. Jason Miller deserved an Oscar for this and it's one of Cinema's great injustices that he didn't win one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still remember the first time I watched this movie, I was 14 years old and alone in the living room, i thought that a movie that is older than i am is not worth watching, but man was I wrong! I found the start of the film to be quite slow and boring but when I got through about 15-20 minutes of the movie that's when i got REALLY scared, i would have to check behind me every 10 minutes to see if anything was there, which is unusual for me because i can usually predict what's going to happen in a horror movie! The acting was excellent, i especially loved Linda Blair (Regan)when she was possesed, she made it look too real, that whenever she came on i wanted to put the light on! This movie is definitly for more mature people, with it's complex storyline and amazing but simple graphics this movie is one for you to watch( that is only if you like 20/25 year old horror movies) i give this classic piece of horror movie history 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still packs a Horrible Knock Out Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally saw this movie when I was 12yrs old. The same age as the main character Regan who gets possessed. My older cousins kept talking about the movie and I nagged my parents until my father snuck me to the theater w/o telling my mom. I need not tell you that I am still scarred from this movie.When I originally saw the movie, I only made it about 1/2 through then had to leave the theater. I didn't see the movie start to finish until I was 16 and was still terrified.Now that I gained some perspective I bought the 25th Anniversary edition of the movie and watched with some objectivity. It wasn't as scary when viewing it through the eyes of 30+ year old. The effects seemed dated, and I was able to focus on the movie rather than just the gore/shock value.It was actually an extremely well made movie! The fact that this happens to an innocent 12yr old girl is excellent. It certainly would not have the same effect if it was a 30 old man. If you are religious, you will be undoubtedly sucked into believing the possibility that something like this could actually happen.To me that is the strength of this movie. While some things in this movie appear to be not credible I found myself still believing that it COULD HAPPEN. I kept saying to myself, "How could this be happening?" Yet it still seemed believable.While it didn't scare me the same way it did 20 years ago, it is still the best horror movie I've ever seen. After watching it I felt drained. I was tense the entire time I was watching it. Like I had been crazy a rollercoster ride. With all the garbage that is put out today, this movie will only endure over time.Also, for all you young "kids" who thought it was actually funny. I challenge you to watch it in a dark room by yourself. Not with a group of friends poking fun at it. I guarantee you this film will have a much different effect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When originally released I was too young and couldn't sneak in the local flea pit to see this (and admittedly a little too scared to try too hard), I was witness to the hysteria that surrounded it but had to settle for the book (which was scary enough in its own right). It wasnt until 1983 that I finally managed to see this on video (just before the ban) and I found it the most chilling cinematic experience of my life (there were awful coincidences happening in my house throughout the movie that scared the living bejeezus outta me). I moved to the States in 1997 and The Exorcist, along with Clockwork Orange, were the first two movies that I rented and whereas some of the impact has been reduced, proably due to an over exposure to gore in the preceeding years, the deeper tremors can still be felt..it still functions at the psycholgical level just as effectively..a view shared by my then 12year old daughter. The use of subliminal images (of a face painted Damien Karras) serve to highten the underlying fear that runs throughout this movie...somtimes its what you dont see, or what you think you see that delivers the real shocks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better the First Time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw The Exorcist on my own, underage and unprepared back in 1974. It terrified me. My walk home from the cinema meant that I had to cut across dark, isolated farmland. Every noise of every hidden creature became a demon in the shadows. I recently watched it a second time. It is still a relatively scary film, but it has been parodied so many countless times that I feel it is now impossible to get the original effect. The world is increasingly less innocent even by 1970s standards. Children are now brought up on diets of violent video games and films. It is hard to know how a movie is ever going to capture the raw horror that this one once did. But then again, - Older people were probably saying the same thing about King Kong!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to make this movie more intense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made. To be fair, though, the level of intensity has a strong correlation with your religious beliefs. If you're an atheist, it won't be terribly frightening, but if you know that this stuff is real, then you'll be left shaking.The movie's plot is a 12 year old girl is possessed by the devil, and her mother enlists the help of a priest to rid her of this evil. If you are aware of the history of demonic posession you will see how accurate this movie is. Notice how Father Karraes struggles with his faith, and how that affects his ability to deal with the devil. Look up Mark chapter 5 in a Bible and make the connections, particularly what the demon would rather have happen to him (them). Brilliant translation, depending on your beliefs. Don't infer too much, though.The movie draws you in psychologically. Just imagine being in that situation (and the way the film is crafted it's not very hard to imagine), faced with a power you previously did not believe in, while watching your child mutilate herself and utter unspeakable things. Not to mention all the supernatural stuff (shaking bed, wind in closed room, moving furniture, etc.).To experience this movie best, you should read up on some of the beliefs of the church, instances of possession, and what it all means. Don't pay attention to the gore or special effects -- focus on how your life would be changed if you experienced such an evil, and how you would react to a power that is more real than you could have imagined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is indeed a landmark in both special effects and themes carried within the film. While the film is not especially scary, particularly to nineties audiences and non-believers, the film still has a very powerful impact on those who see it. The only problem is, that now it is back on video in the UK as part of a wave of lifting bans on films (I believe The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is also on its way to video), some of the mystery and appeal has now vanished. After watching this film for the first time ever this afternoon, I was slightly disappointed. Because of the build up the film was given, I received slightly less than I was expecting. But nevertheless, the only crime is that we were deprived of this masterpiece in the UK for 15 years, as it has outstanding artistic and cinematic merit, regardless of whether it truly is or isn't the scariest movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film you wont forget in a hurry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Re-Releasing films is always a risk for studios.It is impossible for them to gauge the potential success,or potential disaster.Re-Releasing a film banned in Britain for 25 years,and seen only by people lucky enough to be cinema-going in 1973,is a highly dangerous exercise,though one to be praised by the censors. The Exorcist no longer carries the lure of forbidden spice.An official release guarantees it the loss of the thrill,the new generation that are being introduced to it simply do not get it,viewing only on the surface,not realising that its not the fact that a twelve year old girl is capable of masturbating with a crucifix,its WHY she does it that is truly disturbing.The acting in The Exorcist is above and beyond the call of duty for a horror film,with Ellen Burstyn dazzling as the loving mother suffering so much.Desperate,frightened and helpless.Max Von Sydow adds a deft touch of reality and gravitas,and Linda Blair as the child Regan starts her descent with great subtlety.The trick with The Exorcist is the air of realism that surrounds it,and while the special effects have dated somewhat(pea soup)it is what they symbolise that is important.While The Exorcist is no longer considered to be evil,more than just a movie,there are images that disturb(Regan getting a spinal tap for instance)and if you watch it carefully enough,you'll never forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best horror film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I wasn't around when "The Exorcist" first came out, so I may not be able to appreciate it the way people did in the 70s when ambulances were standing by outside screenings, but I am almost the odd one out of all my age group as far as opinion on this legendary film goes.People say it is funny. WHAT IN THE NAME OF SANITY? Unthinkable power, perfect performances, and truly gripping, dramatic, harrowing imagery that plays games with the mind, along with suspense that turns the stomach around like a roundabout. People say that "Scream" is the best horror movie. WHAT IN THE NAME OF LIFE ITSELF? Some teenagers playing around with the 'rules' of horror movies? Just a well-made post-modern teen comedy flick that is a bit on the cheesy side. I suppose, though, that the problem with today's audiences is that they expect 'thrills-and-spills', while older audiences expect (and expected when this film came out for the first time) power. "The Exorcist" is packed with the latter, while "Scream" is high on the former.Critic Mark Kermode may have overrated the film just a tad when he described it as 'the greatest movie ever made', but he was MUCH closer to the truth than the Church of Scotland official who said that he'd rather take a bath in pig manure than watch it.</fullReview>

The documentary itself is scary then you are already tingling with fear and ready to sit through the movie and be even more terrified. Each and every time I get up the nerve to watch, I get butterflies and cold spells! When the movie is over, I quickly shut the tape off and rewind (no Tubular Bells, please!)

True, it is prime horror, focusing on the one person/thing.... I was completely terrified of the thing that was inside Regan, while it ranted and raved at the people around it.... but the other people in the film will keep you very much interested with their parts in the film as well. Max Von Sydow is excellent as the Exorcist, as he nearly always is in many of the films he stars in(does he ever stop playing religious parts?)..... Ellen Burstyn is great as the distraught mother..... and Linda Blair creates an aura of malevolence as Regan/Pazuzu (although Mercedes McCambridge voiced the part of the demon, to terrifying extent). This film will terrify you, compel you, and furthermore will lead you to question the eternal question - is there heaven and hell? I certainly believed in hell when this film was over!</fullReview>

Its hidden story is about a girl changing into a woman. It is the story of a little girl going through puberty and the adults in her life struggling to deal with her journey to womanhood. What's this?? This guy must be crazy you say? It's true. Watch the film again to see what I mean. Keep this thought in mind and you might see a completely different movie.

		<shortDescription>Horrific and Cinematic Mastery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The surfeit of horror and horror-themed movies topping the box office in the recent weeks as the summer of 1999 ends is evidence of the power that fright holds over moviegoers. We've been glued to our chairs or heckling callously at The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense, Stigmata and others. As a prominent horror movie-maker once said, you never forget the guy who frightens you the first time. That guy can be Leatherface, Jason Vorhees, Freddy Kruger, Norman Bates, an exceptionally large flock of birds in the air, a coven of next-door neighbors in cahoots with a devil-worshiping obstetrician, Guy Woodhouse, Jack Torrance, Henry the Serial Killer ... or Regan MacNeil.It's odd to think that, with all the suspense and horror movies we've experienced in the past 30 years -- all the serial murderers, the abusing husbands, the ghosts, the obsessive "other" women, the evil nannies and dentists and that Chucky doll that never seems to be properly destroyed -- the experience that tends to put America on edge the most is that of traditional good versus evil. Sure, you can surmise that running from a bunch of crazed slaughterhouse-types wanting to eat you and use your bones as chair legs and your skin as furniture upholstery is something like battling evil. But let's be honest. How does it compare to the look of despair on a mother's face as she sees the one thing she couldn't have realistically imagined: an exorcist coming to drive a demon out of her daughter?OK, it's a dramatic description ... and far-fetched at that. But watching William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist -- or reading the novel, for that matter -- slowly but mercilessly brings you to that strange sense of dread and hope when that exorcist finally approaches the door and ignores the screaming of the demon upstairs. By then, you're as cold as the scene appears. Somewhere deep inside, your breath is as white as the breath in Regan's bedroom.The Exorcist marries crafty editing, intelligent storytelling and gripping detail into a single, beautifully told tale of demonic possession and the slow, eventual path toward understanding the need to drive the demon away. With superb acting, notably from Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller and Linda Blair, all Oscar nominees for this movie, and a still-exceptional series of special, realistic effects, The Exorcist doesn't make promises to scare you. It makes no pretense at all. It just lets the macabre story unfold in front of you. Sure, a lot of people with today's multi-million-dollar special effects sensibilities will laugh off specific details. But what movie today is going to require you to sit through such hellish situations as stabbing-like female masturbation with a crucifix or through such profanity? We don't stomach things like we used to. Perhaps The Exorcist was before its time, but where would we be today without it?Before you judge a movie, remember its conventions and understand its message. And keep in mind that this movie isn't trying to make you like it or continue watching it. Its seamlessness is based on one simple notion: the story goes on, whether you accept it or not. And the power of Christ compels you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic. See it again on DVD soon. Banishes the Blair Witch Blues...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this millinneum summer, when little stick figures and poor camera work and three whiny improvers have convinced America to be very afraid, it can be instructional and even inspirational to revisit the truly great works of the horror genre.The Exorcist may be the best ever. Now available on a beautiful DVD transfer, this brilliant William Friedkin film looks better than ever. Devoid of the considerable hype which accompanied both the book and subsequent film of this title when first released in the seventies, the film actually grows in power. Director Friedkin, working a familiar vein, never once falls into the kind of cliches which endear the old Hammer and Castle films. It all looks and sounds fresh and real. The cast is simply perfect, the pacing is impeccable, the horror truly and deeply delivered directly to the viewer's soul.If you felt let down by all the hype (and then the reality) of The Blair Witch Project, or if you'd simply like to see one of the really great horror films, check this out soon, even if you've seen it before. I had, several times years ago. But The Exorcist, if anything, has gained power with time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate horror film...should have been called "Eyes Wide Shut"...score: 10 (out of 10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many GREAT horror films of the 20th Century on film, however, here is a film where I keep my eyes wide shut when I see it. William Friedkin brings to us the ultimate in horror movies - a simple story about the Devil and demonic possession. The actors give superb performances. Some have said the movie is slow, but that is the point. If we are to understand the plot, we must first understand the characters involved. The superb special effects steal the show as well (especially when the Devil uses Megan's body to spin his head around and reveal his true identity to the priest...again...my eyes were wide shut!) A top-notch thriller...score: a PERFECT 10!!! (out of 10.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Friedkin's film is a masterpiece. Being, if not the scariest, the most realistic film about the subject of possession. Mike Oldfield's Tubular bells gives me chills, along with the original music. The state of the art sound and sound editing are superb. This film really impressed me with its sound. The make-up was very morbid, and very well done. The acting is just fine, especially Max von Sydow and Jason Miller's THE POWER OF CHRIST REPELS YOU sequence. Even the dialogue is very shocking at times. The special effects are very realistic and convincing! They are also times of true power, moments that dig right into your heart, and move you so much, and moments that will just freak you out. The big shame though, is that not a lot of younger generation, or at least the majority, will appreciate the movie, dubbing it boring, or, not gory. Well....If you want to see teen-trash-rip offs of Halloween-films like SCREAM. go see Scream...But if you want to see a quality-classic-well made-horror-drama film. go see THE EXORCIST.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw this movie when it first came out and i went with three different guys on different dates and all three of them had to leave because they got sick!!!!! I made it through the first, second and third viewings with no problem, being the "scared, meek female" that i was. There were things done in this movie that at the time were never even thought of. It was truly the first gut wrenching horror film that was made. Nothing has come close to it since in terms of scaring the living daylights out of you, except perhaps The Blair Witch Project. A true classic!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What "possessed" me to watch this movie after dark by myself?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not kidding. I am a grown woman, have seen hundreds of horror movies, and even watching this in the middle of the day when it was sunny outside it gave me chills. In fact, a couple of scenes (like the head spinning) scared me so bad I almost started to CRY. I saw this movie on TV when I was in high school and for some reason it scared me WAY more now. The documentary was excellent, and I finally got to see the notorious "spiderwalk" scene that was cut out. I wanted to see this part for a long time, ever since I heard about it, but I didn't think I'd get to because I don't have a DVD player. I was thrilled that it was included, but YEEEESH it gave me the creeps. I think it was a great idea to remaster the sound, as the sound is one of the most frightening aspects of the movie. It rightly deserved the 1973 Academy Award for best sound. Her voice is creepy enough, but these horrible animal-like sounds come out of this little girl that make every hair on your body stand on end. I also didn't think upon a second viewing that I would find any scenes shocking as it takes a lot to shock me, and I am not exaggerating. Well, the scene with the crucifix made my jaw drop and I had to cover up my eyes, I couldn't watch! ( if you are easily shocked I would seriously recommend either fast-forwarding or NOT looking during this scene). What's also interesting in the documentary is hearing about how rough a shoot it was. Evidently Friedkin is not very well-liked by most of the actors who have worked with him, and you will find out they have good cause for this. But I have to admit, he got results, and this is one hell of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a good movie... but was I supposed to be scared?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, so it's a good horror... but it wasn't scary. I know though that it is probably a scary film for others, but I am 14 years old, and usually watch more recent horror movies like Species II... where the gore and things like that are common. There are plenty of movies out there that are more scary than The Exorcist. Wait though, I have to give the film credit, that this movie did freak me out though. But not in a good way. I was shocked at the bad and vulgar things in this movie. I mean, what about that little scene where the girl is getting raped by the Catholic cross thing? It's what the "devil" possessing her was saying that was so bad, and that shocked me that anyone could actually make a movie, and make a child actress say those things. But all in all, it is a cool horror movie, that is greatly made and anyone that likes horrors, and wants to give this movie a chance, (note to yourself: this isn't going to scare you though) I say, go for it. It's a good movie for it's time. I have noticed though that people have been complaining about this movie not being as scary as they thought. oh, Pleeease! Keep in mind this movie was made in 1973... so.. umm... it won't be as scary to people like me that sees this movie today in time, but still, it is freaky and cool. Rent this today! =) My votes?AGE THAT YOU SHOULD BE TO SEE THIS FILM: i'd say 14... HOW GOOD IT IS: i'd give it an 8/10 HOW SCARY IT IS: umm... 1 being= it wouldn't scare a baby, to 10 being= it would scare the crap right out of you... i would give it a 5.RENT THIS TONIGHT...

		<fullReview>The first time i saw this i was at the tender age of twelve. You can imagine the nightmares i had back then. However, i recently rented this film again, just for old time's sake, and guess what? IT'S NOT SCARY!! Which isn't to say it's rubbish. It's a very good film, the acting is spot on and the projectile vomiting and levitation scenes are still classics, but whereas the first time round they caused you to have annoyingly wet sheets, these days they just make you smile. It's like "Led Zeppelin 2", it rocks the first time you hear it, but it wears down with age. Which makes "The Exorcist" the "Led Zeppelin 2" of horror films. ROCK ON!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A defining horror film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is so great about "The Exorcist" is that it combines the atmosphere and visual flare of the great old horror films and it also adds the shock effects (it was actually one of the movies that defined shock effects)of any modern horror movie for a combination that has made it about the only movie I cannot watch alone.The theological underpinnings of the story also add to it's unsettling power. Friedkin's ground breaking approach to music and sound effects also contribute to it's power.Perhaps the most unsettling image I can think of, in ANY movie, is the close up of Regan after the head turning sequence in the exorcism. It wasn't until later than I realized that it was 2 faces superimposed together (Eileen Deitz and depending on who who talk to Linda Blair OR Linda Blair's fake head used for the revolving shot). With the unbalanced features and the different eyes, how could it be anything else but unsettling?About 80 to 85% of the horror movies ever made are total crap(although, it's sometimes enjoyable crap). That makes the 10 to 15% of the good and great horror movies so precious. At the top of the my list of those movies is "The Exorcist".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On finally watching The Exorcist, it left me wondering just why the hell the film was banned on video in Britain. It is extremely tame compared to many films and so it is good to see the film being actually available (A Clockwork Orange, please take note). The film itself seems to have been butchered in the editing room and would benefit with previously cut footage being restored for later prints, thus extending the viewing time and making the film into a classic, rather than the flawed masterpiece it currently is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror sans camp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a very sophisticated look at the controversial phenomenon of demon possession. Friedkin's film presents modern opinions and attitudes about possession: the psychologists and neurologists looking for brain lesions; the liberal priest who doubts possession and fears making the Church look anachronistic by entertaining the notion; the old-school priest who still thinks in Latin and has experienced Satan's reality and his ability to destroy lives.Linda Blair plays Regan, the twelve-year-old daughter of a popular actress, played by Ellen Burstyn. Regan likes to play with a Ouija board, and before she knows it, she's attracted the attention of a spirit named "Captain Howdy." Catholic demonologists call this first phase of possession Obsession. As Regan becomes more intimate with the spirit, It becomes bolder, upsetting her emotionally and kinesthetically acting out. This is called Manifestation, if memory serves (I studied for the priesthood, but dropped out). Finally, Captain Howdy takes control and soon we have Linda Blair at her projectile-vomiting best. Full-fledged Possession! Burstyn goes to the Catholic Church, thinking they can help, and meets a young priest named Father Kinderman (Lee Cobb). Together they try to get Regan help, and in the end decide to exorcise her after conventional means fail. The Exorcist (Max Von Sydow) comes and starts the exorcism. From there, it's a terrifying ride.This movie scares you, disturbs you, and grosses you out. However, the characters are well-developed, the dialogue is terriffic, and the special effects and make-up never go over the top. Even though the little girl floats and her head goes around 360 degrees, you never lose the willing suspension of disbelief. You might, however, lose your lunch.I suggest this movie to everyone, but to Catholics in particular. The mystical bureaucracy of the Church is depicted quite accurately with no hyperbole or cynical Catholic bashing. Not to be seen by children you wish to keep emotionally healthy. Grade: A+.Fun stuff to watch for: homage to cheap motel Vibro-beds, flying Ouija planchette, Regan as the life of the party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist: Highly overrated, or pure genius?Well, I'd stick with pure genius myself. The Exorcist is one of the very few horror movies that isn't hilarious when it's supposed to be dead serious and/or scary. It has the great ability of pulling at the senses and, dare I say it, leaving you on the edge of your seat begging for more. Even though it may be rather offensive to some folk (especially the highly religious or weak of heart), it should be a forced viewing for many people, including most of today's so-called horror movie makers.Also, the influence this film has had on pretty much every horror film (and quite a few films in general) CANNOT be ignored. It's indirectly became a pop-culture icon that people seem to not really have caught onto yet -- both The Simpsons and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me have references to it, yet that'd fly over Joe Average's head. Which is very, very sad...In closing, this film, along with The Shining, is one of the best horror movies ever made. As stated, everyone who hasn't seen it should rush out and rent it. Now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though the film was made a good 8 years before I was born the stringent banning of it in the UK prevented me from seeing it for many years I finally caught The Exorcist, aged 14 on a dated VHS copy of the film. My friend and I instigated a horror sleep over, no girls, just him, me silence and a few shockers to while away the hours. After Halloween and Aliens, The Exorcist was the main event, 2am start. For the next two hours I was mesmerised by the tightly told story, the presence and threat of evil and the respite that there good should always triumph. Every time there is a slight noise from poor Regan's bedroom you don't know what to expect and the film's build up emphasises the sickly sweetness of Regan before her possession which makes you like her more and brings the contrast with the evil being she becomes. Linda Blair's performance stands out along with Father Karras, the character of which is brilliantly written. The psychological games between Karras and the demon are beautifully insinuated and even with minimal screen time, Karras' mother is used to torment the ailing priest in an exceptional scene. The BBFC have recently given the film a video release, citing that the film will not have the same effect today as it did on 70's audiences when compared to 90's horror films. If the BBFC is right, people my age must be in a sorry state to have a higher regard of fear for Scream's Ghostface than the force of true evil. The Exorcist prods with a mixture of subtlety and power at your very perception of the lines of good and evil, it's up to you to watch it appreciatively and open minded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although probably not the scariest film ever, this may well be the greatest horror film ever. It has lingered in our minds for more than 25 years because of this. In its savage and brute force as a horror film, it achieves excellence. The quality of Linda Blair's performance at such an early age makes it even the better. And yet so few people realize that this film is based on a true story. The book by William Peter Blatty (who also wrote the screenplay) is based on actual events that happened at Georgetown University in 1949. So, in conclusion, this film is really not your average horror film, but a look into the struggles between good and evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allegedly the scariest film ever made, this head-turning, projectile-vomiting extravaganza had another outing in British cinemas to celebrate its 25th year. The story is very simple: in present-day Washington D. C. an 11-year-old girl is possessed by an entity that claims to be the devil himself. When her atheist mother exhausts all medical possibilities, she turns in desperation to a Jesuit priest.The first thing that ages in films is the special effects, but in this example some have aged faster than others. The sight of the girl, Regan, being thrown around her bed by invisible forces made some other people in the audience laugh, but the make-up effects, such as the afore-mentioned projectile vomiting and a genuinely shocking scene involving a crucifix, are as fresh now as they were then. The film is also too long, with endless shots of nothing happening deflating the tension that has been built up so painstakingly. The direction itself is assured to the degree of virtuosity (Friedkin had just won an Oscar), and the script is true to its source novel, since the same person wrote them. The finest performance of the film comes from Miller, brilliant as the anguished priest of faltering faith who finds new purpose in saving the soul of the young girl. Blair is also impressive, although the "Voice of the Demon" is provided by one Mercedes McCambridge, having to act in such an entirely evil way would certainly have an effect on an ordinary prepubescent, but she handles it all with enormous talent, properly earning her Oscar nomination.On the whole though, the whole thing is somewhat unsatisfactory. I didn't find it at all scary, though occasionally thrilling, but my fatal error was reading up about the film before seeing it, as knowing the intricacies of how the subtexts and directorial tricks all work detracted from the film itself. Just as films are supposed to desensitise people to violence, I was desensitised to this film's intelligence, thought, shocks and originality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist revolves around young Regan McNeill who, along with her actress mother, lives in a beautiful townhouse in Georgetown. Slowly but swiftly, Regan becomes possessed by an ancient demon and her mother seeks out a priest to perform an exorcism on Regan. The priest just happens to be Father Karras, who's mother has recently died. Karras request permission from the church to perform an exorcism and they grant it, but only as long as another priest, Father Merrin, helps with the exorcism. Soon the two priests are in a face to face battle with the demon in Regan and maybe none of them will survive the night. Very, very good supernatural horror flick that is a must see for any devoted horror fan.The Exorcist is Rated R for some violence, gore, and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read most of the comments on this film, and I am struck by the extreme polarization of views. While the majority think it was the best horror movie ever made (and I quite agree), a large percentage found it boring and even funny. This strikes me as especially interesting because...THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY IT WAS 25 YEARS AGO. Most people were genuinely terrified, but a lot of people LAUGHED at it.First of all, this deserves the title of classic for the same reason King Kong (1933) is a classic: Nothing even remotely like it had been done before. Even those people who weren't scared by it, have to acknowledge that fact. Laugh all you want at the cheesiness of King Kong today, but rest assured women really DID faint at its premiere. Same with The Exorcist. Second, the film especially terrified those of us who had a Catholic upbringing. Blatty was able to reach into the deepest recesses of our fears, and pull out the....for want of a better word, "gothicness" of the Roman faith and shove it in our faces. Third, the Exorcist terrified on a completely different level than most other horror films. You can sleep tight KNOWING that Freddy Krueger is a Hollywood invention, along with Jason, etc. Do you know the devil isn't real? Today I am an atheist, and don't believe in the devil, yet I can still appreciate what the director was hinting at, and what buttons he was trying to push.I challenge anyone to name a more viscerally terrifying movie than the Exorcist.</fullReview>

But she's all that's good about this movie. The external characters barely hold my interest. And the whole debate/discussion about good and evil barely scratches the surface of anything called true discussion. Of course no one wants to believe in the existence of evil. Is that supposed to be a shock? The filmmakers seemed to think so, but I felt insulted.Look--I know what horror is, and I'm the first one to jump on the bandwagon of chastizing people who equate scary with jumpy. I detest so-called horror films that teach the maxim of scariness being how often someone can really get you by jumping out from the closet and saying, "Boo!" Horror is a reaction, it's a mood, it's a feeling. Horror is looking at Raegan and saying, "That's Evil!" Horror is watching Rosemary of "Rosemary's Baby" realize what really has been going on with her neighbors, and just what it is they want of her. But to bring all this back to "The Exorcist", the truly horrific parts of the show are only two seconds long! For the most part, the viewer is stuck watching boring characters who have no flair, no substance, and no interesting qualities. And what of the scenes that end with poor exorcists dodging flying furniture and then never bother to tell you how the priest got out of such a situation? I do apologize, but this film is heinous. It's heinous, dull, and I really am mystified by all the attention people have given it.Best horror film of all time? Gimme a break. Watch "Rosemary's Baby", "Alien", or "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" circa 1978 and tell me you feel the same way. "The Exorcist" is no more a classic horror film than "Street Trash". Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.</fullReview>

No. A twelve-year old starts spewing pea soup and screaming obscenities. w00h00. Weak dialogue, and the "let's-try-to-be-shocking" attitude was insulting to the viewer's intelligence. "Psychological thriller," yeah right. PSYCHO was a psychological thriller. Exorcist was a gore-fest with some religious pseudo-brain-candy. The reason it's as big as it is, is when it was first shown it caused general hysteria. (Don't ask why, these people had low standards for what was scary.) People fainted. Paramedics were on the spot. I'd really hate to think what would happen if someone were to make a scary movie that was actually *scary*. (See: Blue Velvet.) If your standards are low enough, you might be scared by The Exorcist, but those of us with discriminating tastes needn't bother.</fullReview>

But don't let this put you off because under all this is the most intriguing Horror\Drama you will ever see.

		<shortDescription>A common mistake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of those people who don't believe that this is a scary film, I think you must not understand the word "scary." See, the horror/sci fi genre throughout the years has branched out in two separate directions. The old movies in the 30s, 40s, and 50s were scary in the traditional sense. They were creepy and played off of traditional human emotions and storylines (good and evil, love and death, guilt and redemption). But then a movie named Psycho came out and suddenly it was no longer enough to make a creepy movie about an evil monster. Now you had to make a shocker about pathological crimes and sexual repression. "Halloween" continued this tradition of serial killer shockers, and it in turn led to the "Fridays," "Nightmares," "Screams," etc. What happened is that people thought that the only real scare was one involving a surprise. There isn't a single scary moment in any of those films, in the sense that the audience doesn't have a sense of terror that lasts past the moment that the image is on the screen. The only thing they offer is a set-up, release, and surprise formula that is now so much of a cliche that I think the entire genre needs to be eliminated. How often do we see the naked girl walking around in the dark, just to be startled by the cat, and then to get her head cut off just after the "scary" music stops? That is not a horror movie. It is a stupid little child yelling "Boo" at the top of his lungs.The Exorcist is a scary movie and a horror movie. It is about the three most horrific of all inherently human topics--the existence of a benevolent God, death, and human weakness. We see intense, pained people struggling with these topics. And we see a world of ever-increasing evil and moral decay. The character of Karras alone could warrant an entire discussion. And how about the subliminal shots? I don't know if I have ever seen anything as scary--or as inherently cinematic--as those demonic subliminal shots in the middle of scenes that were already upsetting.Despite for some weak (not boring, but unnatural) dialogue in the first hour, a masterpiece of filmmaking and storytelling...</fullReview>

Few horror films since then have been able to create such reactions. The atmosphere created in the film is very important as well as the central story. Parallels to Alien,1979, aren't too far away. This film must surely be up amongst the clasics such as Psycho if not only on the basis of its originality at the time. That there since has been produced a plethora of copies (Scream for instance) that come nowhere near the Original cannot be due to the shortcomings of this excellent film!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing the 25th Anniversary video release of The Exorcist brought me back to Dec. 28, 1973. That first viewing of the film has to rank as one of the top three movie-going experiences of my life. I was one of about 700 people in the audience, but we were all reacting as a single entity to the brilliant way the film was constructed: tension balanced with release, silence followed by horrifying blasts of sound effects and the unforgettable voice of the demon. Terror was being shared by every person in that room, and you could actually feel it. I have never seen any other movie that had such a powerful effect on an audience.I also remember, when the movie ended and my 3 friends and I walked back to the bus station, that none of us spoke to each other. Not about the movie, or about anything else. Any horror movie that can do that has to be the scariest ever made. There will probably never be another one quite like it.A lot of the comments here say The Exorcist is slow and boring, especially in the first hour. For me there's not one wasted moment or image in the film. The slow pace is necessary to create a sense of total reality, of the world these characters live in, so that you come to care about them and believe everything that happens to them later on, no matter how fantastic. And everything you see in the first half (Merrin's face-off with the demon statue, Chris's glimpses of Karras in the streets, her foul language on the phone, Karras' love of his mother and his horrible guilt over her death, the old guy on the subway platform) pays off in the second half.All my favorite horror films (Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, Jaws) have this same structure of a slow methodical build-up before the terror begins, making the terror that much more terrifying. I guess that's just the way I like 'em - never did care much for Jason and Freddy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Movie Ever Made??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As, an Entertainment Editor, I ran a poll at a local video store this year before Halloween. The Poll was "The Scariest Movie Ever". There were several listed but, it was closer between # 2 and LAST PLACE than between #1 and #2. The #1 movie was "THE EXORCIST" which recieved almost triple the votes of the second place movie. I, personally, don't see how. I have seen more "heart-pounding" movies. I have seen creepier movies. The Exorcist was a good horror movie but, not the best. It was not really a great action thriller and no "cold blooded" murder or stalking or eerie poltergeist activity. No killers on the loose, no blood thirsty zombies, nada. Lots of snot, puke, weird spinning effects, deep, scratchy voices, excessive cursing and outrageous blasphemies and sacrilige.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that if you go and see the Exorcist you should remember three things:- 1. The film was made in 1973 and before then there was nothing quite like it. We are these days spoilt with gory horror flicks. 2. This is a film based on religion, which unfortunately is its biggest problem. These days there are a lot of people who simply don't believe in God, if they did and then actually thought about the film for what it represents I think that they would be far more scared than they are. 3. It is a psychological horror film, people find some scenes funny mainly because they can't understand it.Having said that, I really enjoyed the film and recommend it to anyone, but I agree that it has been over-hyped and by modern day standards it is perhaps not as "jump out of your seats" as some people would like.</fullReview>

And after years of hearing about the power and effect that this movie has had on people such as my mother and even my pastor, it was built up more than any other movie that I have ever seen, and let me tell you, this movie sure did deliver. It is pound for pound the creepiest movie that I have ever seen and one of the scariest. I was glued to the screen anticipating every scene. I didn't know where the film was going to take me next or how it was going to shock me next.The climax at the end was terrifying to watch more and more, because at first before the two priests go in to perform the exorcism, you have hope for poor Regan, but as the scene carries on you realize that they aren't getting anywhere and that there is no hope for Regan after all. And that in itself is pure terror. A true classic. As effective as JAWS and PSYCHO. -**** stars</fullReview>

Having seen the Exorcist in 1994 and after reading all the hype about its re-release now, I would just like to point out that Ghostwatch scared me far more than the Exorcist did. Although I admire the Exorcist's reputation as a horror classic, I can't quite bring myself to say it was as scary as most people have made out. To be honest I found the film to be rather tired and slow, the only notable feature being the special effects used to convey the possession of Regen. While Ghostwatch created a "War of the Worlds" scenario to some people, including me at the tender age of 16, the Exorcist did little to raise my pulse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much (too much?) has been written about this film so I'll restrict this review to my personal response only. It does have flaws: the opening sequence in Iraq, although beautiful to look at, is ultimately superfluous (although it obviously inspires the similar setting at the beginning of 'The Omen', which is used with much greater relevance); the pacing is very uneven and the young priest couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. It makes up for its shortcomings with a superb performance from Ellen Burstyn as the mother and an unparalleled performance from Linda Blair as the girl. The final scenes of the exorcism are some of the most powerful ever put onto film (and MUST BE VIEWED ON A BIG SCREEN to appreciate their full impact). The film is harrowing rather than scary, with repeated visits into the girl's bedroom becoming just as full of dread for the audience as for the characters. The demon-possessed Linda Blair is one of the most memorable icons in cinema history. Still banned on video in the UK (mainly because of how young Linda Blair is than for any other reason), this is the only example of censorship of a mainstream film that I support. See the film and, for goodness sake, watch it with your disbelief suspended (sorry if this is stating the obvious, but there were people around me in the cinema laughing at various scenes when there is NOTHING REMOTELY FUNNY about what goes on). Finally, although I said I was going to keep this brief, this is roughly double the size of my average review for imdb and I've had intermittent goosebumps all the way through writing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw the Exorcist for the first time on video and was surprised by the fact that it was not as scary as I imagined it to be. Perhaps it helps if you have had more of a Christian upbringing, which I didn't. In fact I was more worried about having it confiscated in Heathrow airport after buying it in New York. As a film it is very good but not the sort of film that people of may age (20) have been brought up on. We're from a generation that are used to Friday the 13th etc... Obviously the Exorcist is infinitely better than that, it's just totally different. It re-opens in cinemas in England &amp; Wales today (it was in Scottish cinemas in the summer to fill the World Cup movie void) and I'm seeing it for the first time on a CINEMA screen at Midnight tomorrow (Hallowe'en) at the UCI Cinema in Cardiff Bay. So to everyone in Wales and England that has never been able to see it due to it being refused a video certificate then now's your chance. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film about 17 years ago. It had a profound effect on me. I couldn't sleep with the lights out and all that, but bear in mind I was only 14! As a result whenever I watch a horror flick I always compare it to the Exorcist and the way it made me feel. Of course I realise that I was a child at the time but the thing about the Exorcist, for me, was that it seemed real, as if it could happen, and that was the scariest thing about it. Today's films seem to rely on special effects too much and don't really have a good story. This is why I believe the Exorcist will never be beaten, as far as I'm concerned, in the horror stakes. As I write this it is due for re-release and I for one will be going to see it where films are meant to be seen, in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see many of the comments say that the film is slow or boring in the beginning. I think part of the problem is this film is being compared to movies today. Most films released in the 1990s are fast-paced because attention spans are much shorter than they were 20-30 years ago. Blame it on all of us under 35 being brought up in the TV generation. This film slowly brings the viewer to the realization that the little girl is possessed, that Father Karras (misspelled maybe?) is haunted by his own demons, and that the world around the family is so skeptical that they can't or won't believe that a person can be possessed. The reason why the ending seems so explosive and haunting is because how it is set up.If you want some explanation about the film, see the 25 Anniversary edition. Prior to the film, there is BBC produced documentary about the film which shows outtakes and talks to everybody involved with the film. I will say I have seen this movie so many times that it doesn't scare me as it once did but when I saw the outtake of the Spider-Walk scene, I was truly scared again.One more thought, in 1973, when this film was released every denomination denounced the film, Billy Graham did a sermon on the evils of this film, and there were religious protestors outside theaters. Inronically, the Catholics praised the film, acted as advisors and were extras in the film. The person who played Fr. Dyer is an actual Catholic priest.</fullReview>

When people left the theater after "Titanic", they felt awstruck and upset by the deaths of all those people. When people saw "The Exorcist", people truly had a new perspective of good and evil.

It consists of the characters standing around and looking at each other. But when the movie finally gets going, (and I emphasize the word 'finally'), you find out it was worth the wait. 'The Exorcist' while not being all that scary in the 90's, is still a great movie. I enjoyed this movie very much despite the boring beginning. The last 15 minutes of the movie are the best. The scene with the priests performing the exorcism is very haunting. I enjoyed this movie mainly because it is original, and it has still manages to scare me in some scenes, even though it is from the 70's. I don't know if everyone will enjoy this movie, but your chances are 50/50. Give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a 34-year-old horror fan, but it wasn't until last year I saw this classic... It's still banned on video in Finland, but here they show some of those banned films on TV, uncut. The Exorcist was a bit dull in the beginning, but after about 3/4 hours it started to rock... It's really amazing they made this film in 1973, referring to the swear words and religious implications you seldom see in even new films. A real classic, that I will treasure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did they get away with it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did the director and the other folks involved with making this film, get away with releasing The Exorcist in 1973? There are scenes in this film which are very disturbing to say the least (you won't look at a crucifix the same way) and it makes me wonder who would let their little girl star in a movie like this. That being said... see this flick! I was nine years old when it was released in '73 and begged my mom to let me go with my older cousins to see it and she said, "No way!" I'm glad she did. I've caught it on TV a few times since then but of course it was always edited (thankfully) so I'd never gotten to see and feel the full impact of it. I bought the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of the film last week and sat back ready to be chilled and thrilled and I was. There's a 35 minute retrospective at the beginning but do yourself a favor and skip it and then check it out afterwards, it drones on forever but isn't bad to check out after you've seen the movie. Well, what are you waiting for? See The Exorcist!</fullReview>

For an early 70s horror film the effects are exceptional, but the story just isn't that scary and none of the film's images came back to play games with my mind.I could easily have fallen asleep to this one, but wish I'd seen it in my teens when it would have had more impact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time of its release, The Exorcist was the scariest film ever made. With so many technological advancements and boundary-pushing done these days, The Exorcist is not THE scariest movie like it once was. In fact, there are a few scenes that are rather funny. But as a massive movie buff, I can assure you that this is one of the scariest movies ever. Maybe it is not number one anymore, it is still up there. In fact I would perhaps call this the scariest movie I've ever seen. Not really an easy choice, but still.The Exorcist is just a fun little monster movie about a 12-year-old (Linda Blair) who plays with a Ouija board and is possessed by a demon. Well, it is rather unclear if it is a low-ranking demon or the devil himself. Her mother (Ellen Burstyn) goes to many doctors but none seem to do the trick and eventually gets a hold of priest/psychiatrist (Jason Miller) to perform an exorcism. The movie follows two parallel stories with Blair's curse and Miller. Miller who is working at a university and is dealing with his mentally-ill mother who dies. I found this portion of the movie to be rather weak. Perhaps I was just underwhelmed. Either way, it should have been much stronger. His character is developed well and he does a mighty fine job of acting, but the plot development was shallow.Obviously, the stronger story is the one with Linda Blair and Ellen Burstyn. Burstyn is a wealthy actress who lives with her daughter and housekeepers and assistants. I was hoping this could have been stronger too. We get such a brief look into the life of this family, it is as if this story isn't worked on much. I know that they wanted the horror to erupt right away, but a stronger plot for this part of the film would have strengthened the movie overall The more we know, the more we feel. The more we feel, the more scared we get.Linda Blair finds a Ouija board and plays with it a bit. Ouija boards are said to really deliver curses. I don't buy it all. From then on, she slowly descends into uncontrollable insanity. While the family subplots are weak, the regular plot makes up for it. Blair's descending is perfectly paced. Obviously, Linda Blair's acting is top-notch--the best performance I have ever seen by a child actress. But what separates this from other supernatural horror movies is its wonder of what is mental and what is superstitious. That is what Burstyn is torn between figuring out is the best solution to save her daughter. Eventually, it reaches a point with Linda Blair where we see that she is clearly possessed as she becomes a scary monster. Her voice changes, cool make-up is added, things around the house fly about, and her body bends in bizarre ways. These days, you can't help but laugh at some of the situations that happen. Take her walking down the stairs like a spider. Or when she trash- talks the priests. I am Christian and I couldn't help laughing. When Miller finally becomes the official exorcist, that is when he becomes more interesting and the movie's suspense is added. Up until this point, the movie has a drama touch to the horror instead of suspense. Every movie has more than one element to it and the horror did not have much suspense built into it. Problem? Not really. I just thought it would have made for a more compelling viewing. Regardless, Miller and a senior priest performing exorcisms is lots of fun with an ending that will leave you cheering. So even though I thought the movie could have been better, there's still enough good elements to erase most of the bad ones. The realism behind it all and the fantastic creations make this the top horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having only watched the film during its 2000 theatrical reissue, and once the week before, I read the book (in one day) and rewatched the film to compare it and ... I'm somewhat at a loss for words on this one. Beautifully grotesque, nearly unwatchable in its extremely graphic portrayal of a young girl who begins exhibiting most bizarre behaviour. Early doctors are at a loss. Psychiatrist cannot figure what is wrong with her. Ultimately a priest is called.....Film does what it sets out to do, horrify its audience, but there are also deep characters present, with meat on their bones, meaning for being there, not merely taking up space, or appearing just to provide a body count. The sound design is brilliant; in my opinion it is possibly the film's strongest suit, how it plays with silence and subtle, quiet sounds, as well as its haunting, strangely calming theme. Its use of light and shadows, and subliminal cuts add to its disquieting unease.But for all of those things in its favour, this is an extremely difficult watch, as it centres on a young child's gruesome tortured peril. Yet, that was exactly the point of the book and this subsequent film, to revolt and horrify the audience with its religious philosophical horror. An extremely frightening, difficult to watch horror, gory, unsettling, so much so, in fact, that I don't think I could ever watch this again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1973, audiences were left in awe after watching probably the most evil, bizarre movie they had ever seen. Audiences were not used to this, and it continues to shock me today what this movie delivers. The Exorcist has amazing special effects, and an insanely dark atmosphere that feels just evil almost throughout. The cinematography is great and I love the subliminal stuff they put into the Extended Director's Cut. The performances are also amazing, especially by Linda Blair. She pulled it off, she really did. What a lot of people don't understand about the film is that it's not so much about the exorcism, which only takes up about 20 minutes of the film, it's more about a man having to face his own demons, a man that has lost his faith and is now almost forced to gain it back. It's a story about the demons that haunt every human being, and having to face them. This movie should not be viewed as just a horror film, but as a film in general.Extended or not, The Exorcist is by far the scariest movie I have ever seen and it is one of the main events in my life as a movie lover.</fullReview>

Meanwhile in Georgetown, Washington, D.C, film actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) notices disturbing changes in her 12-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair). Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) is a troubled local priest who has lost his faith. Lieutenant William F. Kinderman investigating the suspicious death of director Burke Dennings calls on the expertise of Karras on witchcraft. The doctors recommends exorcisms to Chris for its power of suggestion. In desperation, Chris contacts Karras. Eventually, he's convinced and the church recruits Merrin to perform the exorcism.It marks another step in the horror genre. The special effects and makeup are the best. The projectile vomiting is gross even today. The first half is rather slow but the exorcism lays the groundwork for all others to follow. Max von Sydow is powerful in his performance. Linda Blair shall be cinematic history for all times. This is one of those signposts that marks the march of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catholic propaganda goes for the jugular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its thinly veiled misogyny and blatant stance as Catholic propaganda, few films can match the pop-culture clout of William Friedkin's 1973 tales of demonic possession, 'The Exorcist'. This especially holds true for horror movies which are usually seen by critics and the public as puerile and adolescent fantasies which are beneath them, so the level of cultural hysteria 'The Exorcist' was able to achieve ? with paramedics and priests waiting in the aisles as people fainted, vomited, and claimed to be possessed as a result of watching the film ? seems absurdly ridiculous in retrospect and deserves all the more respect for it.Based on Jesuit-schooled William Peter Blatty's best-selling 1971 novel, 'The Exorcist' tells the story of Regan McNeil (Linda Blair) as she is possessed by the malevolent Babylonian demon Pazuzu and the subsequent attempt to exorcise the demon by seasoned exorcist Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) and Father Damien Karras, a young priest struggling to retain his faith in the face of his mother's illness and death. Scene set and seatbelts buckled, we then go on a visceral roller-coaster ride of profanity and blasphemy the likes of which only the truly religious (i.e. repressed) can create as the demon has Regan openly urinate on the carpet during a shindig held by her mother, violently stab her vagina with a metal crucifix while shouting "let Jesus f**k you", projectile vomit onto Father Karras, as well as turn her head 180 degrees and run down the stairs bent over backwards ? all of which have entered the pop-culture lexicon and are known by many people who have not actually seen the movie.Yes, that's all very well and good?but, is it scary? Short answer: at the time, "yes", now "no", but neither is the point.Long answer: prior to 'The Exorcist (apart from the other horror-movie cultural phenomenon 'Rosemary's Baby' from 1968) the majority of horror movies had been Gothic inspired pieces set in far-away places or at some unspecified time in the past. However, in locating the action in modern-day Georgetown and the victim being possessed through a Ouija board (still then a common board-game available from toy shops) 'The Exorcist' brought horror home in a manner as alarming as it was domestic. Furthermore, at the time, America was still in the midst of the unprecedented social instability of the civil rights movement which challenged all forms of authority and repression, including male domination and the church, and the demon's brutal habitation of a young girl could be seen to represent the effects of such an upheaval of unbelief and taps into the collective reserves of atheist as well as Catholic guilt.As such, the film's conservative bias is visible; what's more, the misogyny of the film is seen in its suggestion that Regan's mother, Chris (Ellen Burstyn), is implicated in the fate of her daughter by being a divorcée with no religious belief and its assertion that grandiose metaphysical evil manifests through pubescent girls on the cusp of developing a libido. In retrospect, this medieval Judeo-Christian demonization of female sexuality is far more disturbing than the film itself. Still, there's no denying it struck a chord and the film was refused a video release in the UK by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) until 1999.Which brings us to today; where society has become even more secular and in cinema Video-Nasties have come and gone and even torture porn is passé?and the "horror" of "the scariest film of all time" just doesn't hold up. As a result, while it still has the power to slightly chill, people coming to the movie having with the hype ringing in their ears are almost guaranteed to be disappointed?as was I when I saw it in 1999. However, despite the reduced fear factor and the religious, moral, and sexual conservatism, it's a film I have found rewarding in re-watching; mainly due to the performance of Jason Millar as Karras. In keeping with director William Friedkin's desire to have the movie be more "docu-drama" than fiction and only cast actors who had had a Catholic education, Millar had studied to be a Jesuit priest and lends a poignant authenticity to the character as he struggles with his own religious doubt.All told, while I find the film morally objectionable on several fronts and not actually that scary, the conviction the cast bring to the film (Burstyn got a Best Supporting Actress nomination), the palpable sense of transgression, and the core of the film coming from the pen of a man wrestling with his own religious doubts, contribute to the film's rightful position as a classic of the genre.</fullReview>

The acting is great from children and adults alike in extreme reactions and portrayal of fear and disgust.-Kooky creative horror and SFX, still passable and surprising by today's standards. -Some great cinema.

		<fullReview>The year was 1973 ... the place Montreal, Quebec ... and the news was filled with talks about the newest horror film to hit the theaters ... The Exorcist! According to the news, due to health concern of theater goers, the theater had an ambulance stationed outside just in case anyone in the audience fainted, or had a heart attack, due to this being the scariest movie ever made ... and due to the public's reactions to the film during its premiere showing. The camera shows the ambulance sitting quietly in front of the theater, and the enormously long line of people waiting to get in to see the movie! We're talking a line that went clear around the block and ended about 12 feet in front of the line's beginning! How absolutely exciting! Fortunately, the movie was in English ... or was in fortunate, I still haven't decided. Anyhoots, the movie began with boredom that slowly evolved into ... how to put this ... SCREAMS of laughter! The scariest movie of all time was turned into a comedy, probably due to many of those in the audience not understanding a word of English! When the movie finally ended, and people were leaving the theater, those still standing in line to get in must have been totally confused by the comments of the people coming out of the theater ... due to the vulgar quotations and the screams of laughter. The No. 1 scariest movie was a comedy hit! Well, yesterday I found a copy of the movie at WalMart, for $ 4.00, and took it home. I wanted to see if it was as funny now, as it was in 1973. My opinion is that this movie became so famous due to the shocking vulgarity, and its disgusting sexual antics. It was pure shock! As for the acting. Linda Blair lost the chance at an Oscar nod due to the academy discovering that there was voice dubbings and mechanics involved in her performances. The real acting came from Ellen Burstyn and, in part, from Jason Miller. Ms. Burstyn was a perfect choice for her part, as were the rest of the cast, but Ms. Burstyn made the most of her part and made it her own! A scene that was not shown in theaters shows Regan coming down the stairs upside-down ... with a torso that was far too long to be hers! I'm not surprised that scene was originally tossed out ... however, it does add to the strangeness, as well as to the hilarity, of the film.This is not a DVD I will be watching again ... in that way, the movie is a failure ... unlike something like "Deep Blue Sea" or even "Mama Mia"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Cinema - 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just taken delivery of the 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray edition and watched the director's cut I am reminded fully of just why this is one of the most influential and important motion pictures ever made. The longer cut (by 11 minutes) doesn't add that much to the theatrical version (also included) apart from a minimal feeling of having watched a slightly more complete and thorough presentation. But, really, it's neither here nor there.The plot is simple. Daughter of actress single mother is possessed by an evil spirit (may or may not be the devil), an Old Catholic priest intervenes to perform an exorcism and he's accompanied by a young modern Jesuit priest experiencing a crisis of faith. Yes, simple. But the content, the events and the themes explored within are immensely complex and emotionally affecting.It's a tale of good versus evil, of the power of religious faith along with redemption through self- sacrifice. Now I'm not a religious person but even I was impressed by the compelling and matter-of-fact way the film seeks to reaffirm belief in the existence of both God and the Devil. And I still remain astonished at the amount of religiously oriented people, even today, who are offended by this film. Considering it works on an acceptance of God's existence and clearly shows good triumphing over the best efforts of malicious evil; how is that offensive exactly? What I personally find offensive, but admittedly unsurprising, is the number of people who haven't actually seen the film but feel qualified to critique and judge it. This is a testament to the closed-minded intolerance of religion and the power of media mythology. More powerful than God for some, it would seem.Undeniably, pure evil is depicted as monstrous, defiling, sick, twisted, malevolent and destructive. The host child is physically tortured and made to behave supernaturally and unspeakably. Well, what would anyone expect ? a demon that just pops around for crumpets and afternoon tea with perhaps a sedate game of lawn croquet thrown in for a clincher?The deal here is, for those of a particularly media susceptible and narrow-minded nature and those who haven't seen it but know something of the reputation; put aside the myths and sensationalism surrounding THE EXORCIST. This stuff is causing you to miss out on experiencing a classic exercise in pure cinema.Friedkin (director) and Blatty (writer) employ almost peerless craftsmanship in structuring and executing this film. It represents the masterwork of both and they will probably never better it. There is some incredibly fine acting on show from Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb and Jason Miller. Not forgetting the best ever screen work of Linda Blair. As the possessed child she is a revelation. Whatever subsequent acting performance she gave as an adult it was, quite honestly, atrocious in comparison. Child actors are unselfconscious and blessed with monumental confidence and self-belief and the ability to imaginatively project. Some of them lose this when they grow up. Linda Blair certainly did. However, in THE EXORCIST, she was something else entirely.The screenplay by William Peter Blatty is one of the most carefully composed and atmospherically chilling pieces one could imagine. He draws each and every character as a three-dimensional human being and takes time over development. Quite remarkable, considering Blatty had been a hack comedy writer up to this point (he scripted, of all things, the Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau flick A SHOT IN THE DARK).Friedkin directs each shot with painstaking care and an eye for making the commonplace seem frightful and unsettling. Case in point is the scene when Ellen Burstyn is simply walking home in daylight. Autumn leaves blow along the street, kids trick-or-treating run by, the wind tugs the habits of some passing nuns, and Mike Oldfield's signature loop from "Tubular Bells" plays in the background. It is really uncannily unnerving. And quite brilliant. Friedkin's choice of this particular music is inspired, but it's used very, very sparingly (only twice?) throughout the movie. Oldfield's piano repeat has a weird hook/tempo that the listener can never quite get their head around. This is what makes it addictive and unsettling and it gets into your head, stays there and helps set a unique tone.The audio visual tapestry Friedkin weaves builds steadily and seamlessly through a series of escalating events and the tension increases in sympathy. Owen Roizman's cinematography is absolutely magnificent, framing the story in a psychologically affecting range of strikingly beautiful textures and tones. Add the support of some immaculately subtle audio effects, the incredible vocalism of Mercedes McCambridge and some truly shocking but never arbitrary or exploitative sequences, and you have one of the most frightening and emotionally rewarding cinematic experiences ever committed to film.THE EXORCIST is one of those rarest phenomena; like PSYCHO, it's a movie that invokes strong feelings in anyone who sees it by intricately creating an atmosphere that is unrivalled in film. There has never been anything else quite like it. And probably never will be again. It's pure cinema and as such demands and deserves the attention it gets. Scrap the media-generated infamy and see it for what it is.The Blu-Ray print is a thing of impressive beauty ? crisp, clean, fresh and vibrant. The director's cut has a very slight edge over the theatrical release, if only for providing the most complete viewing platform available. You get a lot of bang for your buck ? commentary by Friedkin and Blatty, interviews, documentaries, trailers, all the usual suspects. Plus you get the theatrical cut thrown in. It's worth the dough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just purchased the DVD and watching at home for the first time 40 years after its' initial release, my expectations were of infamous bedroom scenes high above M Street where I have traversed since 1978 once I was old enough to regularly drive down to Georgetown. And, yes, I've always looked upon "Exorcist Steps" and been shaken without ever knowing the specifics. So now I know this movie goes beyond spinning heads, bloody crucifixes and projectile pea soup.Now the film opens flat (and in Iraq of all places) and the mythology which should have been teased, was more hinted and poorly executed. In the Omen,. that is the core of the movie. How can you have a movie about demonic possession without knowing the who, what, when, where and why scenarios? We meet a Mother and Daughter who slowly become to realize that something is seriously wrong. Along with the troubled past and present of our Priest psychiatrist, two-thirds of our story seems to be on track.We morph into a terrifying movie that shows our medical gods as unknowing witch doctors practicing medicine as if they were willing gamblers who know no odds. The brain scan scenes were absolutely horrifying! As we approach the exorcism, the scariest part is not knowing what well find every time we open the 12 year odds bedroom door.That's great storytelling!The actual 9 minute exorcism is our reward and final fireworks creep show at which end I was relieved the demon was gone as it had found a place in my home (in my fearful mind) ever since little Regan started mouthing off and cursing at the doctors.That was no coincidence that the possession took place as a girl was becoming a teenager. "What's going on with my kid?" is a typical parental thought leading to more horrific ones at times. Overall, I will wonder why I waited so long, where will those previously mentioned thoughts re-occur in my life, when will I see this again, who will watch with me and how did such an eerie tune as "Tubular Bells" no be more prominent in the movie itself? 60 seconds at best... That song is more mythology inducing than the first 20 minutes, but the rest froze me on the couch in absolute terror f what was coming next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classics have always been boring, if you try to watch them in this YOLO generation. But, The Exorcist is one classic horror you will not be disappointed of.It starts off with something indirect. The climax is related to the beginning. And, the story between them is entailing. Stricken by an invisible spirit, daughter of a popular actress, becomes possessed, the plot of which fails to mention why. The performance of the girl is splendid. The editing is average. And the make-up, I should say, is very genuine. You see, in horror flicks, the make-up has to be authentic and not superfluous. The Exoricst gets an 8.2/10 for this. And the music. "Tubular Bells" creates a bloodcurdling mood. Fantastic.It chills you; the dialogs being funny sometimes, they mostly haunt you. Although, the plot is a tad feeble, the narration quite gets a nod. Cast performance is good. Direction is good and the background murder story is the perfect correlation.BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for horror genre lovers. This is truly a classic.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

		<shortDescription>One of the truly Great love stories...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, it scared the bejeezus outta me when I was a kid (I literally couldn't close my eyes that night without seeing THAT FACE or hearing THAT VOICE), but one of the things I've always found most interesting about THE EXORCIST is that it's one of the truly great love stories. Father Karras sacrifices himself in the end out of love. His doubts about his religious beliefs aside, the ending proves that the man hasn't lost his innate love of Humanity: he's willing to trade HIS life for the girl's. In a fright film as powerful as this one, that's one hell of an affirmation. The re-release, which contained the previously excised "spider" scene, was well worth seeing (though I still can't figure out why it was cut in the first place): it's hands down one of the scariest things I've ever seen; the sound effects alone were worth the price of admission. Unlike the re-edited versions of THE WARRIORS (in which Walter Hill totally ruins the break-neck pace of the movie) or THE OUTSIDERS (in which Copolla drowns out the drama with gratuitous music) or BLADE RUNNER (in seven re-edits of which Ridley Scott makes not one substantial change) or APOCALYPSE NOW (which was edited right the first time) or JAWS (in which Spielberg has Scheider as Brody idiotically saying "Blow up!" as the shark makes its final charge) or STAR WARS (in which George Lucas mistakenly thought that making Han Solo faster than a speeding bullet was a good idea- which completely undercut the character's character) or any one of a number of other "re-dos," the restored version of THE EXORCIST IS worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is a movie to see true and true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching this movie hoping to be scared off my wits, as it is casted in the light of one of the scariest movies out there, well I have lost my wits and this movie freaked the hell out of me.The Exorcist is a 1973 horror film and it is directed by William Friedkin (Rules of Engagement in 2000). The movie itself was adapted by William Peter Blatty (who won an Academy Award for his work) from a novel he wrote two years prior to the movie release, the novel also named The Exorcist was inspired by the 1949 exorcism case of Roland Doe.The movie plot is about an actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) who was visiting Washington, D.C. to shoot a movie, her 12-year-old daughter Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) started behaving strangely which made Chris send her to the hospital, later on her physical appearance started to change making Chris frightened and scared.Also there in Washington is a young priest who served in a University who was starting to lose faith while dealing with his mother's terminal sickness.With Chris at her wits end knowing not what to do, took advice given to her by some doctors and called a priest to perform an exorcism on her daughter.There is a scene in the movie where Chris steps into her house and the lights flicker and you see subliminal reflections, I actually tried to put on the light while viewing the scene by using the switch in my room before I remembered that was not going to help.It was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and winning two, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay. The Exorcist is the first horror film to be nominated for Best Picture in the 46th Academy Awards and it lost it to The Sting. It became one of the highest earning movies of all time, grossing over $441 million worldwide.It was named the scariest film of all time by Entertainment Weekly and Movies.com, IGN's Top 25 Horror Movies of All-Time has it as the number one horror movie of all time and was No. 3 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.The exorcist is a movie guarantee to scare and freak you out at the same time take the time out to check it out.(Note: This movie has disturbing scenes and blasphemy against God and Christ) www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thankfully, The script was written by the author of the novel himself, William Peter Blatty. I believe if someone else attempted to write the story of the Exorcist for the big screen, then it wouldn't of been one of the greatest horror films todays.The Correlation between Blatty and Friedkin works in perfect harmony: With Blatty sticking close with the book's material ( as expected ) and then Friedkin having the perfect eye for delivering a film like this.What makes the Exorcist one of the best horror stories ever is the turmoil amongst The victim's mother's, assistance and the doctors who are desperately trying to heal her. It isn't just some waffle for an hour and an half. No stupid suggestions or cheap get-outs on finding the cure to the child's possession. However, if you're an Athiest, then you could simply laugh at the whole premise of an 'exorcism' but i would like to think that the majority of people can see beyond the ' science vs Religion' saga and instead just relish in witnessing the story between good and evil.Unlike many other classic horror films, The Exorcist's story line is delivered by a character narrative, one's personal struggle. Father Karris played by Jason Miller is one of Horror's greatest Protagonist to ever hit the screens. Then with the likes of Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow and lee.J.Cob acting out of their parts in perfect fashion, the Exorcist proves you can have outstanding, believable acting in Horror and still be frightening.Everyone on set played their part in ensuring the Exorcist will - just like the book - be one of the scariest, memorable horror films ever.</fullReview>

She starts acting stranger and stranger so her mother takes her into a doctor to see if anything is wrong.

		<shortDescription>Hollywood at it's Scariest!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, as a horror buff, I believe that a good horror movie leaves you thinking about it well after you walk out of the cinema or turn off the DVD player. A GREAT horror movie is one that will leave you thinking about it for months and years to come. A great horror movie will also have the ability to give you chills even with repeated viewings. The Exorcist is one of those rare movies that I would consider Great. Everything was near perfect. The casting, The location, the sets, screenplay, Friedkin's capable direction, Blatty's screenplay, not to mention his source material! I've watched it gazillion times but even today when i slip in the DVD and that screechy violin bit ushers in the blood-red words THE EXORCIST at the start, I get the chills all over again for the next couple of hours! And I love It! The banal, factory produced drivel that passes for horror from Hollywood these days (with the exception of the Paranormal Activity Trilogy in my humble opinion) makes me want to gag. And makes me appreciate the genius of THE EXORCIST even more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Linda Blair, Max Von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller star in William Friedkin's 1973 horror film based on the novel. Two priests help a 12-year old girl possessed by a demonic spirit. This takes place in Georgetown, Pennsylvania where we meet actress, Chris MacNeil (Burstyn) and her 12-year old daughter, Regan (Blair). We also meet, Damian Karras (Miller) a priest who begins losing his faith when his mother becomes very ill. Soon, Chris discovers Regan is possessed by a demonic spirit and meets Damian asking for his help. He consults veteran priest, Father Merrin (Von Sydow) and together they perform an exorcism on Regan to rid the evil spirit inhabiting her body. Near the end, Damian regains his faith and sacrifices himself. I remember first watching this horror classic as a teen and thought it was scary. It still is and it has a great cast &amp; eerie score. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most disturbing films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are those who say this film had no effect on them. That it was immensely overrated. It is obvious that there has been a lot of hype surrounding it since its release almost 40 years ago. It has been called the "scariest movie of all time". Do you know why? Because it is.I had my doubts before I saw it. I was prepared for the film to be far less impressive than everyone claimed. Then I watched it. I was completely stunned by it. The film is actually appalling. The buildup is slow and effective. Then the film hits hard and continues to shock you until the end. It is so merciless, going above and beyond anything you thought was possible. The fact that all of this is happening to a 12 year old girl is disturbing, to say the least. I still can't believe the filmmakers got away with it. I don't see how anyone thinks this film isn't disturbing. Everything seems so real. The special affects are unparalleled even today. The imagery is uncanny. It is visually terrifying, yet it leaves a lot to the imagination as well. The performance from all the cast is extraordinary, especially by Ellen Burstyn as the mother, and of course Linda Blair. Jason Miller is also incredible as the young priest losing his faith. The feel of authenticity makes this film even more frightening. I have never seen a film more terrifying than this. The Exorcist is unforgettable and still earns its title as the scariest movie of all time.</fullReview>

The devil is not just something you can hide in the closet from. He is unstoppable. If he wants to possess you, then you are finished.Along with the gruesome subject matter, you had some of the greatest effects of the time. I can see how unnerving it would have been to see a little girl twirl her head around or crab walk down stairs backwards and then vomit blood. (Yes, I realize that is only in a newer releases.)This is by far the best horror movie ever made. It doesn't rely on that old standby of a high body count.

But there is one thing they don't know: this movie is just on the same level of horror as the form movies. One of the most freakiest things I've seen in the movie, the sight of the little girl and what she looked like, sent shivers down my back and horror movies could never give me anything creepier than that. The fact that a movie like this has been around for so long made me wonder why a movie like this hasn't been involved with many controversies that today's horror movies receive do to content, even though they score nothing like this one.

		<fullReview>In my opinion this movie was one of the scariest movies in the 70's, if you compare and contrast all scary movies during that time you would agree. I say this because during the 70's there were your basic scary icons, Jason, Michael, and Freddy. This type of horror film captured reality like if this can happen in your own home. That moment when the girl walks down the steps backwards on all four, were the scariest part in the entire movie. It's not like that was edited and computerized like most horror films now, that was really done with great skill and talent. That's why I consider this movie to be the best Exorcist compared to the remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly frightening, even 38 years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 206The Exorcist stands among greats as one of the all-time most iconic films. Without a doubt you've heard of it, probably in the same sentence as 'scariest ever'. Almost 40 years later, it certainly has aged, but the terror is still there if you want it to be.At first, you'll wonder if this is the right film. The first scene, a long one, is in Iraq, following an unnamed archaeologist or something, digging up a little rock and looking at a statue. By the end it makes sense, and is actually quite relevant, but it's a very obtuse start. In fact nothing really happens until the 30 minute mark, but then it seems someone flips on the 'eerie' switch and it stays that way until the end. The Exorcist has a feeling to it that I have never felt, and it's impossible to describe. It's thoroughly unsettling.The main plot famously follows Regan MacNeil's possession, and a priest who questions his faith. They don't meet for a long time, but the whole film is just buildup for the ultimate confrontation. I bet this would be very rewarding on a second viewing. The characters and their portrayals are a mixed bag. Father Karras(Jason Miller) is excellent as the conflicted young priest who finds himself in over his head with Regan's occupant. He's an excellent character perfectly executed. The other priest, Merrin (Max von Sydow) has very few scenes, but like Hannibal Lecter 20 years later, is an example of quality over quantity. He speaks with his facial expressions, mostly hidden fear. He steals scenes, even if the character isn't as fleshed out as he should've been. Regan's mom Chris is a little shaky though. In some scenes she behaves very understandably, but in others she's very off, like when she receives news of a death. I loved Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream, but not so much here. The director and detective are both underdeveloped, and just sort of appear on screen without explanation.Lastly, the infamous Regan MacNeil(Linda Blair). While it's debated how much she actually acted, the character is amazing. Pure evil in the form of a little girl. That face appears whenever I blink today. If someone asked you who had the power in a room, two grown men or a tied down girl, you would say the men... unless you were watching The Exorcist. The horrifying things she does are so absolutely random and shocking, even today, mixed with that HORRIFYING voice, make one of the greatest "villains" ever on the screen.Much credit has to be given to the effects and makeup. I wondered how von Sydow hasn't aged in 40 years- he was around 40 when this was made. And Regan's makeup- yikes. But the little things make this, like little noises, and that creepy all-white face that appears from time to time to creep you out with being overly jumpy.What's the film about? I don't really know. The Exorcist certainly dwells on religion, or lack of, and with Regan's medical diagnosis, science versus faith. I think at its cold, empty center it is about true evil versus pure goodness. The Exorcist is an experience- mandatory viewing for all who care about film. It brings one of the best characters, a brilliant song, and a famous poster. It's better than the sum of its parts, brought together as on of the most frightening films of all time. 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie didn't scare me as much as it did amaze me by the all the special effects. Some of the effects made me wonder how they did that or how they pulled that off. It was interesting to see how they put all these effects together. I also really like the makeup job they did with Reagan. I saw some of the test footage and I thought that was a little more frightening than what they came up with in the end. I liked how in the beginning they give you a sense that an evil presence had entered the house, but they don't actually show anything until Reagan gets possessed. That approach seemed to generated a great deal of tension and heighten the suspense. On a less positive note, I thought there is too much dialogue, especially in the extended edition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist was beyond scary. It was a good movie that deals with quite a scary and not really well known topic and it was good. The script gives a good depth of the characters and was well written. Then of course there's the camera-work. In a scary movie like this and an exorcist movie you'd expect the filming to capture angles and the darkness. The lighting and color were excellent with great use of light and dark to convey the feeling that is necessary. Jason Miller (don't know much about him) but he was excellent and subtle, and Von Sydow and Cobb were excellent supporting actors as the priest and detective. And of course Blair is very convincing and terrifying and Burstyn as the desperate mother trying to help her daughter.The Exorcist with great filming, lighting, coloring, script and acting really made a great movie, that was scary and hit on a huge topic of good vs evil and God.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that the exorcist pushed the envelop when it come to horror movies would be an understatement. Nowadays you get horror films that try to stock up on gore to freak people out but the exorcist is classic for being one of the scariest movies I can think of without having any gore in it to gimmick people into being scared. This movie is so excellent that the scene were her head spins around actually kept me awake for many a night as a child. Taking on the issue of religion and exorcism was quite the endeavor and because of its success it set the stage for the creation of the exorcism sub-genre in the horror genre.The only movie I have seen that even stands close to the excellence of this movie would be last years The Rite with Anthony Hopkins. If you like this movie then see that one, and if you liked that one see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still scary after all this time.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the title says, this film still possesses the innate ability to scare me half to death. That is saying something considering I am a grown man that has been to war, twice. Everything about the film is designed to make the viewer feel uneasy. Even the opening,which granted the film was made in 1973 and war with the middle east was unforeseeable, makes viewers uneasy with the call to prayer blaring in Arabic. The whole film is superbly shot and choreographed, with special kudo's going to the lighting directors and cinematographers for their excellent use of contrasting shadows to both hide and reveal things. The performances in the film are obviously among the best there have ever been and little needs to be said about them that has nor been said by critics in the past. Ellen Burstyn's performance as the socialite mother with a problem that can not be solved by throwing money at it rings true to what I would imagine any parent would do if faced with a similar situation. Likewise, Max Von Sydow is nothing short of the best in his role as Father Merrin. I mean, I was fraked out just watching the film at home, I would imagine that being in the room with all that stuff going on ( its a movie, I know) would still be very disconcerting. I think the reason that this film has stood the test of time the way it has is because, deep down, we are all afraid of something terrible happening to us that is completely and utterly out the realm of our control. There is nothing more frightening than that to me. I said all that to say this, this film is excellent, it scared me like I have not been scared in a long time, and if you have not seen it, you are doing a true disservice to yourself.</fullReview>

The characters are memorable, the setting successfully changes in darkness depending on what's happening on the screen, and its topic is on that's fit for a scary movie adaption. Linda Blair's performance is what makes the movie frightening: Turning from a sweet girl into a something so evil is the best transition I've ever seen on screen. I was expecting a little more from whatever possessed Blair's character, but I'm still psyched over the climax of the film that I think was still worth making these characters interact the way they did. There's no words awesome enough to describe the showdown between the good verses the evil. Both sides seem equally-matched and deliver an ending that not only throws you off, but it solidifies the image of the struggle between two opposites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the movie the exorcist has a reputation as one of those horribly disturbing films that raised huge amounts of controversy upon its release causing people to become sick and mortified the religious and faint of heart. this starkly filmed picture boasts gruesome makeup effects and some insanely cool possession set pieces... the acting never felt like acting... perhaps the actors were just as horrified by what the girl was saying as their characters were... the lighting is a key factor here as some of the scenes the light borders on being a character... Regan's face is disfigured and contorted but the stark shadows is what really makes it demonic... the music is especially fitting i was surprised the iconic tubular bells only played twice in the whole picture... the picture itself is flawless the copy i have showed no signs that it is from the 70s no scratches no markers and the grain only helps make the picture look darker and more severe... watch as a very normal situation slowly goes mad and out of control... the entire look of the film is different by the time the credits roll... as a horror fan its an absolute essential as a movie buff... its still essential... definitely not for the faint of heart... highly recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This decade's horror films have it all wrong. A person suddenly jumping out of a closet with a knife is not scary. Here is where any film seeking to chill its audience should take its cue. The Exorcist is genuinely frightening. It works so well because a) the atmosphere director William Friedkin sets up is pitch-perfect and b) we believe that these are real people being ravaged by these horrors. The special effects in this movie aren't particularly impressive but it doesn't matter. Regan's transformation from angel-faced little girl to mutilated, violent devil incarnate is done so well that we don't have time to notice any defect in the film's technical aspects. Mercedes McCambridge, who provides Regan's voice once she is completely inhabited is The Exorcist's unsung hero ? her behind-the-scenes work provides some of the most chilling material found here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, after years hearing about this classic, I finally rented it and saw. By the very beginning, I was able to see how many films were inspired by this (not to forget Scary Movie 2 lol).I've recently seen Emily Rose's exorcism, and I notice they have many similarities and many differences between themselves. While in this classic the scares are restrained, in that they are explicit and constant. While in this the psychological horror is more intense, in Rose's the atmosphere is creepier. While in this they are more concerned in the exorcism, in the other the main thing is a debate between science and religion.Both of them are good and have different touches; in my opinion, I would prefer to re-watch Emily's to this, because of simple things as photography and special effects. But in no way I would complain about this one.</fullReview>

In my opinion "The Exorcist" were almost hilarious because of its funny stuff going on and were in my opinion not scary at all, of course 40 years from the premier much stuff have changed, and people don't find this movie scary at all, but for 40 years ago i guess that this movie were very scary for the people because no one had ever seen this kind of movie like it.A teenager going possessed by the devil and gets help from two priests(Max Von Sydow &amp; Jason Miller) who tries to remove the devil from the teenager witch i have forgot the name of played by (Linda Blair). The mother is played by (Ellen Burstyn) who got Oscar nominated for her performance.The movie plot is actually very nice, and of course classic. The movie is not scary at all i think but its still a very classic and a very rare plot and story.But even the movie is old and not the best picture it is still a extraordinary tale of exorcism, witch you not gonna find in so many other movies except for this.The movie were Oscar nominated for 10 awards but only won 2.I still recommend this movie for everybody who wants to get a part of the classic old exorcism story, not the scariest movie but still rare.</fullReview>

The Exorcist was the story of a demon possessed preteen played by Linda Blair and contained very controversial content including nauseating special effects like 360 head rotations, masturbation and self-mutilation with a crucifix and absurdly powerful projectile vomiting. The film was a blockbuster in 1973 despite reports of movie goers fleeing the theaters in fear and disgust, mass hysteria was even reported at some theaters requiring paramedics to be called in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is beyond creepy. It has a sense of atmosphere thicker than pea soup. It is filled with moments that will make you go "Yikes!". The acting from the whole cast is solid. The performance that really impressed me was Linda Blair. She gives one of the finest child performances. When she is supposed to be innocent she can be compared to bunnies even. When she has to go crazy god damn does she go crazy. The cinematography is excellent capturing the dark atmosphere perfectly. Therec is also some of the finest uses of make up ever when Regan gets fully possessed. Many people call this the scariest movie ever. I wouldn't say the scariest, but would be lying if I said this wasn't one of the creepiest and most shocking ever.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why have all the good horror films gone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist was a ground breaking film, tearing up many taboos along the way. The book, which was written by William Peter Blatty, would probably scare an atheist. When the demons start yelling, Merrin! Merrin! Merrin Nnnn! That sent some chills down my spine when I read the book, and I don't even believe in demons. The Special effects in this movie were the best ever done up to that time in a horror movie, and were all done without the aid of digital effects. Linda Blair plays the demons possessed Regan, and I was surprised she was allowed to play such a graphic role at her age, until I learned she wasn't in most of the more graphic scenes. The crucifix scene has to be one of the most notorious in Hollywood history. Ellen Burstyn is believable as the at first concerned and then terrified mother. Cobb is great as usual as the probing police Lt. Kinderman. Max Von Sydow lends good support, as the doomed Father Merrin, and he is the famed hat and coat in the fog and shadows as he makes his way from a taxi to the front of the MacNeil house. Jason Miller is a key figure in the film as father Karras, a psychologist priest who has lost his faith and is charged with Regan's case. His investigation contains some of the eeriest scenes, such as his figuring out the demons messages on the tape of Regan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try to come into possession of this great title, as a number of good things under the banner of wondrous direction come to fruition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Exorcist, director William Friedkin weaves you down a tense and terrifying path of trauma; resilience; suffering; grief; the questioning of faith and, ultimately, evil. By the time the film had bedded down into this, rather literally, one on one scenario between the powers of good and evil, locked away within the confinement of a young girl's bedroom, I was worn out in all the right ways and there was still much more to come. The film fascinatingly and meticulously balances the plight of a handful of characters caught up with one another whilst on the front-line of a case involving the possession of a young girl by a demon. It details the agony and confusion at what might be wrong with her, by those close to her, right the way through to the plight of a police detective wanting to solve the cases of a handful of murders perpetrated by said spirit; all of it wonderfully well and without ever over tilting the emphasis on any one story.The film will begin in The Middle East, specifically Iraq, and an archaeologist is undergoing a large dig with dozens of locals in searching for something which is eventually found. The sense that the archaeologist has been there for a fair while, in attempting to find what it was he was looking for, is put across by way of his arriving at some ancient ruins before having some armed guards retreat upon seeing whom it actually is that has hared up to their entrance in a jeep. His time away from home and in this location suggests a great importance surrounding the item he's searching for, an importance that we feel has seen this elderly man sacrifice most of his later years in looking for it. What he finds appears to be more than a mere physical item, the apparent fever that follows his uncovering of a small fist sized trinket having him suddenly become aware of all the relatively uncanny iconography in the form of gargoyles and such when around the ancient ruins he clearly frequents often enough. If, for all that time, the said items did not all that much bother him as they tower over the general locale, then we most certainly feel something must be inherently wrong for him to be affected, scared even, by them now.Friedkin fools us into thinking this is a film about this archaeologist whom uncovered more than he thought he would in the desert. In cutting to a quaint American suburb in the town of Georgetown, Washington; the director executes his first effective gear change in tone, study and general content as the lives of an American actress in Chris MacNeil (Burstyn) and her daughter Regan (Blair) are focused on. They dwell in a large, detached house; have a healthy family relationship with one another and the domestic bliss that is this cushy American suburban existence in a really pleasant area seems too good to be true. Another major player in proceedings is young priest Damien Karras (Miller), somebody whose faith to his profession is itself under threat and whose mother is elderly and frail. The boxing trophies, his photographs and the general mise-en-scene of his small apartment in a rough neighbourhood suggests he was once a fighter, a scrapper and apparently quite good at it. A glance at his exterior surroundings and the sorts of people whom inhabit it on the career paths they are twinned with a gradual revealing of the kindhearted manner he exudes suggests a resilience through adversity; an ability to become a priest over a thief or criminal and that he may have fought a fair few battles in his time thus nicely setting things up for later duels.The inclusion of Karras is another element Friedkin introduces still without revealing a discernible pattern to proceedings nor in which the direction the film is heading. We are challenged to form a correlation between the three parties, left hanging on the fate of the early archaeologist and left questioning whose story it is. As things unravel Regan becomes ill and the doctor discerns it as an interior problem of a scientific nature which can be treated despite Regan's claims and pleas. In providing us with a 'sick' character during the opening and wonderfully establishing the extent as to which the illness affected him before cutting away without much resolution, the rendering of Regan as unwell has us wonder as to the extent it will affect her and her ability as this young girl to deal with something that it's been previously established has a powerful affect on people.In years gone by, it might have been crude to ruin what it is that forces Regan to become as ill as she does; needless to say in case you're unaware, the issue is less so a scientific one than it is one of a theological nature. As the rest of the characters are left guessing, police Lieutenant William Kinderman (Cobb) is introduced to the text, Friedkin shooting one of his exchanges with Karras beside a tennis court after previously having them get along rather nicely; the use of the court in the background and link to tennis has us think of a tennis match, specifically a one on one match of gamesmanship unfolding on top of all this other activity as Karras and Kinderman clash over the investigating of the death of a British film-maker linked to Chris. The final act sees Friedkin go for the kill, cracking on ahead with a terrifying series of scenes which work gloriously and round off a wonderful directorial job. The film, essentially a battle between good and evil, is rich in disturbing imagery without being exploitative and high drama covering a number of strands and arcs, all of which work. The Exorcist is a superb thriller, running on controversial subject matter and the brilliant direction required to hit levels of this ilk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest movie I've seen in my life!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to a good scare, check out "The Exorcist". This is the movie that changed horror movies forever, and became the most popular R-rated movie of all time which still stands to this day. When this movie came out in theaters, people like my dad stood in line for this scream-fest and some of them were sick by the time the main character turned her head around and puked crap at the exorcist!!! This movie delivers on all counts, horror, thrills, chills, and some humor. I never read the book on which the movie is based on, so I didn't have any idea of what to expect once the movie began. The sequels and prequels sucked, so the original still stands as a horror classic not to be missed!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The devil in its Catholic superstition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That film was a turning point in horror films, in a way. For sure it did not concern some kind of mythical being or character. It was centered on a real person, living next door or up the street. That's the really new element, and even so, there had been some antecedents. The second new element here is the strongly Catholic context, and it is not clear at all that the Catholic Church is not used as a justification, a stamp of truth posted on the film, in other words an alibi. I find that slightly embarrassing today for the Catholic Church and all Catholics in the world. Many Catholics consider that demons, and daemons, and so on along that line, are nothing but a pagan heritage in the Christian approach of the world. The last point is not new at all. It is the close association of these demons to something found in some archaeological site in North Iraq, in other words in Moslem territory. This can be seen today as an anti-Moslem bias and it is absolutely unacceptable. On that point, like on the previous one, the film has aged tremendously. Apart from that the film was well made and still is well made. The suspense and the progression of the plot are quite clear. We understand more or less that the demon takes possession of the younger exorcist and that this priest prefers killing himself to being possessed. There are though several points that remain unanswered and difficult to accept. Why did that demon take possession of a priest? Wasn't it more comfortable to be in a young girl? And how can the priest justify his suicide in any way? If God enables a demon to take possession of one of his priests, that priest has to wait for God to liberate him, and committing suicide is not that kind of a liberation. That's why I will classify this film among the films that played an important role when they came out and even accumulated some fame because of it, but that have today aged tremendously and lost most of their appeal. The list of those is long.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scary But Shocking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thirty-seven years later, the sharp, vivid, fine resolution of the initial Iraqi scenes brings this aging but classic movie into the contemporary age with shots so visceral of great film-making that rivals the quality of even today's advances in film work. As time passes and the scary horror films keep piling up, most of the once classic shots from turning of heads and spitting of goo have transformed this horror movie into predictability, yet the shock value remains mostly because of how utterly graphic and degrading the dialogue and the devilish behavioral occurs in this movie, particularly in the middle portions of the movie. The judicial use of horror and strange where only about five brief odd occurrences are revealed in the first half-hour reveals how focused this movie is on the careful editing and balance of horror and drama and relational interactions that pervade this film. Perhaps only the color and texture of the goo is one of the few weaknesses of this movie. THE EXORCIST retains is strong elements of acting and drama. The first third of this movie is remarkable for its almost independent and prescient approach to photography and directing almost presaging the future of quality film-making - JARHEAD (2005) comes to mind. As memory recalls only the fine, captivating technical medical scenes of the novel were moderately transferred to the film (but for adaptation purposes only perhaps). Overall, this movie minus the clanking old aging medical equipment and strange looking police cars, still keeps its amazing quality of one of the signature horror films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For quite a few years I have been an avid horror fan and my passion for the genre will never die. Horror is mainly viewed by teenagers and men with a love for scares and horror always triumphs over fellow genres. Women tend to get scared while watching horror movies and that's why they prefer watching "Romance". Horror has it all: action, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, etc. but it is better than all other genres. Movies like The Ring, Grudge, Psycho, Scream, and Poltergeist, never have scared me while The Exorcist made me cr*p in my pants. Who would've thought that an 1980s movie could scare you. I certainly expected it to be a low-budget horror movie without any scares but I was wrong. In 1980s the graphics and make up can't compare with what we have today but The Exorcist didn't need lots of money or good makeup because it offered more than any other horror movie so far (2010). The story is intense and pretty terrifying but that's whats good about this movie. In the first two minutes it was all boring but then it reaches its potential and always achieve higher than it should and for that we are blessed to have great directors. The performances by Max Von Sydow is excellent along with Lee J. Cobb and Ellen Burstyn but the real show catcher is that sweet little girl who gets possessed by the devil himself, and that lady is Linda Blair. She really gave it her best from the point to where she was human to when she gets possessed. Her devil act really had me shaking and screaming as she talked with a voice full of horror and dread. She has achieved a great career in film industry so far. The Christian theme will have some religious people p*ssed of and so be cautious when you are watching The Exorcist. Strange thing is that the novel is somewhat scarier than the film.A mysterious entity has stolen 12 year-old Regan's body and is using it to commit sins. Her mother is terrified and doesn't know what to do to stop this entity from wrecking hell. She seeks the help of a priest named Father Merrin for he is the one who can exorcise this girl and stop the demon once and for all. Be warned horror lovers even you will die of a heart attack so be cautious and have the remote in your hand for it will become handy! Mwahahhahhaha! Sorry about that evil laugh. Mwahahhaha! If you don't like spoilers, skip this part. Read the first word in the next sentence! (Spoiler!!!!) Regan has been quite naughty and she has been doing naughty acts for instance, the spider walk scared the hell outta people while the spinning head made people look away. Maybe vomiting on somebody can surely be dirty and Regan has done just that. I know someone will have a hard time washing that shirt. (SPOILER END!!!!) Nothing can compare, in film history, to that demonic voice spoken by the possessed Regan and it is one of the most original and best voices in film. The 1980s style well have you enjoying The Exorcist a bit more for those of you who have lived through the eighties in America. The Exorcist is my favorite film of William Friedkin and can you guys please watch this for my and many others sake. If you don't then shame on you for being so ignorant because you are missing out on the best horror film that will be and is the best in film history. I really loved the screenplay, script, performances by some, the novel by William Peter Blatty, and definitely the sound. The most definitive movie about possession has been made thirty years ago and it still is definitive to this day. Gore lovers will be disappointed because The Exorcist does not need gore to succeed but a good, solid, and a scary story. Sorry. Mwahhahahah! Goodbye!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that people think they should see as it is one of the most famous films of its genre. Often such well known films suffer from the fact that even before one sees it the viewer has probably heard a lot about it or seen the most famous scenes being spoofed in other films or on television, unfortunately this was the case for me when I watched The Exorcist with many of the classic scenes losing their impact. That said I still really enjoyed it even though I wasn't scared by it.Unlike more modern films we aren't suddenly thrown in to the action but slowly introduced to the characters; Father Karras a Catholic priest who is starting to question his faith, Chris MacNeil an actress living in Georgetown and her twelve year old daughter Regan who starts out as a normal girl but starts to exhibit disturbing behaviour which is initially thought to be a lesion on her brain. When scans fail to show anything and her behaviour becomes more extreme one of the doctors suggests something more radical: an exorcism.When Regan's mother approaches Fr. Karras he initially refuses to perform an exorcism saying such things are ancient history and have no place in the modern church, he does agree to see Regan as a psychiatrist though and when he does he is shocked that she knows personal things about him and is claiming to be the Devil himself. Eventually he comes to believe an exorcism is needed and the church call in Father Merrin, a priest with some experience in the field.While the special effects may look a bit dated by today's standards however they still look pretty good and don't have that fake look much CGI does. The main reason the film works so well is the quality of the cast, Jason Miller does a fantastic job as Fr. Karras and Linda Blair did such a good job as Regan that to this day it remains her most famous role. While I didn't find the film frightening there were quite a few shocks, not least of which is when Regan, who started off a sweet child, starts uttering obscenities in a strange voice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films back in the 70s are a cut above modern horror films, such as Dawn of the Dead and The Wicker Man. The Exorcist is considered one of the best in the genre and is horror expert Mark Kermode's favourite film. It is also a film that is apart of the tread of demonic children horror, which also created The Omen, another good horror film.Set in Georgetown in Washington DC, the film tells the story of Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), a successful film actress whom just finished her latest film set in the city. She lives in a house with her 12-year-old Regan (Linda Blair), an innocent, loving girl who had been suffering from health and emotional problems. It becomes clear that something very wrong with Regan, doing seemingly important physical feats, swearing and insulting everyone, screaming and speaking in a horrible voice. She claims to be possessed by the Devil and Chris takes her to see doctors and psychiatrists. After finding nothing wrong with her Chris turns to the Catholic Church out of desperation. She goes to Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), a priest and a trained psychiatrist who himself is suffering a crisis of faith.Like any good horror film, or film in general, there is a compelling story and engaging characters. There is a lot of backstory to the film, it's what you expert from a film with these sort of religious themes, and shows many conflicting emotions in the characters. You don't want Regan to suffer because she is a good and scared girl and Chris is a caring mother pushed to breaking point. It also show what lengths a mother would go to help her child. The best horror films often have a theme. There are religious themes about the existence of God, and the American Health Service; but to me, the biggest horror is of a parent who is powerless to help their children. It is a family metaphor. The film has a skilled director, William Friedkin, who won an Oscar for the French Connection, who keeps the film grounded, and focuses on the characters. There is excellent, downbeat cinematography, some wonderful shots, a great use of sound and fine, suitable music. There are some truly horrible scenes, the big one for me is when the possessed Regan is masturbate violently with a crucifix: it is a truly shocking scene. There is an excellent cast, Ellen Burstyn is a great actress and offers a powerful performance. Linda Blair was a excellent child performer in what must have been an tough role for any actress. Jason Miller too was good in his role.William Peter Blatty wrote the screenplay, based on his own novel, and show he has talent as a writer. He follows a standard three act structure but is done so well and a good example for potential writers.A masterclass in horror cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't believe I've ever watched the original cut, only the "version you've never seen before", of this. You will have to look elsewhere for comparisons; from what I understand, not all of the new is positive, however. I guess the big question that anyone who has not yet caught this is: Is it true? Meaning: Is this really the *scariest film ever*? And the answer must be "it depends". Because if you do not believe in what this depicts, and even worse, if you take this completely out of its chronological context(translation: If you don't consider that this was made in the early 70's, since some norms have changed since then), frankly, several of the things can inspire laughter rather than fear(!). And with that said... this is quite well-made, and for such a potentially sensationalistic subject, it respects cinematic language and contains proper, gradual build-up, as any well-told story does. The acting is great, including Blair's performance. Plot develops nicely throughout. The characters are credible and consistent. A scene or two just... stop, ending at an exciting time instead of resolving the conflict. The direction is effective, and Friedkin does what he can to terrify us, and no matter if you think it's real or not, most of it is unsettling, to say the least. Also, there is no doubt that this inspired later horror movies. There is a lot of strong and outright explicit language, as well as bloody violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of thrillers, especially supernatural ones. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that The Exorcist is The scariest movie of all time, and the best horror film ever made. it is about, an Actress in Georgetown Washington, D.C., Chris lives with her twelve-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair), her personal assistant Sharon (Kitty Wynn), and two housekeepers. There are mysterious sounds coming from the attic of the house, which Chris thinks could be rats. Regan slowly begins to exhibit strange behaviour, undergoing behavioural changes much like depression and anxiety. She turns up in Chris's bed one night, complaining that her own bed was "shaking".The strange happenings in the McNeil house begin to increase. Regan says that she has been playing with a Ouija board and claims that she has the ability to communicate with a spiritual entity all by herself. A nearby Catholic church is desecrated, a statue of the Virgin Mary painted. Chris her mother sees dramatic and dangerous changes in the behaviour and physical make-up of her 12-year-old daughter. Regan has brutally changed both in the way she looks and the way she acts, with violent outbursts on everyone who comes in contact into contact with her. Her worried mother gets in contact with a priest called Father Karras who comes to the conclusion that maybe Regan is possessed. At the same time Father Karras, a priest and a psychiatrist,is losing his faith, and he has deal with a sick mother who needs medical care he hasn't the money to provide for her.Meanwhile, Father Karras's mother falls ill and, due to a lack of money, she is placed in a old hospital to a ward full of mental patients. Father Karras is distraught when he visits her and she seems to blame him for her situation. Later, she dies under these conditions. The church calls in Father Merrin to perform the exorcism, with Karras When Merrin arrives at the McNeil house, Regan bellows his name from upstairs, as if she knows him, and she makes strange animal sounds. He warns Karras about talking with the demon. When they enter Regan's bedroom, she begins speaking with a string of obscene words. Merrin and Karras recite the ritual of exorcism and Regan creates strange phenomena such as levitation, telekinesis, an abnormally long tongue, and strange vomiting. She constantly curses the priests and laughes evil laughter and verbal abuse. I have watched this film quite a few times now. And it is just as good as the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt the best horror film of the 1970s and one of the best of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best kind of films are the ones that stay with us long after we've seen them. They are the ones that make for good conversation. They are the ones that make a big impression on us. One of these profound affects is fear, which we know is a powerful emotion. Being scared is very natural, but is not always fun to experience. Only in the movies is it fun and filmmakers known for making great horror films know this. They tap into our darkest fears and shatter our imaginations forever. One of the greatest examples of this is the 1973 film 'The Exorcist,' based on a bestselling novel, which in turn is inspired by a true case about demonic possession. Doesn't get much scarier than demons taking over the body starting a battle between good and evil. This film stunned viewers when it was released, has never been forgotten, and finds new fans with each generation. That's how powerful this now 30+ year old film is.Pros: An excellent concept. Brilliant performances all around. Amazing and beautiful photography. The score, which is absent for most of the film, is spellbinding. Intelligent writing and direction. Perfectly paced. A lot of creepy imagery. Some really harrowing and frightening sequences. Fantastic job done on the make-up and special effects. Keeps one riveted from start to finish.Cons: Has lost some of it's impact over the years.Final thoughts: I didn't get to see this film until I was 14 years old. Why? Because my mother was afraid it would be too much for me. This only made me want to see it more and when I finally did I was blown away. It certainly did scare me, though maybe not as much as she feared. It holds up to repeat viewings and is one of those horror films better watched at night with the lights out.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Scariest Movies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Catholic priest/archaeologist (Max Von Sydow) unearths a medal in Iraq which seems to summon his spiritual armor to the forefront. An actress (Ellen Burstyn) rents a huge Georgetown house while filming on location only to find it's housing a demon about to inhabit her 12 year old daughter (Linda Blair). Meanwhile, a Jesuit priest (Jason Miller) battles the ambivalence he has about his faith while accepting the sudden decline of his mother's health. The two priests eventually team up to battle the force within the girl before winding down to the shocking conclusion.When The Exorcist was first released in December 1973, the audience wasn't prepared for what it was about to see. Patrons fainted, entire towns banned the film, and some couldn't believe it was only given an R rating, instead of an X. Although countless imitations and the passage of time have lessened its effect, it's still one of the most frightening, stomach-churning horror films of all time. That being said, director William Friedkin refers to it more as a spiritual battle within all of us; in that, we all have fear of the unknown, but we all want to identify with what is good and not evil.Prior to The Exorcist's release, Rosemary's Baby was perhaps the most recent example of a film that scared us by blind-siding us in a way. In Rosemary's Baby, it was ordinary adults who were frightening as minions for the dark side. In The Exorcist, it's the make-up and special effects which transform a sweet-faced young girl into a demon child. Seeing this years later, some of the effects are still effective, but there are others that are phonier than a three dollar bill, like the "help me" message on the child's abdomen. The abdomen is hopelessly phony, and this detracts somewhat from the scene.Still, one can not debate each effect as if the film stands or falls based on each one's genuineness. The film builds slowly, something which horror films are not apt to doing these days. Very little happens in the first forty minutes in the way of shocks. The story is set up with suggestions planted for what's about to happen. The family is absent a male figure, the girl may long for attention she's not receiving, and the mother may be ambivalent toward religion herself. What the film never explains is how or why the demon chooses the young girl to inhabit when its origins are in Iraq. Otherwise, there would be no film I guess.At this point, there are two versions of the film and arguments on both sides endorsing each version. The original version is about 10 minutes shorter and does not contain some key early scenes, but most importantly it leaves the viewer without an uplifting ending. The extended version includes the famous, hair-raising spider-walk scene which really doesn't have a place in the film except to add another unexpected shock. The ending is what many viewers are perturbed by because it seems like a trite attempt at leaving the viewers with an upbeat ending that otherwise does not fit the tone of the film. Viewers will have to decide for themselves, as both versions are available.The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards: best picture, director, cinematography, editing, art/set decoration, supporting actor, supporting actress, actress, and it won for best sound and William Peter Blatty's screenplay based on his previously published novel, which spent a long time on the New York Time's best sellers' list. Incredibly, the novel was based on real life events. Reportedly nine individuals surrounding the making of the film died during its production including Jack MacGowran and Vasiliki Maliaros. Mercedes McCambridge provided the voice(s) of the demon and had to sue to obtain official credit for the film. Director William Friedkin failed to mention this in his pedestrian commentary. ***1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Savage Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to make this clear from the beginning: I have only seen the extended version of "The Exorcist," but it is one of my favorite supernatural movies, and definitely in the top 30 movies I've ever seen, sadly behind Richard Donner's nearly-incomparable "The Omen." "The Exorcist" lacks the thrilling subtlety and possible coincidence of "Omen," which is both a key strength and a notable shortcoming. It is a strength because it allows for a more visceral reaction to the violent images as they unfold, but it can also detract from the plausibility of the film if, as I do, the viewer subscribes to a non-Judeo-Christian faith. We know very clearly what really goes on in the film-- this is no psychological torment, it is all real, and too brutal to be convincingly faked.Except, that is, by a team of Hollywood experts like the one assembled to make the film. It may be a supreme irony that the film was released in a year that also saw the G-rated Biblical musicals "Godspell" and "Jesus Christ Superstar," allowing some members of the audience to experience in the same year both the benevolence of Christ and the uninhibited evil of Satan. But one thing is for sure: as "Godspell" and "Superstar" were classics of re-imagined spirituality, so is "Exorcist," but in a totally different way.The main conflict of the film is the demonic possession of a 12-year-old (I'm guessing) girl. Her mother (the excellent Ellen Burstyn) and everyone around loves her, and sees a wonderful purity and goodness in her soul. But when she starts cursing out everything that moves, engaging in violent spasms on her bed, and saying weird, chilling things, something goes terribly wrong.Paying lip service to Occam's razor, mama Burstyn goes looking for the simplest explanation first-- physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, etc.-- but when one suggests exorcism (not out of belief in possession, but as a "force of suggestion" cure), motherly love convinces her to try the bizarre ritual. Despite the title, there are two "exorcists"-- the jaded young Father Karras (played perfectly by Jason Miller) and Father Merrin (Max von Sydow-- remember when he played Jesus?), a seasoned veteran in the war against demonic spirits.The actual ritual doesn't occur until at least the last half hour of the movie, but it is one of the most compelling 30-minute sections of film ever captured. With equal twists of the psychological and the supernatural, director William Friedkin turns loose one of the most chilling spectacles of terror ever captured. Even with my beliefs, I still find it hard to go to sleep when scenes from the film creep into my late-night thoughts. That, I think, is a testament to its power as a movie.For those who insist that the film "glorifies Satanism," I suggest you watch it and actually pay attention. Does anybody who sees this movie actually *want* to become possessed, or serve the devil? Hard to believe.It does have a few weaknesses (pacing, dialogue, and even that Oscar-winning audio), but you'd be hard-pressed to find a stronger horror movie (except "The Omen," which is more of a thriller anyway) with as potent an emotional impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking and startling conceptual horror, once it gets going</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris MacNeil (Burstyn) is horrified when her daughter starts acting strangely and when all medical treatment provides no answers; she considers the possibility of exorcism.William Friedkin's Exorcist is marvelled by many in today's modern culture as being the revamp of horror, a marvel and a wonder with 2 Oscar triumphs and plenty of other nominations to name, but it certainly takes a while for all the accolades to kick in.Opening with a well shot archaeological dig in Iraq, we see a content looking man gazing face to face with a strange statue that fades away into the familiar American shot. Back on land we are invited into the troubled life of actress Chris MacNeil who is having trouble with her career and looking forward to returning home.When reading reviews, I found this to be one of the most horrific things to grace the screen and a shock to the system but the first hour, is perhaps the most boring and flat scene-setting you will ever see. MacNeil is having trouble, and she has a great relationship with her daughter and it's all very cosy etc, so where is this supposed tag and critical praise going to kick in? 10 years before The Exorcist Alfred Hitchcock released a shocking and brilliant film receiving an Oscar nomination known as The Birds. What the director did was skilfully place the creatures into the story juxtaposed with Tippi Hedren's protagonist and the suspense and tension were well matched against the excitement and fear factor that it was a true convincing and masterful piece of movie-making. Here we have a boring family situation along with a depressed priest that just brings the mood down rather than create a feeling of drama and suspense.But thankfully after an unbearable first hour the tension is notched up a gear with the introduction of a demon spirit into MacNeil's daughter Regan (Linda Blair) and we have an exciting and different prospect on our hands. The foul mouthed being is certainly a catalyst of evil that generates tension between the characters and sparks one of the most controversial issues today, science against religion.Back in 1973 when this was released, medicine was certainly restricted and the ongoing belief in God and Jesus Christ was as high on people's minds as it is today and the scripted dialogue impressively weighs the battle in a shocking manor, that suggests after all science fails, try religious exorcism. Very controversial and very well justified.Thankfully the second part of the film creates plenty of action and suspense to weigh the excitement and mystery of Regan's demon and there are plenty of shocking twists along the way to up the ante right until the unforgiving final scenes.After an atrocious start, The Exorcist generates thrills and spills in controversial ideologies that are definitely worth waiting around for</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest achievements in Cinema history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is without a doubt one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. It reinforced so many ideas, and it shocked millions. But even though the film is mostly known for the 'demon girl', the film itself is a great character study. The characters are so well fleshed out, especially Father Karras. Jason Miller really gives a very subtle performance. The performances by Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair are also phenomenal. The acting as a whole is very strong. The screenplay is so fully layered out, and I was surprised. The direction and cinematography is just brilliant. The film has some incredible shots and scenes. But for those horror fans expecting full entertainment might look someplace else. This is a really moral and deep emotionally haunting film. The first half is sort of slow, but I loved all the development and progress that was done in order to get where the film was going. Overall, The Exorcist is simply one of the best horror films ever made, and perhaps the most haunting of them all. Deserves all of it's praise very much</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching 'The Exorcist' today, one can safely say it has lost none of its essential power to haunt and terrify. I had only seen it once long ago and my memory proved a bit faulty. For instance, I was surprised how inconsequential Lee J. Cobb's role as Lt. Kinderman really is. And Max Von Sydow's part is shorter than I thought as well, though he has a pivotal part as the older priest, Merrin. The film really focuses on Ellen Burstyn's character (Chris McNeil), Linda Blair (Regan), and of course Jason Miller (Father Karras). Chris McNeil is not a particularly likable person, despite being a devoted mother. She is a spoiled, petulant actress who tends to throw hissy fits if she doesn't get her way. Yet she is the audience's surrogate in the film, a non-believer who ultimately, ironically becomes the most fervent advocate of having an exorcism performed on Regan. And to go off on a tangent for a moment, I believe one's reaction to the film is different depending on if you are Catholic, or were raised Catholic, because what is shown in 'The Exorcist' is pretty much every Catholic's worst nightmare. I can't say what someone else might think of it; perhaps it comes across as simply a very intense horror film. But for those brought up Catholic, I think it is doubly so. The damn previews scared me so bad, I wouldn't even see it when it came out. Father Karras is the center of the film, the doubting, tortured priest who ends up making the greatest sacrifice. Jason Miller is perfect in the role. Karras is too intelligent for his own good and yet when he sees what must be done, he proves his fears do not make him a coward. There is a telling moment when Chris asks him if Regan is going to die; he turns to her and without hesitation, says, "No." And poor Linda Blair is really run through the wringer. One can only imagine the rigors she was put through during the course of filming. But she is game, and though her part has been parodied endlessly in the years since, she acquits herself very well. A couple of shots do not hold up well, for instance, the infamous head-turning scene which now looks more phony than frightening, like a ventriloquist's doll. Most of the special effects though are excellent, as convincing today as they were 35 years ago. One of the most insidious and maddening scenes comes right at the end. The demon inside Regan has killed Father Merrin, which Karras discovers when he re-enters the bedroom. As he tries to revive the old priest, Regan sits on a corner of the bed and begins giggling, as though she has just torn up her best friend's diary or something similarly trivial. Karras goes almost insane with anger, throws her to the ground and begins punching her as hard as he can. It is a powerful scene, unforgettable... as is the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The exorcist is the ultimate horror and always will be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, The Exorcist was made in 1973 from the Novel 1 or 2 years before. The Exorcist is about an actor who calls upon a priest to perform an exorcism on her daughter, who is possessed with demons. The priest as well is having problems, not with Satan, but with the passing of his mother. Anyway, back to the review. This movie was actually supposed to have Been a Mystery type of movie, not a Horror. Instead this movie became one of the scariest and most disturbing films ever made. Through all of the footage, the film had a darkness to it, which only adds to the movie, a scary feeling of something bad to come. The actors, especially Linda Blair did an excellent job on their roles. The movie was well directed Also, and all character showed a good amount of emotion. Some of the scenes in The Exorcist, such as Reagan stabbing "herself" with a crucifix, should have landed it the X-rating. Somehow though it Received an R- rating instead. Some people complain that some of the scenes are senseless and have no meaning, I disagree that this is not true. The scenes have meaning, vague, but they do. They are hard to explain and would make this review much longer so I will not write of them. Overall this is my favorite Horror Movie and it's a great one too. Therefore This Movie gets Four Stars out of four on dish and most other movie raters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the Best Supernatural Horror Film of the 20th Century--quite Christian in its rhetoric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite that some in the Christian evangelical community have burned the original book by Blatty along with books by Stephen King and Anne Rice, the "Exorcist" hearkens back to the religious rhetoric of the late Middle Ages which has, in many ways, been reborn in the American Christian Evangelical movement. The writers of the "Malleus Maleficarum" (Hammer of Witches, 1486) and the likes of Martin Luther and John Calvin probably would have approved of both the book and the resulting movie, the Exorcist. It is the classic tale of good versus evil with the power of the Christian religion battling the forces of the Devil, right in line with many-an evangelical preacher currently propagating the "Word of God". And yet there is an underlying theme of the power of faith running underneath the superficial rhetoric of God versus the Satan.The story of a little girl in late 20th-century Georgetown possessed by a demon claiming to be the devil is an updated version of the rhetoric from centuries ago. Here, the devil/demon is not like Bram Stoker's Dracula who is versed in culture and etiquette, sporting black tie and tales. He is not the Mephistopheles of Faust by Goethe (19th century) in which the antagonist is highly eloquent. Nor is he even the character of Milton's Paradise Lost, a tragic figure who feels he has been betrayed by God. Milton's Satan is more like a fallen god or tragic hero of Greek mythology.The devil/demon of "The Exorcist" seems unearthed straight out of 14th, 15th, and 16th-century illuminated manuscripts, early printed books, and priestly/pastoral sermons, both Catholic and Protestant. Even Dante's portrayal of the Devil encased in ice at the bottom of Hell in the Divine Comedy (early 14th century) seems less horrifying than the Blatty/Friedkin monster. In the film, the devil/demon is a truly terrifying supernatural force who growls like a deranged animal, exhibits reptilian behavior, spews green vomit, speaks in tongues, reads minds, and can move objects telekinetically. And it is so highly intelligent that it "mixes the truth with lies" to attack any foe as stated by Father Merrin (Max von Sydow). If someone in the Middle Ages were transported to 1973 and saw this film when it was first released, it would have been their worst imagined nightmares realized in front of them. .There is probably no supernatural horror film of the caliber of the Exorcist, with the possible exception of F.W. Murnau's silent film masterpiece "Nosferatu" (1922). What sets the Exorcist apart is its pacing. It begins with the young Regan, played with amazing credibility by Linda Blair, having strange physical and emotional symptoms. The medical community examines her and concludes her condition is psychological and prescribes ritalin. Later, they believe it is a lesion in her brain. But as her symptoms worsen, the explanation for her illness seems beyond the ability of medical science much to the devastation of her mother, played by Ellen Burstyn in an equally fine performance. And this is where the shift from nature to the supernatural occurs. The girl begins to exhibit the demonic behavior described above.As a final recourse, the mother asks a morbid priest, Father Karras, played by Jason Miller in probably his most memorable role, to perform an exorcism on her daughter. Karras is the practicing psychiatrist for priests at Georgetown University, a Jesuit Catholic college. Although a devout Catholic clergyman, he has turned away from the medieval sensibilities of demonic possession and witchcraft in favor of psychiatric science. He agrees to investigate the case initially as a psychiatrist instead of a priest. Some of the best moments of the film are Karras' interactions with the possessed demon-girl. I only wished some of those scenes were slightly more developed as they were in the book. Karras begins to slowly conclude that the girl's condition may not be natural but supernatural...As stated above, probably the best film in the supernatural horror genre, which subsequently spawned poor sequels and forgettable rip-offs. It may be that the horror film genre is somewhat limited in the number of stories it can tell in two hours. This is probably the best film of its type in which most other offerings are god-awful (no pun intended). Simultaneously, potential new viewers should be warned that if supernatural horror is not your cup of tea, you may want to avoid this film. This is probably more terrifying than any roller coaster ride you have ever taken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of Your Reputation Exceeds You!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm annoyed at myself. Annoyed, because I don't have a clue how to rate this film. I ALWAYS rate films out of 10 after I've watched them. With some, I might change a rating after some thought; whether it be a point less or a point more. I'm sure that my rating for The Exorcist will fall between 5 and 7, I just don't know which one. But enough about my rating issue.I was not expecting "the scariest film ever" when I sat down to watch The Exorcist, tonight. I feel this is important, as too often I have seen others build up a film to God-like proportions, that they go into it with the PROMISE that they will be frightened, shocked, disturbed, whatever. When the film doesn't meet their expectations, they feel that it is the filmmakers fault. Not their preconceived ideas of what the film was SUPPOSED to deliver, in their mind, at least.Of course, it's not entirely their fault. The Exorcist is undoubtedly the most well-known, praised and notorious horror film ever. It is difficult to completely ignore the years of hype, and the ever-so widely tossed around "scariest movie ever" title. But, I did the best I could.The Exorcist is a decently made film. I didn't have any problems with the pacing, I think it's well shot, I think all the actors fit their roles very well. I was not bored during the running time, things just weren't "clicking" with me.Where The Exorcist falls down is the dialogue, and I'm not referring to Regan's possessed foul-mouthed rants. I thought the script was pathetically weak. Every line is just so clichéd, and uninformative. The cast work adequately with what they've got, but the dialogue is so empty. Characters don't really communicate with one another, they merely accept things and get on with it. This may work for some people, but I just find it weird, and it succeeded greatly in distancing myself from the characters and the events at hand.And that there is my biggest problem with The Exorcist. I didn't feel involved in the plight of this girl. I didn't feel for the characters, I wasn't concerned about their well being or their fate. The best kind of film makes you feel like you are right there watching. Or better yet, experiencing it exactly with the main character(s). Inside (2007) is a good example. Watching The Exorcist, I felt like a mere bystander.I also find the story pretty weak, and not very tightly constricted. The bulk of the film basically rests on and revolves around the possession of Reagan. So we get various visits to her room by different people. We witness her apparent "worsening" state as time goes on. I'm sure this was terrifying back when it was first released, but for me there is Nada scary in watching a 12 year old girl scream profanities. Most of which could easily come from a demon-free 12 year old boy with an attitude. Although, kudos on the, "fine day for an exorcism" line. That was a witty one. The rest, not so much. "Shove it up your ass, faggot!" gave me a smile, though.As for the "masturbating" scene, to me it looked more like self-harm. I see nothing masturbatory about it, aside from the demon yelling "LET Jesus F!CK YOU!" Regan was bleeding, so clearly the demon wasn't forcing her to do it for the purpose of pleasure, it was to harm and shock. Which is pretty much all The Exorcist does. There is no great focus on good vs evil, which I would have liked. Instead, Friedkin just throws this possession in our face, then delivers a bunch of gross out and shock tactics, while he expects the swearing, demon-infested, stronger than Hulk monstrosity upstairs to carry the film.Oh, and one thing that's been really bugging me. Maybe I'm missing something here, maybe I'm just stupid, but how on earth did the demon artifact get from Iraq to the steps outside Regan's house? Are we not supposed to know? Are we meant to assume that the demon itself transported the object with its demonic superpowers? Did Father Merrin drop it? Maybe I'll never know.One thing I do know is that I certainly don't think this is the scariest film ever, but I don't hate it either. It's competently made, but it will never be a favourite of mine, and I wouldn't consider it a brilliant film. I think that The Exorcist is a perfect example of its reputation exceeding the actual quality of the film.It's a shame, but inevitable.</fullReview>

It's a good flick, in its day it was a great one. I avoid horror movies like the plague. I've only seen 2 others. "The Omen" (suckered into it by my liking for Gregory Peck, it upset the hell out of me, god had nothing to do with it, it was things like people getting their head cut off! I've hated Gregory Peck ("Arabesque," "Moby Dick" and all) ever since) and "The Revenge of Frankenstein" which I saw when I was 10 years old and was in a state of terror and horror for days afterwards. These were trash. "The Exorcist" had some class. But it's well to remember that this is nothing but a movie. It is not a documentary of science failing and religion saving the day. It is a movie! It's not the holy grail. It's not even holy. Except the little rows of punched out squares along either side of the celluloid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was originally turned off of the Exorcist knowing what it was about. I am an atheist, so I never found the idea of possession to be by any means frightening, so I had no reason to see the Exorcist. Well, I had nothing to do last night, so I decided to try it out. Boy was I mistaken by the fact that it wouldn't scare me. As an atheist, I have to say that a movie that delt with possession scared the crap out of me... wow! The things that frightened me about the movie though, had nothing to do with the possession scenes. I found the subliminal scares to be better. The quiet scenes leading up to the climax are without a doubt the creepiest scenes in the movie, and the 1 second shots of the demon possessing the little girl where without a doubt some of the creepiest scenes I have ever seen.The special effects, while they steal the show, didn't overall impress me as much as you might expect. They took some of the realism out of the movie for me, but again, I'm atheist. That was to be expected. The special effects themselves are actually VERY good, and still hold up by today's standards.Everything else: the storyline, the acting, the script; all perfect. The only negative point for me was the fact that pieces of the plot where concentrated on too much, but that goes back to personal preference.Overall, the Exorcist is a must see for every horror fan. Whether it scares you or not, you will still never forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's not scary anymore, that's for sure! But that makes it even better, at least for one reason: People will finally begin to understand how incredible the film is, without having to be scared.How should I start? On what should I comment first? On the perfect structure (three separate stories that don't meet until the last 20 minutes)? On the superb acting of all the actors (Max Von Sydow, you're one great actor, I must say)? On the mesmerizing photography? I'm rather irritated when friends tell me they don't like it, because they don't find it scary. Well, the point isn't to get scared! I'm afraid people haven't realized yet how rich on ideas the 'Exorcist' is. First of all, it's about a society where God doesn't belong. Materialism forms its consciousness. Even the priests have lost their faith! But what happens when Satan in fact possesses a young girl? Will her mother, who till then hadn't any religious beliefs, finally start believing on Good and Evil as supernatural forces? To be brief, it's a film that focuses on personal stories; the art of Friedkin lies on the fact that it achieves to depict a whole decade's way of thinking (the 70s) through the independent dramas of 2 individuals: A priest who loses his faith after losing his mother; a mother shocked, when her little girl seems to be ill and the doctors can't figure out what exactly her sickness is. And how does Friedkin do that: By combining the two dramas at the very end of the film. And that's when father Merrin shows up: He is the Exorcist, the priest who has faced Satan before and won't lose his faith at any means. He is the bond between the desperate priest and the wrecked mother.Is the 'Exorcist' the best movie of the 70s? What does it matter, since it's one of the best American films of the past 50 years!? Oh, and one final thing: Don't watch the sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am shocked at how many children saw this movie. It is definitely not for children. I first read the book and later saw the edited TV version as a young adult of 20 and I could not sleep, heard noises and even went to confession afterward! This movie really resonated with me and made me think. It stays with me to this very day. I just ordered the 25th anniversary edition and can hardly wait to see it again.One question: would you rather come face-to-face with Freddie Kruger or Pazuzu? You only die once, but you can be possessed forever! THE SOW IS MINE!!! PS: This is a serious movie about a serious subject and some of the reviews here show how jaded and insensitive we have become. Also, all the hype and spoof movies have likely blunted the most shocking scenes, which is a shame. But isn't that in itself tribute to a film that was made 30 years ago and is still talked about today? Truly unforgettable, a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically everybody knows everything about this film and that's, in a way, because it has a very simple plot. "The Exorcist" is a terrific film that, from a simple plot, has a great development of the characters and shows the change of all the character's mind. The film begins with Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), a mother who is worry because of the strange behavior of her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) and, at the same time, the Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller) is having a complicated time too, dealing with his mother's terminal sickness. As the film continues, the situation causes more and more desperation in the characters and both are looking for solutions. In consequence of the dead of his mother, the Father Damian begins to lose his faith and at the same time Chris, in a desperate act, finds in the faith the last hope for her daughter. And finally when the exorcist (Max Von Sydow) arrives we can see how Pazuzu works, attacking to your deepest feelings. But why the victim is a very young girl? I think that is one of the many reasons of why this film was very disturbing and banned in some countries in it's time, because gives the audience the sensation that anybody could be danger, even in a secure place like your own house. But I think that the biggest reason of why this film was very controversial is because it touches a universal and very delicate theme like religion. Besides that the main theme is an exorcism, phrases like "Let Jesus f*ck you, let Jesus f*ck you. Let him f*ck you" or "Your mother s*cks c*cks in Hell, Karras, you faithless slime" were probably an insult to many people.The Cast: Everybody did a good job. Ellen Burstyn is great in the main role as a really brave mother, a bit similar to the role of Mia Farrow in "Rosemary's Baby". Linda Blair is good in the best role of her entire life, definitely a difficult role that will stay with her forever. Conclusion: "The Exorcist" is one of the finest horror films ever with a tremendous impact as any other. Definitely a must see for any Cinema lover and a perfect film for a Friday at midnight.</fullReview>

Now it is exactly 8 o'clock in the afternoon,all the curtains are shut,the light are all off and there is quiet everywhere.So i thought maybe its time for me to start the movie and let the moment i have waited for my whole life begin. This wasn't the first time i was watching the scenes in the Exorcist,because before this time i have watched some trailers and some parts of scenes of the movie on internet,and as i was watching the movie it was like the scenes in my mind where completing.After all the scenes and the voices i have listened to before i have watched the movie, at last they all coming together and that was so exciting. It was like a puzzle that was divided in half and i have only had one-half of it. There were many frighten scenes and moments in the movie and thats what scares you when you watch this movie.And one other thing which is important in this movie is that it has something in it that you don't normally see in other horror movies.The Exorcist is not a science fiction and it is actually a supernatural movie.The content of the movie may be true and may be in our own daily life.Its not like a monster movie or a movie which involves fiction killing and themes, it is a movie may tell a story which might happen in real life.Not in this way and like this but in another way. When i wanted to rate this movie,I thought that it was a kind of horrific and scary movie in a way and it did scare me for a night or so, but is it really a smart movie?yes and no,this might be only a opinion but i thought that the movie was just a bit corny sometimes.Not that it wasn't a good movie,its just that i thought i can't rate it ten out of ten. Anyway "Exorcist" is a smart movie and i really enjoyed watching it,also i thought it is one of the most scariest movies of all the time. "The Exorcist" is a well-directed movie with many stars in it and is based on a novel by William Peter Blatty.If you want to watch a very scary movie,i suggest you to watch The Exorcist"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May God Be With You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An innocent little girl, the daughter (Linda Blair, believably innocent) of a popular actress(Ellen Burstyn, a performance for the ages), is beginning to exhibit unbelievably odd behavior. A garrulous detective (Lee J. Cobb, fun and sneaky)investigates a random murder. Elsewhere, a middle-aged priest (Jason Miller, passionate and wonderful) who is forced to abandon his mother for his priesthood struggles with his cause. Elsewhere, still, is an elderly priest (Max Von Sydow, magnificent)who has come face to face with evil...and survived. All these characters will collide at the climax of an unspeakable and powerfully dark horror: this is The Exorcist. The one film continuously labeled as The Scariest Movie of All Time earns it's title unlike so many before it...and after it. A talented cast of actors at the absolute top of their game, a director who will go just far enough to frighten and move the viewer, and an eerily suspenseful backdrop all give credence to one of the few films in the horror genre to be taken seriously by pompous critics. Some think of The Exorcist as an evil film. It simply isn't. What The Exorcist is, what it represents, is an earthly battle between good and evil. An extremely strong and disturbing drama that just happens to be about the supernatural. Will The Exorcist still frighten viewers today? Depends on the average viewer. Film-goers have become desensitized by all the mindless violence and cheese-ball horrors that have come and gone since then. But the film hits the viewer in an entirely different way. It shakes your beliefs and challenges your faith. The subliminal imagery still holds up to this day, while the less sophisticated scares are still quite powerful. Try getting the score, Tubular Bells, out of your head even days later. If you are a film lover and you still haven't seen this, horror fan or not, make time for this one. It will do what movies do best: Entertain, move, even frighten you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the 14 year old film fanatic movie review on the exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi i am the 14 year old film fanatic. And your maybe thinking that people my age only like incredibly bad, unfunny and un-entertaining films like white chicks, scary movie etc. But like most film fanatics i do have taste in films unlike other people my age.The exorcist. Number one on every scaries movie ever poll.But is it?Of course at the time of it's release my mother went to see it. And like hell she warned me not to watch it. But i watched the directors cut.First of all. The cast was all very well chosen right up to the priest who was played fantastically. The mood of the film starts off on an easy pace,but then everything begins to become unsettiling. After unsetteling everything builds up to a terrefying melanchony,dark and disturbing atmosphere.The special effects were all well done considering that they weren't done in post production.But what makes the exorcist so blood curtling? Is it the atmosphere,the effects,the make-up. Perhaps it's all the events. Like the 360 head spin or the spider walk.You only know how scary it is until you see it.But please don't watch it expecting a scary film keep in mind it is a drama toooverall. Why doesn't this bloody site let you put above 10 starts?!!!!?????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still stands up after 34 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen "The Exorcist" again, some 34 years after its initial release, and must praise this as an excellent movie.Forget the hype of this being "The scariest movie ever made". It is simply excellent story-telling, and what makes the film work is the wonderful character development. Ellen Burstyn is outstanding as the distraught mother trying desperately to understand and cure her daughter's bizarre behaviour. Jason Miller is also wonderful as the priest whose own scientific training causes not only his own crisis of faith, but skepticism as to the nature of Regan's distress. Lee J. Cobb and Max von Sydow also do tremendous jobs in their supporting roles. Linda Blair's performance was so good that it ultimately ruined her prospects for any future career - she was the poster child for the term "typecast". I will not rehash the story in my review; it has been adequately covered by others. Suffice to say, this is a story about people: Not only Regan and her possession, but most importantly the reaction of sane, logical, 20th-century educated people trying to make sense of inexplicable phenomena. And it is the increasing desperation in the face of no scientific, logical answers that plays so strongly on the audience. We are forced to ask questions regarding our own beliefs, and whether we have room for the supernatural in our own ideas of the universe.The shock value of profanity and vomiting were novel in 1973; of course that's old hat today - although the spinal tap and other medical examination scenes still make me shudder - perhaps because they are all too real. But the overall thrill of the story hasn't aged a bit. In my view, that's what makes a film a classic - it stands the test of time in terms of its entertainment value. Well worth watching again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the greatest horror film of all time; still unmatched in its power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film traumatized me like no other! I first saw it at age seven(!) and I've never been that scared in a movie since. I thought for a long time afterward that the scares came from not just the film, but my age at the time. However, even in my middle age, I watch it and the hairs on the back of my neck still stand up! Conclusion: it still works.Amazing how all the imitators failed to heed the reasons WHY it works so well. EXORCIST is not filmed like a horror film; it's shot like a drama. The characters aren't pretty teens running from Jason. They're the upper middle-class people who live in the nice neighborhood uptown. Half of the actors (particularly those in the mental hospital scene) look like they wandered off of a documentary. Which makes the horrific scenes of possession and poltergeist phenomena that much more believable. The actors are all very natural. Ellen Burstyn as harrowed mother/actress, Chris MacNeill is the agnostic, audience-surrogate non-believer who is forced into a spiritual showdown of good vs. evil when her 12 yr. old daughter seems to be possessed by a demon. The signs are so subtle at first (bed-shakes, etc.), it's easy for the audience to get lulled in. After MacNeill's daughter Regan seemingly pushes film director Burke Dennings from her window, "with his head turned completely around" as Detective Kinderman (played by the wonderful Lee J. Cobb) puts it, Chris soon turns to a priest for help (on the advise of her stumped doctors). Enter Jason Miller as Father Karras; a young priest haunted by the recent death of his mother (which weakens his already shaky faith). After "interviewing" the demon within Regan, Karras seeks approval to perform an exorcism. At this point, Max von Sydow as Father Merrin arrives (bookending the film; he is in the opening prologue sequence on an Iraqi archaeological dig). Together, Karras and Merrin do battle with the demon for the last 20 or so minutes of the film and (literally) all hell breaks loose. You've no doubt seen the parodies and the rip-offs, but the exorcism scene is still one of the most powerful sequences in all of horror. Mercedes MacCambridge (as the demon 'voice') gives a heart-stopping vocal performance. But that's only part of the what this film has to offer. The build-up, the crises of faith among the leads, the potent dialogue ("I tell you that thing upstairs is not my daughter!"). All of these pieces fit together; adhered by a near documentary look that makes this movie feel like it could happen to anyone, anywhere. That's the true horror. It's NOT an abandoned carnival, or a dark castle, or a cemetery at night; it's a nice upscale home in Georgetown! The heroes are not shotgun-toting, bare-chested guys but two Jesuit priests! Whichever version you see (the original or the re-issue extended cut) be warned. Watch it alone, at night with the lights down, and you WILL be scared.I've seen MANY horror films in my life. Many good, many not-so-good. But EXORCIST is still the gold standard. Because at it's heart, it's a solid, well-acted drama first. That element of true drama (often missing in most horror films lately) helps you invest more emotion with the characters when the film abruptly jumps into its horror scenes! After all these years, it's still the greatest horror film EVER made. And (until someone gets it right again someday) will probably remain so for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist (1973)Number 1 - 1973 Top 3 Greatest Horror Movies Of All TimeIn my opinion the most terrifying film ever made. Why? There are no masked maniacs slicing people or cannibals eating people or zombies, nothing like that. Like a few other horror films (The Shining), this is an experience in psychological and supernatural terror.The Exorcist while it peaks into the supernatural, it does not go to far as to leave the mind comfortable that this thing is 100% impossible to happen. Yes OK, the hovering over the bed and the lacerations on the body maybe. But being possessed by spirits? Well we can't rule that out completely. There is some boundary; the element of the film is bordering some possibilities; it may just happen; could someone really be possessed?The film that shocked a generation and laid the path for horror films to be made; only a few match the calibre of the Exorcist and that absolute ease to terrify and engulf the viewer. This is landmark cinema.Grossing $405,000,000 at the worldwide box office, it is still nearly 4 decades on, the most financially successful horror film, even without adjusting it to inflation.William Friedkin's film is a powerfully shocking and savagely intense horror film that still holds the spot as the film most likely to shock, haunt and terrify. A technical and cinematic landmark.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most profoundly frightening film ever made. No contest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1973, as a hard-headed 14-year old, I defied my parents explicit orders and slipped into the Shreve City Cinema with a buddy of mine, to see 'The Exorcist'. It was a decision that I regretted for countless 'nervous' nights that followed. The bottom line on this movie is this: If you are a Christian and believe in the reality of spiritual evil, then this film will almost certainly disturb and deeply frighten you. Even some skeptical atheist friends of mine have admitted that this film profoundly upset them. The very best of the slasher/shock value genre of horror films, pale in comparison to The Exorcist. They may make us jump out of our seats and spill our popcorn because of a knife wielding maniac, but the core of the horror in The Exorcist is something intangible and infinitely more malevolent, the very source of every hateful, cruel, destructive, bloody act ever committed. Just a small taste of pure undiluted spiritual hatred for mankind is enough to scald your spirit for life. The Exorcist is, to this day, far and away the most frightening film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does it hold up? Yes . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget its "genre." This is no "horror" film. This is simply a brilliant film, period, that happens to stab the heart of the ancient debate: is "God" real? Is the "Devil?" No film, to my knowledge -- no novel, in fact -- has broached this subject -- before or since -- quite so directly.Odd, that "possessions" in real life (as opposed to this story) only happen to "believers." The original story (newspaper reports in 1949) of this "exorcism" upon which Blatty based his novel, is bogus. Google it.Yet Blatty (previously a comedy writer) masterfully turned the phony story into a powerful best-seller. And then, into a film.Say what you will about Friedkin's methods with his actors. None of them have been as dynamic before or since.Even if you don't "believe," this film demands you take these concepts seriously.It works on a deep level that shatters even those who profess no "belief." So meticulously constructed is the novel and the film that the reader / viewer cannot help be -- personally -- challenged and horrified.Perhaps no other film so successfully weds special effects with photography and sound. Especially not in 1973.Nothing like these words and images had ever been presented on screen before. Audiences were jolted.The film still works, but only in an actual theatre on a huge screen, experiencing it in the dark, with strangers.At home, on a TV screen, no matter how large, it is far less effective.In a theatre, the film "controls" you. At home, you "control" the film. Big difference in its impact.There's a reason "The Exorcist" is a landmark.Watch it. And forget "the version you haven't seen." Friedkin's original cut was right, and Blatty was wrong to insist on several extraneous moments, scenes and "subliminal" inserts being restored. They add nothing and detract significantly from what was perfection.Of course, long after the fact, you start thinking. And that's a bad thing. The MacNeils (Regan and her mother, Chris) are not religious. Father Karras is, but he has doubts.Who wins in this Good versus Evil struggle? The Devil.He first possesses an innocent non-religious girl then ultimately takes out a Priest and lives to possess again!Interesting, to watch Friedkin and Blatty discuss NOT wanting audiences to think that Evil won, on YouTube.Because any way you cut it, the Devil terrorizes and threatens to destroy the MacNeils then kills a priest. The Devil wins and, for all we know, may repossess Regan next week.I love this film. In real life, and through serious study, I haven't believed any of this twaddle in decades. But in the theatre or on DVD, for the three hours of "The Exorcist", I buy every minute of it as happening to THESE PEOPLE.One of the finest films ever made, and transcendent in its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie with no virtual reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films have been reduced to virtual reality images representing demons, monsters, or other evil entities. "The Exorcist" did not use any of this bogus technology that we see in these genre of films nowadays, which makes "The Exorcist" a genuine cinematographic masterpiece in this genre of movies. However, I understand that the author of the book upon which this movie is based got his idea for this story in 1950 and spent many years trying to get his book published without running into censorship. In any event, breakthrough books and movies are usually the ones that do the best. My mother told me that she was quite intrigued when she read the book to "Rosemary's Baby" in the early 1960s, because she had never come across any book like it back during that time period. I don't know what exact year the book to "The Exorcist" was published. I haven't had the occasion to read the book to this movie, but I have heard only good comments about it. However, I can say that whatever the book to this movie is like, if it strongly resembles the movie, it has to be a far cry from the conventional vampire or other scary books that may have been on the shelf at the time of its publication. As for the movie "The Exorcist", by 1973, people were ready for something different than Christopher Lee in vampire makeup or Vincent Price terrorizing his house guests in a creepy dark castle, and "The Exorcist" gave horror fans something new to digest. Hilariously enough, some people I know who saw "The Exorcist" said that they thought that it was a sincere account of a parent dealing with pre-teen hell with their daughter, who can be more terrifying than Linda Blair was in "The Exorcist." Oh, well. It was a good movie in either event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old hat and mix bag?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young teenager is possessed by a mysterious evil entity and her mother asks two priests for help in the hope they can save her daughter.From many of the comments placed, you could argue the film is almost over-rated. From the start the film still retains a creepy atmosphere but over the years it seems to have lost it's scare factor. That said, some scenes are still disturbing and the some foul language still amazes to be shocking.The score, sound and editing can sometimes be a mix bag but the acting and direction by William Friedkin is exceptional. Max von Sydows limited screen time leaves an impression and Jason Miller as Father Damien Karras plays the troubled priest, however the star is rightly Linda Blair as Regan, the actress is great especially for someone so young. There probably hasn't been a more intelligent horror film since 1973 or a better film on demonic possession. A must see for new horror fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the scariest movie i have ever seen. And i've seen my share of horror films over the years. After all these years i still can not watch this movie by my self. The question allot of people ask is why is this movie so scary? I say it's because it's very realistic. The movie is more of a drama the first hour or so, really allot of storytelling and getting to know the characters before anything really happens, which makes the impact even bigger when something actually does happen. You'll live and feel with the characters. Especially with Regan's mother, Chris (Beautifully played by Ellen Burstyn).The film has some great scares and a very haunting feeling. If you ask me, it's still the scariest movie ever.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top ten scariest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie that will continue to scare you even after multiple viewings.It's downright unsettling the first time you see it.A young girl,played by Linda Blair,begins to act strangely and when a myriad of medical tests fail to find a cause the thought begins to creep in that she may be possessed.This movie is based on the very scary book of the same name by William Peter Blatty and he does a super job with the screenplay to this movie.The direction is by William Friedkin and his pacing of this movie is perfect.All the actors are great,with the exception of Blair,who is a little too cutesy and a little too hammy in some places, at least until she is possessed and then she is quite good.Jason Miller, in his first ever movie role,as the troubled priest/psychologist is superb.Miller was a very interesting man who won a Pulitzer prize and dropped dead on stage during a rehearsal for a play.The DVD version of this movie comes with some scenes that were omitted from the theater version.The scene with the possessed girl walking down the steps upside down on her hands and feet will freak you out.I can't imagine why the original couldn't have used the scene at someplace in the movie.The gore and pea soup scenes are tame compared to some stuff we see today in movies but it is more the subtleties in this movie that will scare.A shadow,a figure behind a door or movement at a window are seen in our mind as something evil lurking nearby and we construct the scariness in our minds.Watch this movie with all the lights out late at night and then try and sleep without wondering what is under your bed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Disturbing Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSFor horror fans, how could you not like the Exorcist? It's purely brilliant in every way. You name it, the horrific events in Regan's room, to Chris's constant panic for her daughter, to Father Damien's mother's death, it's perfect. The acting is pure brilliance, even the voice for Pazuzu, the demon possessing Regan.What got to me in this film is that the fact is Regan is innocent, she didn't do anything to deserve this possession. She's innocent, I tell you, innocent! Anyway, this film is deeply disturbing, from spitting vomit on Damien, from the disturbing image of Damien's mother, to Regan doing stuff with a crucifix. This film shocked me, along with everyone else in the world. What can I say, this film is terrifying! This is the most creepiest film I've seen since Halloween, and the most disturbing film I have seen since the Shining. I must admit, this movie has gotten a bit tamer since 1973, but it still horrifies every time I see it. It is very scary, in my opinion, when you find out that something is not right with this girl. I mean, she's talking in this strange voice, she's slapping people, ans she's vomiting! It terrifying! The Exorcist is about a 12 year-old girl that is obviously possessed by a demon called Pazuzu. A priest named Damien Karras is taking care of his mother when she dies, and he doubts his faith. He then meets Regan's mother, Chris, and she tells him to perform an exorcism on her daughter. He reluctantly agrees and meets Regan. It doesn't go so well. She insults his mother, spits vomit on him, and other foul things.Father Damien Karras is then joined by Father Merrin, another priest. They throw Holy Water on Regan, and other things. They take a break. When Damien comes back into the room, he finds that Merrin is dead. He then tells the demon in Regan's body to take him. It does. He then throws himself out a window, killing him. He had sacrificed himself for Regan.Overall, this is so close to perfect.9/10 Recommend Films: The Exorcism of Emily Rose</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this really "The Scariest Movie of All Time??"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, yes. The Exorcist is easily one of the best horror films. Period. It is truly brilliant in every way. Some people pass it off as having cheap scares, bad effects and so on. People seem to forget that back then they didn't have such top-notch effects. The scares in this movie aren't cheap, either, they are genuinely scary. Be it the insanely creepy score, the white, demonic face that appears or suspense that is built up, almost the whole movie is scary. The acting is top-notch from everyone. To mention names would be unfair as every actor does such a good job. The fact that Jason Miller, Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair were overlooked at the Oscars is a travesty.There is really no need to explain the plot, as every fan of the cinema should know of it.Now, to today's movie-goer this would seem boring and out-dated. This is because this has no gore or sex. This movie relies on psychological thrills. It's all about character development and tension. And no other horror (apart from Hitchcock's Psycho) does it better. Regan's change from normal girl to demonic child is brilliant. By the time a damaged Father Karras arrives she is taken over.Now, to the scare factor. For me, this rates 10/10. The demonic face that appears throughout is enough to give nightmares for weeks (it sure gave me nightmares)!! Some of the sounds and words that come out of Regan's mouth are frightening and chilling. The head-twisting scene, the spiderwalk and the crucifix scenes are all disgusting and un-nerving. But William Friedkin handles them with confidence. He really does a brilliant job as director, I'm amazed he didn't win the Oscar. Thank God the sound did, though, as the score was amazing.I could go on and on about this, but I won't. I will just finish by saying, this is an extraordinarily good movie.5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exorcist was the best of the horror series for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of horror movies since seeing my first horror movie. My first experience in the horror was my screening of the 1953 movie "HOUSE OF WAX" and was shown in 3D. I was seven years old at the time and had to beg my Mom for the opportunity to see the film, but I was successful and it made a lasting impression on me. It made me a fan of a genre that I have carried with me into my sixtieth birthday. Many enjoyable moments along the way but none compared to the first time I viewed the movie "THE EXORCIST". There was much hoopla attached to the opening to this movie and I wondered if it would live up to its billing. I had heard the stories of how the actor depicting the director character shown in the film unexpectedly died of a heart attack during the filming, the burning down of the Chicago theater where the Premier took place. Lee J Cobb, who played the detective in the film, died right after the filming, etc, etc. This film was special, and I knew it, as a veteran of the 1950 William Castle horror films that always had a gimmick to promote its release. Who will ever forget SMELLOVISION? This was different. My wife was six months pregnant for our first-born Christopher when this movie was released and there was a warning against viewing the movie for woman carrying child. We waited until the final showing of the initial release and traveled 45 miles to see it. We were not disappointed. This film was a landmark. Here was a horror movie that actually had a story. Directed by William Friedkin, who began his career in Chicago on WGN-TV TV in the mail room and two years later began directing live TV. The man had a talent in telling a story. In 1968 he directed his first feature film, "GOOD TIMES" starring the then very hot, Sonny and Cher. By 1971 Friedkin had directed the "THE FRENCH CONNECTION" and was highly regarded in Hollywood. The book was a critical milestone and although fictionalized by William Peter Blatty was based on a true incident, which took place in 1949 in Mt. Rainier Maryland. Prior to this book, Blatty had earned his wings as a screenwriter of comic movies including "WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE WAR DADDY?" in 1966. Following an unsuccessful screen writing period, Blatty retired to a secluded cabin near Lake Tahoe, where he began organizing the story that would later earn him a worldwide best seller entitled "THE EXORCIST". The pieces were in place for an extraordinary tale that would become a horror classic. "The Exorcist" exploded into the cinema history books not as a gimmicky exercise but as a thought provoking saga of the forces of good verses evil. As William Friedkin describes in the 25th Anniversary Edition, everyone interprets the story differently. Every Halloween I view this movie and I always notice details in the story that I missed in earlier viewing. I highly recommend this movie for the folks who want to see a horror movie that does more than say BOO! Be assured that for maximum impact, it should be viewed with the lights down low and it won't hurt to view the feature "on a dark and stormy night".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what cinema should be all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is one of those films that define cinema as the art it is. It will evoke different sentiments to different kinds of viewers. Admiration and awe for the true movie aficionado. Excitement and horror for those that just want to be entertained but also are open-minded. Disgust and condemnation from those that feel it insults their beliefs (or challenges the intellect). And mockery from those that have an eye for effects and think that green vomit is unacceptable as SFX. For some people it might evoke a bit of everything. Yet, despite all the different reactions (and because of them) it has given rise to eternal debates, theological conversations, has changed the course of horror cinema (and direction) and, to the day, is the only film that has managed to threaten the human psyche to such a degree, either causing people to faint, vomit and miscarry, or democratic 'secular' states banning it for 25 years. This is cinema, not propaganda. It makes you observe, it makes you feel (to the max), it makes you think, it makes you question. For me, a true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scariest movie of the 1970's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time iv'e seen the exorcist it scared me so bad i had nightmares for days,and that was in the mid 80's,during its re-release its a modern horror film depicting the possession of an average good natured 12 year old(Linda Blair)but when demons begin to possess her all chaos breaks loose,this was done before cg effects came out.the movie seemed cursed,a few people died during filming like jack McGowan and some crew members.in the new version with the added scenes there's a lot of footage not shown in the 1973 release.the cast is great,Linda Blair delivers an awesome performance as Reagan,the little girl possessed.max Von sydow as father merrin,Ellen burnsyn as Reagan's actress mother, Jason miller as the troubled catholic priest.and lee j Cobb as the inspector on the case.no movie ever topped or even matched this,many movies like;beyond the door,abbey,and the tempter all tried but failed.the sequels never lived up to the original.fact Linda Blair injured her back during filming.the spooky music on the soundtrack is very memorable,the exorcist is the scariest movie from the 70's. it needs to be viewed in its uncensored version to be appreciated. there's a lot of strong language and violence.max Von sydow,Linda Blair and kitty Wynn reprised their roles in the first sequel called the heretic exorcist 2,which was pointless,the third one was OK,the latest one was a prequel and was'nt good in my opinion.the exorcist is a horror movie one does'nt forget,a true classic.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of the best horror movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the book by William Peter Blatty, and this movie is very close to it-he helped direct it I believe. It is truly scary if you believe in the possibility of evil and possession, it will keep you up at night. The special effects are awesome, especially for a movie from this time period-Reagan is really freaky when she is possessed. And I have to say in The Version You've Never Seen, the couple effects that they added and the scenes, really added to it-I used to have the original version, and I like the newer one, too. I recommend reading the book, for those of you who like to read, as well. Because there is more detail in a book, than they could possibly fit in the movie. For example, the only scene, that I've always thought needed an explanation, for those who hadn't read the book, is the one where the priest is in Iraq-because it doesn't tell tell you much about the significance of what he's found, or the demon itself that possesses Reagan. This is my all time favorite horror movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent horror movie. Remarkably, the film is quite unique despite doing little to break its genre strictures. It evens dispenses with any sort of pursuit sequence one might reasonably expect from such a film.Instead we are presented with a cast of broadly varied but well-drawn characters. These character and their neuroses are put under scrutiny by the extraordinary things that begin to happen around them; the surrealism and irrationality of an immoral demon pulling them all together serves as an invasive metaphor for the issues they all face.Although von Sydow's eponymous Exorcist doesn't appear until the final act of the movie and interacts little with the rest of the well-established cast, his is indeed the titular role. His pragmatism and solemnity introduces the fact of possession to the rational equivocation (in the form of the many scientists and the soap-operatic normality of the cast) of physical health, mental health, morality and their consequent metaphors.Such a complex project wouldn't work were it not for some really rather good acting from virtually all the cast, well-handled special effects and a host of great ideas in committing the whole lot to film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I soiled myself...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a horror purest. I have loved horror films since I was 4 years old. I have watched 1000's of horror films, while alone and in the dark. I own over 1500 horror films on video and DVD. I do not own this one...For it's time The Exorcist was an unheard of type of film, the 70's were about good times and free love, disco was on it's way in and love stories filled the local theaters. Bill Blatty comes along with a book that transcends the normal balance of our comfort zone, and forces us to look at a realm of consciousness that we wouldn't dare. Bill Friedkin gets the script and decides to make a film that will terrorize generations of movie lovers. The story is pretty simple, a well to do child, Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) messes around with an occult toy and accidentally summons Satan himself, (how bad could it be, right?) Once the film establishes what's happening, Friedkin unleashes a battery of the most disturbing images left on modern pop culture. The crucifix, vomit, curses, urine and spinning heads are just icings on the already melting brain activity of the viewer. I am the proud and loving father of two beautiful daughters, but if one of them ever.... I have always stated that The Exorcist is the scariest horror film ever made, and I stand by that today. I would never watch it alone in the dark, so I don't even own it. The story is so brilliant that the actors need not mention, the film is a horror GIANT, and I believe it will stay on top until some unknown director decides to take a chance and create something that no-one is prepared for, it has not yet been made. I look forward to the day that I can sit down with a bag of popcorn, turn off the lights and watch it by myself... I would probably soil myself.</fullReview>

Its one film that will possess you forever. visual,audio, and graphic nature of this film will stop your every muscle in your body, and stop you physically and mentely. If they ever remake this film it won't match. The follow up films to the Exorcist are fair to none, though Exorcist III was good. I loved how the camera follows to Reagens room with the sounds in the room and the door shut. The house was well established, looking dark inside even in the calm scenes. the devils voice is well done. the girl well dressed with make up. When Reagens climes down the steps like a spider, how grizzly!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing has ever scared me as much as this film. The special effects are simply outstanding (especially when you consider it was made in 1973) the cast is all great. You really feel for these characters. The fight between good v.s. evil and god and the devil. Wow. No other movie has ever done it as good as this film. The sequels ALL stink to high heaven though so don't even bother. Watch this film alone and keep the lights off. If you don't get the creeps then nothing will creep you out.I've seen the other version that is updated with new footage,but I didn't like most of it. I wish they only would have added the spiderwalk scene back into the film and kept the rest untouched. The spiderwalk scene is the only new footage that really adds to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't know by now what The Exorcist is all about, please skip to another review because this one isn't going to give you a synopsis nor is it going to speak of great performances.What I will share with you is how utterly scary this movie is. Teenagers and others who might think they are immune to this film because they have seen "Bloody Ax Murders Who Know What Jason Did Last Summer" type horror movies should not dismiss this as just another horror flick. To this day, I occasionally have nightmares of Linda Blair's possessed face while "Tubular Bells" chimes in the background. It's a nightmare that I am always grateful to wake from.I know that I could not even in broad daylight watch this movie without shielding my eyes or muting the sound of the demon as he speaks through the 12 year old girl with eyes that are the windows of hell.If I had it to do over again, I probably would never have watched this film. It honestly is terrifying and I've never seen anthing that has come close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly the greatest horror flick of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this brief. It is my opinion that The Exorcist IS the greatest horror movie of all time, bar none, taking into account the year in which it was released and the social response at that time. Nowadays, the shock factor is gone. Our senses have been dulled by the constant flow of lame so-called horror films that promise so much but fail to deliver. When you consider that this little movie emerged from relative obscurity in 1973 at a time when people were a lot more fearful of religion than they are now, and when you look at the horrific imagery and blasphemous dialogue that was hurled at the unsuspecting cinema audiences, it is little wonder that some of their stomach contents made an even earlier exit than they did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Why you did this to me?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Friedkin's adaptation of William Peter Blatty's supernatural tale of a young girl possessed by the devil himself caused a firestorm of controversy when it was shown. It had customers fainting, storming out of the theaters in droves and demanding that the film be pulled. Religious viewers were outraged by the blasphemous lines uttered by the possessed child. Some scenes never made it to the final film such as the spider walk scene. The religious ideas of the film may be a bunch of bunk but there's no denying that the film is harrowing. People who saw the film initially were freaked out by the infamous 360 degree head turning scene. The Exorcist is a classic horror film that was the uncontested king of the gross-out movies until Alien came along 6 years later and out did it with the chest burster scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During its original theater run, this film caused thousands of viewers to "escape" from the theater, convinced that the action on the screen was not a fantasy, but real. This is indeed "The Scariest Movie Of All Time"; everything people say about this film is true. It's terrifying, dramatic, compelling, edge of your seat entertainment. More than 30 years have passed, while the plot hasn't aged a day; it certainly still scares the proverbial "living daylights" out of a new generation of film buffs.Linda Blair's electrifying and critically acclaimed performance as the possessed pre-teen catapulted the young actress to instant (if short-lived) world stardom. "The Exorcist" became one of the most successful films in the US as well as Internationally. If thrillers are your bag, you are going to like this picture!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that you can't fail to have heard about before viewing it. Famous for being banned, it certainly has some controversial scenes, but nothing that will destroy civilisation. The story is of a young girl, for some reason called Regan, who is possessed by the devil. She becomes rather rude and demented, her manners vanishing noticeably. An exorcist is called in to sort things out, but finds that Regan is a tough cookie to crack. The young girl is absolutely barmy and there are some chilling moments when she loses control and attacks people, but luckily it all works out in the end. The famous head turning scene looks a but comic nowadays, whilst the vomit episode has been spoofed so many times its hard to view seriously. Nevertheless, this is a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest film of All Time? No but an excellent movie nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a good share of horror films,and from what I've heard this is THE ONE that scares everyone,the one that makes you have trouble sleeping,the one that'll make heads turn(Bad Joke). I received The Exorcist as a gift today,and to tell you the truth the legends about the film being so scary frightened me. The Exorcist tales the story of Chris MacNeil,and her beloved daughter Regan,they share a close bound.Chris is somewhat of a movie star,and has a big house.Regan becomes ill,she starts saying vulgar words,and acting violently.Chris naturally worried contacts every doctor she can find,until they recommend getting the help of the Catholic Church.Chris meets Father Karras,who is at a time in his life where he seems to begin to loose his faith because his beloved mother passed on.Karras is also a psychotherapist,he agrees to see Regan to see if an Exorcisim is the right thing to do.Regan is now controlled by the Devil,who knows Karras is weakening,The Devil insults him about his mother,and towards the end speaks in his mother's voice.Karras then asks if he speaks other languages,The Devil did but it was backwards English.Karras plays the tape,and the name Merrin is shouted over and over.Karras knows he has to perform an Exorcism.The Church authorizes one,but sends Father Merrin to over see it,as he had performed a similar Exorcism before *cough,Exorcist:The Beginning* In the Director's Cut which is what I have there is an interesting scene which has Merrin unearthing a sculpture of the Devil on a dig in Iraq.Merrin know he has to face the Devil again,he doesn't even open the letter asking him to perform the Exorcism.The priests go to perform the Exorcism,but can they save innocent Regan? The Exorcist is not a scary film(well at least to me) I believe the reason it is hailed as the scariest film of all time is because the generation that saw it in 1973 was a Catholic one.The concept of the film is very scary,movies about Hell all most all ways are.The film does have a lot of disturbing images(The split pea soup scene,Regan stabbing her private parts with a crucifix,and Karras' demise.The character development is great,both priests are somewhat flawed,Karras is loosing his faith,and Merrin has had heart problems since he performed his last Exorcism.The Direction is great too,how the house changes through the course of the film.I agree that the Exorcist is an excellent film,but not one to be scared of.10/10 or 4/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rightfully hailed as one of the scariest and most famous movies off all time, The Exorcist was both critically acclaimed and smashed when it was released. Although 30 years have past, the film is still one which inspires fear, caution and awe. However, does it still live up to the name of 'scariest movie ever', or has time taken its toll? The Exorcist, adapted from Blatty's novel tells of a young girl becoming possessed by a demon. Her mother cannot cope with her sudden change, and being a famous actress, stops at nothing to find out what is wrong with her daughter, employing scientists, doctors, psychiatrists etc. At first they claim her behaviour my be caused by a brain lesion, others think it may be drugs or simply the trauma of growing up in what they feel is an unstable environment. However, her behaviour goes beyond extreme and the doctors know the case is above their understanding. When a friend dies, a cop investigates. It is recommended that perhaps Regan should see a preacher. Chris Macneil tracks down Father Karras who has recently been having a crisis of faith. When he encounters Regan, he too feels out of his depth and becomes even more troubled. Father Merrin, a man who has followed supposed demons around the world, and who is the only one to have performed an exorcism before, is called in to help, and the two men begin. It becomes a struggle of faith and between good and evil, to save Regan's life.Freidkin's direction here is cold and stylish, and we get a real sense of something, not only lurking inside Regan, but outside the house, throughout the city, and inside many others. Blatty's novel only gets exciting in the last few pages, and Freidkin does well to make the entire film nervy and full of fear. The constant images of the loss of faith in individuals and society greatly add to the growing fear. Butchered statues in churches, priests meeting in shadowy places and having no inner strength etc. Blair steals the film with her brilliant performance, helped by the score, sets and effects of course, but her transformation from innocent 12 year old to monster and back seems effortless for the actress, terrifying for the character. The supporting cast are all flawless too, meaning this is not just another messy horror film banned for content, but a true cinematic classic, rich in theme and substance. Burstyn is strong as Chris, trying to juggle being a single, famous working mother and the attack of this evil force. Von Sydow's performance is small but effective, and he once again commands the screen while on it. Miller is excellent as Karras, a complex character whom he develops fully, and Cobb is also good. The famous theme, although barely heard during the film is one of horror's best, but it is the mix of screams and noises which add to the atmosphere and other-worldliness.The content- the blasphemy, swearing and actions of Blair, was the main reason for the film's various bans. However, with society as it is now, with all that has happened in the past 30 years, this seems tame, or at least it does not have the same impact it once did. However, this is not to say the film loses its power. It is still frightening, with many moments which will haunt you, the floating, head-spinning, vomiting scenes, and of course, the spider-walk. It is true that now we can watch and understand it more effectively, whereas upon its release we may have been biased, or seen it purely because we had heard that it was evil. The flashes of that demonic face will get a few jumps out of people, while many will continue to avoid seeing it just because of what they have heard about it. This is unfortunate as it is a truly great film, one which lives up to its fame.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am currently 14 years old, and i am a very big horror fan and ever since i was about 12 i wanted to see the exorcist because thats what came up when people talked about scary movies, and i was eager to see what they were talking about and experience the terror myself. Last year was when i first watched it, at first i was disappointed because at the beginning it was a little boring and i couldn't stay concentrated, but as it moved into the house with Regan and her mum i started to get interested.It is a very terrifying movie, which is well put together and i have to applaud Linda Blairs performance because she was the best actress in the film and to top it off she was very young.I was also a little disappointed because it wasn't as scary as i thought it would be, i heard so much about it and when i came to watching it it wasn't what i expected.I think this is partly to do how many horror movies I've seen and comparing the technical effects and that it wasn't as good as i thought. But is an amazinly powerful film! everyone needs to see this, because it has a very good story to it, terrific acting and much more. Cant be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is actually good in the Exorcist is success in combining strong mystic basis with a good-quality drama. Story lines of both mother and Father Karras portrayed believably and touchingly thanks to Blatty, Friedkin and for sure actors.What else is good? Some visuals - e.g. that bluish lighting in Regan's bedroom, camera movements around the wrapped bed, Regan/Pazuzu stare and animal roaring, the scene with the crucifix. Most of Pazuzu lines are adequately cynical and explicit. The most disappointing about this movie is inaccuracy with details. E.g. the tape recorded message of Regan could be a much stronger scene of daughter missing her father and could explain much better why Pazuzu decided to possess the girl. Some lines of Pazuzu are counterproductive (like "it would be a cheap exercise of power"). Most of the special effects are unnecessary and excessive compared to the care authors paid to the drama component.The Exorcist deserves right to be treated as a classic as it set the standard in its genre. Nevertheless, for inaccurate script and excessive use of the effects it deserves only 7/10. Another classic in the genre, the 6th Sense is much better in the above terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breakthrough horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read my other film reviews and comments, you can pretty much tell I like older films. Recently, I have been getting into more of the classics from the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, I do enjoy the horror films and thrillers and believe it or not, I finally got around to see "The Exorcist" this past fall season. I have had a few opportunities to see this movie on TV or rent it, but just never did. Seeing it on TV, I am sure I missed most of the controversial content that was a taboo in 1973, but still some of the scenes are pretty shocking and unforgettable even by today's standards. Linda Blair and Ellen Burstyn literally went through "hell" in making this, both suffered injuries and were put through grueling preparation for some scenes. The special effects are pretty good and the voice of the devil, which was done by 1950s actress Mercedes McCambridge was believable. I read she had to sew Warner Brothers because they originally did not give her credit as the demonic voice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE MOST SCARIEST &amp; THE MOST BORING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally worked up the courage to see 'The Exorcist' last night. There was a lot of talk, which I think was necessary for the plot. However I was only interested in the scary segments which were scarce. While sitting through minutes upon minutes of endless babble I wanted to turn it off for lack of interest. However, every now and then they would show a scene with the possessed girl which would then jolt me awake and scare the pants off me and then I would want to turn it off for lack of courage. Following that, I began to fall asleep again during the useless sections of nothing.So basically what I'm trying to say is that if want it for the horror, then watch the 2 minute trailer that comes on the DVD, because it collected the few horror scenes along with 'The Excorcist' theme song in an absolutely spine tingling clip that leaves you wanting more. But that's just it.....there isn't any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this is the best "scary" movie ever made. It has and will stand the test of time. I believe the reason it works so well is the well-written story, the caliber of actors and the cinematography. There is suspense and scariness. I especially like the "new" version. It explains more and you understand why certain things are happening. When I first saw the movie I was 13 and I loved it!! Now, as a mom I still love it, but I see it differently. Now I view it through a "moms" viewpoint. It takes on a new meaning. I love scary movies and this is by far the best one out there. No "gore" just "scare". I love it and highly recommend it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me this is by far the best Horror movie ever. I really hate calling it a horror movie though. When most people mention horror movie I always think of those "slasher" movies that always seem to be popular, though I'm not sure why. Sure The Exorcist will scare the heck out of you, but it is also a great drama. The different people who have their own problems, all come together to fight the one evil. The mother who only wants to help her daughter by whatever means possible. The priest who is not sure about his faith in his religion. The old priest that comes to the rescue only to fail. (That scene when he dies and Father Karras comes back in the room and Regan is on the bed giggling is one of my favorites) I truly believe that you have to be a thinker to get this movie. Anyone can make a movie with some guy chasing teenagers across the screen with an ax or chainsaw and call it horror. But its not scary. But what is more scary than the unknown and unseen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book vs Movie (original and director's cut)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it in its original theatrical run. The new director's cut shows an extension to the scene where the director's assistant comes and tells Chris that Burke was found dead on the sidewalk below Regan's window. In the theatre she turns to the wall and Sharon moves forward to comfort her. In the extension, Chris turns to the stairs thinking about Regan's recent behavioral problems and how them might been connected to Burke's death. Just as she does this, Regan comes down the stair on her hands and feet, but on her back, not on her stomach. She opens her mouth and blood spills out.Now, all through the extended version, you see a ghouls face do a split second appearance in various places. In the original, there was a scene close to the beginning in Regan's bedroom where Regan/Legion informs Father Karras that Sharon fantasizes about him nightly. That segment of that scene was removed in the director's cut. When the movie first premiered, the cast was on the Mike Douglas Show and it was mentioned there that the story was based on a true incident that occurred many years ago. I found the book the movie was based on and read that as well. There are some things in the book pertaining to the credibility of the incident that would raise the hair on the back of your head. Other trivia is that Jack MacGowran (director Burke) was taking a nap on one of the unused bedroom sets during the final filming.That set caught on fire and he was killed in it. I don't know how the fire was started, or whether he was burned or died from smoke inhalation. A whole canister of film had to be reshot because of double exposure. It was suppose to have been sealed to prevent that, but it happened anyway. The movie itself is a superior piece of work. Ellen got an Oscar nom for her work. Jason Miller went from acting to playwright with "That Championship Season". It is a scary and dark story that reminds you that there are things that should not be trifled with in this world and this is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when i was very young. It was reintroduced to me several times through out my life. Every time i watched the film it got more and more scary. Images from the film must of gotten embedded in my subconscious because i've had nightmares centering around the subject of possession. The film was one of the first films that were actually better than the book. The murder of the director is not seen yet creates a very strong image of what must have occurred in Regan's bed room. I am 31 years old now and i refuse to watch this film alone at night. I made the mistake of watching the movie with friends while house sitting and staying in the basement only to have my friends leave me to face my room alone, i was 24 then and it SUCKED.

		<shortDescription>Where the art of storytelling and the art of shock value meet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Exorcist" revolves around a 12 year old girl named Regan (Linda Blair) and her mother Chris (Ellen Burstyn) who live in a colonial-style Washington home. Chris is an actress, and she and Regan move around a lot. Things at the new home seem to be going well - until Regan begins to act very strange. She can't sleep, her bed shakes in the middle of the night, she has bouts of body convulsions, and these symptoms progress. Her mother goes to numerous doctors to find help, and even the doctors aren't sure what's wrong with her daughter. Chris finally comes to the conclusion that Regan may be possessed by the devil himself. She then goes to her last resort, and consults a Catholic priest to perform an exorcism on her daughter. Often quoted as the scariest film of all time, "The Exorcist", while maybe not the scariest, is surely one of the best horror movies to come across the silver screen, ever. Based on the equally shocking novel by William Peter Blatty, the script here is stunning work. Blatty also wrote the script himself, and the translation to the screen is done with precision and the result is absolute brilliance. What's most remarkable about "The Exorcist" is its maneuvering of narrative progression with the shock value that only film could capture.The film contains a multitude of subplots; a struggling actress, a helpless mother, a Catholic priest whose faith is in limbo, and a twelve year old girl possessed by the ultimate evil. In the beginning of the film, Regan is a seemingly normal young girl with an often absent mother. But, ever so slowly, we begin to see her personality transform over the course of the film, until she has become an entirely different person, possessed, and a monster - slapping her mother, masturbating with a crucifix, uttering every curse word imaginable, vomiting green slime; the transformation is done with subtlety, but the pace at which she morphs is perfect, and the final result is tantalizing yet in-your-face. The acting is excellent, Ellen Burstyn gives a solid performance as the terrified, helpless mother who doesn't understand what's happening to her daughter. The audience sympathizes with her and is able to feel her fear and concern over the supernatural force that has grasped her daughter and won't let go. Linda Blair in the performance that defined her career (for better or for worse) is incredible as the likable little girl with a sweet and innocent face. Blair manages to evoke this innocence with ease, but what she manages to do even better is envision her possession of an unspeakable evil. She conveys the vile, evil nature of her possessed character, and is, in a way, a monster. Max von Sydow plays Father Merrin, and is excellent, as is Jason Miller as the "looks like a boxer" Father Karras. All the acting here is solid, I can't think of anything that was in need of work - the cast is perfect.Friedkin utilizes a plethora of Catholic imagery and various symbolism throughout the film that add to the overall creepiness of the movie, and the religious message that is behind it all. I watched this when I was thirteen, and it scared the living hell out of me (literally). Watching a sweet-faced little girl go from normal human being into a foul-mouthed, disgusting "thing" is disturbing on so many levels. The special effects were extravagant for the time, and most of them still hold up well to this day. And the final scene between Regan and Father Karass is an absolute cinematic landmark? the culmination of a precise weaving of narratives with the shocking and the macabre. "The Exorcist" is a shocking piece of cinema. It's superbly acted, gruesome, disturbing, and flat out scary on so many occasions. It may sound clichéd, but it is without a doubt one of the greatest horror films ever made. The artful manner in which the story is presented, combined with its strong cast and perfect balance between narrative and shock value is unmatched. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest movie of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is "The Exorcist" really the scariest movie ever made?For me, watching it for the first time in 2004, no.But by the horror film standards of the early 1970s, when The Exorcist was released into cinemas, yes, this is the scariest film of all time.The Exorcist's history of being banned on video in several countries and causing it's 1973 theatre audiences to faint and even reportedly miscarry, draws the conclusion that nothing this disturbing or haunting had ever been seen by movie lovers before.The new uncut version has notorious scenes that were deleted from the original release including the brief but compelling Spider Walk. It really is "The Version You've Never Seen".But for those who may have since seen Jaws, The Silence of the Lambs, Alien and Halloween, The Exorcist in the 21st century may certainly astonish like no other movie, but just doesn't scare in the same respect.That doesn't however mean you should not see this movie. It's gripping, suspenseful, spine-chilling and hair-raising and by the time we reach the final exorcism, you'll be hard pushed to find an experience as legendary and as chilling as The Exorcist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive piece of cinema, but hardly scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of the most controversial movies ever made, the Exorcist was one of the first to so explicitly target religion in such a mainstream way. Viewed as a work of heresy by the Catholic church, the Exorcist's plot centres around young Regan, the daughter of a famous actress, who seems to be possessed by Lucifer himself. After trying everything down the medical road, her mother turns to religion, and Father Damien Karras.Karras recently lost his mother and blames himself, and added to this the fact he seems to have lost his faith would compel us to believe he's not the best reverand to be dealing with an exorcism. Enter Max von Sydow's Father Merrin who's previously carried out a 4 month exorcism, however, and the 2 of them take Hades on, head to head.This film goes down in folklore due to the hype and reputation surrounding it. And yet, when we probe the surface, what we really find is a simple good Vs evil yarn, albeit with a supernatural twist.It must be said that Blair is quite incredible as Regan/the demon, and never fails to convince us that she is either or both. The makeup and special effects are extremely well realised, and there's no doubt that in the 70's, this would have been terrifying stuff. Nowadays, however, the likes of Ring have eclipsed this on fear levels, and consequently I barely even got a chill out of this - but I *did* thoroughly enjoy it. The level of 'wrongness' is quite good, what with the semi-subliminal demon imagery, and the all-round performance of Blair - especially that Spider walk down the stairs...All in all it adds to really a rather enjoyable and impressive piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest movie ever on a motion picture!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is definitely the scariest movie of all-time. The possesed 13 year old girl just scared the living hell out of me. The end was by far the scariest when the two priests try to take the devil out of her and another scary scene is when she turns her head around and when she's strapped to her bed, talking to the priest. I am a catholic and I'm deep into my religion, so it just scared me to death watching this film. So many scenes disturbed me and throughout the movie, I almost couldn't keep my eyes open. I'd give this movie a 10, only because it is the scariest film of all-time.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the scariest movie of all time, i still have nightmares after watching this years ago. I loved all the special effects and all the actors in this movie are fantastic. They are all brilliant including Linda Blair. I love the spider-walk scene and the message on Linda Blair's stomach saying (Help Me). This has got to be the scariest horror movie ever, and should be Number 1 in the horror chart. I can't wait to see Exorcist: The Beginning that looks really good. I hope they go on forever making sequels with new stories. I have see both version's original and director's cut and i have to say Director's Cut is way better. There are a lot more scenes in Director's Cut and it's a lot more scarier. If you havn't seen Director's Cut yet, you have to see it, it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is still a scary film today. Some of the effects look a bit dated, but the style of the photography gives it a documentary feel. I suspect the Blair Witch Project borrowed some of it's ideas from the Exorcist. As with most great horror films the real fear comes in the things that we don't see. Regan is a normal child until being possessed and undergoes all manner of treatment from the normal medical community. Eventually it is decided that the Catholic church needs to be brought in to complete the exorcism. Definitely not a film to watch on your own in the dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What to say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been hesitating to review this film even though it's one of my all time favorites. I mean, what can I say about it that hasn't already been said? This film is a true classic, simply because it was so far ahead of its time.I can remember seeing TV advertisements for it when it was first released, and I couldn't have been any more than 3 at the time. I got my first chance to see it when I was 12 and mom was working late. Of course, she never would have permitted this, so I kept it a secret...until one of California's routine earthquakes sent me screaming out of my violently shaking bed in the dead of night two weeks later. Fortunately, mom was too busy laughing to be mad at me.Anyway... I'm not going to waste time rehashing the plot frame by frame. Everyone knows what it's about by now; even non-horror movie fans know who Linda Blair is and often refer to her as the "Pea Soup Girl." Blair gives an astonishing performance as the twelve year old girl possessed by the "Devil," although stunning opening scenes shot in Iraq reveal the devil in question to actually be an ancient Sumerian (or Assyrian) demon known as Pazuzu, a bringer of hot winds and fever. No matter. Pazuzu's motives are never made clear as to why he has chosen this one little girl, but that's not the point of the film. Blair is not the target here; everyone who must sit helplessly back and watch her suffer are the true victims. The priest who is losing his faith, the atheist mother with the bad temper and the priest whom Pazuzu has battled before. There are moments of sheer subtle genius in this film, as Karras sits in a bar and admits he has lost his faith as the song "Lord I Was Born a Rambling Man" plays in the background, as Regan and her mother innocently wrestle over a cookie, a scene which will be repeated later in the film with the laughter replaced by screams and the cookie replaced with a crucifix. There are also moments of perhaps unintentional humor, as doctors light up cigarettes in hospital corridors and prescribe Ritalin without blinking. True 1970s stuff here. The effects are still quite shocking even 30 years later; gross, upsetting and sick. In particular is the voice of the demon, as performed by Mercedes McCambridge. It is a shocking effect, a multi-layered chorus of the damned speaking in Legion out of the mouth of a little girl. It disturbed me more than the green puke or even the terrible ripping sounds that accompanied the crucifix scene. Max Von Sydow is wonderful as the kindly but strong Father Merrin, who literally battles to the death for the soul of a little girl he has never really met and will ultimately never know. The ending is both devastating and triumphant, and was not at all the "downer" that I have heard other people refer to it as. What can I say? This movie is a masterpiece, right up there with "Rosemary's Baby". You can't say much about films as great as these that hasn't been said already, but even if I'm repeating what the masses have already confirmed, it's better than saying nothing at all. This movie is a classic. It always will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aesthetics raise a pulpy story to beautiful heights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cosmology of `The Exorcist' is so conservative it's almost embarrassing--this story takes place in a world of absolute good and absolute evil, where the bad guys are supernatural monsters who attack children and the good guys wear black suits with white collars. For all its legendary shock value, it's really about as subversive and blasphemous as a Sunday-school pageant, and in another director's hands, it could easily have verged into the preachy, campy territory that `Bless the Child' would explore almost thirty years later. But William Friedkin works something of a minor miracle with his pulpy, didactic material. Like Francis Ford Coppola did with `The Godfather,' he takes a fundamentally stupid and obvious story and uses style to transform it into something brilliant. And truly, `The Exorcist' is an aesthetic marvel, with Friedkin's incredible sense of rhythm and timing apparent everywhere. The early scenes establishing the characters are so flatly scripted, they might as well have no dialogue at all, but the director's detached, almost voyeuristic approach makes them seem authentic rather than clunky. We feel we are seeing banal slices of these characters' lives, and that's what makes the introduction of the vulgar, loud, stylized demon so jarring. In fact, the film works best as a study in contrasts--long scenes of great stillness are punctuated with moments of sudden violence and grotesqueness, and the result is not an effect of mere surprise, but real sensory horror. Friedkin's use of sound is great too, not just in Mercedes McCambridge's famously foulmouthed performance, but in such sudden startling touches as a phone ringing, or something rustling in the attic, or a woman's voice suddenly speaking with a Greek accent. (Both the sound and the unusual pacing suggest the Roman Polanski of `Repulsion' and `Rosemary's Baby.') As for the acting, it's fine across the board, with Jason Miller standing out as the weary antihero Damien Karras. Whether the film is scary seems to be much a matter of personal taste, but even if you aren't frightened, it's hard to deny the staggering beauty of the filmmakers' expression here. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most important modern-horror movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?The Exorcist' tells the story of an innocent twelve year old girl named Regan (Linda Blair) who starts to exhibit strange, often violent, behaviour. After numerous medical tests her despairing mother, Chris (Ellen Burstyn), calls in a young priest by the name of Father Karras (Jason Miller) who, to begin with, believes that Regan is somehow faking demonic possession. However, after Karras conducts numerous tests he becomes increasingly convinced that Regan is indeed possessed by a demon and enlists the help of Father Merrin (Max von Sydow), an ageing and experienced priest. Together the two attempt to rid Regan of the demon that has afflicted her.William Friedkin directed the screen adaptation of William Peter Blatty's best selling novel, which was based upon the last known exorcism to be carried out in the United States. Blatty changed the little boy from the 1949 incident into the young girl that we know as Regan and Friedkin's adaptation of the story became one of the most controversial and infamous horror movies of the past thirty-five years. ?The Exorcist' is far more than a simple horror story about demonic possession. Blatty gave us characters that we could care about and sympathise with and Friedkin transferred these characters to screen wonderfully. The characters all have a history and their own traumas that feature heavily in their lives. ?The Exorcist' has been condemned by some as showing evil to be more powerful than good, but ?The Exorcist' is a story about fighting ones own personal demons. The subtle undertones of the movie portray that sometimes having faith is not enough; we all require help from time to time. This message is subtle but apparent, yet never removes any of the horror. The way that Friedkin manipulates his characters gives, what could be deemed as an unrealistic movie, a shocking sense of realism. The characters are far from one-dimensional and that impacts even more heavily on the viewer.By pushing the limits of what was acceptable in terms of violence and taking horror effects further than they had really been before, Friedkin introduced us to a new wave of cinematic violence that would pave the way for far more brutal and gruesome exploitation movies, yet none had the raw impact of ?The Exorcist'. Although the effects used in ?The Exorcist' were very basic, the impact that they had on any viewer willing to consider the subject matter was enormous. Unlike other similar movies, every aspect of the portrayal of ?The Exorcist' was vital to the script. One is forced to feel for this innocent twelve year old girl and her despairing mother as all manner of horrendous events occur. Convincing acting performances from the entire cast (although Regan's demonic voice was dubbed in by Mercedes McCambridge) certainly aided ?The Exorcist' in becoming the movie that it is. Ellen Burstyn is exceptional as the despairing mother and one can do nothing but empathise for her character as she is driven to a near-breakdown, but remaining strong for her daughter's sake. It is hard to imagine how a loving mother would truly react in such circumstances, but one would believe that Ellen's portrayal was not far off the mark. Jason Miller's performance as Father Karras is also extremely powerful. His crisis of faith after the upsetting events in his life is portrayed beautifully and gives his character an air of humanity that is rarely found in horror movies.Without a doubt ?The Exorcist' was helped by the numerous reports of people vomiting, fainting or running out of the theatre screaming. The extremely troubled production of ?The Exorcist' (which included a set catching fire and people dying) also added to its notorious reputation. However, even without this unfortunate infamy, there is little denying that ?The Exorcist' is a movie of extremely high historical importance. Blessed with ten Oscar nominations and breaking the box-office record previously set by ?The Godfather' one can hardly doubt the impact that the movie had on the genre and cinema in general. One can debate whether ?The Exorcist' took the subtle, psychological horror of movies such as ?Rosemary's Baby' (1968) and added extreme exploitive horror, or whether it simply plays on fears of the unknown ? perhaps even a mixture of both? Nonetheless, ?The Exorcist' remains one of (if not THE) most powerful, shocking and compelling horror movie of all time. It is possibly the most important modern-horror movie as it's influence can be seen in such movies as 'The Omen' (1976), 'The Evil Dead' (1981) and even 'The Amityville Horror' (1979) to some extent. My rating for ?The Exorcist' ? 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One scary masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist has been called the scariest movie of all time and I'm inclined to agree with that. The Exorcist is the best movie that William Friedkin ever made, and that includes The French Connection. It's hard to describe the atmosphere of the film without seeing for yourself. You get the feeling that something isn't right. Even in the beginning, before you have even seen Linda Blair, you get this feeling of dread. Not many films can do that.I wonder sometimes why Linda Blair never went on to fame and fortune after The Exorcist. She does a fabulous job as Regan. Her performance is even more amazing considering her age (12) at the time. She had to endure some serious tortures for the role and her acting in the film is shocking. The rest of the cast: Max Von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn, and Jason Miller all turn in credible and emotional performances. Special attention must go to Jason Miller (Father Karras) since this was his first film. The subliminal effects, makeup effects, and sound effects all turn The Exorcist into something otherworldly. When you watch this movie, you get the feeling that Satan might very well exist and he might even have had a hand in making this movie. At the very least he had a hand in destroying Linda Blair's career. Bottom Line: This masterpiece should be on every movie fan's shelf. If you haven't seen it yet then you've really missed out. Oh yeah, in the new version with restored footage, the spider walk scene scared the living @%#$ out of me. And I'd seen the movie countless times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. The first time I saw The Exorcist I thought it was good but severely overrated. It just didnt seem that scary to me. A few years later, I decided to watch it again, I was shocked by how powerfully disturbing the film was. The movie has some scenes that will disturb the mind. It is a movie that will get under your skin. The acting is a major strength in The Exorcist. Ellen Burstyn is excellent as Mrs. Macneil. Linda Blair is fantastic as Reagan Macneil, the possessed girl. Burstyn and Blair have a strong bond that makes the mother-daughter relationship seem very real. Jason Miller is very good as the Priest who has inner demons of his own. Max Von Sydow has a brief but definitely good role.The Exorcist is loaded with atmosphere, thanks to some excellent Cinematography. The Exorcist has a number of disturbing scenes. William Friedkin does a masterful job directing The Exorcist. The Script is also very well written and the music is a bit creepy, perfect for The Exorcist. The Exorcist is not flawless, but it is very good and bound to give you a few chills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't see what's so scary about this movie. I rented it, under the pretense that I would be scared to death since I had heard so many good things about it. I have to admit that it is a extremely disturbing and creepy film but there definitely wren't any scary moments.There are to me, also a lot of plot holes that I missed or didn't pick up on. Regan, for some reason gets posessed by the devil but its never mentioned why. In addition, we see a early picture of the Exorcist in his younger days during the early miners dig but I just don't see why that scene is important (I rented the unedited version by the way...)All in all, you see the doctors throughout the movie try to figure what's wrong with Reagan before taking her to see a psychiatrist. To me, this movie is part entertaining and silly. It pretty much looked as if little Reagan was actually high on drugs or something.. nah, they just had it the other way around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The exorcist is one of those movies (right up there with Citizen Kane and Casablanca) that will remain with popular culture forever. It is truly frightening, with scenes that can actually make you feel physically threatened. Now, some reviews have been done by people with religious upbringing, and i can see how it would have a great impact to them. I, however, am an athiest, and i have to say, the movie doesnt lose any of it's impact even if you dont believe in the existance of God and Satan, because in the movie, they are very real, and very convincingly portrayed.Linda Blair was pretty damn brave at her age for taking the role as Reagan. Unfortunately, this movie did for her what Clockwork Orange Did for Malcom McDowell. Rather than being lauded for her part in one of the greatest horror films ever made, she became the bearer of it's stigma, actually having her carreer suffer for her convincing performance.If you wish to make your life filled with paranoid delusions and a fear of the dark and being alone, I recmmoned watching The Exorcist, The Ring, and possibly House On Haunted Hill (okay, crappy movie, but had some good scares) alone in the dark at night. try taking a leak at 2 in the morning with the subliminal face of the devil creeping into your thoughts.All in all, the film was well produced for the early 70s, the acting was well done, the special effects were great, and the attention to what constitues "horror" was impeccable. While it is blatant at times, it is never particularly gory. Anything that could be construed as "inappropriate" was the Devil talking through a child, so it wasnt inappropriate, it was plot.To date, the only horror film that affected me nearly as deeply as the Exorcist was The Ring. If you like horror and have not seen this classic, you are sorely cheating yourself.</fullReview>

This film is good, well acted, the script is excellent, the special effects are amazing, it is entertaining and brilliantly made in every aspect. It is thrilling and exiting.First of all this is not an average Horror movie. The Exorcist is not about a killer who goes somewhere and kills someone or about a boogey man or something. It is about a girl being posessed by the demon and how the girls mother is trying to deal with it. You won´t exactly be scared but imagine yourself that you were in that mother shoes. I mean would you be uncomfortable with the fact that you daughter is up in her bedroom tied to the bed screaming and swearing and while she´s untied masturbates with a cross.This film is also dealing with death, religion and people lives. This is not a film that you should be watching at party´s it is a film that you should think about and take notice its not supposed to be taking as a flick that you hide back of your sofa scared to death. Although if you think this film is really scary that is of course a different case.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most over-rated films of all time. This movie is not scary in the least and yet somehow it is one of the most recognizable "scary" movies. I don't understand why. Maybe if you are a sheltered Christian - then, I assume, this is scary stuff. I've just never found the devil to be scary. If anything, the classic, literary, and biblical character of Lucifer has always had a romanticism in its appeal.This film's scare factor is a complete puzzle to me. A devil-possessed young girl spewing profanities and projectile vomit is simply comical. Some of Linda Blair's lines in this film are downright silly.The only notable element of this film was the special effects. Make-up effects artist Dick Smith is a revolutionary in his field and this film is a showcase of his craftsmanship. The movie broke new ground only with Smith's contribution. This film should only be watched as a testiment to some of Dick Smith's work...or if you just want to see an underage girl masturbate with a crucifix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>****1/2 out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You cannot call yourself a true horror advocate until you have treated your eyes to a viewing of the Exorcist. Forget the terrible sequels and the unending stream of knock-offs this is the mother of all horror films, not only because of its mass effectiveness, but because it is one of the few horror films that could make good use out of religious content. The story starts out in Iraq on an archaeological dig site where an elderly priest finds an ancient artefact of some sort, we never really find out what it is but there is no question that it injects fear into the veins of its finder. Now we travel back to America where our film is divided into two parts. One is about a priest who is plagued with guilt over the death of his mother. The second is about an actress and her twelve year old daughter who becomes sick. The little girl is believed to have come with a mental disorder but all the doctors tests reveal that there is nothing wrong. We later find out that really the girl is possessed by a foul mouthed demon who spews forth enough perversions to make even the strongest willed feminist go into shock (whether it is Satan himself or not is really up in the air), so her mother enlists in the help of two priests (one being that of the above mentioned) to perform an exorcism on the girl. This film has been pegged as being the scariest movie ever made. I will admit that this is just as much a classic now as it was when it first came out, but scary it is not, haunting yes, but scary no. In actuality this film needs not be scary, that is half the fun. Nothing jumps out of the dark and there is not creepy music blaring in the background, there is just a dark atmosphere that sucks you in and eats at the back of your head like a termite in a lumber yard. I think that the cold breathe that comes from the mouths of all who enter the girls room is more effective than the moving furniture and the projectile vomit, although that does add to the overall effect. The one problem I have with this film is that aside from the haunting nature and the great acting there is very little logic and understanding in the events that happen, little to nothing is explained and almost every scene seems like it has been cut short, some scenes even seem to be put in there for no reason. Other than that this is the horror film of all horror films that have been made in the past, present and furture and easily ranks itself as one of the best in my books any day. It is always nice to see a film done with style and originality in a genre that is usually known for its amateur filming and usually laughable acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can people say this movie is not scary? Not only does it have horror aspects, it is also deals with religion, a very scary topic on its own. The fact that this is all based on a true story makes it even more frightening. The idea that Satan can possess people is terrifying. There are so many scary things in this movie, the flashing white faces, the way Reagan looks at the end of the movie, and don't get me started on the creepy voices. It makes you think just how strong your religion is. I would give this movie 10/10, I'd give it a 2/10 but that's only because it gave me nightmares for weeks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright maybe I haven't but please, come on. This movie is NOT scary at all you pussies! I saw this in March 2001 on my own, in the living room at 11:30pm with a bottle of beer, expecting to be scared out of my wits. There I sat for the whole movie, waiting to be 'scared out of my wits'. It never came. In fact, when the movie ended I thought to myself "Is that it!?!" I couldn't believe how overrated and overhyped this is. In fact, I found it more funny than scary. In FACT, this out to be classed as a comedy, because I sure as heck laughed more times in this than I have in any other so called 'Horror' movies. I almost laughed as much as I did when I came to this page, seeing the countless comments saying "This movie scared me. It's terrifying! I can't sleep anymore! Help!!!" Gee guys, get a grip. Look at it as it is. It's not real. It's a movie. It's funny. It's not scary. All this bull about the "curse" of the Exorcist, i.e. the production problems they ran into is preposterous. Of course, they shot it and made it for over a year. During that time it's very possible someone is going to get sick, someone is going to fall down in the shower and someone is going to die of natural causes. That's NOT a curse morons!! Oh man, the bottom line is that The Exorcist is NOT as scary as people make out. The Exorcist is pretty darn COMICAL if you have a view on life as I do. Thanks kids.</fullReview>

No film will ever have that kind of terror and suspense, as well as excellent filmmaking and acting, all rolled into one film. Amazing thing was that I didn't get disturbed by it like I thought I would. However I wasn't born in 1973 when it first came out so I was already used to large visual effects movies. But it was still a good chiller none the less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have seen it in 73</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I wasn't even born back then so I had to rent it on video. Well, what do you say about the (arguably) most horrific movie EVER MADE. After seeing it I can say that it's definitely more disgusting than it is scary, containing some of the most disturbing images I have ever seen (and believe me, it's really really hard to show ME something that'll throw me off line!!!!!)I'm talking about the scene where the mother looks at the stairs and sees her demon-possessed daughter speeding(crawling) down them on her hands and feet. Or the one where she's "offering" herself to her mother, jumping up and down the bed. But apart from that the movie's merely disgusting(the barfing, masturbating). It is definitely one of the most influential horror movies ever made(now there's something new) ,has a good story(something most modern horror movies seriously lack!!!) and imagining I would watch it in a theater in 73 I'd probably be scared as hell. Even today, a couple of hours after watching it I can honestly say that some things will never be the same. It's probably the hype surrounding the movie that made it what it is today, but nontheless it's a movie every movie lover should see. Although, sadly it has been shamelessly copied in numerous movies, like "Stigmata", where Gabryel Byrne's character is a twin copy of Max von Sydow's father Merrin. But the question that really bugs me is what kind of parents would let their child have anything to do with this kind of movie. And I came to the conclusion that Linda Blair was probably an orphan. I mean she had to be, or she had some irresponsible parents. I can't imagine what an experience like that does to a kid. DAMN!!!! A movie that after almost 30 years still does the trick. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it's one of the most well made. The film is a highly effective drama, that doesn't try and go for the cheap thrills of most horror films. Instead, the film chooses a much nastier way to disturb, and does so better then almost any film ever made. It takes its time, letting sheer dread take over; until there is no escape. The Exorcist is not for all tastes, but those who think they can handle being taken into one of the darkest depths of film -- this is for you.</fullReview>

To anyone older than 30 it has lost little of its original power to shock and provoke.I don't buy the "you take from the exorcist what you bring to it" line, which sounds like 90s (or was is 80s) spin - the good guys win but at a high price and little girls are not to be trusted ;- 7/10 well worth watching in any time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD Commentary - don't bother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am commenting specifically about the new "Version you've never seen", which was rereleased in theatres recently and has come out on DVD with a Director's Audio Commentary. There is little else in the way of extras on the DVD. The Theatrical Trailers are just the new ones created for the re-release. The film was directed by William Friedkin, who did a masterful job making "The French Connection". For the commentary, he talks non-stop, but really says nothing at all about the making of the film, or the reaction to it's controversial subject matter. Instead, he talks the movie. In other words, he's like an annoying roommate who saw this really cool film and wants you to see it. But instead of letting you just watch it in silence, he tells you exactly what's going on in every scene, like you can't figure it out for yourself. For example, he goes on about how troubled Father Damien is about his dying Mother. Well, gosh, his character says out loud how he wishes he could have done more for his dying Mother. How about some insight into how some of the special effects were done? How did the actors cope with performing some of the scenes? Why did you originally cut the scenes from the original release? Go to the trivia section for this film and there are a few pages worth of interesting anecdotes, virtually none of which is mentioned by the director. Friedkin doesn't reveal really anything useful, except: - The scene where the detective and the mother have a 'cat and mouse' conversation is his favourite scene. - Father Damien is frequently shown rising from the ground (up a stairway, walking up a hill)As for the film itself, there are plenty of recommendations out there that establishes this film as one of the great scare flicks, up there with "Psycho". Unfortunately, the audience for scary movies is different now then it was in the 70's. The movie originally came out before the surge in the 80's of teener slasher movies ("Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc.), and really is for a more older sophisticated crowd. It isn't surprising to hear that younger audiences watching it these days may find it slow, boring, and perhaps even silly. One thing that escapes them is that this film, as opposed to most mindless horror flicks, is actually based on fact!Movie: 7 out of 10 DVD extras: 3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview> For sheer emotional and mental terror,"The Exorcist" stands alone as the single most frightening film ever made.Nearly 30 years after its premiere it still never fails to deliver.The screenplay and direction are one of the films major strengths,Friedkin knows how to build tension,he also knows how to develop realistic characters.The late, great playwright Jason Miller turns in the finest performance of the film (and of his career as an actor) as the doubting and troubled Father Karras. Miller shows us a very human and struggling priest,full of the desire to believe yet held back by his own inner demons. He was appropriately honored with an Oscar nod for this performance. Also strong is Max Von Sydow as the Un-nerving and Staunch Father Merrin,while Lee J. Cobb provides steadying support as Detective Kinderman. Without spoiling the plot and outcome,Von Sydow and Miller provide an intense climax to the film during the exorcisim scenes, each one performance intensely showing what they are willing to give to free Regan from the possession. Overall an incredible film that has not dated or aged with the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The powers of good and evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I was frightened when I first saw this movie, as a teenager. Not just during it either. I had never seen a horror movie that had stuck with me much at all after I had left the theater. I saw it twice more not much longer afterward. By the third time, I was laughing at some of the scenes.Nevertheless, I see "The Exorcist" as one of the all-time great horror flicks. A novel idea, filmed in modern America, based on a true story, if exaggerated. Max von Sydow was, of course, an excellent choice as initial exorcist Father Merrin. The gradual deterioration of Regan (Linda Blair) is dramatically effective. Jason Miller is superb as Father Karras. The special effects work because they are not, well, really special effects but part of the story. People seeing today's special effects used in intergalactic sci-fi battles or ridiculous sped up action as in "Charlie's Angels" tend to be drawn more away from the film than to it. Absurdity is accompanied by tiresome exaggeration and repetition and disorientation of the viewer, who aside from finding the action hard to follow, gets diverted from the plot. In "The Exorcist," however, Director William Friedkin made sure to use special effects to convey what William Peter Blatty, and presumably others, picture demonic possession to be like. Legions of warships are not blown up, a bed is raised. Superhuman strength is displayed, but within the confines of a single room Body features are made grotesque, but for good reason. The swearing etc. might be cheap in another context, but here it is not really obnoxious but powerful, intense, hateful--demonic. I do not think of this film as sensationalistic, as some do."The Exorcist" is highly evocative in its portrayal of demonic possession along with the immense power and tradition that the Catholic Church can summon to combat it. Indeed, the imagery of the Church presented is dignified, majestic. Historical background of demonic possessions and exorcism is in but is understated and subtly effective for that reason. This allows us to focus on the situation at hand rather than Devil stories. In sum, "The Exorcist" contains some of the most dynamic imagery of "good" and "evil" ever put on film. This is its most important legacy.</fullReview>

This film ranks one of the highest on my horror list. Linda Blair was excellent as the possessed Regan and they also did a wonderful job on making her look as if she were possessed. The makeup was great and she looked so scary you could barley explain it. If you are horror fan or have interest in scary movies, you should definetley watch The Exorcist.

This movie is not violent/gory either, it is simply filled with "disturbing images" as the MPAA puts it. This movie is not worth vomiting over as you may have read. I did read that it was extremely revolting and caused people to vomit in the theaters... this is probably why i was disappointed. BUT, still this movie was excellent. Excellent direction, excellent cinematography, extremely excellent acting, and extremely excellent and controversial (for its time) special effects. Add it up and you have a great, classic film! Linda Blair was excellent in acting the parts she actually acted in... The only thing this film was missing was the terror.RATING: *******///I give this movie a 7 out of 10.

I had no idea what I was letting myself in for, but I'm sure glad I did. The special FX were good (even by 1973's standards) - so good, I was nearly gagging - and it is very haunting; it'll stay in your mind for weeks, if not months, after.Linda Blair is great as the possessed Reagan (didn't she go nuts after making these movies??) and unsuprisingly, Ellen Burstyn also puts in a great performance.Now, with the re-release of 'The Exorcist', I can see an extra 11 minutes of one of the best horror movies ever created, and captured on film.</fullReview>

Insulted by my friend who said it was a complete waste of money, I thought exactly the opposite. I thought it was the scariest freakin movie I'd ever seen in my life. I know I'm not gonna sleep tonight and I hate myself for reminding myself about the film. As the movie developed I recalled certain scenes, but still wasn't prepared by the full impact of it. The infamous "Spiderwalk" scene almost left me running from the cinema screaming like a little girl. Even though it is a brilliant movie; great to see that style of horror is still aprecciated today - I still hated it. For the mark it left on my psyche, which is totally shredded by the way. I must admit the beggining was a bit long, but as an avid movie goer I kinda expected that from an old movie. The use of lighting and music was exceptional, the music tone being unexpected and sudden to freak the **** out of you, like the "Help Me" stomach scene. I hated that too. Anyway, I'm gonna try to go to bed now (unlikely) but before I do I recommend The Exorcist. If you have any shred of sanity afterwards I commend you. A fine example of cinema horror history.

		<fullReview>Well, come on, the scariest movie ever??!! Without a doubt one of the funniest!For all the effort he goes into with the initial creation of atmosphere, Friedkin then just seems to have decided to go for a pure, all-out in-your-face shock approach. Which may have been effective in 1973, but I'm afraid doesn't age too well. Audiences today are just too sophisticated (too blase, perhaps) to be shocked enough by flying pea soup, or 180 degree rotating heads, or ever more implausible makeup, to require post-traumatic counselling. That's why the sucessful modern horror movies (the original Blair Witch most notably) succeed, because they don't display the action in all its gore, but leave most of it to the imagination.Still, credit to Friedkin for a degree of wit. I don't know whether the Devil still has the best music, but he has the best lines in this film. I defy anyone not to giggle at "Your mother sucks..." or "Look what she's done, you ***ing daughter"! And I like the creaking sound effects when Regan does her head-turning act!The person I feel most sympathy for its probably the cop, a character Friedkin builds up but hardly does anything with. Imagine the paperwork it would take to explain all this!!Like I said, good fun, but on a scale of hype versus fulfilment it probably ranks alongside Phantom Menace.</fullReview>

This movie had a strong impact on me when I saw it many years ago, and I can still watch it with great reward today. The sad thing is that you realize how hard it would be to make a movie like this within the Hollywood system today, where the chills and thrills should be presented in full force from beginning to end, leaving no room for ambiguity and character development. Friedkins choice of a documentary approach to the material works brilliantly, and the deliberate pacing, the orchestration of the buildup to the horrific scenes, is masterful, as is the subtle use of music and sound effects. Something that should be studied by all serious moviemakers working today. It´s sad that Friedkin´s made a lot of unspectacular movies after this one, but I guess he has had a hard time working within a Hollywood system in which the standards of storytelling has gradually been lowered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Demonic possession is, for me, a lot of hooey. So why did I enjoy re-seeing this film so much?For one thing, the movie doesn't scrimp on showing the search to find a conventional explanation on why Regan is going from sweet to difficult to psychotic and beyond. In this it puts the viewer into the head of bewildered Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn), who like myself is irreligious. One might even say this dates the film, being that audiences don't have so much patience for lengthy revelation before the shock scenes.But more so, I like this film because of Jason Miller's Father Damien Karras, easily my favorite movie priest. He doubts, he is burdened with palatable guilt for the lonely death of his mother, he's reluctant to help Chris...but when it's just down to him against Old Scratch, he knows the right thing to do and does it. I am amused by the irony in the caution given to Karras by Fr. Merrin: "The Devil will mix lies with the truth to confuse us." So the Devil, it turns out, is a lot like a politician. Is this why he is showing up in Washington?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you give us some more blood, Mr. Friedkin?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just come from seeing the reissued version of William Friedkin's classic, "The Exorcist", and I have mixed emotions about this "new" version of such a well-made film.I was only three years old when this film was released, so I never got to see it on the big screen until much later in life when I caught it at a midnight movie festival around Halloween. The print we watched that time was scratchy and the soundtrack was in mono, but the audience was still mesmerized.Now in the year 2000, we have a re-edited version of the film, digitally remastered and in multi-layered stereo. The subtle differences in the print are interesting, but I'm afraid it doesn't suggest anything positive about how audiences have changed in the time that has passed between 1973 and today.The print looks great. The colors are vibrant and the soundtrack sounds very fresh and clear. However, after viewing some of the outtakes, it's easy to see why they didn't make it into the original cut of the film. One scene in particular, in which the demonically possessed Regan crab-walks backwards down a flight of stairs, comes off as laughably phony. Interestingly enough, Friedkin (or whoever spearheaded this project) has altered this footage somewhat, through the clumsy black magic of computer generated images, to where the nimble Regan freezes and lets out a strange scream, which is accompanied by a gout of blood spewing out of her mouth. Apparently, modern audiences would not find it sufficiently shocking just to see a little girl bent into an impossible position, they had to add some blood, too.This is just one of the things I found cheap about the new print. Where the original featured several nearly-subliminal flashes of Father Karras's demonically-possessed face, the new print uses this trick numerous times, to the point where the glimpsing of demons becomes almost comical (one shot features an apparition that appears on the stove as Chris walks through the kitchen...haw haw).One of the things that I find so haunting about "The Exorcist" is Freidkin's use of long silences to create an atmosphere of unease. Now that they have dumbed it down for today's audiences, ominous music has been added to indicate to the thinking-impaired that something is dreadfully wrong (duh).But the film's fundamental power to shock remains unchanged by these anomalies. The issues of science versus faith that are raised are still as powerful, but let's be realistic...no matter how much is written about the artistic pretenses of this movie, it remains a film intended to scare the audience through some of the most revolting and disturbing images they could conjure onto the screen, and in that the film will always be successful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scarryest Movie I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have been around 12 years old when I first saw this movie and I have seen it several times since then. I went to see the year 2000 re-release and the added scenes make it a much better movie, in my opinion. They should have never been edited out to begin with.The movie has aired on American television many times, but this is one movie that commercial television does not do any justice to. In order for theatrical movies to be shown on American commercial television, they edit out scenes. In my opinion, if a theatrical movie is going to be shown on television, it should be left in it's original theatrical version. Editing scenes from this (or any other) theatrical movie does it more damage than good. And this is one movie that does not need to be edited.Seeing this movie in it's full unedited version made it way more enjoyable. This was by far the best of the four movies in the series (I say "four" parts because I count "Reposesed" as one of the four parts).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the creepiest film ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Or one of the creepiest, anyway. What Jaws does for swimming at the beach and The Blair Witch Project does for camping in the woods, this movie does for, er, being a twelve year old girl and minding your own business. Actually, all stupid jokes aside, that is one of the things that sets this film apart from most other horror films. In most horror movies, it seems the threat is mostly avoidable. For example, Jaws: just stay the hell out of the water; BWP: TS for you if you can't follow a friggin' creek out of the woods; etc. But in Exorcist, the girl and her mother do nothing that we can see to incur the terror that comes to plague them and could have done nothing to prevent it. It just happened. Of course, one has to believe that this kind of thing can happen in reality for the film to have maximum impact (and there is, at least, a basis in reality). But, for my money, even if you believe demonic possession to be so much hokum, this film does a good job at being creepy anyway; it's just that well made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best scenes in this film are definitely the ones with Linda Blair while she is possessed. The rest of the film is fairly boring, due to bland characterisations and some pointless scenes. The possession scenes are truly horrifying, and match up well with today's standards. The head spinning scene is obviously a classic, but just remember that the rest of the film is just downright boring. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friedkin's redemption?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw the re-issue of 'The Exorcist' with about 12 minutes of new footage, a re-mixed sound track and a print cleaned up for today and it looks as fresh as the day it was released. It is by far the best horror film ever made and a thought provoking essay on the supernatural with religious overtones that paved the way for many of today's horror films. The new footage is a redemption for director William Friedkin. I don't understand why he didn't use this new footage originally in the 1973 version. Perhaps Friedkin thought it would be too literal in the point he was trying to make. My only criticism is the ending which WAS better in the original version but the other footage definitely belongs here and with its recent box office success I hope we can look forward to other older films being released in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Plot...Interesting Film! :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Fictional) Actress and single-mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), loves her daughter, Regan (Linda Blair), more than life itself. Yet mysteriously, young Regan becomes "sick". She's doing wild things that she's never done before and saying things that Chris could never imagine. What's the cause of this all? Captain Howdy, of course! Now, Chris and Regan's only hope is Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), the exorcist himself!I saw the re-release version (w/ the never-before scenes) in theaters (as well as on video). I remember my two friends being scared before watching and they were huddling together in the theater. I personally didn't find this movie scary at all even though the fact that being possessed by demons is possible. Yet I must say that I think this is by far, the freakiest movie I've ever seen in my life. Interesting too, because there was never a movie like this before! And of course, afterwards, other movies about possessed victims have followed (i.e. "Stigmata" starring Patricia Arquette as the helpless victim). Yet nothing could ever repeat the errie horror of "The Exorcist".As a matter of fact, there were some funny parts of this film! (he he!). When Linda Blair's character, Regan, is possessed, prepare for very funny cursing lines (especially when the two priests come to visit), but also rather painful parts (when she's attacking herself with a crucifix...lots and lots of blood - **ouch**).But anyways, this horror cult classic is one of the best movies I've ever seen! :) It's even great watching it on the silver screen w/ the re-release version! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who remembers "The Sting"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It failed to win Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Director, nor Best Supporting Actor and yet "The Exorcist" stands out as the pacesetter in intelligent horror filmmaking. Now, 27 years later, this crisp, stunning treasure is back as fresh as Linda Blair's naiveté. Under William Friedkin's direction, we witness the crescendo fright of human beings rendered powerless by the anti-Christ. But the screenplay of William Peter Blatty's work is also filled with ironic playfulness, such as the highly inquisitive detective (Lee J. Cobb) who wanders in the middle of the film with Columbo-like mannerisms or the self-assured doctor who proclaims exorcism as the panacea for all the wrong reasons or the comparison of Father Damien Karras' (Jason Miller) facial likeness to John Garfield and Sal Mineo. Graphic is a word this film etched into our minds from the visual shock of x-raying the brain to seeing the excessive terror of a little girl as she turns her head completely around or spews out green vile or talks with the husky vulgarity of Mercedes McCambridge. Then there is the brilliant scene of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) getting out of the taxi and facing the Georgetown house in the haunting evening shadows and streetlight or the unforgettable line of the Father Karras' mother figure acidly asking her guilt ridden son, 'dami, why you do this to me?' The acting is first-rate. Linda Blair makes the central figure,Regan, a believable damsel in distress and both Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller give excellent portrayals of tormented figures fighting an uphill battle of survival. "The Exorcist", unlike many other films about God, treats the Catholic religion under attack with both reverence and accuracy, as suggested by the many credits given to clergy at the end. This remastered return of a great film makes us ask how in the world it could have lost out to "The Sting" in 1973?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest horror film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never got a chance to see "The Exorcist" when it first came out in 1973. But how could I. I was only 2 years old when the film first hit theaters and broke box office records. The first time I saw this movie was on cable about 10 years after its release and I found it to be one of the most terrifying movies that I've ever seen. I have seen it more times on video and I even went out and bought a copy of the film. "The Exorcist" is one of my favorite movies of all time, and a couple of years ago I made a wish that someday the movie would get rereleased back in theaters so that I could go see it on the big screen. Well, my wish came true on September 22, 2000. This was the date that "The Exorcist" returned to theaters. However this time the movie is being called in the ads "The Version You've Never Seen". The new additions to this version of "The Exorcist" include 11 minutes of restored footage not seen in the original 1973 version, and new digitally restored sound and music. And the result, the movie is better than ever. "The Exorcist" is without a doubt the best horror movie ever made. This movie is so powerful that I still keep thinking about it. But what makes the movie so memorable now is the experience of seeing it on the big screen in a packed movie theater. Yes, the theater I saw it in was filled. "The Exorcist" will be adding several million dollars to its already $165 million gross and deservedly so. What is "The Exorcist" about? I'm sure everybody knows this question by now. It's about a movie actress who goes through an absolute nightmare when her 12-year-old daughter becomes possessed by the Devil, and two priests who attempt to drive the demon out of the poor girl. Since I'm sure everybody knows what happens during the course of this film, I won't say anymore. But I'll comment on the new additions to the film. I don't think the new footage hurts the film at all. The much talked about "spiderwalk" scene is especially creepy and to me was quite shocking. It reminded me of the first time I saw "The Exorcist" and all the shocks and scares it gave me upon seeing it with all of its disturbing images. The sound effects have been upped a notch, and it's very effective. Plus, the additional music gives the movie more tension. I very much welcome the new additions to "The Exorcist". As for everything else in the movie, it's perfect. The performances by Ellen Burstyn as the actress Chris MacNeil, Linda Blair as her possessed daughter Regan, Jason Miller as the troubled Father Karras, Max Von Sydow as Father Merrin (the exorcist), Kitty Winn as Chris' secretary Sharon, Lee J. Cobb as Lt. Kinderman, and Jack McGowran as Burke (the ill-fated director of Chris' movie) give brilliant, outstanding performances. I've rarely seen a horror film with so many good roles. This is thanks in part to William Friedkin's direction and William Peter Blatty's Oscar-winning screenplay (based on his novel). WHAT A JOB! All the technical aspects of the film are splendid. From the excellent cinematography to the fast-paced editing to the eerie music score to the scary sound effects to the freaky special effects, everything about this movie is great. "The Exorcist" is literally one scary ride of a motion picture that still has the power to frighten the hell out of us. A masterpiece of terror that's brilliantly told.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

I simply couldn't stand her. Although her motivation was surely driving her histrionics, she should have tried to go for a little more restraint. If I had been the Exorcist, I might have tried starting exorcising her instead of Linda Blair. With a little luck, I might have been able to exorcise her out of the movie. Incredibly bad acting.The rest of the movie is an amazing work of art, though. 10 stars to it, -1 for MacNeil, a solid 9 rating.</fullReview>

And this movie is so terrifying tense. The tension just doesn't let up. Every startling image it presents leaves a long lasting imprint in the mind. The direction and editing are so tight and carefully done. And the script and cinmeatography are just plain out terrific. Once this film gets going, there is just no letup.

Nevertheless, I consider this to be a quality film: The Iraq scenes reveal a great cinematographer, the characters are deeper than the usual horror flick and by 1973 standards it has good visual and sound effects. Just don't compare it with REALLY scary films. Maybe it's a psychological study, but definitely not a thriller.

		<shortDescription>A classic should not age with time... this one did.. .in a bad way, not like wine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all honesty, this movie probably deserves something lower than a generous 5 but I do not want to completely ridicule it and label it as a nonentity in my forthcoming polemic. After all, this movie must have been horrifying and excellent with its effects for its TIME... A true classic e.g. like The Shawshank Redemption ( albeit a non-horror movie) still maintains a place amongst the greats and is able to rival movies even in modern times. The Exorcist fails to do this. It is a spurious classic in the sense that people seem to appreciate it (only) in the context of its time but do not dare to compare it to modern horror movies because the very elements that it depends on can not possibly compete with contemporary rivals such as e.g. Korean film "A tale of two sisters".So why is this movie so bad?The movie is about a young girl who gets possessed by a demon. She starts throwing tantrums and uses vulgar language as a result of her takeover. Furthermore, her body is able to undergo contortions that should leave her for dead after the demon leaves her body - assuming the demon provided her with vitality to cope with the neck breaking contortions. Apart from breaching the laws of human anatomy which can be forgiven in these types of movies, the vulgar language fails to add to a genuine sense of horror. Sure, a little girl spouting obscene language is shocking but... BUT.... the movie fails to develop the girl's character and likability before her possession. In a twisted way, her foul language becomes somewhat amusing and laughable because A) we can hardly relate or care for her apart from pity her state and B) her putting on a silly grimace and vomiting green pea soup hardly qualifies as authentic horror. Sadly, this movie would have made a decent comedy.Having said this, some religious people may be horrified at the concept of demonic possession. I am a theist but I am not sure about the existence of demons and even if demons did exist, I doubt it would have changed my views about this movie. This movie attempts to "frighten" the audience with cheap shock thrills.The crucifix mas********* scene was uncalled for but it did develop a sickening atmosphere. I can only think of one scene that was scary in some respect. It was the scene where they flashed the pale face of a demon. However, even this momentary flash which is verging on subliminal priming fails to qualify as genuine horror because it plays on our visual (conscious) deficiency to process a quick image - the fear of the unknown. Perhaps, Scary movie's parody of The Exorcist has warped my perception of this movie but if you think about it logically, this movie is simply not scary - I said it folks. It is just a vulgar movie, riddled with obscene language and logic-defying contortions and green vomit... erghh... I only liked the priests who were called to perform the exorcism. I did not care for the daughter ONE BIT. She was dislikeable pre, current and post possession. If the daughter-mother relationship was developed properly and presented as heart warming and affectionate, the possession would have robbed the character and we would have cursed the demon and empathised with the family.If you still find this movie terrifying after having watched it and reading my argument, it means that you have been sheltered from great horror movies and/or just riding the hype bandwagon that has propelled this movie to undeserved acclaim. There is a reason why this movie is slipping down the charts because it is not that good. Use your intellect before trying to preserve the status of a "classic". This movie has become obsolete and fails to deliver genuine horror. Obscene language in my dictionary does not qualify as horror. Not in a single scene did I feel like "holy cow... what is going to happen? I don't want to look." Enough said. You can rate this review as terrible but I am glad that I am not delusional and impressionable by critics with faulty reasoning. On a good note, the girl-demon-spider-walk scene was fairly cool although, again, what was the point?Watch this movie for cultural purposes to learn and appreciate landmark cinema. A true classic should not lose value with time. Effect dependent movies that lack good characters usually fade from our memory in time. If only they had got the characters right... it would have saved them from this unfortunate verbal onslaught. This movie was conducive to this response. I am sorry fans. Haters gonna Hate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turn down lights. Turn up the sound and enjoy The Exorcist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mere sound of the most infamous film score in cinema history; sends dogs cowering back into their kennels, cats clambering up trees for dear life and children's hiding under their covers, fearing the worse. "I was always thought that film should be an emotional experience; it should make you laugh, cry or be scared. But it should also inspire and provoke you and make you reflect." And that's exactly what Williams Friedkin's The Exorcist does, it both scares the audience witless, but most importantly it posses the intelligence to provoke and ask questions. When we think about the battle between good and evil, we looked to heaven and hell, too the superhero comics, too the war field of opposing countries. What we cease to forget the most prevalent battled between good and evil, is the one we all have to deal with on daily bases. For the greatest battles occurs on a more personal plane, the struggle we all face as we must choose between what is right or wrong, or the struggle of one's decision to accept region or two turn their back on it. The Exorcist is a film that seeks to unravel the mystery around faith, and the chilling truth between what we deem to be evil. And it's the ability of The Exorcist in to delve such an honest and uncompromising subject that has been neglected by cinema for so long, in exchange for the big budget spectacles, rather than focusing on the more important, the human condition. That has meant over 40 years later, its messages and themes, are still as relevant and potent as they were in 1973. But most importantly, after all those years as effortlessly retained its ability to frighten, and should be no surprise that no matter if you watched The Exorcist when it first came out or 40 years later, it still takes you on a bone chilling journey into your deep darkest nightmares. And guess what! It's all based on a true story, 1949 in Silver Spring Maryland to be exact. William Friedkin's takes both William Peter Blatty's novel and screenplay and weaves frightening real life tale of a movie stars who fights to determine the reason behind her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) violent mood swings, retreating health, and rotating head. She seeks medical, physiological and finally spiritual help to determine whether it is a deep seeded mental and physiological issue or is she truly being inhabited by a malevolent entity. The cinematography in The Exorcist is probably the best in horror film history; the delicate balance between light and dark fashioned by Owen Roizmans complements the piece superbly, acting almost as the perfect metaphor between the delicate balance between good and evil. You just have to look at the scene that has rightly been used on every advertising campaign and poster for the film, the one where Father Merrin steps out of the taxi in a fog filled street, only partially lit by one solitary light, It was both artistically stunning yet goose bump inducing chilly. The inspiration of the composition came to Friedkin from the portrait Empire of Light by Rene Magritte, which I felt suited the film perfectly. Another aspect of the film I enjoyed the most, where ironically performances of the two actors void of any acting experience before hand. Linda Blair was practically forced to audition for the roll by her mother and Jason Miller who played Damien Karras, wasn't even a trained actor and was in fact a play write and was studying to a real life priest. But looking back I suppose it was the lack of experience that brought so much fresh energy and vigour to the roll, because they weren't so self-conscious and preoccupied with how they were acting and pleasing Friedkin, but instead focused on actually being present in the scene, feeling all the same emotions the characters would be feeling. "Over the years I have discovered that most people take out of The Exorcist what they bring in to it"So if you throw your entire being into the film and are willing to suspend your disbelief, then I guarantee The Exorcist will scare you in such away, that it will permanently leave a mark on your deepest subconscious, whilst shaking you to the very core of your being. So if you're ready, then I suggest you turn down lights. Turn up the sound and enjoy The Exorcist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Friedkin delivers a highly effective horror film that's still powerful after all this time. I just watched it for the first time in about ten years. While not as scary as it was the first time, I was able to appreciate the filmmaking behind it even more. Years of exorcism movies have followed and all borrow from this film. It's undoubtedly one of the most influential horror films of the last fifty years. Possibly second only to Night of the Living Dead. Regrettably, all of the imitators will dilute the original somewhat for a lot of viewers. Especially younger viewers.The cast is great. Several were nominated for Academy Awards. Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, and Lee J. Cobb are all solid. Max Von Sydow gives a distinguished and understated performance. Linda Blair, in her career-defining role, is excellent. Unfortunately, she is seldom given much credit these days. This is due to the fact that her voice was dubbed during the possessed sequences. I don't feel this is particularly fair since her performance outside of the possession scenes is quite good and during those scenes she is still acting, despite the later dubbing of her lines.Anyway, there's not much I can add that hasn't already been covered in great detail by other reviewers. It's a seminal horror film and I can't imagine anyone who is a fan of horror not seeing it. Taking it a step further, it's just a great film overall that I think transcends its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people complain that this movie's too slow but those are the kind of folks who only like 80-minute splatter films with characters so dumb and one-sided, you pray for the bad guy to kill them. This monster of a drama is both beautiful and bold. It has CHARACTERS and not simply LAMEBRAINS lined up for slaughter. It has class and purpose. It takes the audience into the darkest recesses of humankind and then brings them back through a message of hope and self-sacrifice. The movie is NOT anti-religion, it's anti-evil. Anyone who likes smart, clever, meaningful horror-drama should see this film at least twice. It is surprisingly touching and amazingly powerful.That said, the cast deserves a hand for their wonderful performances. Ellen Burstyn perfectly conveys the tension of a mother of the cusp of tragedy; Max von Sydow is hauntingly perfect as the story's ray of light; Jason Miller embodies the sadness of a defeated man; and Linda Blair is far above average even at her young age.Once again, see this movie. You won't forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1973 classic has Blair in her most famous role as a young girl displaying unusually violent behaviors that science cannot explain. Priest Miller (in his first film role), who is facing down his own demons following the death of his mother (Maliaros, her only film role and died before its release), is recruited by Regan's mother (Burstyn) to put the exorcism into affect. Max von Sydow plays the title role in a modestly subtle way, yet he masters it perfectly. Doesn't date a bite. Friedkin has mood and story revolve around the characters, their ideals and personal conflicts; a style Friedkin is best at, and there's no better place for it than in this film. Sudden cutaways from intense scenes are a bit annoying at times, but it ultimately works itself out. 2000 version restored the haunting spider-walk scene? ewwwww!***? (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The review I'm even too scared to write!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can not say anything about the initial impact of the film, as it is I was not around in 1973, but I can testify to the lasting effect this film has had. By the time I came around, the film had already been around a couple of decades, but each time it is introduced to a new generation it becomes brand new all over again. I remember that sinking feeling, deep down in my soul, when I realized what was going on in the film. I can never remember being that petrified by any other film before it, or since. I can watch that film today and still get that same feeling I got when I was seven-years-old. No one person can claim all the credit due to how creepy this film is. The voices, noises, and dialogue are a major part. Also, the completely terrifyingly realistic make-up and effects are possible more important. Yet I believe that the part that eats away at us year after year is the subject matter.We are all scared of what lurks in the dark, whether we admit it or not. What if that creature or being that we are so afraid of was to enter our bodies and steal our souls. It really is absolutely horrifying! The way that this film was made was just perfectly so. It created exactly the atmosphere necessary yo convey the story in all of it's entirety. I am giving myself the creeps just writing about it. Just thinking on it to write a review, little Linda Blair's face scratched and mutilated from the demon inside her, creeped out. Will I sleep with the light on tonight after writing this review? Of coarse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very apprehensive about watching this film after it had been labelled 'the scariest film of all time' but it was nowhere near as scary as I thought. It had a good story-line and some good actors, but I thought that the bit at the beginning with the desert? Why did they need that? I just thought it slowed the film down. Yes, Regan was creepy when she was possessed but if you ask me the blood looked really fake and it was obvious what was real and what wasn't. Having said that I know the film was made in the 70's and there wasn't as much effects as there are today but I still thought it had the desired effect. Overall I would say that The Exorcist is a very good film with some good actors and a good story-line. I would rate it 8/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone mature 13+. Sadly though, I wouldn't class it the scariest film of all time.</fullReview>

Tonight I watched it for the first time and really enjoyed it ! You will be truly surprised by this film because it is scary, yet captivating. I was constantly on the edge of my seat waiting with great anticipation to see what was gonna happen next. Linda Blair played her part very well. Turn out the lights, grab yourself some popcorn, lock the doors and be prepared to have the living Christ scared out of you !This film is by far one of the greatest horrors ever made ! 10/10 for sure !</fullReview>

I have watched approximately 2000 horror movies and this is by far the scariest.the lead actress (linda Blair) deserved an Oscar for her performance as she was so young at the time of the films release.

		<shortDescription>Well that was terrifying!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly this movie puts all the modern Horror movies to shame. This movie was so original (even though it was based of a novel) and in my opinion still the scariest movie of all time. With amazing writers, actors, director, and cinematography this showed people the potential horror movies have! Now a days the best people come up with is "SAW 5" or "Scream 4". Why do people insist on making shitty remakes when "Paranormal Activity" has shown people you can still make an original horror movie in modern times and have it be a big success. Now "Paranormal Activity" doesn't really stack up to the "The Exorcist" (1973) but still fits in the category of amazing horror movies. The key recipe I believe this movie figured out is to slowly disturb people. I mean at first Regan MacNeil simply wireds you out by pissing on the floor at a dinner party then saying some nasty things to the guests but before you know it shes crab walking backwards down the stairs, her head is spinning around 360, and I've soiled my pants! I guess It matters that I was 10 when I first saw this movie but even though I may not show it, it scares me just as much today as it did back then. For going up and beyond what the horror genre was thought to be I give "The Exorcist" a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is more than a mere horror film but a classic case of good against evil. The book is excellent and for once a director captures it on film perfectly. All the main parts are played with passion and realism. The story starts slowly with flashes of evil placed to unnerve and keep you on your toes. Then a sudden change in pace whacks you round the head and makes your head spin till the chilling finale. This lived with me for years from my first view at the age of 12. I plucked up the courage to watch it again in my early 30's and learned to appreciate it more. The film has benefited from recent revamps and Mark Kermode's documentary aids to the appreciation. Freidkin is my favourite director for this film alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is one thing consistently missing from reviews of this film, and that is of the performance by Jason Miller. I have watched this film probably more than thirty times, and, notwithstanding Mark Kermode's claims that it is simply the best film ever made (a claim I have difficulty refuting), even his accolades don't contain appropriate kudos to Mr Miller's acting. Don't get me wrong, Ellen Burstyn really should have won the Oscar for actress for this, she is mesmerising, and von sydow and all the supporting actors are amazing, but Miller's performance is a complete revelation, his character experiences the most dramatic emotional and spiritual arc, there is a moment during the exorcism in which he is looking at Regan and Merrin, it is one of the most believable moments of transition I think I have ever seen, his faith is being restored because he is witnessing the true exorcism of a true demon...........next time you watch this film, watch him, he really is amazing.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a not of fan of horror movies so this was not the easiest movie to watch.It was a very disturbing movie for its time and still is pretty disturbing now.I feel like it had to do a lot with the questions of god vs. evil and god vs. Satan and it completely opened the world eyes to what exorcism and if it is or isn't real.I think its one of the truly greatest horror films because it pushed the envelope of what is a horror movie. It is constantly tests your mind and tampers with your thoughts to try and make you see what they want you to see. It also brings about the question of whether there is a god or divine power out there and I find that very fascinating because I tend to question that all the time. The score at the end of the movie when the demon possesses the little girl and then the priest was intense and disturbing and showed a new side of horror never seen before.Overall, it was just a really disturbing and scary movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone once wrote that "The Exorcist" was an advertisement for the Roman Catholic Church, and I guess it is partly. I don't see anything necessarily wrong with that. Every story is an advertisement for one or another belief system. A man must stick to his guns and do what he believes is right, even against public opposition. ("High Noon," "The Fountainhead", and God knows how many others.) Or it's wrong to push ahead in the face of public opinion. ("Citizen Kane", etc.) Some belief systems are better than others but even the obviously malignant messages can be well framed. ("Triumph of the Will.") "The Exorcist," taken for what it is, is a well-constructed and thoroughly spooky film, better than the novel it was based on. Promoting Holy Mother Church may have been necessary in order to enlist the aid of the authorities in filming the story on the campus of Georgetown University. Some of the minor characters are played by real priests. William Friedkin, the director, tells us practically nothing of the back story in his least-informative audio commentary.It hardly seems worthwhile to describe in any detail the narrative itself. A normal young girl (Linda Blair) is possessed by some kind of demon and after many gruesome medical tests is turned over by her terrified mother (Ellen Burstyn) to two priests (Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow) to be exorcised. The clerics get the job done but it costs them their lives.The special effects were superb for their time. The performances are equally good, especially Lee J. Cobb as Lieutenant Kinderman, the cop who is investigating a death associated with the possession. He's been excellent before but never better than here, with his soothing, childlike, and perspicacious presence. Jason Miller is as taut as a 40-pound bow string. Even Linda Blair, who went on to do some awful trash, is thoroughly convincing.The director steps wrong once or twice, revealing a passion not for spiritual enlightenment but commercial success. Having a candle flame flare up and then blow out in a darkened room is a cheap shot but it works. So does a shot in which Jason Miller is hunched over tensely, a ringing phone explodes the silence, and he shouts "Huh?" and jerks upward. Bob Hope could have done that. But these minor intrusions, though they remind us that what we're watching is "just a movie," don't detract from the aplomb with which the rest of the film is handled.It really IS scary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not the scariest movie of all time - not even the scariest of 1973!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a library full of comments about The Exorcist down the years; the film itself gathered such notoriety in England that Channel Four, who had the television rights, decided not to screen it for several years.As to myself, I first saw it around 1980 or so in a re-issue, and have viewed it three or four times since, in an effort to understand what disturbed so many people. I can only think it is the religious angle of the story, that the Church seems to accept that Regan is indeed possessed by a demon from Hell, thereby giving the film some verisimilitude.The Exorcist is a well-made film, decently acted and directed, but time has not been kind to it. Unlike The Wicker Man or Don't Look Now, which were both released in the same year, the film simply never succeeds in really getting under your skin.During the first hour or so the story is generally presented along realistic lines, although it does seem to take a long time to get going and there are little moments of supernaturalism - the sounds in the loft, the Ouija board, etc.However once the demon is revealed the whole thing slides into self-parody. It's rather obvious that Linda Blair is overdubbed with entirely different dialogue during the "profanity" exchanges. Blair is very convincing for the most part, giving a performance that type-cast her in sub-basement horror films for years afterwards. Yet the presentation simply never convinces you - seeming to be just an excuse for some mechanical Hollywood effects, pea soup projectile vomiting (which actually looks extremely fake - like the goop they used to drop on people in TISWAS)and the bed is obviously being pulled up and down on wires, as is Regan in her levitation bit. DVD sharpness reveals this rather poor effect.However some of the film does work, Karras suddenly being confronted by his recently-deceased mother in Regan's place, is a spooky and unsettling moment, and Father Merrin's entrance to the McNeil home is justifiably famous, caught in silhouette against an unearthly light from Regan's window. If only the rest of the film had been as subtle.I have to say when judged against it's contemporaries, it simply isn't as good, is too slow and suffers from a rather undeveloped plot. The Omen maybe a cruder film but it is a much more effective one. The Exorcist is an important film historically, then, but not in terms of quality. Future generations may well wonder what all the fuss was about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a psychologist sees in a case of child abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are countless mothers who are similar to Chris -- who are on the verge of mental illness; luckily often there is a dad in the house to give the family some stability. In Regan's case there is no father; only empty wealth, which, unfortunately is no substitute. The result is that Regan lives in a kind of hell; slowly asphyxiating beneath the weight of her mother's madness. The Exorcist is a visualization of a psychotherapist's fantasy; it is the ultimate in real horror. This is the horror that children must endure in abusive houses -- not physical but psychological abuse; Regan is the victim of ironic, crushing psychological attempted murder in a posh townhouse.Father Karras is the psychologist who is called and sees the hopelessness of the situation -- the problem is not the child but the mother, and there is no way for him to get the child out of the abusive household. His fantasy is ultimately to give his own life so that the child can be set free; we see his fantasy become reality in the Exorcist.Only a few scenes are necessary to establish the dysfunction of the family. Not only does Regan's father, who is a continent away, not call his daughter on her birthday, the mother (Chris) makes a scene about it within earshot of Regan. The mother is in this scene abusing Regan; she is unloading her own frustration at her failed marriage and her helplessness with her own neuroses onto the child. The internal psychological life of a child in Regan's situation is hell; childhood situations like those we see in the Exorcist are the source of most evil in the world.The father could not be farther away from the family, both physically and emotionally. Do we even hear his name? We never hear him speak, and we don't hear anything from him. As a psychologist, Father Karras asks whether Chris has contacted Regan's father -- at a point in the story when Regan's situation is so severe that it is a surprise, and heartbreaking, when we discover that Chris has not done so. Chris doesn't want to contact the father because Regan is _Chris's_ child. Regan is Chris's psychological teddy bear; she is hers to squeeze too hard and punch in the face whenever she feels like doing so. Though Chris can't help herself because of her neuroses, Regan is Chris's victim in this sad story. Regan is Chris's captive ally in her fight against everything that terrifies her -- which in Chris's case is _everything_.Some more strong evidence for this interpretation is the scene when Father Karras discovers -- alone -- that Regan's behavior is a cry for help. This is often the case with a therapist in such situations. Chris doesn't see the real little girl in Regan at all; she thinks she does but she cannot. But Karras is tipped off to the real Regan when he is led to the room where he sees the message 'help me'. And he is led to the room not by Chris but by Sharon. Chris is completely blind to the message; Sharon sees hints of it; Karras' genius is that he can see the little girl under the layers of abuse.Another touch that I found to be genius was how the ringing of the door and phone is extremely loud whenever Chris is around; that is what life is like when you live with people with neuroses. That is what life is like for them: everything that happens in life, even the smallest things, are perceived with terror and fear. People who suffer from these psychological disorders, like Chris, can't help themselves: they reach out to anything they can grasp and hold on for dear life, often squeezing so hard that they find rejection. The irony in Chris's case is that she is a successful actress, but she is still in need of support. Since everyone runs away from her madness -- including her husband -- she channels all her fear, anger and hatred into the only thing that won't run away: her defenseless child, Regan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"She says she's the Devil himself"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist The Version You've Never Seen is an awesome movie. The movie talks about how a little innocent girl named Regan (Linda Blair) get possessed by the Devil/Satan and all that is left to help her are two priest, Father Charass and Father Marrin. The movie is nothing if you are looking at it as just another horror flick. You have to have faith and believe in God and the Devil. Most people will say they believe in God but not the Devil... but how does that work? Where ever there is good there is evil to fight against the good. The Exorcist is based on a true story which a boy of 14 years old in 1949 was said to be possessed by Satan. William Peter Blatty, author of The Exorcist, book written in 1972, was there at the time of the 14 year old being possessed and this is what made him write his book The Exorcist in 1972, and to become a film in 1973. The Exorcist film is known to be the scariest movie of all time and i would have to agree on it. I have done studies on demonic possession and learning more about it. People say they don't believe that a demon or the Devil him self can take over humans... but why would there be and exorcism in the bible then. The demons believe in the power of possession in which the same way the Catholics believe in the power of exorcism will drive out the spirit inside the human. The Exorcist is my favourite movie and i give it a 10 out of 10. If u want a good scare watch this with the light out and see how u feel after. (people have gone insane over this movie and committed suicide after the movie came out in theatres because believe since its a true story that the devil was going to come to earth and take over mankind-true fact)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hokey, synthetic, horror film that never really disturbed or frightened me. Despite the sensational details of the film, it's laborious, and the characterizations and details in the first half of the film are not particularly necessary. The script seems truncated and leaves many things unexplained and Lee J. Cobb's detective serves no real purpose. For me, the most disturbing scenes were those involving the rigorous and invasive medical tests that the doctors put Regan through, and the film's single most impressive effect is the make up job on Max Von Sydow, a most convincing job of aging. Ellen Burstyn, a powerful performer, is effectively shrill and over the top, and Linda Blair's performance as Regan is a triumph of make up, dubbing and special effects. Unlike Hitchcock, Polanski or DePalma, Freidken takes his horror seriously; the film is heavy-going; humorless and shallow, and you don't feel for Regan or her mother, so the movie basically operates on the level of a carnival freak show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only truly scary film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not scare easily. In fact, I have seen everything from The Shining to The Ring to the Freddies, the Michaels the Jasons and The Texas Chainsaws to The Omen to The Saw films and back. I like horror films. Well, the Saw franchise notwithstanding. My point is, horror films do not get under my skin. Not in a bad way, anyhow. I should also note that I do not think of demonic possession as being within the realm of possibility. Moreover, having been born some years after The Exorcist came out, I am too young to be impressed by images and special effects that were considered especially explicit back in 1973. But for some reason, The Exorcist has me absolutely, permanently traumatized. It isn't scary to me in a fun, roller coaster ride way. It's scary in a shortness-of- breath, cold sweat, unremitting insomnia, shaking hands, nauseated way. As I understand it, when the film debuted it was so terrifying that members of its original audience were carted out of theaters on stretchers for having heart attacks and the like. It was banned in cities throughout the world so "Exorcist bus trips" were organized to take brave moviegoers into neighboring towns where it could be shown. I heard that Billy Graham even proclaimed the existence of an actual devil dwelling in the film's master print (or something like that). Okay. That's all understandable since the most terrifying film to reach audiences up until that time was probably Rosemary's Baby. And there is a big, big leap in the evolution of the horror film between Rosemary and the Exorcist. But today, audiences are much more desensitized. For instance, I went to see The Exorcist when it was re-released as "The Version You've Never Seen." Its audience was comprised mostly of people close to my age, born long after the hype surrounding this film faded into pop-culture obscurity. The audience cheered, laughed and applauded. No one had a heart attack or screamed or even broke for a cigarette break to relieve the scares. Some people even left at the end, complaining that it was no big deal, that they wished they hadn't wasted their money on some hokey, has-been of an old movie.Meanwhile, I am flinching at every little tap on the shoulder, seeing demonic activity in every shadow, and trying very desperately to erase from my memory the moments from this movie that disturbed me the most. And it wasn't the famous head spinning (admittedly, the head- spinning is kind of stupid) or projectile vomit that really bothered me. It was the subtler moments. Like the homeless "old alter boy" or the scene when doctors observe Regan moving around the examining room slowly, sort of hunched over, almost dancing. The clocks stopping and the fighting dogs. Noises in the attic. Defaced religious iconography. The cinematography in this film was very effective. There are a great deal of slow dolly shots, where viewers are led through the filmspace at an almost excruciatingly deliberate pace so as to invoke the dread of moving towards something horrible. It is so visually detailed that after I watch it, my most mundane surroundings (my living room, the city street I live on, subway platforms etc.) seem chock full of potential to terrorize. And the sound design was equally effective. I know the filmmakers used animal thrashings, pigs being led to slaughter and such, layering and distorting the sounds to pack the best punch. My hat is off to them. They certainly succeeded in creating a visceral experience that will probably be forever burned into whatever part of my brain makes me feel fear. I give this film ten out of ten stars, although I wouldn't say I like it. It deserves the highest rating because it elevates the genre of horror as well as the cinema altogether to some of their most extreme possibilities. For the genre, The Exorcist demonstrates that it doesn't have to be second rate. It doesn't have to be cheap looking. It doesn't necessitate B or niche actors. It can be a cinematic masterpiece and be a horror film all at once. For the cinema, it demonstrates how emotionally affecting the medium can be. To paraphrase the critic, Andrew Sarris, those who live the movies they see will have a great deal of difficulty with this one. Given what I know about this film combined with what I experienced during its most recent theatrical re-release, I suspect young audiences do not tend to "live their films" as much previous generations did. As far as I am concerned though, it isn't "the scariest movie ever made." It's the only scary movie every made.</fullReview>

Ranier, MD) puts Regan, an adolescent girl, Living with her mother in Georgetown in Washington, into a more and more difficult situation. She exhibits strange symptoms, including levitation and great strength. When all medical possibilities are exhausted, her mother is sent to a priest who is also a psychiatrist. He becomes convinced that Regan is possessed and he and a second priest experienced in exorcism try to drive the spirit from Regan before she dies.Very graphic for it's time. But it's the tale of the possession that shocked millions. The acting is great and the ending is a WOW!!!!

		<shortDescription>Stands the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few films, specially horror films, that have stood the test of time, being as frightening, groundbreaking and thought provoking as it was back in the day. Director William Friedkin relies on creating an unsettling sense of dread, that grows to the point of becoming suffocating, as the film progresses, and it's approach of a documentary film-making style adds to the film's authenticity and 'spookiness'. Still, it's not only about scaring the audience out of their wits, as it is just as great as a truly heartbreaking character driven drama, and it shows, thanks to William Peter Blatty's amazing screenplay, based on his own novel. As a matter of fact, I find the lead characters' struggle with their own inner demons much more effective than the infamous exorcism/possession sequences. Linda Blair, barely 14 years old when she made this, gives a jawdropping performance in the role of Regan MacNeil, the possessed pre-teen girl that would become an icon of the genre. It's a shame she didn't have a very succsseful career, because judging from this film alone, she could've really been a terrific actress. Ellen Burstyn is tremendous as the child's mother, and is probably the most interestnig character in the film along with Father Karras, exquisitely played by Jason Miller. We also have Ingmar Bergman's star Max von Sydow, who despite being the title character, has small screen time, but as always, gives a haunting, memorable performance. Overall, one of the genre's definite classics, that surely deserves it's praise. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE scariest of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've enjoyed reading all the comments, and most share my belief that start to finish, for overall quality, combination of storytelling, shock, horror and brilliance, The Exorcist trumps every other horror film. I do think it comes down to sensibility, and move goers today are so desensitized by Saw and Hostel that a more 'thoughtful' horror film like this gets tossed off as irrelevant. How can anyone watch the last half hour and not be at the very least creeped out by it all? That one close up shot of Regan's demonic face, it lasts about 2 seconds, still makes me avert my eyes from the screen. Hideous! Again, it's about being drawn into the story or just looking for a Freddy or Jason moment, but Im glad I'm the type to appreciate this for what it is--one of the best films every made, and the most fascinating to discuss, ponder over and find trivia about, even now.I saw the Version You've Never Seen in theaters, and cant say i like the new ending better... I don't think the demonic faces that pop up here and there do much either, its almost like its trying too hard... less is more, overall, I say .. but the fact that a 30 year old reissue did 40 million in box office says it all, doesn't it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adapted for the screen by William Peter Blatty from his bestselling book about a young girl possessed by a demon, and directed by William Friedkin, The Exorcist is perhaps one of the most infamous scary movies of all time. When first released in the 70s, the film caused hysteria with people fainting in the theatres and requiring medical attention (the makers were accused of manipulating the audience with subliminal imagery). In the 80s, it was caught up in the 'Video Nasty' phenomenon, and when submitted for classification, was refused a release.The late 90s saw the film released uncut on DVD, and several versions have since been released, including 'The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen'. which saw the movie given a digital makeover, and 11 minutes of footage (excised from the film's original release) reinstated.But is the film worthy of its reputation as 'the scariest film of all time'? Well, Friedkin's movie is, without a doubt, an intense viewing experience?but only in places. Linda Blair's portrayal of Regan, the girl who must undergo an exorcism after she shows all the signs of possession, is simply breathtaking and her scenes are truly amazing. Her disturbing transformation from sweet little girl to foul-mouthed, puke-spitting blasphemer is one of horror's defining moments and still has the power to shock.Dick Smith's wonderful make-up and Marcel Vercoutere's mechanical effects make Regan's possession seem only too real; they include the now-famous revolving head scene, the levitating body and, in 'The Version You've Never Seen', the amazingly creepy 'spiderwalk'.However, between these compelling 'shock' scenes, the film tends to drag and certain issues in the film are left unresolved. The prologue in Iraq, which adds very little to the story, lasts way too long. How or why Regan comes to be possessed, and exactly how this is connected to the opening moments, is vague at best. Scenes involving the desecration of a church, a silver necklace and a small clay statue require further explanation to be understood.The Exorcist is a film that any self-respecting horror fan should see. It is a classy production, with solid performances and lovely cinematography. The film's influence on horror cinema has ensured it has a well deserved place in movie history. Whether or not it deserves the all of the praise that has been heaped upon it is another matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only movie that has truly scared me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1973 when this terrifying shocker first came out, the reactions from movie audiences were all over the place. Some people came out of the movie nearly collapsing off of their feet; some people checked into therapy after seeing it; some people actually vomited in the theater; some people were so scared that they ran out of the theater and never came back. Whatever the reactions were, THE EXORCIST certainly has one of the most powerful reactions from any horror movie ever made. No one had any clue that director William Friedkin was out to make what is quite possibly the scariest film ever made of all time. After the first time you see this movie, even you will have trouble sleeping at night for at least a week.Linda Blair is terrific as the little girl who goes to hell and back, Regan; Max Von Sydow is terrific as Father Merrin; Jason Miller plays Father Karras to a tee; and Ellen Burstyn is perfect as Regan's mother. All of these actors convey such depth and emotion, and Blair truly is terrifying when she becomes the demon and speaks in the demon's voice. It...is...shocking.The story centers around a little girl named Regan, one of the nicest girls on the planet. She loves horses, plays games and jokes with her mother, and seems like the most down to earth kid. Little does she know of the terror that truly awaits her as the movie progresses. We know that Chris is an actress and quite a reputable one at that. As the movie goes on, Regan is getting a check up at the doctor's office when a most terrifying face is seen for a split second as she stares at the ceiling, and then suddenly she is quietly taken over by the demon. If you pause the movie right when the face comes up, you will get shivers down your spine. Just the way it looks at you and is smiling and the eyes, everything is just VERY scary. You won't notice it at first, but later Regan's behavior begins to change, especially after her outburst in the doctor's office. But it doesn't end there.As soon as Regan gets home, all the bad stuff begins to start unravelling one by one. One event that occurs where you know things are going terribly wrong is when Chris walks into the room and finds the windows all open with the chill in the air and Regan not under covers but facing down on her bed. The fact that you can see breath is chilling, but just knowing Regan is going to wreak havoc is absolutely terrifying. There are a two moments in the movie where "demon" Regan's head spins, but the first time you see it is dreadfully unsettling. According to Wes Craven, at that moment some lady got up from her seat, was screaming Spanish and ran out of the theater. The fact that director William Friedkin has no inhibitions about what he was going to show made the movie more powerful, minute by minute. Father Merrin has been made aware of the nature of Regan's "demonic" behavior by Father Karras, so they ultimately decide to perform an exorcism, and that scene between Regan, Merrin, and Karras has to be one of the most classic scenes in any horror movie. Every time you hear the demon voice, see Regan in demon form, or see the bed shake or vomit spit, you jump back from your seat. It's a movie that's all about reaching deep down into the "chill" factor of your soul.Despite the sheer terror and frightening scenes depicted in this movie, there is no real gore and no real sex in the movie, despite the scene involving Regan and the crucifix. The film is actually stronger without any of those elements, it's an ultimately terrifying experience. The actors; the suspense; the demon effects and makeup; the storyline. Every element in this film works better than any other horror movie made in history.THE EXORCIST is at least one of the most horrifying experiences you'll ever witness in your life. Heralded as a classic by both critics and fans alike, this movie will stay in your mind for a long time. This is the most realistic and most documentary-like film about the portrayal of demonic possession. William Friedkin, you may have been genius, but this movie is pure madness...reach into the scare factor of your soul and watch THE EXORCIST...but never, I repeat, never watch it alone...and in the dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever made. Landmark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, "The Exorcist" revisited as of 10/16/09, and what a great return. This was, of course, the re released version of the film, probably because finding decent prints of the original version is harder to locate. This was everything you could hope for from an audience that was mostly twenty to thirty-somethings. All the scares were there, the infamous "spider-walk" got jumps, followed by applause and nervous laughs of relief after the fade to black. Every time this film is viewed on the big screen, it is immediate to the mind what a well crafted and acted story we have here. The scene where Chris talks with Reagan at bedtime is excellent and very real. The conversation Chris has with the detective is grueling as she realizes the true cause of Burke's death. The exorcism and demonic attacks sequences are still a marvelous display of pacing and effects. I love this film for its incredible impact and interesting story. The acting is superb, the special effects brilliant, and the sound Oscar worthy(which it won). Ellen Burstyn is one of the finest actresses of our time. Linda Blair is excellent as the possessed little girl. Jason Miller is heart wrenching as the troubled priest. The directing of this film shows how realistic and paced a good horror film is. The are some fantastic sound moments in the film . . . The eerie dissolves of the music from one scene to the next. The sounds in the girls bedroom as the room shakes(Speckles of plaster hitting the floor can be heard.) The tribal sounding music mixed with plucked violins as the mother drives home. This film attracted audiences in all demographics and changed horror to pre-Exorcist horror films to post Exorcist horror films. Chris MacNeil's walk through Georgetown with Tubular Bells in the atmosphere is one of numerous brilliant touches added into the film and has been recreated in numerous films since. It is still a fantastic film today and must have been mind boggling in 1973.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror film beyond it's time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely a classic and will probably go down as one of the best horror films ever made for the big screen! There is nothing out there that even compares to the quality of this film. What better film to test your faith and beliefs...it will certainly move you in ways you have never thought possible. It is THE perfect horror film. After watching the Exorcist for the first time (10 years old), I had nightmares for months! I actually thought that demons and the devil existed and can enter your body at any time...boy was I frightened to death. Even 'till this day, I still get shivers up my spine when I watch this film...it still makes my hair stand on end. What made this movie so great, was how real it actually felt while watching it...it felt as if it was happening right before my very own eyes. It was so believable that it actually created a lot of fear. And that's what makes a great horror film. FEAR!I highly recommend this film if you want to be scared out of your mind. Please be advised that this movie is not made for the weak stomach, unless you really like PEA SOUP! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Drama Full Of Horror And Beauty!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!Time has not treated this cinematic masterpiece very well. No element in this 31-year-old movie has lost its quality since its original release? what has changed is the cynicism and respect of the modern audiences. Today, this movie is parodied, ridiculed, laughed at, and misunderstood by an audience that was promised the ?greatest horror movie ever made' and instead got a slow-paced movie about a grieving mother fighting against a malady slowly killing her daughter. It's amazing what over-hype can do to a movie's reputation and how it can influence the expectations of the viewers! As it is, it makes complete sense to me why many compare The Exorcist to The Ring, or why they even hold this more recent movie in higher regard: it's a movie that made its reputation as a scary movie on its own, not thanks to 30 years worth of hype; people went to see this movie at the theatres without expectations besides hoping to be entertained, and they came out with feeling rewarded with an unexpected experience. That's fair.I first watched The Exorcist around 3 years ago: like everyone else nowadays, I watched it expecting an earth-shattering experience in horror. I was sorely disappointed when instead I saw a careful character study. I didn't hate it, but I did feel cheated. A while ago I bought the DVD, and I've seen it around three times again since then. I can now say, without a shadow of a doubt, this is one of the finest dramas I've ever seen! When you put aside the demonic possession plotline, what remains is a fascinating story about a frustrated mother who doesn't know what to do against a mysterious malady that's destroying her innocent daughter, but can only watch, helpless, as the malady becomes worst and worst? any parent with a leukaemic child can understand what Chris McNeil is going through with her daughter's condition. And this is what makes this movie stand above the average horror movie? the human interest: take away all the supernatural nonsense and what you've got is a very realistic portrayal of a mother fighting a disease that could very well be cancer or leukaemia; the demonic possession is just a clever metaphor. As a matter of fact, if you want to watch The Exorcist without the supernatural, just watch Lorenzo's Oil - with Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte - it's just the same movie, but more reality-grounded. And this is how The Exorcist should be seen nowadays? not as a ?horror' movie that stopped scaring people around 20 years ago when filmmakers got bold enough to put all the gore they wanted on screen, and the audiences became so numb to gore and violence, that The Exorcist lost its horrifying effect. No, The Exorcist today must be seen as a delicate character study of a mother who, out of despair, will do anything to save her daughter. Because after all the fancy plots and subplots are done over and over again, and the ?original' ideas exhausted, what remains that hooks peoples' interest is the human part of the story: people should remember that; unfortunately, not enough do?Of course, The Exorcist can only achieve telling such a focused story with the help of a fantastic screenplay; many will say the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay was only a ?consolation' prize for losing everything else to The Sting? I disagree; if there was an Oscar that this movie deserved to win, it was for Adapted Screenplay. William Peter Blatty's success is in transforming an otherwise boring story - a mother trying to save her daughter - into an entertaining story by ?dressing it up' with the supernatural, but ever without losing the true focus of what the story is about: a mother and her daughter. As it is, The Exorcist is one of the best character-driven movies I've ever seen, everything that happens from the point Regan is possessed is conditioned by her mother's actions, no one is forced into doing something unnatural to their characterisation, instead Chris slowly grows from a passive mother who believes science can help her daughter - even if it means putting her through painful treatments - to considering the alluring possibility of blaming her daughter's behaviour on psychological problems - and wouldn't it make things so simple? - to having the doctors explaining her the fallacy of believing in psychology in a case like her daughter's; then to more painful treatments, and finally, out of desperation, the exorcism? is this an unusual choice? Being drama, it's not. Drama after all picks up reality and turns it more interesting, and what is exorcism in this case but alternative medicine in the real world, like acupuncture? And when do we resort to acupuncture in the real world? When science has failed us and we're on the brink of desperation and we jump into something that might offer a solution? in Chris' case, it's the exorcism. Now, one of my favourite aspects of the story is that even Father Karras doubts the exorcism and is willing to offer a psychological solution to Regan's problems. That's the sort of intelligent writing that's lacking in modern horror movies. A real person DOES NOT immediately jump to the conclusion that an exorcism is a viable solution, that's why it takes Father Karras a lot of time to decide to put Regan through the exorcism, until he's finally convinced. The screenplay is so tightly written, the exorcism doesn't start until we enter the third act of the movie, the denouement. It's a long wait, but understandable. In this aspect, The Exorcist reminds me very much of The Sixth Sense: Malcom also has a lot of doubts Cole can see ghosts, he chalks it up to mental issues, until slowly he's convinced of the real supernatural powers of the boy.And when the real exorcism - when Father Karras is united with Merrin, the original exorcist - starts, this movie becomes one of the finest Christian movies I've ever seen! I'm not a Christian, my beliefs are too wide for the Christian Church to accommodate, but it's received a lot of undeserved bad reputation, mostly through movies that always turn the Church into a secret, conspiring group of fanatics with creepy agendas? it's a cliché, to say the least. But The Exorcist defends the core values of this religion by having two priests giving their lives to save a child from a powerful evil whose goal is to `make us despair? to see ourselves as... animal and ugly? to make us reject the possibility that God could love us,' as Father Merrin puts it. But Karras' sacrifice in the end restores the possibility that there is an omniscient being in the Universe who loves us so much he puts people like Karras and Merrin on Earth to fight and die for us. It's no wonder, then, that the ending is reassuringly hopeful and full of beauty, for it shows us that Evil can be beaten, even if only at great costs. This is definitely a movie where the ?happy ending' doesn't ruin the mood but is the natural conclusion to such a story.Whether you call it a horror movie or one of the finest dramas ever made, the fact is The Exorcist remains as one of the best movies ever made in the history of cinema, for its uncompromising show of horror, fear, loss, pain, sacrifice, hope and beauty! This is what The Exorcist stands for in the end, and I give it a well-deserved 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliance in filmography...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read several user's comments and do not understand how you can compare 'The Ring' to 'The Exorcist'. Honestly, are you that shallow and unintelligent? The Exorcist simply is the best scary movie ever made. Editing, acting, special effects, etc. etc. Considering the movie was made 31 years ago even more illustrates this point. 'The Exorcist' simply puts all other horror flicks to disgracing shame. Okay...to all of the young people you do not have the patience to sit through anything besides extreme blood and gore...you are missing out on the best character development ever to be shown on film, ever! How can you say you laughed at this movie. Nothing about it is funny, not in 1973 and not today in 2004. That goes to show why stupid Hollywood flicks continue to gross more money than artful, intelligent movies. Look at the audience obviously.Linda Blair was 12 years old when she made this film, and it is the best performance given by a child actor/actress ever to be seen. And that is a shame really because child stars are a big business, but none that are in the movies today display the depth and maturity that Linda Blair did in this film. She was simply way ahead of her time, especially considering the disturbing film subject matter. I have watched this film at 6, 13, 15, 20, and 29 years of age. It still scares the hell out of me. This movie is not a joke. The subject is intense and still hotly debated. Masturbating with a crucifix, telling a priest to **** himself, hitting your mother and using "cunt" prolifically...all very very intense stuff.To all those who don't understand the reason for this films' greatness...You obviously are more suited for movies like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', and that is your problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie. I really did. For years I had heard that it was one of the scariest horror movies of all time, and horror fan that I am, I knew I had to see it. So last year I finally did. And let me tell you, it's a bad sign when you find your biggest reaction to a horror movie to be laughter.The first half of The Exorcist is loaded with long pointless scenes that don't serve to move along the plot or help to develop the characters in any way. The second half contains more of the same, punctuated with unintentionally funny scenes of Linda Blair acting "possessed". Basically the only thing I got out of The Exorcist was the realization that the whole concept of demonic possession is pretty goofy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring (a few spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its hard to accurately judge this movie, as it has become so engrained in our culture that even people who have never seen this movie know many of the key scenes (the pea-soup scene in particular).Time has changed an audience's tolerance of horror. When "The Exorcist" was originally made, movies were nowhere near as explicit in their violence as they have become. Unlike modern horror films, "The Exorcist" relies more heavily on psychological terror in its attempt to build tension.Even if its a little dated, its a stylish and intelligent movie. Its greatest drawback, however, is that it is incredibly, incredibly, unremittingly, unimaginably boring. Its a stifling movie which crawls along at a snail's pace, where everyone, with the exception of the cast, knows exactly what's going on.We are presented with a child with a mysterious illness, that no one can seem to figure out. Her mother takes her to doctor after doctor, trying to figure out what's wrong, meanwhile, everyone in the audience is screaming "SHE'S POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL." Ok, these days, the movie is an institution, and there was probably no one in the audience who didn't know that Linda Blair was possessed by the devil. Even when it came out, though, I'm guessing most people already knew that. I mean, its called "The Exorcist", it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that demonic possession is involved in some way.There is tension related to this movie, but its the wrong kind of tension. As you see this remarkably slow movie trudge inexorably onwards, as her mom tries to find out what's wrong with little Linda, you're on the edge of your seat, not anxious to see what happens next, but anxious to find out when everyone is going to realize that "SHE'S POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL." Granted, this wouldn't be on my top-ten list of possible ailments afflicting my child, but you'd think the writer could sacrifice a little bit of realism in favor of plot development.Then, once they finally figure it all out, the actual confrontation with the devil is one of the least satisfying things I've ever seen. Almost no explanation as to why this child, of all the people in the world, was chosen as a host for the devil. The confrontation wasn't exiting or particularly scary, its was mostly just gross and scary. By the end of the movie I had no particular empathy for any of the character, and found myself no caring one bit who lived or who died.A vastly over-rated movie.</fullReview>

Film deals with the possession of a young girl (Linda Blair) by the devil and the priest who is questioning his faith who must exorcise the demon. This cut of the film adds pointless scenes and adds some scare scenes early into the film destroying the build-up that made the original cut so terrifying. Still some of the scenes still hold there emotional power and the performances are exceptionally well done.

The films fatal flaw is an over-reliance on crude special effects which were unconvincing in 1973 and are positively ludicrous today.

		<shortDescription>Who cares about milestones in the history of horror? This is a damned good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the new version a week or two ago. To be honest, I had to look up later which bits were added for the (ahem) director's cut and which had been there all along; it seems to me that the additions have more or less no effect, apart from making the film longer - and since "The Exorcist" is such a strong, absorbing film, the longer the better.Whether it's THE classic horror movie - whether it's a horror movie at all - is something I couldn't care less about. It bears no resemblance to slasher flicks. I'm not even sure what about it (if anything) makes it frightening. I recall being the teensiest bit frightened when I saw it on video in the mid-afternoon many years ago; just recently, in the cinema, I was not frightened in the least. But who cares. "The Exorcist" succeeds as work of fiction, rather than a mere heartbeat stimulator, because of its humanity. The priests are all human. So much so that I felt positive affection for the Catholic Church, without ever being manipulated into so feeling - odd, but there you are. Regan is portrayed in the early scenes as a genuinely nice child, someone you instinctively warm towards, and so we continue to care about her however many unspeakable acts her possessed body may later perform. The point is this : the film cares about its characters - ALL its characters - and despite the grim goings-on, it isn't particularly cruel to them when it comes time to decide their fates.Satan, of course, is not a human character, but even he has been intelligently portrayed. Those who have read the depiction of satanic possession in C.S. Lewis's "Perelandra" will recognise this as the very same Prince of Darkness - not so much a being of infinite evil as one of infinite, childish spite. (Why does Satan bother to take control of human bodies? What's in it for him? "Spite" is really the only answer that makes sense, so spite it is.) The difference between "Perelandra" and "The Exorcist" (well, one of them) is that the latter doesn't console either the audience or its characters by repeating several dozen times in big bold underlined letters that there IS a loving god who is omnipotent and who will win out over Satan in the end, etc. But surely this is a strength.One tiny weakness is the fact that the actual exorcism - if you got your stopwatch out, I suspect you would be surprised how little of the film's time it takes up - isn't as interesting as everything leading up to it. How, exactly, can these two priests force a demon out of this child's body? Be honest now: what does all this splashing of holy water actually achieve? How can we see the first few minutes of the ritual as going anywhere when we are told that the last exorcism Father Merrin performed lasted over a month? The film seems to stall. And the sudden conclusion is - well, sudden. Still, it's not the cop-out it may appear to be at first. Indeed, it's rather subtle, in the way it neatly rounds off Father Karras's story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie that many consider one of the scariest movies ever made did nothing for me. I won't say it wasn't a good movie. But it left too many things unanswered. What is the with the statue that the old Priest finds at the beginning of the movie and later shows up in New York? How did it get there? Why was he so afraid of it? Why does the Devil choose Linda Blair's character to inhabit? Perhaps the book answers these questions. Perhaps the sequels answer them. I am referring to the limited release of the directors cut version of the movie. 11 minutes of extra footage. The movie "Poltergeist" scared me more than this movie. The movie "Rosemary's Baby" can be put into the same kind of scary as "The Exorcist" but I enjoyed "Rosemary's Baby" much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shock Film That Didn't Stand The Test of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge horror fan who was born some time after the era of classic releases, I have been systematically working my way down the classics over time. To my fresh eyes, some of them have aged very well: The Shining, Psycho, Alien, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre even, while others sadly haven't held up:The movie, as most probably know by now, is about a little girl who gets possessed by a demon (via playing with a Ouija Board of all things), her mother thinks it's mental illness, and then when it's pretty clear it's not they get in contact with an exorcist, along with a side story about a priest struggling with his faith in the wake of his mother's sickness and death but ending up agreeing to help with the exorcism in the end. Not a bad setup for a frightening movie rooted in religious imagery, however the issue here is how it's structured more like a drama film with some scary bits here and there rather than a full horror film.The movie is 2 hours long but could probably be cut down to 1 hour easily as it is padded with long stretches of nothing happening. One might argue this is to build atmosphere and suspense, and yeah if that is what it actually did then it would have been fine with the slow pace, the problem however is that it really fails to deliver on any sort of tension.What we get is everyday dialogue in the vein of a soap opera, interluded with shots of dark hallways, flickering lights, doctor visits and flash cuts of spooky faces. This is not good building of atmosphere, this is a director trying to convey horror but not actually knowing how to get under the skin of audiences psychologically by using old tired tropes that I can't imagine were all that fresh even if the 70's. There is also an attempt to show the little girl gradually going from innocent child to pawn of Satan, though due to poor editing and a oddly put story structure we don't get to actually know her much, and there is long stretches of side plot in between her scenes which ruins any sort of personal connection the audience might feel to her beyond "she is a innocent little girl"Which brings us to the other part of the movie: torture! Now movies like Saw and Texas Chainsaw Massacre are often labeled as meaningless torture due to their sadistic betrayals of human suffering, but at least there they have a purpose. It shows character and how they deal with being put through hell, it builds the universe, it gives an intensity to scenes as you feel the terror of the character being forced onto you in a powerful way. The Exorcist on the other hand falls more into the camp of Eli Roth's Hostel: torture for tortures sake.There is no reason to show everything that is being done to the little girl at the hand of the demon; everything from self mutilation, defiling a cross, assaulting her own mother and using language you would expect a internet troll to use to rile people up. It practically reeks of indulgence in shock imagery and trying to tick people off on the part of the director and writer, especially when considering how violently and inhumane they treated their actors, making Rob Zombie seem like a Nobel Peace Price winner in comparisonNow all of this, all of it could have been okay if the characters and deeper meanings of the film had been good enough, but... there really isn't much character to go around. Reagan is "the girl", her mother is "the screaming lady", the priest and exorcist are "the knights in shining armor" and the demon is "the dragon", and it all boils down to a Saturday cartoon good vs. evil all in all. Their motivation is that they are good, and demons are presumably evil, and therefor they have to get rid of the evil thing. The mentioned side plot of the priest who assists in the exorcism don't really add up to anything other than the demon using his feelings about his mother against him to try and weaken him, it's really no deeper than a wrestling villain trying to rile up his opponent all in all. The simple black and white dichotomy along with the constant swearing and attempts to shock rather than trying to make the audience think makes it all sorta come off as rather juvenileAnd that is the reason I feel this movie doesn't hold up: it just doesn't have a strong foundation to it. It's all style, iconography and shocking moments to tell your friends about and no heart, no soul, no humanity to ground it with. It uses it's human components as pawns in a game rather than characters to be knownAs a drama it doesn't hold up due to the flat characters, as a horror it is not scary, as an exploitation special effect fest it has too many boring parts in between the gore, and as a religious film it doesn't work due to how vulgar it is. All in all it is a confused movie that wants to do too many things at once and ends up doing very little at all. Not recommended unless you just want to know the historical context of the piece and study the special effect use at play</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's widely considered, the scariest movie ever made. It's not really up for debate either, much to my chagrin. I don't think it's as scary, as it is disturbing, and absolutely brilliant. By that, I mean, a film that puts the "fear" of God back into the viewers. What other film could do that? The Exorcist is a triumph of special effects. The demon, Pazuzu, looks just as good in 1973 as it does now. It's a mystery why such brilliant practical effects were replaced with CGI. This film also takes you on a psychological ordeal. The line is blurred between reality and fiction, between faith and science, between lies and truths. You'll keep wondering if it's all just some kind of disease Regan has.. well, until the exorcism begins.. then it's pretty obvious. I loved this movie. It's a testament to the power of the cinema, and what it can do for people, for better or worse. People ran out of the movie theaters when the film was released, possibly traumatized. For the era of Vietnam, that is really something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've often heard people tell me time and time again, this is either the scariest movie they've ever seen or not scary at all. Personally, I'm not scared by the movie, but only the fact of worrying/wondering if something like this could ever happen.The movie itself is so beautifully shot and such good performances, I wonder sometimes if it's even real. At times, some may cringe or want to turn their heads away. Some may even just stop watching altogether. This movie does that, but it's so rewarding of a film to watch all the way through.You find yourself really caring about the characters and hoping for them. Each of them are going through struggles within all on their own. It's the ultimate fight between good and evil, light and dark; and in my opinion, couldn't have been depicted on film any better than what Friedkin gave us. The colorful scenes, make-up, music, effects, etc. he brings to the screen are pure brilliance. I honestly can't think of one thing to complain about while watching this movie time after time.If someone gives you a bad review on this movie, I would disregard it because the movie is such a wonderful piece of art. I can never get tired of watching it because it isn't just some blood fest where stupid teenagers are slaughtered in a row. It has substance, foundation, a backbone and a point. I've run out of things to say. It's beautiful. Watch it if you haven't already. It's my favorite movie of all time. My grade: A++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen "the Director's Cut" today, actually after midnight in a huge salon together with about 20 people or so, rather alone than with too many.Interesting, I have tried to search some other hints as just horror and possession, but I didn't find any, so I'm writing my point of view now.I couldn't find anything speaking against a common case of hysteria playing the chief role in the behavior of Regan. There are too many signs left everywhere in the film that can justify this statement.First of all Regan is a 12 old girl: a very difficult age indeed. This is the age when a young girl replaces the love to her mother towards it to her father. We don't know anything about Regan's father, he has just left, and the mother is, of course, guilty of it. There is a scene when the Regan is in the bed with her mother, this is the last point she still (sexually) attracted by her mother. But the young lady has began to feel herself appealed by men: for example, the story about the man with the gray horse, she wants to ride with him. She is jealous to her mother's friend and wants to kill him, which also happens. It may still be just an imagination, but I'm think everything is in the brain of the girl, this was said, too.Everything happens in the bed of the girl, in the night: that should be her dreams. I can imagine a young sexually frustrated lady could have such nightmares. Yes, this is hysteria.The absence of the father and the need of them is depicted by the roles of both priests. It is conspicuous how oft the word "father" is used in the film.The younger lives and loves his mother, feels guilty about her death: a very common "oedipus complex". He is the man playing the prince in this modern saga about the sleeping beauty. He sees his mother in the girl and falls in love with her. He rescues her, "kissing" or swallow the evil, and the evil is the suppressed libido of both. After the act (their orgasm indeed) he falls down the stairs, not being a man any more for a while at least (Erich From: "A man is a man only when he has erection") and she is free from the demon, she is not girl any more but becomes a young woman.A wonderful modern fairy tale. I am really very impressed of the film.By the way Sigmund Freud said in his lectures about the psychoanalysis that probably many women are convicted in the middle ages to be witches or possessed by the evil just because they had a hysteria or similar symptoms led back to suppressed sexual wishes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some ignorant people are confused as to why the beginning of the film takes place in Iraq. I'll explain it to those few or many. The purpose of the locale is that it adds to the mythology of religion and how it has wrestled the notion of good and evil. We have the elderly priest who also happens to be an archaeologist. He happens to be an expert on exorcisms and has had experiences with the devil and dealing with possessions. When he discovers the ancient artifact of the evil head and confronts the mythological demonic statue "Pizzuzu", it foretells that he is going to have one last encounter with the Devil. Thus we see the dogs fighting as if "Pizzuzu" is casting a spell and creating chaos. This is a symbolic face-off between good and evil. The statue representing "evil" and the priest representing "good". It is a premonition for Father Marin and also a powerful opening for the horror that follows in the story.

		<shortDescription>ONE OF THE SCARIEST &amp; BEST HORROR FILMS OF ALL TIME</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE EXORCIST (1973) **** Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb, Kitty Winn. Director William Friedkin's masterpiece of terror encapsulating William Peter Blatty's bestselling blockbuster about a little girl possessed by Satan sent audiences into a dark, unsettling and very scary journey into fear, faith and the possibility of what is real and what isn't. Blair, in her (sadly) best and debut performance, as Regan, manages to actually act under the tremendous make-up job by maestro Dick Smith and gave new meaning to `pea soup' and evoke true spine-chills thanks to the electronically altered vocals by Merecedes MacCambridge's smoky tones as the outlet of hatred for Old Scratch. Disturbing and still stands as a spiritually powerful film that really gets under the skin with all its visceral splendor. Kudos to the outtakes including the `spider walk' of Regan down a flight of stairs. Creepy to the max underscored by the ethereally haunting `Tubular Bells'. Winner of two Oscars, Best Sound and Adapted Screenplay by Blatty (look quick for him during the first campus filming sequence conferring with the director, Burke Dennings). One of the most frightening movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, let's just be boring and say that The Exorcist is still f***ing chilling to the bone. Shots that William Friedkin designed from paintings (like the shot of Max von Sydow's Father coming to the house in silhouette and seeing the lone light beaming out from the bedroom window), and taking from some "based on a true story" stuff from writer William Peter Blatty that the director shoots like a documentary is what sells it for me, for us, for the world. It could be said, argued, that after years of parodies like in the 'Scary Movie' movies that the effect of seeing a little girl spewing green puke and rancid curses in the voice or 70 year old chain smoker Mercedes McCambridge isn't scary as it used to be.But the (surprising) fun of the Exorcist, and the dread, is that Friedkin doesn't back down from taking this seriously, and with an intensity that is unshakable. The acting is so naturalistic, yet still the actors giving screen performances (and it's people like Ellen Burstyn and von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb, you can't go wrong there), and there is a bit of mythology too ? in maybe the only slightly over-long sequence at the beginning where the older Father goes about old ruins in Iraq to find? spooky things? as they say, the devil's in the details. And this is still the film to beat when it comes to stories of demonic possession, by far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose the special effects were state-of-the-art at the time. Yay. Linda Blair's head spins around, the bed does the Mashed Potato, etc., etc., and it's all very lovely. Too bad it doesn't make up for a jumpy storyline which really doesn't flow well.The Iraq sequence is pretty to look at, I admit; but it is in no way relevant to the rest of the story. The only connection I found was the image of that fertility statue appearing in a particularly poor special effect. I guess we're supposed to draw the conclusion that the evil fertility god possessed Regan. That fifteen minutes wasted on Iraq could have been much better used to develop Regan's possession, perhaps making Captain Howdy more than a sideline?Overall, I was singularly unimpressed by this film. I realize that, in the early 70s, many things done/said by Regan were shocking . . . but nowadays, if I want to see someone masturbate with a crucifix, I'll watch a Madonna video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having looked over the other user comments, I see there are some definite patterns in how people react to this movie. Religious people think it is horrifying, agnostic people think it is creepy, and atheist people think it is hilarious. But I really can't figure out the people who say it's scary because of its "subtlety." How on earth is vomiting, head twisting, levitation, and masturbation subtle? This movie is intended to shock and offend, not scare. I mean, a "subtle" possession movie would have the demon murmuring in a low, unearthly voice, not shrieking like the Incredible Hulk. Everything is just too over-the-top.There are parts that are pretty sick and twisted, but nothing really scary. It didn't take me long to figure out that this is nothing but shock schlock. I didn't find it as funny as some people do (although the pea soup vomit was rather amusing), but I did find it disappointing, insulting, and irritating.4/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took my Little Brother to see this movie when it was re-released in the theatres. We were both hoping to see an intense, psychological horror film. Instead, what we saw was a dull, tediously cloying film. The only way in which this film works at all is if you know beforehand that Linda Blair is possessed by the devil, otherwise, apart from the overbearing menacing soundtrack, there is almost no suspense. There's next to no explanation as to why Blair is possessed, I had no feeling of warmth for any of the characters, and it feels like the director didn't either. Its an intensely ugly movie and I felt cheated by it.I suppose that since it was one of the first movie's of this kind, then theatre-goers at the time viewed it very differently, but it really doesn't stand the test of time, and these days it seems like just an attempt by Hollywood to cash in on the commercial success of "Rosemary's Baby."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film with tons of hype, as everyone of later generations, but before you start thinking this is just a biased view of over-expectations gone awry; I am talking mad, "scariest movie of all-time", "I couldn't watch during some scenes" type hype, and it wasn't just a couple of people, it was the entire internet and a pool of varied, different people in real life. Still, I just went into this apparently quintessential horror classic of classics, which I knew had deeply influenced pop-culture and the way people look at the horror film forever, with a fair man's mindset expecting at least something solid. What we get here is the most predictable story and development, with no discernible subtlety or particularity - just the most bland version you could POSSIBLY think up reading this review right now knowing however little you know this moment. The dullest, least dynamic, flat overdose of vivid and boring obviousness in all its early 70's splendor. This film was obviously a complete hoax. It just knew it had something big: a (for the time) graphic depiction of a possessed girl, the satanic/possession theme, with a film studio trick or two (the upside down stairs gallop, the twisting head.. today, just cheap), a mixture of gross and taboo made for shock value pestilence, glorified by the morbid fascination of the bored and willing masses. I swear the "the power of Christ compels you" scene is the longest; you might literally find yourself staring at your watch with the most jaded, defeated expression on your face. There is nothing remotely redeeming about it, no interesting development, morality, point of argument...nothing. You could basically watch a one-scene-parody of it, and that would really, actually do it justice. And that's a really, really, really bad perspective for a film, and I don't believe this is out of line at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this is the best horror movie ever made and it's almost a certainty that no other horror movie in the future will even come close. It's not that Linda Blair got nominated for Oscar for best actress in a supporting role in the age of 15, nor the terrifying (but at the same time a bit ridiculous) scene that she walks down stairs upside down or the head spinning scene, but the fact that director William Friedkin builds up tension agonizingly slowly. It's one of those good old movies that didn't hurry up revealing everything right from the start like modern movies do, trying to scare you with all possible impressive but cheap tricks. The exorcist is mainly a psychological horror film (the most successful modern film that comes to my mind in that department is "It Follows"). The slow but engaging progression of the possession, the step by step lose of faith by the priest and the emotional breakdown of the poor mother all are means to the end of engaging the spectator to the realm of the film. After that the final 5-10 minutes of the movie are just the shocking end that finishes the work. Like Rocky features the fight between the hero and Apollo Creed just in the final minutes of the movie, the exorcism itself actually lasts a few minutes and it's only a secondary part of the plot. All in all this one is a classic horror film that like "Night of the Living Dead" no one should have missed.Grade: A+</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong..the structure of the movie was very very good..I like the directors commentary about the use of stairs up and down to show heaven and hell pretty awesome...and I think if anyone noticed this without listening to the commentary they are telling porkie pies.

		<shortDescription>Scary, yes. But scariest?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I scare easily. Movies like Alien, Silence of the Lambs, Sleepy Hollow and, yes, even Mars Attacks, traumatised me for extended periods of time. The Exorcist was, despite its eerie foreboding name, not scary. A friend and I wanted to watch a good, classic, horror movie and settled on The Exorcist, as it reportedly fulfilled all our criteria ? in fact, I was a little reluctant at first, what with the honour of being "the scariest movie ever." IMDb has even granted the movie an almighty 8.0. While setting the scene, giving us a backstory, everything being all fine and happy in the beginning is great for a horror movie, this one started out a little too slow. We waited and waited, ready to cover our eyes and squeal in terrified delight, but nothing was happening. The blurb states that a mother hires two priests to help her possessed daughter, but the daughter doesn't show scary signs of possession until halfway through the film, the first priest visits her even later, and the famed second priest shows us his face for the last ten minutes, if even that. This movie is more accurately the story of a worried mother and a parallel story of a depressed priest-psychologist. Then at some point an exorcism takes place. No doubt the makeup on Linda Blair is great, but while the demon-girl's look has a lot of potential, she doesn't do anything scary. What is horrifying about puking pea soup? I can go check out the local nightlife and would surely witness comparable scenes. The levitation scene is also more "cool" and strange than scary. Okay, the demon can fly in her sleep, but she's not torturing anybody. When Regan spews profanity at her exorcist, my friend and I burst out laughing and had to rewind and listen to her line again. After the movie we even went back hoping to get another good laugh. (We did). The scariest part in this movie was Regan's second trip to the hospital, and the creepiest, most annoying villains were the stubborn doctors who would rather torture a little girl than let her see a psychologist. Rather than anti-religion (in fact, this movie seems to glorify faith more than anything since, after exhausting the rational medical options, only a priest is able to save the day), this movie is anti-psychology, branding mental illness as a horrible crime, and preventing one from seeking help for it. The method of storytelling with numerous short takes is also headache-inducing. Scenes are so short and bounce from one time, place and character to the next, that it's difficult to follow. Nobody wants to read a book. That is written. Like this. In very short takes. There's no time. To get into the mood. Or feel. For the. Characters. Isn't this. Super. Annoying?There are so many minor characters with their own stories and quirks that not only is it difficult to remember them all, but it begs the question of why are we shown this. I didn't even remember who Burke, the man Regan killed, was. What was the point of the drunken man at the party? Why was the detective's loneliness such an emphasised motif? Wouldn't the movie have been a nice concise package without the extra side sequences? Finally, screen writing is clearly lacking, since the movie ends with a accumulation of unanswered questions and discrepancies. Sure, fans have tried to fill in some of the gaps, and movies don't need to state everything point-blank, but when everything is speculation it gives the impression of an improvised, not-so-thought-out story. When, how and why Regan? If the demon wanted to just scare the populace, wouldn't he have picked a publicity figure or someone whose possession would become widely known and cause more controversy, maybe a famous priest? How about the pope? Why did the demon fear fake holy water? What happened to the demon in the end? (Can non-corporeal demons even die? Would he have passed onto another person?) Why was the demon so sex- crazed? What was the point of levitating and spider walking? Where did the crucifix come from (and why)? Who desecrated the statue? Was Regan possessed by the Devil, as she claimed? Yes, even I know from reading about the movie, that the demon was Pazuzu, but I shouldn't have to devour Wikipedia, read the book, or watch any bombed sequels to get all my questions answered. I'm judging this movie as a movie and not as the separated Siamese twin of the novel. As a standalone piece of film art, this is a poorly executed example. So all in all, with the combination of slow storytelling, short scenes that end when they'd just started, scarce action, a litter of names and stories that add no substance, unanswered questions, and some hilarious profanity, why is The Exorcist a good movie?</fullReview>

As I am sure everyone knows, the scene where the possessed spins her head and projectile vomits was a classical for years (and it was spoofed superbly in Scary Movie 2). I realize this was suppose to be a thriller, but I was laughed at most of the scenes. I nearly lost it when my best friend screamed like a girl during the vomit scene because when my sister whipped her head around her long hair hit him in the face. This movie is a great way to drift off into fantasy horror for a couple of hours. The pace is good and the characters well-defined.

		<fullReview>Some religions, including "Christianity" believes that the Devil(s) or the Satan(s) has much power enable them to possess and control other people bodies; this was enforced, probably, by the Idea of "Jesus" being crucified and tortured by some people. Different from Islamic religion, the powers of the Devil(s) are very limited, not exceeding showing signs of temptations to people, they do not have the power or ability to physically harm, possess or hurt. I, myself, as an atheist, watching and hearing some stories from here and there conclude that; what happens, in these "cases/stories/events" could be explained in either any one of these three possibilities: .................. 1) The "victim" or the "person being accused of being possessed" is a normal person who had some talents or shows some activities that were strange to those around "him/her". Influenced by the "Christians believes", those around "him/her" start to implement "exorcism rituals" which are actually some sort of "torturing"; such torturing may include: hitting, slapping, wounding, injuring, isolating, starving, imprisonment, chaining the victim to the bed, etc. eventually; the result is: the victim's character or behavior's "transforms" from a normal behavior into another style of behavior that may sometimes change "his/her" voice or character partially or completely. ................. 2) Those who perform the exorcism rituals are not religious; however, they "deceivingly" practice these rituals as form of "torture" to some victims whom are, sometimes, unaware of what is going on. Such form of torture is not only accepted by the society but also encouraged. ..................... 3) The victim sometimes believes that "he/she" is possessed based on the influence of the surroundings or based on "his/her" own personal believes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film ever made that will scare the devil out of you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing that The Exorcist is still by far the scariest horror film ever released--over 40 years after it's legendary shocking release. The timeless frightful aspects of the film will always stand up, probably because most people on our earth have a fear of the afterlife, the devil and his hell, the power of faith and it's questionable ability to help us in our time of need, and even life itself and what we cannot control in it. The film, as well as the book it is based on taps into every one of these fears quite meticulously, little by little, while developing it's characters fully so that we understand them, give a damn about them--even the deleted role of Lee J Cobb as Lt. Kinderman comes off as a fully developed character with only a few minutes of screen time--the mark of a brilliant writer (William Peter Blatty, who adapted his novel) and director (William Friedkin, his first film after his Oscar-winning work on The French Connection) working with a perfect cast (Ellen Burstyn as Chris McNeil was at her peak and Jason Miller as Father Karris never again demonstrated his power as an actor in film after this role. But it was newcomer Linda Blair as the possessed Regan that was a true "godsend"--like she said in her acceptance speech after winning a Golden Globe award for her amazing performance--"What can I say? The devil made me do it!") Most so-called "horror" films these days are amateurish--you will get more scares at Halloween by visiting your neighborhood spook house. But watching The Exorcist will scare the devil out of you, probably give you nightmares, and stick in your mind as the ultimate horror story for the rest of your life. Do you dare take this ride? You should--because this one will frighten you for sure but leave you with an ultimate appreciation for life and all it's scary parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was younger I always thought this was one of the scariest movies ever. I watched it again for a second time recently and I agree with other reviews. The story and characters really sell it all and the special effects are just unique from that time that CG just is not the same. Well I do not think the movie is scary and I laughed at a few parts now just because some parts are overly exaggerated. The only reason this is not terrifying is just knowing nothing like this has or will ever actually happen. The real story its based off of was nothing remotely like this nor was there ever any real exorcisms like this. I would be in the front row of church every single Sunday if this was actually true in all details. I think though it is one of the best horror movies ever made, but its slower then modern slasher movies. If your religious I think you will get more out of it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While totally I enjoy horror genre, somehow I managed to miss this one, never knew The Exorcist movie existed until lately when I got prank-ed by a mere flash game, called Scary Maze Game at http://scarymazeworld.com/ website, really impressive prank actually: in order to "win" the game, player must focus and concentrate hard to drive the object through the maze without touching the walls. In Level three, difficulty level rises and player focuses more, which is when it happens! Image of Linda Blair from The Exorcist movie pops up screaming, SO SCARY!!! Anyway, this is how I found out about the movie: people wrote in discussions where the image came from and I decided to watch it. While the movie is really old, as a true horror fan, I enjoyed it greatly and even recommended to my friends. Can't really call it "intense" but if you're watching it late night alone?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it ten years ago, but i was a kid back than, and frankly couldn't understand the movie it self, but now i see why this has remained for so many years as one of greatest horror movies ever made.1. Acting is really really great, you can't complain about acting, actors performance was astonishing.2. Story and script were beautifully made, the movie starts slow, developed slow, but in the end it didn't leave any questions unanswered. Also the characters were well developed, we got to know them before the whole thing started.3. Horror... i must say other "ghost" "demonic" movies of today's era can't compete with The Exorcist in the level of scariness, they are way to predictable which is not the case with The Exorcist. Ten years ago and even now it made jump a few times.There might come another horror that will come close to The Exorcist, but as things are going it's not going to be in a near future, so we should enjoy the classics we have from different era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist is one of those movies that truly leave you with the thought, what if this happens to me, or someone I love and care for. Okay so the effects may be outdated but it is the psychological aspects that one must focus on to better appreciate this gem of a movie.One scene in particular that left me will a chill down my spine, was the father karras dream sequence. The dream is loaded with symbolism, as are most dreams, but exorcist is also about prophesy. This dream sequence re-establishes this motif through the images of the demon and religious symbolism.Moving onto the main topic of this review.(well not really a review as such)The face of captain Howdy/Pazuzu. Many people actually complained that the scene in which we first glimpse the demon had subliminal imagery. For me I think this image was what truly scared me as a kid more than regan herself maybe this was used to instill fear at a deep unconscious level for me I believe the image is perhaps one of the most iconic in horror history.</fullReview>

I went it understanding some consider it to be the best horror movie ever and can see why people think that after watching it. Now it isn't a slasher or a gore-hound movie but it was a classical horror movie. It is very entertaining and the acting is great for a horror movie. If you are skeptical about watching this I would definitely recommend doing it. It was a great movie from beginning to end and I would definitely watch it again. I give "The Exorcist" a 9 out of 10.~Joe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist - The Best Hell on Earth You've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be no great coincidence that the scariest movie of all time was released in the 1970s, a decade notorious for cult killings, hallucinatory drugs, civil unrest, shocking imagery, and a public consciousness that was still very entrenched in the wrath of God versus the duplicity of the Devil. "The Exorcist", directed as a play of madness and hellfire by William Friedkin (and based on a book that was supposedly based on a "true story") is a great film that set the standard for horror?so high in fact, that it spawned a million sequels, imitators and montage techniques that we so easily take for granted in the CGI age. To see The Exorcist today is still a visceral delight, though it's unlikely viewing it will lead to any miscarriages or seizures, like it did during its debut, no doubt benefiting from a bit of group hysteria. It is a film that has aged slightly, but that still packs an emotional wallop, even with an entire generation of desensitized nihilists who grew up playing GTA. Horror and GoreThe Exorcist goes for scares over gore, though there are a few bloody murder scenes here and there. Friedkin rightly understood that the inexplicable and the surreal are truly the scariest parts of a nightmare, which is why he went all out to transform an innocuous little girl into an obscenity-spewing, spider-crawling demon filled with nothing but contempt for mankind. Friedkin's creative use of cheap visual effects is spectacular, and more effective than one hundred computer-animated corpses. Pazuzu is truly one of cinema's greatest villains, and perhaps because of the spirit's random, indiscriminate nature. No one was safe from an angry spirit, and the fact that Friedkin allowed it to possess a sad little child (surpassing Hitchcock's in-the-shower vulnerability) was truly the end of our fourth wall comfort zone. How to Watch ItThe subliminal messages in the film add to the creepiness factor. For the best results, watch it sober, in the dark, and watch it before all the millions of imitators. Don't be surprised if your honey demands you to put the DVD outside the house before returning to bed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The antiquity of this movie can only add to its brilliance and coronation as the scariest movie of all time. With that being said, The substantial amount of work put in by the director &amp; the crew to introduce such brief scenes of pure horror that would love you sleepless for nights to come can only leave you applauding while the credits are being shown.Reading the background of filming this movie, William Friedkin has taken extraordinary measures to ensure the desired effects are being executed on the screen as an artist perfecting his canvas. At that time, the early 70s, little or no technical backup surrounded a production of a movie unlike nowadays when efficient CGI effects can produce better results, back then they relied on makeup &amp; props to get the effect done.. knowing that, you can only admire the production.I was born early in the 80s, though I find this movie unprecedented in its being a masterpiece, probably the best possession movie I've ever seen. The devotion of the crew, the production of real-time reactions through scaring the actors, the absolute devotion of Mercedes McCambridge into producing the demon voice while regurgitating on food, being tied to a chair just to simulate a voice, the amazing performance of Linda Blair as Regan are all wrapped up in a dark and twisted masterpiece.The real boldness of this movie lies in the fact that it was released back in 1974 when obscenities were not freely allowed in movies, when religion was a bit more of a cornerstone of the society than nowadays.. displaying scenes of such content was guaranteed to produce turmoil in the audience base, it was expected that the movie would be banned on some scale, which actually happened.. yet, the director insisted on fulfilling his vision.Simply the best horror movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last week. I like this movie. The plot and sound in this movie are really amazing. Many horror movies always made their audience shocking because the sound effect or the ghost appears suddenly, but The Exorcist is very different. It didn't have any kinds of scene that can make any shock. This movie is really "horror movie" because many scenes showed how the demon possessed Regan's body make many peoples scared and he also killed two people. He also could make the young priest confused and he successfully influenced him because of his mother. The ending of this movie is unpredictable because I think father Merrin who can solve the problems but in fact isn't him. This movie in recommended if you want to watch horror movie without shocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Exorcist" is the scariest horror movie i ever seen. The storyline of the movie was also good. The special effects were good, example of that is, the scene where Regan comes down the stairs like a spider and her head could rotate 180 degrees. The film was very good constructed and formed for that time, it was a new type of genre in the film industry, the beginning of horror in the film history and still is one of the best horror films ever made. We get a good impression of how it happened and we can really find ourself in the movie. The film maker wanted the people to really think about the film and used good techniques for this. He gave the characters a lot of emotion and made the movie sad in some aspects, of course the main sad part is about Regan, but also father Karras is very sad because he lost his mother. This made the movie better and it helped to keep the watcher's attention throughout the film. Overall this film is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mum told me when she first saw this movie she spent the majority of the film hid behind a magazine. Intrigued, I felt compelled to see the movie that was deemed one of the "scariest films ever made". It lives up to its reputation, I guarantee it.And it isn't just the movie- it's the theme and vibe that surrounds it. For example, the iconic shot of the priest stood outside underneath the lamplight. This gives the impression that the Demon is anywhere, and it knows who you are. It might not bother you, but it knows who you are and could be anywhere.The film's fantastically performed, with golden performances from the entire cast. I think there are some genuinely terrifying moments in the film, especially in the latter half when the evil presence really takes control. The film is disturbing, and for the faint of heart a perhaps difficult film to watch (a certain scene with a crucifix and a needle come to mind).Overall, I'd say definitely see this film, although if you are easily frightened don't watch alone. After all, like I said in the second paragraph, you never know...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Journey Through the Psyche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find the Exorcist time and time again to be one of the most electrifying psychodramas ever. Being a Catholic surely contributed to having it frighten the wits out of me, however, I must note that I have met Atheists and Jews who were equally as freaked out.My Uncle, who has since passed, was a Jesuit priest in the D.C. area and knew the priests who worked on this. I can tell you that it is quite authentic and based on a true happening. Now I have never heard of any head spinning or anything of that sort. Just cursing, spitting, beds moving, Ouija boards, words being scratched on skin etc...I was lucky enough to have seen this with my priest/uncle who after-wards had to use the toilet and I asked if he would bless it and he quipped, "I don't know about that, but I can baptize it" LOLLAnyway so back to the movie. INTENSE DRAMA! NOT really a HORROR movie. Yes the effects have aged and look cheap in some parts, but the effect of the undercurrent is stunning! The story telling and acting alone makes this movie soar to the highest of realms. Absolute perfect pacing, though some people have remarked that the beginning is slow yet I find it as haunting as the rest- clocks stopping, rapid dogs fighting, a mysterious Jesuit medal found in an archaeological dig, then the statue of Pezuzu. The score mostly by Penderecki, while not meant to be scary, is unbelievably so. Just everything down to it's minutest detail is just perfect. Just one example is when Chris MacNeil is walking freely down the street to her home in Georgetown and passes some nuns with their robes billowing in the October breeze, which we now know is Halloween when tiny trick or treaters run past her. It is these subtle images that really bring this movie home. It isn't about being scared in the middle of the night or 3 a.m. it is the devil at all hours.Now Regan goes through all the shenanigans that "modern" science would put anyone through if they were acting this way even in the 21st Century where everyone with any hint of spiritual/emotional crisis is put on pills if they are deemed problematic. Of course this all fails and Chris with no alternative seeks a priest or "witch doctor" as she says with exhaustion. The cinematography is brilliant, for it captures something otherworldly, yet also close to home. I know that I feel at home watching this, yet I also feel the cold breath of the shadow that lives within us all.I love this movie and though aged it still delivers!</fullReview>

But now I have read the book, and I watched the movie again. And I have to say that the book is simply better. Maybe it's because, even though I saw the movie first, I kind of forgot how it looked and I imagined a few things different, based on the book. I imagined Chris to be younger, prettier and more desperate. I imagined Regan pretty much the same, only a bit less evil-looking, more like a zombie looking. Karras was really good and the scenes were also really well done. Only Chris' actress was a real disappointment for me. Otherwise I recommend the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so iconic and has permeated our society to such a degree that I was convinced I had already seen it though, after watching it this time, I realize I actually hadn't. While I did not find this movie frightening, I do understand how it would have been found to be by viewers at the time. Its use of relatively cutting edge special effects (the head turning) mixed with the "pea soup", make-up and voice over effects made little Regan appear quite the little demon. For me, though, it was the demon's explicit demands issued from Regan's previously innocent mouth that will be remembered.I was a bit confused as to why there was so much time spent showing Father Merrin in Iraq. Other than the scene with Father Merrin on the right of the screen facing the devil statue on the left of the screen (later repeated in pseudo flashback), I really didn't understand the significance.There were several interesting technical items in this movie. I especially like the scene when Father Damian Karras descended a spiral stair with the camera at the bottom looking up, tracking him circularly as he came down. There were also several dramatic uses of zoom in that added to the effect. The use of music was also memorable and added to the ambiance, especially (my favorite) "Tubular Bells".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horrifying Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up till now, I still rank The Exorcist as one of the most terrifying movies in cinematic history, even by today's standards. As the film blatantly implies, the movie is about an exorcist (two actually) and his heroic attempt in trying to save a girl under the influence of demonic possession.From the opening credits superimposed on a black background with a subtly chilling score, to the eerie opening sequence of an archaeological dig in the Middle East, the films lets you know you are in for a disturbing experience. The movie cuts to Washington, to the suburbia home Chris Macneil, an actress and a divorced(Big Surprise!) mother, where some disturbances begin to occur. Soon she will be forced to realize that her 12 year old daughter Regan, has been possessed by an ancient evil.She enlists the help of Father Karras, another disturbed soul who has his own demons to exorcise (figuratively this time) who in turn calls in famous exorcist Father Merrin, finely played by the legendary Max Von Sydow.All the major characters put in superb performances. We share the frustrated agonies of Chris Macneil (Ellen Burstyn) as she tries to move earth and then heaven to save her daughter, first seeking medical help and eventually, resorting to a God she does not believe in. The acting of Jason Miller and Sydow was restrained but mainly because of the taciturn characters they both played. But that does not in anyway reduce the impact of their performance. Without saying anything, you can see the fears on Karras' face as he doubts his ability to save the girl.But the true star in this movie was Linda Blair who played the possessed Regan. She played her character to the hilt. I do not believe there has been any other evil child character that has been portrayed more convincingly or more scarily.The only drawback I can see in this film is the detective character played by Lee J. Cobbs. His character did not really advance the plot and seemed to drag the film a bit. But I think the director wanted to stick the film as faithfully as possible to the book. And he did. Willian Friedkin did a masterful job and paid attention to some minor details of the book such as the fighting dogs and the desecration of the statue of the Virgin Mary. I still believe that the Exorcist is his best movie and it was a good thing that the studio hired the Exorcist author to write the screenplay or otherwise we would have likely had a hatchet job.37 years after this movie was made, it is still an entertaining chiller and epitomizes the eternal struggle (or if you must, the spiritual warfare) between good and evil.The movie's success spawned two lousy sequels that nearly destroyed the legendary status of the original movie. I cannot believe that the great Richard Burton and the iconic James Earl Jones agreed to appear in Exorcist 2. It was a really horrible movie.Much later, they tried to restore the franchise by making a prequel called The Exorcist: The Beginning. It was a valiant attempt but still does not hold a candle to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For everyone born after 1973 the experience of the movie's debut in theaters is something you cannot imagine. Nothing like it had ever been made before, or since. The essential element in this movie is it could happen to you. That stays in the back of your mind throughout the movie. A non-religious family, divorced parents, a newly single working mom, and a naive pre-teen daughter. The movie weaves a web in your mind. How could something like this happen? A innocent girl playing with a Ouija Board because she had nothing better to do, and her mother was hardly around due to her busy career. There is a disconnection in their relationship. Perhaps the divorce of her parents left her emotionally vulnerable... and Regan is a very vulnerable character. The characters are more connected than they know. There is an underlying plot that it was a trap for Father Merrin. How the possession began, the mother went to a priest for help, and he was an acquaintance of Father Merrin. Perhaps he knew it would come back into his life, and was waiting. Nothing is explained, but you can guess this demon and the priest have met before. What made it so amazing is they did not hold back. It's not the book version because that would be too outrageous even today. An NC-17 rating to say the least. When the movie ends there is still a black cloud over the family. She decides to move, but it seems they are running away. Who could stay in a house where so many unimaginable things occurred? This movie leaves a lasting impression in your mind.</fullReview>

Then, the audience can see the shot that they both stand in the opposite side with the weird of sound background(nondiegetic sound) that mixes with the sound of barking (offscreen sound). I think the director try to imply the audience that they both are going to encounter in some scene. In addition, the director uses "a lap dissolve" to connect between stories. Next, the plot of the movie follows with two story lines, and each story line meets each other in the middle of the movie. Moreover, the director uses the dream of the main actor to urge the expectation of the audience by connecting with the item(necklace) that was represented in the beginning of the movie. Finally, when the girl turn into evil, it looks very scary because the production designer did the good job for makeup. Plus, the director uses the special effect to show the supernatural things(shaking of the bed).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist is a film that has a number of great elements to it. The lighting in the film is excellent. I was really impressed with the films use of sounds. The use of diegetic sounds such as objects, to the piano playing, to Regan's creepy demon voice are impressive. I enjoy the non-digetic music as well. The film is full of scary noises and creepy strange music. Which I felt was fit the films content. Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) is a phenomenal actress. She plays the 12 year old girl who becomes possessed. She is extremely believable. If I didn't know it was a movie I would really think this little girl was possessed. The film overall was done well. I like how real it felt and what makes it real scary is that it makes you wonder if such things could happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist Is the best Movie in existence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist, a film by William Friedkin and the novel by William Peter Batty, Is a gruesome Horror/Thriller Film that makes those wannabe horrors like Wolf Creek and the Saw series look very very sick compared with The Exorcist. The Exorcist is based on a girl (Linda Blair) named Regan MacNeil who becomes possessed by a demon who says it's the Devil it self. This movie was literally the only horror in existence that scared me, It has so scary, but awesome moments that you'll just yell out what the hell! My favorite, which i won't say just comes out of the blue and freaks you out. This movie has great screenplay, great script, great acting and great special effects for a 1973 movie.You liked those newbie horror films *cough saw, wolf creek and hostel cough* then you'll LOVE this. Unless you have really bad taste. This movie is best watched in the dark at night or really early in the morning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Movie That Celebrates The Best In Humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many people I watched The Exorcist decades after it was made. Like many I grew up on the hype that it was the scariest horror movie ever made and found it tame and disappointing. Unlike most, however, I didn't let this affect my enjoyment of the movie. When I watched it a second time and judged solely as a movie and not the ultimate cinematic experience in horror, I discovered I was watching one of the best and most beautiful movies ever made.In an otherwise peaceful suburb, the young Regan becomes strange: first she starts talking with imaginary friends, then she becomes restless and violent. Her mother, Chris, takes her to the doctor but science can't explain her illness and strange phenomena surrounds daughter and mother: a nearby church is desecrated; the child starts talking in foreign languages, objects move without touch.There is never any doubt that this movie is about a demon that has possessed a child. But one of the distinguishing marks of this movie is the logical progression of the plot. There are several rational explanations for Megan's behavior that must be demolished before the exorcism becomes the only possible solution and salvation.We can say that the movie follows two different narratives for a while until they come together at the end: first Chris' struggle to find the cure for whatever is hurting her daughter. Seldom has a horror movie displayed such a loving and strong character as Chris McNeil, wonderfully played Ellen Burstyn. Her never-ending, tireless pursuit borders on obsession but also shows the love she has for Regan, the innocent victim.The second story concerns Father Damien Karras, a priest struggling with his faith. Jason Miller, an unknown actor, became one of my favorite actors after I saw his performance here. Beginning with his melancholy and tired face, Miller is the perfect actor to play Karras, a man who seems to carry the world's problems on his shoulders. He not only doubts his vocation and the existence of God, but he's tormented by the guilt of having abandoned his mother at an institution in which she killed herself and died alone. Furthermore, he's a rational, skeptical man. When Chris comes to him to ask for an exorcism, he mocks the idea considering the advances in psychology that has debunked all talk of demonic possession. But kind as he is, he nevertheless interviews Regan and slowly he becomes convinced that she is indeed possessed.Before these two stories begin, there is a prologue, a ten-minute sequence in Iraq, in which we're introduced to Father Merrin. This character is absent from most of the movie up until the moment of the exorcism, that some may think the prologue exists merely to introduce him. But the Iraq sequence pretty much explains the entire movie, not to mention it's one of the most beautiful sequences ever filmed.It starts with Merrin digging at archaeological site. He discovers a statue's head representing a demon. This leads him to think an old enemy has returned (we later learn Merrin once came across the demon in Megan). Cocophony abounds in the sound of blacksmiths hitting iron, the voices of the market and dog growls. Sound will later become very important in the movie. Small events lead Merrin to fear the worst, like a clock that suddenly stops, showing that the natural order has stopped too. He travels to outside the city, where two dogs are fighting each other. He climbs some ruins and stands before a demonic statue. Mortal and demon stare at each other; never has the battle of good versus evil been depicted in such clarity. Then the dog growls intensify as the sun turns red and the growls turn into the sound of airplane jets, in one of best transitions I've ever ever seen in cinema, and we arrive at Chris' house.The Exorcist, I said, is one of the best movies ever made. It has some of the best production values I've ever seen: the use of sound, for instance, is still unique. The cinematography is unforgettable too, capturing the world in shadows and dark tones. The actors are all good: Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Jason Miller, Linda Blair, and also Lee J. Cobb as a kind police detective investigating a murder connected to Regan.The intelligence of the script is also unique in the history of horror. There's never a false step, nothing that makes the viewer scratch his head in wonder or that requires suspension of mental faculties, like many horror movies today. The movie takes itself seriously and respects the viewer's ability to think for himself and make his own connections.Finally, The Exorcist is just a great story about human goodness. For a movie about the Devil, it's amazing how much decency, altruism and heroism there is in the movie, how little nihilism it contains. I've already talked about Chris, the tireless mother, but credit must also go to Fathers Merrin and Karras, two of the best heroes cinema ever produced, as they selflessly confront evil beyond comprehension with nothing but their faith and goodness. If you ever need to watch a movie to restore your faith in humanity, The Exorcist is the movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When approached with the opportunity to watch The Exorcist I'm like "Hell flippin yeah! pop that bad boy in!!!" It's a total roller coaster ride for me. I also know that i am not the only one that will fast forward through half of the beginning just to get to the good stuff. Any way you watch it by the time you get to the end you've already planned it in your head that your going to church the next morning to be blessed by priest which makes it even more fantastic! This is with out a doubt the scariest, sickest, most awesome movie ever made. I think the part that freaks me out the most is when Reagan does that spider walk thing down the stair....blagh!!! i get creeped out just by the thought of it!! I LOVE IT!!!! Now i grew up in a house where i could watch pretty much whatever i wanted, no joke my first memory of viewing any movie was when i was 4 and i watched "Day of the Dead" with my Dad. Seriously. But this movie i was forbidden to watch until i was 16. If your parents literally hide it from you you know it's good. This will forever be a classic, I don't care 500 years from now it will still be scaring the pants off of people as it should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were living in the 1930's, I'd make a movie glorifying gays and inter-gender relationships. That would solidify my movie as a "classic" for sure! Masturbating with a Crucifix and asking a priest to have sex with a 12 year old girl (among other disturbing events) also falls into the "instant classic" category. Exorcist gets a free pass to the "Classic" status this way.Did I like the movie, though. No. I'm from the year 2000. I wasn't impressed with their shock tactic. It was interesting, I guess, but not scary. It was hardly psychological. The "famous" musical score was only used twice, I believe. I wish they had used more ominous music for many more scenes. I was really hoping that watching the first 40 minutes of basically nothing would pay off. It didn't, daing it.I gave it a seven because I know in its day this film was a huge deal. Unlike my uncle Jimmy, though, non of us are living in the 70's anymore. This film doesn't hold up in the 2000's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist: Still Terrifying 35 Years Later!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very rarely will a good horror film not depend on excessive special effects, have flawless performances, and a story that will hit you hard. So many horror movies are scary and fun, but "The Exorcist" isn't fun. It's positively one of the most terrifying, disturbing, and upsetting horror movies of the modern era.Chris MacNeil is an actress. She lives in a very nice house in Washington with her adorable 12-year-old daughter Regan. All is well until Regan begins to display strange behavior. Soon, the behavior becomes creepy, and then it hits the point of being absolutely horrifying. Chris depends on faith and looks to Father Damien Karras for help. With the assistance of Father Merrin, the two come to a conclusion that the most demented force in the world is possessing Regan, and they must perform an exorcism in order to save her."The Exorcist" is scary because it goes where no movie viewer has gone before. Stuff happened in the film that audiences had never seen, filling their minds with shock and disturbance. This is the most violent depiction of possession you will ever lay eyes on.We feel sympathy for Chris, but our heart goes out most of all to Regan. This poor girl has done nothing wrong, and this demonic force inside her is putting her through Hell and back. And the way Regan's face changes is absolutely nerve-shattering. She displays so many obscene things that we begin to think that Regan no longer exists.The movie is filmed in a very realistic way, almost like an actual documentary of an exorcism. It is done with hardly any special effects, despite the iconic "vomit," "crucifix masturbation," and "head-turning" scene. Director William Friedkin depends on characters and imagination to scare you, and he achieves all goals required for the film.So much controversy revolves around "The Exorcist." Not only did it send religious people back to their church and cause many to try and sue Friedkin, but the movie, like "The Omen," has a so-called curse. Cast members Jack MacGowran and Lee J. Cobb died the year after the film, and reports of fire on the set shattered many. These are all just coincidences, and do not change anything about the film.The cast is absolutely perfect. The role of Chris is the role that Ellen Burstyn will be remembered most for, and Linda Blair deserves an Oscar for her disturbing portrayal of Regan. The exorcists are also great. Father Karras is played by Jason Miller with emotion. Karras is a priest who is losing his faith, and this exorcism challenges him extremely. And Max von Sydow is excellent as Father Merrin."The Exorcist" is based on a best-selling novel by William Peter Blatty. Sure, the book was scary, but it's much more terrifying when something is seen on screen. This film remains a truly disturbing and eerie classic that always shocks me each time I watch it. It's essential for any fan of the genre. If you're a horror fan and you still haven't seen "The Exorcist," shame on you! "What an excellent day for an exorcism!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scary, But Still Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist was one of those famous movies I had heard about all my life but never seen. A lot of people called it the definitive horror movie. Netflix claims, "If this horror classic doesn't terrify you, maybe you need a shrink." Maybe I do. I didn't find the movie particularly scary, though I know it gained its reputation almost immediately upon release. A video on YouTube even shows crowd reactions from the audiences of 1973. A theater usher goes so far as to describe how "as soon as they faint, I get out the smelling salts." Another theater patron proclaims she's "not going back in there." This huge rift in reaction can only be attributed to the desensitization of modern audiences. I actually saw Paranormal Activity the same day as The Exorcist and the former was easily the scarier of the two. Nonetheless, both films are miles ahead of the gory slasher flicks that masquerade as horror these days. I'm not criticizing The Exorcist. While it's true the horror aspects are somewhat tame by today's standards, the film still excels in a number of ways. Take for example the intriguing verbal sparring match between the demon and Karras. The priest interrogates the demon, trying to find if this is an actual possession or a simple case of mental illness. The demon states it is Satan himself, a claim designed to fool Karras into thinking the latter, as Satan doesn't possess humans. The demon also attempts to torment Karras by claiming his recently deceased mother is being sodomized in hell; he responds that if it's true, the demon should be able to produce his mother's maiden name. He cannot. The Exorcist boasts a memorable theme, characters that were well played and worthy of emotional investment, and a climax brimming with tension. It's not the scariest movie ever made as some might claim, but I won't fault the movie for that. Even without being scary it succeeds brilliantly. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Must See Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although The Exorcist was released in the 1970's, it is just as captivating and chilling now as it was back then. Based on a novel by William Peter Blatty, which was, in turn, inspired by a real life exorcism of a fourteen- year- old boy in Maryland, the movie relates the story of a girl afflicted with a devil possession. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys horror movies.The Exorcist puts a lot of insight into the Catholic Church and their beliefs. If you didn't believe in possession and exorcism before seeing this movie I believe it could change your mind. Linda Blair who played the young girl who was possessed did an absolutely unbelievable job playing the part. Although she was very young when she played the role in this movie, she brought a great amount of emotion and realism to the part; you actually felt like it was really happening. The Dialogue within The Exorcist is well written, spoken and true to the time and setting. The locations where the movie was placed give the movie an even more realistic feel. I felt that every scene was more than accurate all the way down to the last detail. The lighting and Cinematography, although done in the 1970s, is done exceptionally well. Even in today's advanced technology in horror films The Exorcist still stands far above the rest. There were no "cheesy" scenes like you see so often in movies today. Every bit of it was realistic and believable. Many movies rely heavily on music and sound to make viewers jump or to give that "scare" appeal; The Exorcist does not have to use those techniques. This movie will scare you right out of your seat even without all the loud unexpected sounds and people jumping out at you. This is one of the best movies I have ever had the privilege of seeing, and the simple fact that 36 years later it still is as widely popular as it was back then speaks for itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this when it was re-shown in British cinemas as its ban was lifted in 1999. 'The Scariest Movie Ever Made' is a formidable reputation and naturally, I couldn't wait to see it on the big screen. The cinema was at capacity, most were probably less interested in good horror and more curious in the film's dubious infamy. I had anticipated an audience jumping from their seats, shrieks from flabbergasted adults who could barely contain themselves in a some petrified stupor! Pop corn leaping from trembling hands and perhaps even a walk-out or two. What actually happened was laughter. Thats how a modern audience, fed on CGI laden garbage treats a horror classic? Personally, I think The Exorcist has aged beautifully. The script, cast and story all have a depth and quality that just doesn't date. And whilst the head-spinning, projectile vomiting, crotch grabbing moments of the film may not shock as they once did; there is an atmosphere to this movie, a feeling like an evil dog is off its leash and could do anything. The opening scene in the Middle East just has an indescribable un-easiness to it.If you have yet to see The Exorcist, I couldn't recommend it enough - it is a classic in the truest sense. Try and forget the ban and even your own expectations and enjoy one of the greatest ever movies made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie lost its horror factor, but it's still a work of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist was one of those movie which revolutionised the genre. It was perhaps the first horror movie to bring such new elements as demons, possession, religion in it. Granted, it's not very scary now, but try and think as someone from the 70s, who had no idea what to expect and were treated with a shocking movie.The story is set in Georgetown. The protagonists are, first of all, Ellen Burstyn (Chris MacNeil), an actress and a proud mother of a girl, Regan (Linda Blair). One day strange things start to happen at the local church. At the same time, Regan's behavior makes a sharp turn towards the "dark side" as she starts talking rude and hitting people. As she gains new powers and as her face deteriorates, psychiatrists can no longer be of help and Ellen considers an exorcism.The second protagonist is Father Karras (Jason Miller), a priest and former psychiatrist, who is part of a sub-plot, which eventually leads him to the main plot. The final mini-protagonist is Father Merrin (Max von Sydow), someone we will see more towards the end.Commenting about acting in this movie is useless, mainly because it cannot be complained about. But I do have to mention Jason Miller, since he really managed to give life to the depressed, but perseverant Father Karras.The plot evolves slowly, but seeing the possessed girl is somehow rewarding. I know that back then it was very scary, but I think the possessor is hilarious, all his dirty talking made me laugh. But the exorcism scene is a unique one in cinema history and it has its place among the most memorable ones.With all honesty, it is a masterpiece, The Exorcist is an essential part of the horror genre and it will still remain an example in the years to come.Final Score: 5/5 or 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all to those people who say this film is crap and its more funny than scary - you are stupid. I think people who think that are just shallow people who cant think about things. I feel this film made me think allot about Religion and the Afterlife. I mean this is based on a true story so surly something must be out there. Anyway lets not turn this into a religious debate (Im not a Christian by the way). This film is perfect in so many levels. Its powerful, as I said it makes you think. But its also powerful because you begin to feel the guilt that Father Karras feels about his mother and when the demon speaks in his mothers voice and says 'Why did you do this to me Dimmy?' really gets to you. They really did choose the soundtrack well as well, Tubular Bells is one of my favourite albums and it works brilliantly in this film. Apart from that this song doesn't actually have much music, but I think that works well. It makes it seem more realistic unlike most modern films. Another thing that I love about this film is the In Your Face scenes. They just time it so well. One minute its quiet and nothings happening then it just explodes in your face.I found I understood the film more after I read the book. It's certainly more detailed. If you haven't read the book I seriously recommend you do.... Also if you haven't seen this film yet... WATCH IT! Haha but seriously if you not one of those people that likes horrors that just rely on pointless gore and flashing images and your someone who likes clever classy horrors then this is your film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still The Scariest Film to Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I watch this film it just reminds me how excellent it is and why it was etched in my memory as one of the most disturbing films that I have seen.It has somehow become cool to dismiss the Exorcist as overrated, over-hyped, or "not as scary as everyone says it is". The fact that this movie has an 8.1 rating is disturbing in and of itself. I exaggerate, but that strikes me as unreasonable.Everything about this film made it the quintessential horror experience. I remember this film leaving the biggest long-term psychological scar of any film I've seen. It was during this time that I was impressionable towards the idea of religion - nowadays I would not give religion even a passing consideration - and the idea that demon possession may have some believability to it--this is the way the film was billed to me. I'd liken this to going into the Blaire Witch Project expecting it to be an actual documentary.But not just that--the film reaks of perfection. Every shot was given masterful consideration. Friedkin, I am told, spent endless takes just trying to get shots to his liking. So combine this level of perfectionism with an already interesting premise, a universal accessibility, and some of the best acting I've seen of any horror film (if you can consider this a horror film -I consider it a 'psychological thriller' - period.As far as build-ups in movies go, this movie had one of the greatest build-ups I've seen. It does not launch right into the action as your average horror flick would and treats the subject matter deftly. What ensued is a very subtle, very tight-rope tension builder....and not overdone with blood, in-your-face scares.This is what I go to the cinemas for: flight-of-fancy, compelling films.Also, this movie in conjunction with The Omen instilled a permanent fear of the number 6 for me.</fullReview>

From northern Iraq to Georgetown this barely lets up.The Exorcist is tagged as a film about The Devil possessing a little girl, but its unnerving when The Priest (an excellent Jason Miller) doesn't really know just what kind of entity that dominates Reagan and doubts his own Faith even more.The special effects are still gruesome, the shocks still shock and the face of Pazuzu flashing vividly in Karra's dream sequence with his mother coming out the subway is still really scary and frightening.A classic horror film for all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The exorcist is the scariest movie of all time period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People were screaming, people were crying, people ran out of the theater, people were vomiting, and people were grossed out. This is what happened when they say The exorcist. The exorcist is the scariest movie of all time period. I can't think of any other film that was as scary as this or what film played with your religion so much.The exorcist is about a fourteen year old girl who is becoming stressed and she's acting unusual. She's cursing, she's throwing tantrums, and she yells. We find out a demon is taking control of Reagen.Now it is unbelievable of how scary this film is. Did you know The exorcist came out before all the horror classics? It came out before The Texas chain saw massacre, A nightmare on Elm Street, Jaws, The shining, Stephen King's It, Friday the 13th, Child's play, and more. Yet, it's still scares the crap out of you. The director first sets the movie in Iraq and then sets the movie at the house with Reagun. Now we see Reagun as just an ordinary girl who enjoys being with her mother. Then we see her with a demon inside her.People that say this movie isn't scary probably didn't see it in 70's when it came out. I even find that hard to believe that you didn't even jump once during The exorcist even by today. I saw this the second time today and it scared the living crap out of me. The exorcist has a great story, amazing acting, and a well use of CGI. Everything looked believable. Overall The exorcist still stands today as the scariest movie of all time, period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of what i've heard that doesn't do the movie any good. So i'll go back to the first time i've seen the movie which was somewhere in the eighties. In that time i watched many of the horror-movies available in the videotheque. When i was about 14 years old, titles like Lucio Fulci's Zombie or Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust and the Faces Of Death-series were top of the bill by me and my schoolmates. During that same time i saw this movie: and i liked it. It's not so really aggressive as the titles named above. The seventies had delivered the top in gore and exploitation at the end of the era so the fact many people were furious about this movie around 1973 hahaha. But Linda Blair does give a brilliant performance as Regan. Some very strong language and masturbation with a crucifix scene will make this movie a little bit unsuitable entertainment for Christian people. For the rest 8 out of 10 points (Very good, buy the DVD)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a "true" story ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read that this was based on a true story, only instead of a girl in reality it was an adolescent BOY.I wonder in light of all of the revelations to the massive abuse in the Catholic church if any bright reporters have looked closer into this story based on priests who shut themselves into some boy's bedroom yelling at the mom to stay out and all of that. I mean seriously, people, that should be looked into. Priests locking themselves in with a schizophrenic or troubled underage boy? That scenario would never wash in this day and age. Now, would it?That whole "devil got a hold of me" kind of scenario doesn't fly these days. Gotta wonder how weird it actually got in that room. Priest to mom: "The Devil's in there with the boy. Leave the house and lock the door. Wait, where is your wine? Great, now go!" Who knows, reality may have been worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Friedkin has produced possibly the most controversial film of all time with his petrifying tale of a girl being possessed by the devil. This film was released in 1973 and quickly became the most feared movie of all time. No-one had ever seen such scenes of religious slander and coarse sexual language. I find it simply extraordinary how this film could have possibly been released to the extremely touchy audience of the early 70s. Afterall, this film is terrifying compared to any modern horror film i have ever seen and this is quite possibly the scariest film of all time however, this doesn't make it the best horror film of all time.The story follows the story of a girl being possessed by the devil and her devastated mother trying to get her exorcised. This leads to a climatic ending.This film is renowned for its spectacular imagery created by the make-up. Linda Blair was made to look as horrifying as possible with her famous make-up. Furthermore, the editing at times was brilliant. Unexpected flashes of weird faces are sure to terrify the audience without them even anticipating it. Such psychological horror is what all horror films should utilise rather then the 'gore gore gore' prerogative most contemporary horror films go by. Such psychological horror is what makes a brilliant horror movie.Moreover, the film has many cool subtleties that you would expect from a 70s film such as the fact that early in the film Regan hints towards using a ouiji board which of course prepares the audience for later in the film and possibly provides some sort of reason for this satanic possession.Anyway, despite the films obvious horror value, I feel that although it may the scariest film of all time it is far from the best horror film. What film gains with scares it lacks with enough substance and thought. For example, the shining is most probably one of the most thought provoking films of all time alongside psycho's amazing plot twist at the end. Therefore, as a film the exorcist isn't particularly breath-taking but because of its controversial and shocking theme it is slightly over-rated. Sometimes we should step back and look at a film as a film not a theme.Horror seekers should see this simply because it is a milestone of cinema. A powerful film of visceral proportions.8.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's be frank, by today's standards this movie's funny and anything but scary, especially with movies out there like "Audition," which has some of the most gruesome images ever put on film.However, as far as films in general go, this movie is one of the best I think I've ever seen. One thing that makes it such a great movie is how daring and visually spectacular a movie it is for the time.Religion was in heavy practice and offended many (this would continue into the 80's with the PMRC, especially with bands such as Venom and Slayer) and also notable is how people see and empathize with the mother and what she has to go through.For the time, the movie was very real (this is especially notable when you consider the blood which is much more real than the blood in "The Godfather" which as released a year prior to this one) and so some people actually thought that what they were seeing was Satan on the big screen.While by today's standards of "gruesome and terrifying horror movies" it may not hold up the best anymore, but it is still a scary part of the industry's history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superb piece of film-making. Acting,directing,script..all top drawer. When viewing it, you do get this very uneasy feeling and you can feel the tension build and build. This film demonstrates very well that its all about building atmosphere in horror movies...no guts and gore particularly but through menacing music and lighting, a chilling scene is set. I'm sure other viewers who have enjoyed viewing it, want to watch it again but have this fear factor towards...i know i do! I recently bought the 25th Anniversary DVD..have watched the extras but haven't sat down for the movie yet..(have seen it 3 times now and still scares the hell out of me!) I did have the 'Version you have never seen' on VHS and i remember when i first saw the spider walk...sends chills down my spine thinking of it.Some people seem to find this film comical - which surprises me. I tend to think those people haven't watched the movie in the right frame of mind or with the right audience....but then again, if they do not believe in god, then i guess this is not relevant for them. Its been 34 years now and i don't think the Exorcist has been bettered..or ever will be. Watch it...but be warned...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly a cult classic horror film above the rest. The Exorcist is of course one of those films that will always be remembered and will never sink into obscurity. I got the special box-set not so long ago and it includes the book -Out of the shadows by Bob McCabe. A detailed insight into the making of the film and a guide to how it all came about. The film has a timeless atmosphere that leaves a long and lasting impression. The rapid dreamy subliminal cuts will linger forever. its a ride that will never end.***warning spoilers follow*** A priest questions his faith after a series of unfortunate events that occur in his depressing life, and he begins to have his doubts in his beliefs. He soon comes face to face with a possessed girl who claims to be the devil. It ends in a showdown which restores his Faith as he battles to save the girls life with the help of an experienced exorcist called father Merrin, played brilliantly by Max Von Sydow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mother of ALL Possession Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently purchased the re-cut DVD version of this 1973 film. I had never watched the whole film (when it's appeared on TV) over the years but I had read the book long ago. Since I had no pre-conceived ideas about film content, I really enjoyed it for what it is: a thinking-man's horror movie.Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller are excellent as the two priests who are called in to fight evil. Ellen Burstyn is properly distraught as the mother. Linda Blair, as Regan, has to be admired for the arduous task it must have been to portray the physical disintegration the 12-year-old girl goes through; she was never to repeat that kind of performance in her "career". Lee J. Cobb, as Inspector Kinderman, is the only somewhat light note in the dark proceedings.The effects are, for their time cutting edge. The shock value has been lost slightly by the fact EVERYONE has heard about those scenes or seen still pictures or video clips of them. The FX are still effective and add to the fear and tension.Warning: if it's even AVAILABLE, do not see Exorcist 2!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie and to tell you the truth I was not truly scared but more of intrigued, or so I thought at that time. I went to sleep that night and had such a bad dream about the movie that I couldn't really sleep well for about 2 days.And I want to tell you that I am not that sort of the person who get squimish or scared that easily, I saw Silence of the lambs, The Blair witch project and and most of the Japanese horror movies which I think are way more scarier than the American counterparts very easily without any problems, such is the impact of the movie on someone's mind.I have the uncut version of the movie and let me tell you, If get squimish easily. its better you watch the cut version coz those pukes, those head rollings and that Christ bashing can really get to you.Linda Blair plays the part of the child being occupied by the devil really well with those eyes and that innocent face. Those screams, Iknow they were done by someone else, but still you gotta get the expressions right because without them the acting accounts to nothing.But what I really like was the character of Father Damien Karras played by Jasom Miller, his confusion and his way of being caught up by life and his utter frustration is really fascinating you get intrigued by the character. All the other characters play their part well and keep you interested. The music and the sound effects are really good and makes the movie what it is today.But all is not so perfect about the movie, it sometimes just loses you in the middle, sometimes it gets slow and boring and after sometime all that screaming does really get annoying but even after that its a good movie to watch if you are a fan of horror genre but I don't know about the forever classic part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it's dark. my uncle and i, both fans of the genre, have decided to watch "the scariest movie of all times". we have managed to convince my aunt, my mother and my brother to watch it with us. "it's a movie you shouldn't watch by yourself. the more, the merrier" my uncle says, with an all-knowing smile upon his face. we turn on the TV... a dull image appears - the proof is the fact that i forget it the moment it is replaced by another one. it's a word. it says "PLAY" my world slowly starts to collapse. i look frightened at my companions as they quietly head for the bedroom, leaving me with these horrible images. i want to follow them, but i can't. i know that i won't be able to sleep unless i find out how it ends. and it would better end right! i'm so scared... hardly has a half an hour passed, that i'm all alone in the (now) much creepier room. the only one that is still here is my uncle. i look at him with gratitude, thankful for not having left me on my own. i turn my eyes at the TV and i remain still with terror and disgust. that sweet, beautiful Teresa is climbing down the stairs...in a rather... unusual way. i can't understand why this image has had such a great impact. i am simply terrified. i want scream, but my mouth won't open. i want to leave the room, but my feet won't budge. i don't know what to do. i need to get out. i need to turn off the TV. i need to run away. but i sit there, still, waiting for the next scene.eventually, it ends. i go to bed without saying a word to my uncle. i lay on the bed, wondering how will i be able to fall sleep. i get up, sit next to the bed and i say a short prayer, thanking god for my brother, who's sleeping in the bed next to mine.weeks later, my family had left me all alone in the house. i turn on the TV. i see a commercial: THE EXORCIST - soon on tvr1. i can see how shadows appear out of nowhere in the quiet, clean room. i can see how her dreadful hand reaches for my shoulder. i can see her dreadful head and i can feel its chilly breath on my hair. i want to turn around and face it, but i am too scared...that night, i kept the lights on from dusk till dawn. that night, i didn't close an eye. i stayed under the blanket, wishing for someone to drop by unannounced. and that's how i spent the next four days, until my family came back home. i spent the next week recovering.but i can still sometimes feel her. now and then, she comes to me and she makes sure that i haven't forgotten about her.i want to ask for help, but nobody listens. nobody understands. nobody cares. i'm trapped...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary, but otherwise brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I'm just going to come right out and say it - this movie did not scare me at all. I don't know if it was because I have an unusually high threshold for grossness, or because I knew about most of the scary scenes in advance, or because I find the concept of organized religions laughable, but for whatever reason, this movie, touted as one of the most terrifying ever made by just about everyone, did not scare me.Now that I've established this, you're probably wondering why I gave it 10/10 stars. And I will answer in the following way - because just about everything else was perfect. Linda Blair's performance was spot-on, even if it wasn't her voice during most of the possession scenes. Father Karras had my sympathy the entire length of the movie, even if I disagreed with him on matters of faith (a sign of a truly good character). I could've done with a few less demon faces, but that didn't *really* detract from the movie.But above all, I will say what I always say about The Omen (1976): if the very premise of a movie is the exact opposite of everything you believe in, and you totally believe it by the end, it truly is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is not scary but it is indeed very good especially for a film made in the 1970's when make up effects were not as great as they are today.Taking age into consideration is a must as yes this movie does feel like you are watching something old but the storyline is enough to keep you watching.The first 45 minutes are as rather slow but this is when the storyline really perks your interest nothing scary happens but the discussion topics and conversations are really intriguing and get you thinking about what's going to happen next.The rest of the film is filled with some intense,adrenaline pumping scenes that are most definitely genre defining.What they decided to do with this little possessed girl character is really very innovative.The situations are very odd and well disturbing for those who are easily scared however i found none of it frightening at all just really interesting and intense.For any of you who have seen X-Men:The Last stand it's like a darker,more eerie version of the scene with Phoenix in her house but with that same passion and adrenaline that just gets you excited and into it.This movie is very very unique and really relies on atmosphere to draw you into it you can almost feel how cold Regans room is.I didn't find the demons voice scary at all honestly to me it sounded like a New Yorker who smokes a lot yelling obscenities and threats so that took a lot of the creepiness away for me personally.I love all of the subtle things you notice like faces in the room or shadows or just little orb like things it really makes you feel like you're watching something that is footage,very good, effective film-making.Overall The Exorcist is a film bound to scare young children or easily frightened people to death but for those completely desensitized to horror films it is not scary but definitely a great piece of cinema with memorable scenes that would inspire many horror films to come.</fullReview>

The original book was actually not quite as good as the movie! Most books are better than the movies that are made afterward, however this film was so well done that it is more interesting, exciting and enjoyable than the book was! Bravo! Every Halloween I can't help but watch this film again along with a few other favorites that of course include, Night of the Living Dead, Phantasm, Dracula- 1960's version, Frankenstien -1960's version, and Teenage Frankenstien -1960's version. I am also a huge fan of British and 1960's horror and cult films. They were done so much better back then in the 60's and 70's. There were also way more movies to choose from back then as well. Were are all the good film makers hiding these days? Come out- come out- where ever you are!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the best horror movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes The Exorcist scarier than all other horror films, is that unlike the rest of the lot, this film takes itself serious. Too many modern cookie cutter horror films have fallen into a predictable recipe of presenting some characters (most viewers start guessing which one's will live and die right from the get go) in really bad situations, apply some psychotic killers or sci-fi monsters, and let the blood fly. The Exorcist is head and shoulders above anything else in the genre, because it is presentation of what would happen if someone were possessed by the devil. Period. And that's scary. There are special effects, sure, but nothing more than needed to depict what would happen during an actual possession. The Rites of Exocism performed are fairly accurate. Compared to modern standards of whiz-bang effects and creative ways to show dismemberment, The Exocist comes off as slow and almost low-key as a film. But, great acting and hauntingly depressing scenes, remind us that nothing is more horrific than common people battling the ultimate evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scariest horror film of all time" I get scared extremely easily!! Things like Harry Potter scare me. Things like my friends creeping up behind me scare me. Random noises in the night scare me. The Exorcist did not scare me!! I had heard things about the exorcist being scary etc. so I wanted to watch it and was prepared to turn it off after 20 minutes from being scared. But I spent the whole two hours WAITING for it to get scary!! The people who say the only reason I didn't find it scary was because I didn't understand it. Well yes I did understand it but even if I didn't it should still have been scary. I have watched films which I did not understand but still scared me. If it had really been the "scariest film of all time" then understanding it should not have been essential for me to be scared. Biggest waste of two hours!! Katie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the end of the movie, when Father Dyer is about to walk off, we see him standing still in contemplation. In the original version, a leaf can be seen falling in the background. In the extended version, the leaf is missing.I only noticed this because I was comparing this scene frame by frame. If the extended release is a transfer from another master, could that leaf in the original have been drawn in? It's blurry, but it seems to intentionally move at an angle across the rear of his head in the same direction that he is staring. There are other leaves falling in the background, and this leaf is not at all prominent in a casual viewing.With the exception of the aspect ratio, everything about these few frames appear identical, with the exception of the "leaf." If this was an intentional insertion, I wonder if other elements had been placed in the original version.</fullReview>

But my mom wouldn't let me because the movie freaked her out like no other, and she said that she still has nightmares from it. But that's only because she went to see it in theaters when she was 11, so no wonder it scared the living daylights out of her. Anyway, I begged her for a very long time and she finally let me see it. AHH! It's not so much a *scary* movie but all that got me freaked out of my mind was her face. I mean, seriously, how can anyone not find that creepy? Don't get me wrong...I love the movie and I would definitely see it again, but I understand why my mom didn't want me seeing it. It was on TV last night and I asked my mom if she would like to watch it with the rest of the family and to my amazement she said "fine" so we watched it as a "family movie" and she closed her eyes through half the film! It was funny, but it's been a LONG TIME and it still scares her! It will probably always scare me every time I see it, but I'm a horror freak so this movie is AMAZING!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist ****I let my older sister and her friend watch The Exorcist and they were really freaked out. So did my two younger sisters but they were watching an edited version of the film. I overhead a student talking about The Exorcist and how he was completely shocked. Now this was in 2004. If a horror film can still scare people even though made over thirty years ago, then I think it deserves to be named one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The Exorcist was also an Academy Award disappointment. Why? Maybe they viewed the film as a Vomit Fest. Now I can't deny that people have gotten sick while watching the film, but after the second time, these people also saw how great of a horror film it really is.The Exorcist- The Version You've Never Seen ***1/2The Version You've Never Seen is just as slick and terrifying as the original. This version adds ten minutes to the original film. An extended seen at the doctors office and the exorcism, (not the exorcism in general), and the famous spider walk seen. The flaw with this version is the ending. The original ending was such a downer that it worked. This version has a friendship striking up at the end. However it is still a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why THE EXORCISTS should receive Bram Stoker Award</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE EXORCIST deserves to be part of William Peter Blatty horror works that won him the Bram Stoker Lifetime Achievement Award. The scenes of Regan possessed are horrifying. Regan is speaking in a very deep voice, instead of her usual high-pitched voice. Her eyes change to the color of yellow during the exorcism and her head turns around 360?. The devil gives off an odor and makes the room freezing and can make the bed literally levitate. In chapter four of part two, Blatty wrote on page 143, "...Chris watched helplessly while her daughter's eyes rolled upward into their sockets and she wrenched up a keening shriek of terror torn raw and bloody from the base of her spine. Burke Dennings was killed by Regan. The scary part was that "Burke Dennings...was found at the bottom of that long flight up steps at exactly five minutes after seven with his head turned completely around and backward." ------------ THE EXORCIST is a wonderful horror story that is full of suspense and can introduce one to the topic of exorcism. Mr. Blatty's ideas of Regan being possessed and how he is able to unite fiction and nonfiction together will make him a reputable author of horror. The Bram Stoker Lifetime Achievement Award is for authors whose entire body of work has influenced horror and THE EXORCIST deserves to be part of Mr. Blatty's horror works that won him this award.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't beat the 1970's horror flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the 1973 film "The Exorcist" is one of the greatest horror films of all time. Why is it so terrifying, because the plot (bassed on that of possession) seems like something that is believable, and could actually happen. What makes it even more electrifying is the mix of possession and religion.Overall, the picture is just plain disturbing. There are several scenes in the film that are rather difficult to watch. This film made a major impact during it's 1973 release; few films have the capability to make such an impact today. People were actually walking out of theaters during it's original run, or they were lined up around the block trying to purchase tickets.The 1970's brought us perhaps some of the best horror films of all time. Today's supposedly "scary" movies are absolutely absurd, and not well thought out, and really stupid. If you have an appreciation of horror classics, The Exorcist is an absolute must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>QFC - The Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The exorcist is good, no doubt about it. What makes it particularly good and all the scarier is the drama attached to the horror. If this movie didn't scare anyone, which is pretty hard to believe, it would at least strike them as a drama. The background of every character is scary on a human level. The Priest conflicted, losing his faith and shook by such a horrible death of the mother. A mother whose husband is somewhere in Europe and won't even call for her daughter's birthday. A Priest in his old age, very ill and lonely. This is all stuff that would make a perfectly good drama. A human drama. What happens when a drama meets a paranormal movie? A total disaster. But not in this case. Here, it's movie history.After the exorcist, many have tried to make a film like it, see all the sequels including 'the Exorcism of Emily Rose'. Well, they all failed because they were nothing more than films made to scare the crap out of people, not to really strike people with fear and compassion.Directed beautifully, maybe a little slow starter, but scary, and hard hitting. This film is history! WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When the exorcism begins, beds shake, furniture move, complete chaos invades the room but the two Priests have to keep praying, can't leave, can't move, and are forced to witness the power of the devil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful film to say the least.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is, at the moment, tied with the Japenese "Premonition" for my favorite horror film of all-time. Perhaps "The Exorcist" has a slight advantage, though.First of all, whether it is a true story or not, it still has extremely strange circumstances surrounding the making of this movie.I think something like 13 people died during the making, the set burned down mysteriously (no one knows why, even to this day) as well as the crew being plagued with minor difficulties.I have heard conflicting view on whether or not the actual exorcism occurred, but I tend to believe that no matter how improbable, these sort of things do happen.Call me religious. Call me superstitious. That's just what I believe.Also, the acting is amazing. I know a lot of it is real, like the angered look on the mother's face when she gets slapped across the room, and the frightened look from the Regan when she is flipping out on the bed. The are REAL emotions the actors went through, because they were being pulled too violently (in both cases) by the men who were pulling the ropes for 'special effects' behind them.However, whether you, yourself believe in the above mentioned things or not, this is not a forgettable film whatsoever. My recommendation is to watch it either completely alone or with one other person at the most in a pitch-black environment. If you aren't freaked out and/or if your jaw is not dropped open by the end of the film, then I'll know you're watching it from a little cell in an unknown prison, Charles Manson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've recently been watching runs of this on cable and am fascinated that it no longer scares the be-jeezus out of me. Back in 1973, I went through a somewhat prolonged and superstitious period of not being able to be alone, due solely to having watched this film. But, also having seen some of it's franchise offshoots, (II-III and the prequel), I can say without a doubt that this is the best of the lot. The screenplay is tight and the production steadily builds to the final climax. Even after having watched it recently several times, and even though I know the ending, I can readily see how a newcomer might not be able to predict it, with surety. Great film --by today's standards, has an indy look and feel to it. The casting is superb -- Jason Miller left very big shoes to fill. I would LOVE to see this on a big screen again!</fullReview>

Without the classic pea soup scene in the bedroom with the Demonic girl, we wouldn't have that Scary Movie scene!

		<fullReview>I love this movie because it does what most scary movies cant do. Scare. Not so much what the possessed regan does, but what the film suggests. It suggests that anyone can be "taken over" and that there is a devil. But if there is a devil then there MUST be a God. Good and evil are symbiants, you cannot have one without the other. I also love this movie because it appeals to my dark personality. I want to be a film director and when i read some of the things the director william F. did to get his point across to the other actors, i wanted to be just like him. He isn't afraid of using unorthodox methods in his directing and i admire that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Exorcist when I was about 9 years old and back then every body was watching the film and not finding it scary. The line i hear the most that makes me think 'oh god' is when somebody says "It wasn't jumpy". I have to admit i wasn't a fan straight away of the film as it didn't really do anything for me. I recently watched the film again with a more mature attitude towards it and can understand the effect of the film. The idea of what is happening is terrifying and the power of the film is incredible and although there are some cheesy bits in towards the end, most of the film is absolutely horrific. However i do wonder that in the cut version why the scene where Linda Blair crab walks down the stairs, was cut by William Friedkin and then keeps in the famous scene with the turning head and the crucifix!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best horror movie in history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is like the Mother of all horror films, I'm a huge fan of stuff like Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween etc however no film had an effect on me like the Exorcist. From the opening scene right until the end everything seems to be extremely tense. Often in today's society people say they found the Exorcist funny, these people are idiots. Usually what happens is they have no understanding of the film they just take out little bits of it such as masturbation scene etc and laugh at them. What I recommend you do is put yourself in the position of Regains mother in the film, imagine like that was your own daughter or younger sister that had came possessed it would not be so funny then. Watch the film from the very beginning take it all in and try to understand it, and then you will see that this picture really is the most freightning thing that ever went on a movie screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily the most horrifying movie ever made. It, at some points is hard to keep from covering your eyes. If you are a catholic this picture could give you nightmares. Linda Blair is so frighteningly believable as a girl of thirteen who gets possessed by a demon. Her mother played by Ellen Burstyn initially has no idea what is going on when her daughter starts behaving strangely.Regan,the young girl, quickly progresses into violent and vile behavior. After seeing doctors and psychiatrists it is suggested that the the family resorts to seeing a priest for an exorcism. A young priest working as a psychiatrist and counselor gets some assistance from an aging priest with experience in such matters played magnificently by Max Von Sydow. The film is very graphic and the language is very strong,both of these things add to the picture.If you enjoy horror movies or are trying to finally get scared watching a film,this is your answer.</fullReview>

I'm sure we all know that it wasn't a girl, but a boy. The main priest's sidekick in the movie was actually the Principal of my high school at one point, St. Louis University High. Our high school has a weekly school newspaper, and the priest wrote about what actually happened in our newspaper. All I remember from reading a copy of it was that things did fly across the room and the bed did shake. I'm not sure if the boy actually had markings on him, but things did indeed fly across the room and the bed did shake. So there you go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My comments on the Exorcist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally watching the exorcist scared me half to death! yes times have changed, looking at it, the make-up and filmography to a modern audience is terrible. What scares me about it is not just the fact that for the time she looked scary but when you read or hear things that relate to the movie. This is real! This is possible! Also the other aspect to it's "scariness" is the choreography, when the head spins around-it is terrible! But the audience can imagine it, the sound though is very realistic. There are certain aspects of the film which are very clever and well put together, others just seem trashy to a modern day audience as we are used to high-tech, state of the art technology. The best aspect about the film though i think is the fact it's a well-structured plot, the movie doesn't just dive straight in with the possession. It builds you up from the scenes with the priest in Iraq, sensing the evil and seeing Regan playing and hearing about the problems with her home life and then the differences that take place building up to her possession. This creates tension and a proper horror film. All i can do is award the team that made this film, especially Linda (Regan) for doing such a wonderful job at such a young age, i congratulate you for making the ultimate scary movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The exorcist is a very good scary movie. The thing is at first some people might not get as scared as later on. after a few nights I couldn't get to sleep for a few hours thinking of it. Probably some of the scariest parts were the subliminal messages of the demon throughout the movie, the backwards crab-walk ( totally unexpected ) , and the masturbation with the crucifix. The problem is when it is not concentrating on Reagan it gets kind of like a middle-grade drama movie. But I guess that makes it more of a big story. Nonetheless it has a very creepy story, good effects, and it makes up a good movie pretty much overall. this gets an 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie about two months ago thinking I want to watch a really scary film, one that would have me hiding behind the sofa but if anything it was just a little disturbing in places especially when the little possessed girl was "masturbating" with a crucifix screaming "f**k you Jesus, Jesus f**k you" that freaked me out and I remember thinking towards the end of the movie when she is back to normal, "she is going to have one hell of a shock when she has a look down there". I realised at one point that it had been on TV when I was 15 and I remember my parents strongly advising me not to watch it because even my step dad (who I assumed had a stronger stomach) was scared when he watched it and when I watched it I laughed when I remembered this ha ha ha. So if you haven't watched it, even if your under 18 like me watch it because its not like you are going to be scarred for life, cause I'm not and I scar easily like that when it comes to horror but I guess I've become used to gruesome horror, violent swearing and violence itself.

		<fullReview>Very good film, it's one of my favourites because it is a different type of horror film, mostly to do with religion, faith, and despair.Only a few horror films include religion and faith, so that's why i think this film succeeded. And also the fact that it was kind of based on a true story, it was only vaguely based on a true story though, because the true story is totally different, but does include an exorcism. This was the best one of the exorcist anthology in my opinion. The only thing i disagree with is the year it was released, people weren't ready for that type of film yet, it made people shocked and scared, and even murderous, it wasn't the right time, they should of waited a few more years to release it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrelenting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE EXORCIST is one riveting horror film for reasons most people who know the film don't talk about. This William Friedkin movie, based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, is not only about the terrors of demon possession- the idea of which is unsettling enough in itself. THE EXORCIST is also about the sterility of the contemporary world, and that is terrifying indeed.Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn), the lead character in the story, is a successful film actress who is working on a movie being shot on campus at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., a film which is the "Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story", in her words. During the time of this production, McNeil's only daughter Regan (Linda Blair) is stricken with a mysterious ailment, which turns out to be possession by an ancient and violent energy from hell. After numerous medical tests and consultations regarding the "attacks" her daughter is experiencing, the medical staff that she is taking her daughter to advise her to seek the assistance of an exorcist.McNeil consults a priest/psychiatrist whose brooding presence has caught her attention. Father Damien Karras(Jason Miller), a priest and student of psychology, is himself experiencing alienation and emotional trauma brought on by the recent death of his mother and his own growing lack of faith. Karras agrees to look into the McNeil case. Convinced by a number of disturbing phenomenon that the possession is for real, he makes arrangements for Regan to be exorcised by a father Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow), a specialist in both theological and archaeological studies. Merrin travels from Iraq to perform the exorcism. He and Father Karras have a number of dramatic exchanges with the demon, the penultimate of which results in the death of the older priest. Karras then confronts the demon in a sort of street manner, defies it to leave Regan and enter him, and once it has done so, destroys both himself and the demon by hurling himself out a third story window. The negative forces in the earth are set back once again, and the curtain falls.But what the film leaves unresolved is the surrounding horror, the everyday horror that is much less then supernatural. All through this film, what is pronounced alongside the horrific things the demon does to Regan McNeil, is the essential coldness and lack of imagination to be found in the contemporary world, and this isolation and desolation is suggested in a number of scenes and camera techniques from the very beginning of the film. The opening frame, with the night time shot of the Georgetown brownstone the McNeils live in, is one that proclaims isolation even in the midst of prosperity. The camera jumps then to Baathist era Iraq in its semi-feudal misery, where the priest/archaeologist Father Merrin is overseeing a dig. Not only is the desolation of the near eastern landscape pronounced, but the isolation of Merrin as the western visitor and "other" in a world that he is not part of on anything but a very abstract level.Back in Georgetown, where modern medical science at its apogee is offered to the McNeils, the very machinery of the modern reeks of sterility and the loneliness of infirmity and death. Nowhere is this theme more pronounced in the film then in the scenes where Karras, seeking to care for his dying mother, is forced to visit her in an underfunded and bureaucratic mental institution that serves the poor. When Father Karras' mother dies, she dies alone, and it is two days before she is discovered by the neighbors.Friedkin, to his credit, brings onto this hopeless scene some warmth and some light relief through his character Police Lieutenant Kinderman, here played by the very fine actor Lee J. Cobb. Kinderman lives a life of police department by-the-book, but he also has a life of mind and imagination that bolsters and prepares him for his everyday world. A film geek, he is fond of making semi- humorous allusions to his favorite movies in conversations with the protagonists in the movie. And it is entirely suitable that the movie ends on a note with him and a young associate of Father Karras, as opposed to the last, cold shot of the stairway next to the brownstone, as did the earlier released version of this movie.All in all, I think THE EXORCIST is far more about the horror of humanity at war with itself then it is about any supernatural visitations. I offer as parting validation for this assessment one of the last dialogs between Father Karras and Father Merrin. Karras asks why the demon has chosen a child to victimize, and Merrin replies that it is so people will despair, and feel themselves unworthy of the love of God. And it is this very self-imposed unworthiness that Friedkin focuses on for much of the film. At the end of the day, it is we whose imaginations have failed, who have no answers to our mutually agreed upon isolation. And that's the real terror. No demons need apply.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lee J. Cobb's classic moment of unspoken pathos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my very favorite cinematic devices is the climactic exposition of unspoken emotion. When done properly, these can pack a subtle, but powerful punch and leave the viewer breathless. Such scenes are getting rarer in modern cinema, which largely caters to lazy, unthinking ticket buyers who prefer cheap, in-your-face thrills to complex emotional dichromatics. The Exorcist boasts a monumental, masterfully-woven tapestry rich with subtext, and contains one of my very favorite moments of silent pathos. The final scene shows Lee J. Cobb's character, Lt. Kinderman, coming upon the chaotic and bloody aftermath of the exorcism. While uttering not a single word, he successfully registers an expression of complete, shocked bewilderment over what he is witnessing; a reaction to horror that is honest, pure, and completely believable. This gem ranks with other classic cinema moments of silent pathos, including Barry Fitzgerald's deeply-touching embrace with his aged, feeble Irish mother in 1944's Going My Way, and Morgan Freeman's emotional seaside reunion with his slammer buddy, Tim Robbins, in 1994's modern classic, The Shawshank Redemption. In each of these instances, the director had the courage and intelligence to eschew the narrative element and allow raw, visceral emotion to invest the scene with its inherent value. In this way the impact is deepened for the viewer, who is left to privately ponder and interpret what she/he has observed. The Shawshank sequence is particularly potent because the camera pans away to a high aerial perspective at the crucial moment of reunion, reinforcing the sense that the viewer is a vicarious witness to something deep, profound, and very, very personal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For it's time, yes I can imagine it being pretty damn scary. I mean, a 12 year old innocent little girl suddenly possessed by a demon for no reason? ( By the way, it IS a demon, not the devil). Anyway, by today's standards it is still scary, but not as much. Certain scenes are disturbing though. One scene talked about a lot is when Regan masturbates with the crucifix and yells "let Jesus f--- you!". Yeah that scene is really that bad. It's actually worse than I imagined it would be. Another part is when she is having "violent back spasms" and suddenly she falls back on the pillow with her eyes rolled to the back of her head and groans. That did scare me. Although the DVD I rented was scratched at the end, I can tell you what happened. SPOILERS HERE IN- When father Karass is choking Regan, the demon exits Regan and possesses Karass. And Karass knows it too. So he jumps out the window and rolls down 97 steps to his death. A priest gives him the last rites. After all of this, Regan and her mom leave the house and their former lives behind. "Do you know what she did, your cunting daughter?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never thought something wrong of this movie, since my dad told me about this movie I was scared. This movie is about a 12 year old girl that has an evil spirit, and that leaves you thinking many things, for example "I should be catholic", or "Won't let my kids play with a OUIJA".Well, I haven't seen the movie complete, but at least I watched the best part (I mean the ending), which was very good, and scary, and as I said, I couldn't sleep without having a nightmare.Now, some guys had done other "Exorcist" movies, some guys think they must make the new movie more scary, others just make remakes, sequels, even comedies, but none is as good (or shall I say scary) as this one.And the director of this movie, as my mom told me, he was like a crazy guy, he had to see many psichiatrics, doctors, whatever, and while this movie was being produced (22 years ago) horrible things happened, some actors were injured, and I think others died. Probably a signal of heaven, who knows? Still, this is a good scary movie, and if you like horror films this is very recommendable. I won't ever play with a OUIJA, and because I'm catholic I could say I'm safe...This movie receives: 10/10 for being one of the best horror films of the century.</fullReview>

The scene where Regan was fighting the Doctor who is giving her an Injection and shouting "****ing *******!" was a quality scene!Father merrin was my best character.The cursing Demon was a bit to hyped (but still good) for me. Not many people know this but Satan was teaching the humans Sex, violence, drugs, swearing and all the good stuff of life in the book of revelations (It's not written there but thats what happened ;)). Satan brought a lot of bad things unto the world like hunger, death, hate, bill gates etc.I give the Exorcist 8/10, It's my 2nd favourite horror movie, behind The OMEN.</fullReview>

But they were totally mistaken they didn't even saw half of the movie when he asked me to turn it off. Right after the spider-walk scene one of my friends ran out almost crying cuz of the disturbance of that scene, my other friend quickly turns off the movie and states that he will never see the rest of the movie again.

This is not a horror film like the ones that come out today, they just rely on gore and that's about it, The Exorcist does have it's fair share of gore but it is not the gore that is scary, it's the atmosphere. I recommend anybody to watch the Exorcist, just proceed with caution, this film can affect people in strange ways. In the cinemas in the 70's a man reportedly threw himself at the screen to pull the demon out of the screen. I saw this when I was thirteen and I strongly recommend it to people of that age and upwards, don't worry about the certificate, you should be mature enough by now to realise that it's only a film...Or is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the scariest movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to begin by saying that I think of myself as a movie buff. I try to watch every film with an open frame of mind not allowing myself to draw any unfounded conclusions. Only after watching a film in its entirety do a start to form a opinion on the film, I try to ask myself what was the director/Writter trying to say, or what feeling did they (director) wanted you to feel as you wear watching. As with lots of movies that are supposed to be scary i find myself disappointed after watching the movie, rarely does a movie actually frighten me. The exorcist on the other hand has frightened me like no other movie has. As i watched it for the first time I was so overtaken by fear that after the movie was over I lay ed in the bed all night long scared of what happened to the little girl in the movie. if you like to be scared I would advise you to watch the exorcist and remember that no one is safe not even a little girl. I would like to say that I don't believe another movie could ever produce the fear that this movie has!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I'll start by saying that while The Exorcist is the scariest horror movie ever made it is not the best in my opinion. I rank The Omen and A Nightmare on Elm Street higher. Both movies are fun to watch but neither are scary. ( Well maybe The Omen a little. ) The Exorcist is the only movie ever to disturb me. I watch it these days and I find nothing perturbing about it. However I'm a little more cynical these days than in the early eighties when I first saw it. I was only about fifteen or sixteen when my mother brought the video home not knowing what it was about. The tape was turned off immediately when it came to the crucifix scene. I never saw the rest of the film until 1990 London when it was shown in a theatre on Shaftsbury Avenue. I was glad to revisit it in all it's glory. Having become a non-believer in that space of time I could watch the film for what it was. A very good night's entertainment. One thing struck me though a few years later when I bought the 25th anniversary edition. It's not the gore and spectacle that scare you or remain with you when you leave the theatre. It's the little things. When the clock stops at the start of the film. The rustling noise in the attic. The subliminal flash of a white face. Whenever Reagan says something about Captain Howdy. It still sends shivers up my spine. The blood and the gore don't interest me. It leaves nothing to the imagination. The Exorcist works brilliantly as a psychological thriller and I think that's where the scares come from. I love this film and revisit it every now and then just to get those goosebumps rising.A very good shocker and no horror movie has scared me since. A testament to it's genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes you pray that there is a God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 14, only two years older than the "possessee". At the time, I was agnostic; when I left the movie, I was praying there is and was a God.By today's cinematography standards, the film may seem hoaky and ridiculous, but the plot still and acting is still very well-developed and convincing. I find it even harder now to watch as I am a parent and can relate more now to the role of a parent watching over instead of the "victim" and since the initial screening have not been able to watch it in its entirety, even on "regular" TV where the worst has been edited out.After becoming a Christian, have learned that possession and the devil are real, which makes this movie all the more frightening. Watch at your own risk!</fullReview>

Besides the expected and excellent improvement of picture quality,the audio was also excellent and a real bonus.I hadn't seen this movie since.....since it came out, lol, and i must say, i enjoyed it immensely.It moves slow at the beginning and just when you start wondering when the movie is going to pick up, it hits you right between the eyes.PS: The scene where Blair comes down the stairs like an upside down centipede completely blew me away. lol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Way back in 1973, one Oscar winning director was asked to adapt a top selling novel by William Peter Blatty. This director being Wiliam Friedkin, who has made probably the best known horror movie of all time,The Exorcist.A 12-year-old girl inadvertently becomes possessed by a demon called Pazuzu after playing with an Ouija board. The doctors think that she has something wrong inside her head, but her mother soon comes to think otherwise. The only way that she can be saved is to be exorcised.Based on a supposedly true event, The Exorcist was THE most shocking movie of its' time. In this day and age it may not shock as it did then but can still pack a powerful punch for those who believe in the power of possession and God and the Devil.Acting is top notch with Ellen Burstyn knocking in an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a leading role. The Version You've Never Seen is for hardcore fans only and movie purists, the spider-walk being the most talked about scene and the one fans wanted to see most.Overall a good movie but not great but definitely influential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Fantastic Movie..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Exorcist(1973)" is one of the best horror movies i have ever seen. The film basically sheds light on the horrific experiences of demonic possessions on a young girl and an attempt by a catholic priest to separate the demon from the girl's body. The story, direction, choice of cast, acting portrayed by the actors all contributed equally to the success of this movie.Each scene has been shot to perfect detail making the choice of the best camera angles possible.I give it 9/10 stars. Please watch the movie on DVD to get the best movie experience possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the horror movie by which all others of this genre shall be judged. not one bad note or scene in the entire movie. the writer figured out what it is that scares each and every one of us. and the director has successfully brought it to the screen. the cast is top notch and the story (though loosely based on a true story) is brilliantly written. the story behind the making of the movie is almost as entertaining as the movie itself. this is the perfect kind of movie to watch with the lights turned off and on a big screen TV with surround sound. this is a movie that should be required viewing for any aspiring filmmaker or storyteller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review and i thought that it would be appropriate to pick one of my favorite's movies of all time. now, i am a horror movie fan and i think that this is the best horror movie of all time.my reason is this, it is so scary. not only the very obvious fact that it is an innocent little girl that is being mutilated but it is the fact that this is a little girl. the fact that it is an innocent little girl that is targeted.The acting is flawless i think, people may disagree. but this is my opinion. Linda Blair does an excellent job of her character, and i know that some people gave her flak because she didn't do the voice of the devil but she still did a great job.the atmosphere that the director manages to create is astounding. the feeling that they are not alone in the house, this is mainly achieved by the quick shots of the deamons faces that are "blink and you miss it" quick.all in all i think that this movie is a downright classic and even if you don't like horror movie you MUST SEE THIS MOVIE 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, with a film called The Exorcist, you can only assume that it would be some cheesy B movie with a cheesy cast with amateur acting abilities, along with a crappy script. In other words, bound for failure. However, in the case of this classic film, it was a great success and still hailed as the scariest movie of all time. It opens with Max Von Sydow's character at a dig, where he discovers a strange rock. It later goes to Georgetown to Ellen Burstyn's character's townhouse, and develops her character. While watching, you get the distinct feeling that they're specifically trying to push Linda Blair's character with all of the possible cuteness and innocence as they possibly can. Then it brings up this ouija board which they NEVER fully explain, but it's assumed that that's where the demon possessing Regan came from. It goes through different stages of development, but has a relieving ending to it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly the scariest movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With great acting, great music, great special effects for 1973, and a great plot, The Exorcist is by far the scariest movie of all time. Good verses evil is always the best way to scare people, and this classic movie shows it in no other way. The only movie that comes even close to this masterpiece is The Omen. William Friedkin truly captured the horrific evil in this movie, Linda Blair was superb for what she had to go through, Ellen Burstyn was magnificent in capturing a mother's concern and love for her child, and Jason Miller was perfect as the struggling priest who was the only one to get the evil demon out of Reagan. It is a shame that horror movies hardly win or get nominated for the Academy Awards because this, in my mind, is one of the greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>greatest horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To date, the best horror movie ever made...close contenders are night of the living dead and very few others. Both versions of Dawn of the Dead have been picking at me to put them somewhere on my list as well but the stand out has to be The Exorcist. With direction from a wild man who shot a gun on the set to bring out true fear in the actors we have a film that tests the limits of all film audiences. The time of the release was just right to not only offend the viewers with vulgar religious exploitations but to test their minds. The movie didn't use the over done jump scare to frighten the audience. It got to you psychologically. I have no need to mention all the memorable scenes of a little possessed girl. I just want to recommend it to all. Though it may not have the same affect on younger audiences of today, there is still going to be some sting in the back of your mind when your done laughing your fear away. It will be a nervous laugh too. Cheers to me, in hopes to try and compete with the greatest horror movie ever one day by directing a better one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw The Exorcist a few years ago, I thought it was good, but not really scary. Maybe part of the reason for this was that I saw the original version, and not the "Version you've never seen" or maybe it was because since then I have become more religiously aware of myself recently. Well, last weekend, I wanted to give it another try, so I rented the new "version you've never seen" DVD version of it. Well, I just have to say that I think this movie is maybe the scariest movie of all time. I was really spooked after watching it, and I've been thinking about the film a lot since then, invisioning some of the horrifying scenes in my head. I think the added scenes do the film really well, except maybe the added scene at the very end, which is awkward and out of place. The split second flashes of that white demonic face were incredibly effective. Very simple, yet very scary. Also, since the film is longer, it allows more time for character development, and increasing the tension. The sound effects are really well done... Regan's demonic voice, her growls, and the music score are terrific. The scene that shocked/scared me the most, and possibly the scariest scene in movie history, was the spider-walk scene in which Regan walks down the stairs very quickly on all fours and then spews out blood at the bottom of the stairs. VERY disturbing! This brilliant scare, and many other fabulous scenes in the movie, are due to one of the greatest directing performances in movie history. William Friedkin really goes all out in making the film as great as possible. Other scary scenes include the scene where Regan is violently flopping up and down on her bed and then her eyes are blank and she growls and her throat becomes large. And the vomiting scene also was shocking. The atmosphere throughout the whole film was consistently tense and spooky, which is very important in creating a scary movie. Linda Blair's acting is extraordinary considering that she's only 12 years old when the film was made. And, I personally found that the way in which Father Karras gets rid of the devil is perfect. It would have been bad if they exorcised the demon in a normal way. All this adds up to one of the greatest films ever made. Some people may not be scared by the film, but I sure was, and</fullReview>

It is not until late in the movie does not give any clue that Father Merrin had once faced that demon before. The book is much more explanatory, but the same can be said with all books adapted into screenplays. Merrin then travels to a site where there is a statue of the demon Pazuzu.

It is here where the young, sweet Regan McNeil lives with her actress mother Chris McNeil. Unfortunately poor sweet Regan becomes possessed by Pazuzu. That is when Chris seeks the help of skeptical Father Damian Karras. He himself is having problems with his faith. He is torn between having become a priest and living a life of poverty and not having become a highly paid psychiatrist and been able to provide for his old, ailing mother. He reluctantly agrees to see her. These are some of the most memorable scenes. One good example is the famous throw-up scene. It is not until later in the movie, when Father Merrin arrives to perform the exorcism, that the most horrific scenes are shown.

		<fullReview>I saw "The Exorcist" when I was ten years-old, July 3, 1974. Before that I had never heard of demonic possession. Even though I have been a Bible reader (The Book of Revelation) from the age of seven, had never come across any of the accounts in the Gospels of Jesus encountering demoniacs and subsequently casting the demons out. But this night in July of 1974 was a turning point in my life. I was scared, too scared to cry even. It instilled in me an attitude of wanting to overcome evil, and it has been with me ever since to this very day. I watch the movie periodically and I find myself braver and bolder where the devil is concerned every time. I highly recommend the film to everyone. While I am a Christian, I do not hold to the Fundamentalist Evangelical stance on the movie. It is a very deeply spiritual movie exhibiting that good, no matter what the personal cost, does overcome evil. A case in point beyond this motion picture- The Man Jesus Christ, God's Only Begotten Son.</fullReview>

I could never watch this movie alone.I've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in it's original release at the theaters , on its viewers.Incredible masterpiece.... Horrible , psychological stuff scares the pants off me. Then , this movie was remastered with some new things and ....Oh bless their hearts - put back into the theaters for a Halloween release , which I HAD to go and see. I still loved it. I thought the extra parts of the film were decent and interesting. This movie is SO scary - this is the scariest movie I have ever seen in my life! What I just found out last month when i seen the real story behind this film - that really amazed me - was the fact that , - that really creepy voice poor little Regan has when she is possessed is actually , a voice of a woman!!! WHOA! Not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough , but what always got me - was that creepy voice. Best horror film EVER. Nothing can ever be this scary again. Halloween viewing at its evilist. PEACE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of the Milestones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Phantom Of the Opera in the '20's, Frankenstein in the '30's and Psycho in the '60's, THE EXORCIST was one of those must-see, everybody's-talking-about-it rite-of-passage movies (regardless of your age) which, like the earlier ones, actually did send people screaming from the theaters and have them swooning in the aisles (at least the first week it was out). Sure, a lot of it was the hype which approached mass hysteria, but 30-plus years on, this film holds up, due to its sure-footed direction, excellent casting and solid craftsmanship.THE EXORCIST is something of a textbook on story construction, pacing and the art of audience manipulation (in the best sense of the term). It sometimes relies on tricks, but that's okay, because they work. Director William Friedkin cleverly unnerves and agitates the viewer early on with exaggerated and sudden sound effects (phones that ring extraordinarily loudly; medical equipment that blasts the eardrums), and inoculates against unintended humor in later scenes. For example, streams of obscenities unexpectedly bursting forth from a child who has been shown to be almost sickeningly sweet is just the kind of thing that can set an audience to tittering, but Friedkin defuses its shock value with earlier potty-mouth dialogue from Ellen Burstyn and Jack MacGowran, so the audience can get its initial humorous reaction to such things out of its system.Just as with Hitchcock's Psycho, THE EXORCIST demonstrates that an out-and-out shocker needn't necessarily be a second-class film. It's intelligently written, it effectively places the implausible squarely in the context of the real world - employing three-dimensional characters who react believably to events that logic tells them shouldn't be taking place - and the first-rate cast (Burstyn, Cobb, Miller and Von Sydow in particular) delivers performances that demand the entire enterprise be taken seriously. Beyond the "pea soup" and "head-twirling" set-pieces, there is much to appreciate; rich and subtle moments such as Lt. Kinderman's (Cobb) interview with Chris (Burstyn). There are so many emotions boiling beneath her controlled exterior - her daughter's "illness," her friend's death and the realization that the tyke may be responsible for it - while she deals with this nosy and starstruck detective. Watch for Burstyn's understated, but dead-on, reaction when, politely offering another cup of coffee and expecting him to just as politely refuse (and get the hell out of her house), Cobb replies, "Yes, thank you." Her 'oh sh--' expression is priceless.A good portion of today's target demographic, unborn when THE EXORCIST was released, might well find it tame by their standards, even as I, shy of 10 years old, found Frankenstein and The Phantom Of the Opera. I nonetheless loved them and recognized their artistry. Intelligent, sophisticated viewers of today will similarly find themselves appreciative of all this film has to offer (even if they were brought up on ubiquitous CGI and an excess of, well, everything). THE EXORCIST was a landmark of the '70's, which was arguably the last golden era of American film (think Cabaret-Chinatown-Network). But that's a discussion for another time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, where to begin? This is the scariest film ever made, if that kind of thing affects you. For me I don't find this kind of thing scary but I enjoy it a lot. Basicly the book and film can be divided into sections. The intro, the beginning of the happenings, the doctors visits,tests and medication, calling Father Karras in and then the exorcism and finishing up. The book, one of my most read, compares favourably with the film for accuracy and I really think that you should give both a try unless you are particularly squemish. Some say the book/film are only scary if you actually believe in the things they talk about- exorcism, daemons and spirits. Make up your own mind- watch the film NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far the scariest movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is by far the scariest movie i have ever seen! I personally am not scared by any movies but this one has scared me. This movie is about a young girl who is possessed by the devil and this movie has many shocking moments. There is one scene where the girl goes a crab walk backwards down a flight of stairs and that should be enough of a reason to watch it. There is also a scene where the girls head spins 360 degrees the whole way around.While the girl is in her body with the devil she actually carves HELP ME in her stomach from the inside. The movie is filled with enough shocking moments to entertain for its whole length. I would not recommend this for younger audiences. I would warn you that people have fainted during this movie so i recommend it. I give this **** out of **** stars it is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this as a 10-yr old on video, the next 3 months or so, I literally slept in my parents room. All of this because of the demon-child's image wandering in my head. To think of it, I might not watched it alone even nowadays, if it's in the night. A chicken might I am, but the movie itself produce a grandeur feeling of horror. If not physically seen, it always botch the feeling and mental state of viewers. In a word - scary. The sequel (and prequel) just didn't have the wholesome gist of original. Blame me for dramatic,but this movie stood out on its own permanently. A classic and a must possessed (no pun here) title. Now, where's my green pea instant soup?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest horror films of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film does in fact rank as one of the most scariest films of all time. If you watch this film with an open mind it will scare you.This film isn't so much of a horror film outside of the "Exorcism Scene" it is really more psychological than anything else.Linda Blair has once said in an interview for E! Entertainment television "The Exorcist is the type of film that will make you think"During this films initial release back in 1973 it scared the hell out of alot of people when they first saw it. Why did it do this? The ad campaign was brilliant, you didn't really get any clues as to what the film was about other than its title "The Exorcist"If you were to walk in and watch this film without having any prior knowledge of it, it will scare you. I know there are some that aren't bothered by it at all, however I am sure when they thought about it later, it disturbed them some, maybe even caused them to question there own faith.The one thing that angers me, is those people who say they have laughed at the film. Laughing at "The Exorcist" shows ones lack of maturity. If you laughed at that film you obviously didn't understand what was going on at all.The people who have laughed at the masturbation scene offend me, that scene dipicts a desecration of a crucifix and that is no laughing matter, in fact it is disturbing. It's even more disturbing that there are people immature enough to laugh at it. I do not want to condon any age bracket from watching this film although it is a film for the more mature minded individual. If you should view this film with anyone under the age of 18, please use caution.I remember the first time I saw this film, I was a young kid, the film scared the hell out of me, I even had a few nightmares. (All this came about from yes and edited version I saw on the Television back then) I didn't want to see it again for a while.I eventually gained an interest in the film and decided to watch it again, I saw the original version uncut and I liked it, it didn't scare me like it did when I was a kid, however it did and still does disturb me sometimes. The 2000 re-release "The Version you've never seen" provided some added chills with some of the re-instated footage deleted from the original and some rather fast sequences of the demon face that occur rather quickly.The actual Exorcism scene doesn't bother me anymore, in fact none of the Reagan Demon scenes really bother me anymore, the masturbation scene will always be disturbing. The restored "Spiderwalk sequence" was a nice little scene added for shock value, it shocked me.This film is purely psychological and you might feel yourself shake a little bit when you think about later even if it doesn't bother you during the viewing. This film may not get the same reaction today that it did back in 1973 but it still has the power to make you think. Very few films that are made today have the power to creep inside our minds like this one does.Sit back and watch this film again sometime. here is a dare for you: "If you think you are man enough or woman enough I dare you to sit through this movie with the lights out, I bet you can't, then again one nevers knows today."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall view on one of the most electrifying horror flicks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I seen this movie was back in 1973. Some how I managed to get into this super super scary movie. At that time "R" rated flicks were very difficult to get in. "The Exorcists" seemed like it should have been deemed NC-17. At 7 years old the thrill of the fright was all I could be concerned with so the plot was way beyond me. Thirty one years later, "The Beginning (2004)" spiked my curiosity to revisit the re-released version of "The Exorcists", but this time I paid attention to the plot and ignored the scare, a very hard thing to do.The movie started out with a scene of an archaeological dig located in northern IRAQ. Here, a priest/archaeologists (Father Lankester Merrin) discovers an idol which unleashes the evil wrath of pazuzu. Father Merrin duels with pazuzu and exorcises its evil, but has a premonition that he would have to meet up with this evil force in the future.Pazuzu's evil force follows Father Merrin's return to the United States and manifests itself in a twelve year old girl (Reagan) played by Linda Blair. Reagan's mother (Chris), Father Damien Karras, and the church decides to pursue exorcism and calls upon Father Merrin since he is viewed by the Catholic church as the best qualified to perform an exorcists; and so, the duel between good and evil once again is revisited.This movie is laced with many interesting subliminal motifs, which I found to be very creative. I can really appreciate this effort from director William Friedkin given the fact that early 70's film making had not yet been introduced to the technological advantages of special effects. In my opinion however, the power of suggestion will always out-weigh special effects in terms of a film putting "the scare" into its audiences. Case and point -"Blair Witch Project". Watch the director's notes to learn about these motifs and some other interesting tidbits about Mosul and U.S./Iraq relationships during the early 70's.Wes Saldua</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt, it's a well made first class horror film, but not only that. Von Sidove is the true hero here, assisted by the younger priest.He faces an old arch enemy of his, the Satan , for the last showdown of good vs. evil.The effects used are excellent.&lt;&lt;Spoiler&gt;&gt;: At the end the girl is escorted to the cab by her mother who tells the priest:"she remembers nothing"--"good" he retorts. But the girl suddenly turns back and gratefully kisses the priest's cheek as to let know, that she unconsciously ,at least , must thank him. And one more detail, Lee J. Cobb here, portrays the "earthly" and helpless hand of the law- takes his new friend by the arm in a picture shot at the same angel as in Casablanca's last scene and they both fade away like H.B and Claud Reinnes......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People just can't appreciate subtlety these days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It never ceases to amaze me that nothing seems to scare people these days unless it involves loads of gore and is blunt and in your face. The Exorcist is an amazing movie and one of the main reasons for this is the subtlety and depth that exudes right through the movie. The tension is built up to breaking point several times during the movie and it is the unexpected explosion of tension that provides the chill. The depth of character progression and the subtle subplots (most people see the main Good v Evil plot, however the controversy surrounding ritalin [sp?], the issues of faith, the tensions of bringing up kids for a single parent, the sacrifice at the end, the science v alternative treatment argument etc) give great depth that is rarely seen in the Horror/Thriller scene. All of the characters are fully realized and give a level of reality to the movie that is missing in many films. It is the realism of the film that helps to drive the horror home, as opposed to excessive gore.The quality of the film is also bought out in the intricacy of the visuals and the amazing soundscape that William Friedkin has been able to portray. The contrast of light and dark and extreme noise and extreme silence is amazing. The subtle overlay of the "devil" images at certain times of the film are very effectively used and utter silence at times is used like no other film I have seen to great effect. And how can you not go past Mike Oldfields Tubular Bells for a great atmospheric lead in. I think that I was most impressed by the overall atmosphere when I first saw the movie (and that was only last year when I saw it 4 years ago at the re-release). I don't think that this film loses anything 31 years on, I think that the amount of discussion that it has raised since it was first released (both positive and negative) shows that it is a movie that has been very effective and can be called a classic in its own right.I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it when it first came out and the lines went around the block. The audience was frightened and horrified. I never laughed so hard in my life. The effects were silly: throwing up pea soup on a priest, having the girl's head spin around in a 180-degree turn and the filthy words she spews out at the priest. It was sheer satire. I'm unclear how the other reviewers found it to be a great horror film. Linda Blair's transformation from a sweet, little girl to a ridiculous demon isn't frightening because it's too inane. The Saturday Night Live parody was even funnier. The only people I know who were truly scared were devout Catholics who believed this could happen. "The spirit of Christ commands you!" Very entertaining!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No movie has ever disturbed me quite like this one. When I say disturbed I don't mean upsetting, but more like, once you see it you will be haunted by it for years to come. No horror movie has come close as far as acting, suspense, direction, and genuine terror partly because most don't take themselves seriously like this one did. This movie was made over 30 years ago and still has the same shock value that it did then ( without hardly any gore ). Even if you're not a fan of demonic possession flicks (although this is the one that started it all) you have to at least appreciate the psychological tension and general uneasiness this film gives off, long after you've seen it. Even the score (Tubular Bells, I think) is haunting. You will not disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always liked this movie, ever since the first time I saw it when I was about 9, and even more so since I saw the uncut version. It's rare for me to be really scared watching horror movies, even by myself, but that spider-walk scared the sh!t out of me, and I was watching it with friends. One of them jumped at least two feet in the air, and he was laying down on the couch. All the actors are absolutely fantastic, especially Linda Blair. Her performance still astounds me. She was so young when it was filmed, but she did such a great job. All in all, a great movie. Some parts may be a little gruesome for a few viewers, but it's a classic. It is definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The exorcist is the best movie of all time. It has the perfect blend of thrill &amp; chill. I watch it on a regular basis and it still scares me sometimes. My favorite scene is the spider walk. It still gives me chills.But I feel bad for the cast because they went crazy after they made the movie, especially Linda Blair. She was only 13. It must have caused a lot of problems and nightmares. But I guess all that counseling did some good. I haven't seen the Exorcist 2 yet. I can't find it. I think there's 5 Exorcists. This is a very good movie. But I can't shake 1 thought out of my head, this was supposedly really happened, but to a boy. I asked my dad if believed it, he said no. But if it never really happened, then why was the preist that Exorcised him sworn to secercy????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie from Blockbuster, hoping it would give me a good scare, just like what my parents told me. I watched the whole thing, and I can tell this movie was dated for me (I am 18). The only part that I considered scary is the ending when the two priests try to exorcise the young girl. There was a lot of profanity, and a lot of gross parts, like when she does dirty things with a cross, and when she constantly threw up on everybody. The movie was pretty weird by the facts that the room was cold when she was in her bed, and the room shakes and things blowing around the room when she is in a rage. As a Roman Catholic, I knew priests used to do exorcists, it is a shame they are not performed anymore. They can at least be a form of entertainment, like hypnosis. I still recommend everyone to see this great movie.</fullReview>

It's a shame that it isn't in the top 10 horror movies but it's almost there. Please add your vote.. but back to the movie. We look at horror movies today more as action movies. Going back to the days of movies like the exorcist, they simply dominate over movies like "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer"... which by the way is probably the stupidest name for a horror movie ever. 10 out of 10. It's too sad that the big budget producers at WB are saying that Paul Schrader's version of The Prequel to the Exorcist, wasnt "gory enough". Which shows what the Producers think of young people today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of horror movies since I was 8 years old. I saw the Exorcist for the first time when I was 10. Being that young I don't think I was able to comprehend all the mind f*cks in the movie. So the only thing I understood was the gore. Believe it or not it didn't scare me. The second time I watched it I was 14. I understood it better and it scared the sh*t out of me. After that I did not watch it again for a long time. But today it is apart of my movie collection and is my favorite horror movie. Very few movies can have almost the same affect on you as the first or second time you see it. Although the Exorcist still does scare me it doesn't scare me to the point that I can't watch it. When the re-released version came to theatres I remember driving all over town trying to find a theatre that was showing it. Why they didn't include the spider walk scene in the original is beyond me. I just wish they would have showed the girl kill that guy before the spider walk scene. To anybody who is contemplating seeing this movie, remember that it all depends on what you bring into it. I not trying to plagerize the author but if you see it with the mentality that this is a f*cked up world, you'll think that even more after the movie. But if you feel that although evil exists but good can overcome, the movie will also rienforce that. To sum up, if you like horror flicks see this movie. But be sure to exercise extreme caution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Terrifying *possible spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 10 years old when I saw the Exorcist for the first time. I couldn't sleep for weeks and was even afraid to go from one room to another at night.It was probably the most terrifying experience ever. I later grew up to liking horror movies and enjoying them. But it wasn't until 4 years ago that a friend of mine lent me the movie to see it again (after 15 years). The thing that I did not expect was the effect the movie still had on me. The eerie scenes, the atmosphere, the music ,and the cast, again delivered the best horror movie. One of the scenes which I recall very well is when her neck turns 180 degrees and starts speaking in a hoarse voice. The actors were all in top form, especially the little girl. The thing about this movie isn't the gory imagery or the monsters in it.Its the psychological effect that the demon has on the characters especially when trying to burden them with guilt. This caused confusion as well as weakness for the priest. Another aspect of it is that ,it is also a test of faith. There were movies which frightened me as a teenager but when I see them now, they cause so little or almost no effect. While "The Exorcist" still retains the mystic and eerie spine tingling atmosphere which among the years none has surpassed. The movie is a definite must for all the horror fans being one of the best horror movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen (1973/2000)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies lose their effect with age: while they might have been shocking upon first release, thirty years later they could seem relatively tame. But the re-release of William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist (1973) firmly proves that this is NOT such a movie. Now carrying the tag "The Version You've Never Seen," the 27th anniversary version of William Friedkin's seminal film (with added footage and a new surround mix) is as horrifying and disturbing as ever -- and I mean that in a good way. While it is still best known for the taboos it broke (i.e. a possessed girl urinating in the living room, vomiting pea soup, and -- most infamously -- doing inappropriate things with a crucifix), the most powerful aspects of the film are in fact its compelling story and unforgettable characters. The story -- adapted by Blatty from his best-selling novel -- is essentially about a 12-year-old girl who begins to show strange behavior and ends up having an exorcism to remove the demon that is possessing her. But when you consider the picture as a whole, this part of the plot is really rather minimal: most of the film revolves around Father Karras (played indelibly by Jason Miller in his debut performance), a psychological counselor dealing with the guilt of his mother's sudden passing. When he is introduced to Chris MacNeill (Ellen Burstyn), he sees an opportunity for redemption in her possessed daughter Regan (Linda Blair in a role that determined -- and, in a way, ruined -- her acting career). Max Von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb play the other two principal parts -- respectively, a priest and a detective -- and in the end, all of the characters collide in a conclusion that still manages to shock and amaze us. And let us not forget Jack MacGowran (whose eerie death during the film's production is still the cause of speculation), who delivers his most memorable role as Burstyn's drunken friend. The Exorcist is one of those films that seems more and more perfect as time goes by: the screenplay, the direction, the editing, and that haunting music ... it all adds up to what is quite easily one of the best American movies ever made. Friedkin (who was notorious for having treated the cast of the movie as cattle) manages to draw top-notch performances from each actor, creating a mood of dread and tension unparalleled since Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. Every minor detail (keep your eyes peeled for the subliminal devil images) just makes it increasingly flawless, and it is made even moreso with its new additions: the extra scenes (the most important one being Regan's "spider-walk" down the staircase) actually add something to the movie, giving the characters and story greater depth and development. But the greatest supplement is surely the remastered soundtrack, which is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital EX, making the film even MORE intense than it was to begin with. The Exorcist was an unexpected success in 1973 (garnering 10 Academy Award nominations, including the coveted Best Picture), and hopefully it will be just as potent with this re-release. As a new generation discovers the images that have haunted the rest of our dreams for the past three decades, let's pray that it will last yet another thirty years ... and then some. The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen marks the resurrection of a true classic.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All time greatest horror film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Voted "The scariest movie of all time" by movie critics worldwide, and numerous film institutes, and also banned by bible thumper Billy Graham who declares there is an actual demon in the films celluloid, this shocking horror movie based on the novel by William Peter Blatty made waves in the seventies causing loads of controversy with audiences, religious organizations, and even spawned a mystery when strange accidents began occurring throughout the filming. This tells the story of young Reagan Macneil, a beautiful little girl who lives with her single struggling actress mother. The two have lost faith in life and god until weird incidents start to occur within their house and young Reagan's personality begins to rapidly change when she begins muttering Latin and becomes increasingly violent. Desperate, Reagan's mother seeks out the help of a young priest who has also lost faith in god due to a hard life, and along with an experienced old winded reverend, who has finished a hard battle with the devil years before, the two will attempt to discover if Reagan is possessed by the devil and battle for her soul and their sanity. Shocking, terrifying, and aggressively character driven, this is arguably the greatest horror movie of all time by horror fans. With the incredible dark direction from William Friedkin, he supplies an incredibly scary horror movie which was boycotted by religious groups in the seventies. The movie takes its time by introducing the likable vulnerable characters slowly and develops the plot with ease making way for the shocking finale which will literally put chills down the viewers spines. There are some rather incredible special effects that were ahead of its time and rather influential being used again and again in latter day horror flicks. There are a lot of memorable scenes in the film including when Reagan is floating from her bed, the scene where her head spins, and the infamous vomit sequence. This spawned two sequels, and inspired much research into the occult, this is an excellent film and as a hardcore horror fan, this is my all time favorite horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only movie that ever scared me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I was young when it came on TV for the first time. But seriously, this movie scared the living daylights outta me. Even now it is severly freaky. The director's cut (saw it in 2003 I think) was just as good.The only other movie(s) that give me something of the same feeling are The Omen (I and II... III wasn't bad but it wasn't the same thing). Something about the Catholic religion, the devil, and little freaky kids is just a wild mix I suppose. Dunno. Maybe cuz it was when I was a kid that I was religious enough to really believe in that sort of thing. Regardless, I give the exorcist a 10 outta 10 for being the only movie that really scared the dog outta me.</fullReview>

It's a great movie for that time I do great impressions of possessed Regan, like In her demonic voice: "Until her body lies stinkin' in the earth!" "In Time, In Time!" When they poured holy water on her she's like, "AAAAAAAAAAAH! IT BURNS! IT BURNS!" And her voice kind of changed just a few seconds</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My All-Time Favorite Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was about 7 years old, but only because my older cousin was too afraid to watch it himself. So me and my cousin Monique laid on the floor with a blanket over our heads and just peeked at the screen periodically. The little bit I heard and saw was enough to scare me so bad, I could barely walk or talk afterwards.Flash forward years later and this move holds a special place in my heart as my all-time fave of all. It's the type of thriller that stays with you long after you've viewed it. What makes the movie so effective are the intense audio, the weird buzzing sounds, the crackling noises, the demon's hideous voice, the subtle subliminal messages, the piercing eyes and the realism of the film. As a child, I thought this could happen to me. The film takes the subject matter very seriously and it has a psychological effect on the viewer whether you are religious or not.I read the book years ago and it is far scarier and left me afraid to turn off the lights.Still a classic, it's best viewed with the lights off and in total quiet</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people have critised this movie for the fact that it isn't scary. This was due to the hype and, like The Blair Witch Project, didn't deliver to the people that were expecting to s*** themselves. This film is a matter of taste. I'm still waiting for a horror movie to scare everyone but until that day i will tell my own opinion of this film.Contrary to what most people think i believe this is one of the scariest films i have ever seen. And i was watching it with company. The hype had the oposite effect on my. With my friends telling me that it wasn't scary caused me not to expect much but BOY was i wrong.But the sheer disturbing and terrifying nature of this film is not what makes it great. This is proof that William Friedkin used to know how to make a good movie. The acting is superb (Linda Blair giving a genuinly horrific performance), the script is very well written and the whole look of the film gives shivers down your spine.I have only seen the uncut version and i think in seeing the cut version i would have been a little dissapointed. Everything works in this film and the build up racks on the tension as the deamon slowly takes over Ragan (Also see my review of The Thing). The crucifix masterbation scene is gut wrenching whilst the actual exorcism itself is brilliantly done, with both priests oozing exhaustion from every pour.I still can't watch the "infamous" Spider Walk sequence. This is because of how purely unnatural Ragan looks crawling down the stairs upside down. If you have the DVD version then pause frame for frame whenever the deamon's face appears and see how hidious and scary it looks. Just thinking about it still makes me judder.This is a movie that plays on the audience's fears and it works all the better for it. This is one of the few horror movies that knows how to scare people and it does so with an uneasy effect. I'm sure people have had many sleepless nights over this film and that wouldn't surprise me in the slightest.It is a film that can be watched over and over again without getting tired of it. The scare factor does eventually die down after repeated viewing but no matter who you are, you can't deny that after the umpteenth time of watching it still gives an uneasy feeling inside.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film miscategorized in the horror genre. The Exorcist (1973) is primarily about redemption, much like Return of the Jedi (1983) (ROTJ deals with a son's forgiveness for the sins of the father, whilst The Exorcist deals with a son forgiving himself.) However, unlike ROTJ, this film is a beautiful work of cinematography and acting, albeit it suffers from a plodding storyline filmed with seemingly irrelevant characters and misused special effects. The theme of Psychology is nicely reinforced with the near-subliminal superimposed demonic faces and imagery. Otherwise, the levitation, telekinesis and airborne bodily fluids, are absolutely unnecessary. It ends with much catharsis by generating more questions than it sets out to resolve, which can often be a wonderful springboard for discussion and analysis.I watched this film alone in the dark at 11pm last night and did not receive so much as a shiver from it. I will concede that my sleep was disturbed by it later, though. This film cannot be the scariest of all time however, because of the existence of Seven and The Ring (or Ringu). Hell, even the almost B-movie, The Gift, had more shock value.This is a fairly good film, critically, but I fail to see why it should hold up as a popular form of viewing entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, where do you start with a movie with as much hype as this one has? I still remember the trading of pirated copies being passed around my 6th form common room and the talk of how this film sent people crazy but in all honesty if you think its gonna make you jump out of your skin or scare you in a conventional "Scream"/"Halloween"/"Friday 13th" kinda way then you will be disappointed by this film.What this film does, almost uniquely, is scare you more after its actually finished. It plays on your mind and leaves you feeling unnerved and unsure for days (and nights) after.The film itself is a masterpiece and there is no denying it. There are exceptional performances from all of the major roles, with Linda Blair stealing the show for her surprisingly convincing portrayal of Regan. The scenery and musical score only add atmosphere and tension to Friedkin's masterpiece which still today has an unnatural edge to it. But what makes this film stand above most is its use of light and dark. Its simple yet powerful use of lighting gives it an eerie raw quality not seen since the days of Boris Karloff.My recommendation to anyone watching this is to watch it once, then watch a "making of" documentary and then watch the film again. Only then will you truly appreciate how great a film this is. What Friedkin put his cast through is almost as disturbing as the film itself but the outcome is what makes The Exorcist simply one of the greatest horror movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moved from another accountConsidered by many to be the scariest movie ever made i'd have to say i disagree, although i do like it. In typical supernatural horror fashion its a slow builder, but the use of Mike Oldfield's 'Tubular Bells' helps enhance the dark atmosphere. It is easy to see why this was banned for so many years, the crucifix stabbing scene is disturbing enough. One problem i have with this film, however, is towards the end when 'Regan' is hurling obscenities at the priests. 'Your mother sucks c**ks in hell' didn't really seem necessary for me, it fails to add to the suspense.Otherwise though 'The Exorcist' is a very disturbing horror film, which is made all the more scary because the devil is inside a 12 year old girl. Much like the effect 'The Omen' has, it is more disturbing when a child is the evil character. All in all a classic of the horror genre that has aged relatively well. One only has to compare this with 'Stigmata' to see that it has not been left very far behind even 30 years after it's release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American cinematic masterpiece!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The exorcist" is still "the" only movie that stirs my mind and faith. What is so hypnotizing about this movie is that it addresses a basic element. Life and death. It makes you shutter , will this happen to me if I lose my faith. Religion has always been a very controversial issue. Faith is about the unknown. No one knows for sure. What 's so scary in this movie is that it is so visual and descriptive. Chris McNeil, the mother , states to the priest, I'm not very religious. Well, who is? Nobody ever knows whether they have enough faith. This movie questions that premise.This movie is about the unknown which comes to life on thescreen in color. I'm a classic movie buff. I love old movies. The reasoning being they actors/actresses were better and better trained. Today, all you need are good looks and $. But actors back in the day came up through the ranks. Some were actually rougherr in real life.But they were real people that you could relate to.Just name all the greats: Clark Gable, Betty Davis, Kirk Douglas, Charles Bronson, John Garfield, Susan Hayward, Humphrey Bogart, James Dean, Marlon Brando, Paul Newman,George C. Scott, Clint Eastwood , etc., etc., etc...... These were classic actors.!!! The movie "The Exorcist" was directed by William Freidkin. He also directed one of my top five movies "The French Connection." Friedkin is a true cinematic artist. Very gritty and documentary type movies. In making this movie, in order to make it believable, all the angles were covered to make this a superb crime drama(not horror movie) as it occurred. Top notch cinematography, top notch actors/actresses, top notch soundtrack, top notch screenplay, top notch special effects.It always amazes me when people say they laugh during the movie. There is nothing funny about the issues addressed in the "Exorcist". Anyone that laughs during this movie is (A.) not very spiritual or (B). too immature to understand the implications of the movie.There will never be another movie like the Exorcist! EVER! Simply because making movies is no longer an art form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though they are showing the Exorcist on cable now like crazy,"The old version", and they have since put the film out in theatres with about 20 missing minutes, and stuck DVD's and VHS tape on the shelves to appeal to the so called "youth" of today- They have done nothing but cause a laugh riot with everyone.I believe the film should have been left alone-just like the people who died on the Titanic- that should have never been sensationalized either.I can remember the day the Exorcist came to my neighborhood and I was with my best friend and it scared the hell out of us in 1973- I can remember it like it was yesterday-and it was very real. It is a big shame that they just can't leave things alone-the classics will now be put on DVD and have stuff added and subtracted and changed and kids today will not know the true meaning of what it was like to sit in that theatre on a hot summer day in 1973 and see the Exorcist and not be able to sleep for 3 days, or see Jaws for the first time and never go in the water for a whole year. These films shouldnot ever be laughed at. They will be here forever, long after my generation and the next generation is gone. But-there are those I have talked to recently- Aged 25 and under that said that they could not see anything that great about the Godfather.My point has been proven. The good films should be left alone. And treated holy and with respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** out of **** (excellent)Possibly the scariest movie of all time, this film when released, was extremely controversial, and even sent a woman into early labour (!). After discovering a witchboard in her basement, Regan (Linda Blair) becomes possessed by a demon hidden inside the spirit she contacted. Now, her mother must call in two priests and a detective to help aid Regan of the evil inside. Although not as effective as it was then, it still does manage to send a few chills down my spine everytime I watch it. Excellent acting, excellent directing and excellent script. Very detailed and accurate relgious aspects as well. "The Exorcist" is a classic for its time...and always will be.Rated R for Violence, Profanity and a Scene of Violent Masturbation</fullReview>

Even though most people don't care for it because of it's content, I like it because it gives off the message that the devil can't win over God. this is such an amazing piece of work. now, the first sequel to it was okay because Linda Blair was in it but they shouldn't even had messed with making a third. seriously, that one sucked!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and then again I might be obsessed with this movie. All i can say is that I'm 36 years old and will not watch this movie alone or at night. still, i maintain that it is my "favorite" horror film and the scariest movie i've ever seen. i first viewed this film when I was 12 years old and it was "taboo". I watched it at my best friend's house for the first time (on BETA no less) and found the sensationalism to be over the top. it was "cool" to be watching this film knowing that my parents would kill me if i asked them "can I watch THE EXORCIST"?? Years later I studied film at a liberal arts school and had the opportunity to actually discuss this movie with my peers, and from that day I found a new respect for just how frightening this movie is. and I'm not even Catholic. It's now the subtle things that make this movie so frightening--Reagan when she is being hypnotized and looks up at the doctor....the night she kills Burke Dennings and we can see her floating in her window (bet you didn't notice that one before!!...and the conversation that Karras and Merrin have together in THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN about what it means for us to despair. I'm now reading the book for the fourth time. Like I said, I might be obsessed with this movie, but anyone who can honestly say this movie didn't scare them....well, perhaps then you aren't afraid of anything. and for that I commend you, because this movie really stays in my head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie again for about the 6th time in my life. I was three when this movie came out, so I saw it when I was a teenager for the first time, on TV. It was so creepy, that I looked under my bed, before I went to sleep. My imagination went so far, that I thought there was something coming... Later, I let my sister scream with this movie, when it came again on TV. I was laughing, although it gave me chills still... At the age of 33, I find this movie one of the most sticky movies I've ever seen. And it still give me chills. I think the acting is so brilliant, so perfect, like in the real world, with very strong acting by Linda Blair, Max von Sydow and the guy who played the investigator Kindermann. I gave it a ten out of ten, because of everything that's in the movie. It's by far the best horror picture I've ever seen. And the music tinkles in my ears, like something wrong is going to happen. The rest of the Exorcists have failed to give this jewel a worthy follow up.If you're in for a good scary movie, well I definitely can recommend you this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>back in 1973, the exorcist had a profound effect on it's audience. people fleeing from screens to be sick. people claiming sleep depravation through reacurring nightmares from the film. people leaving the cinema because they were just too darn scared. so as a teenager living in britain. i became rather angry with the fact that it was a banned film over here. i read the book, but really wanted to see the film. it became a desire to do so. i finally got my chance when it became available back in 1999. and i was disappointed. on first viewing. my hype just blew the film up in my face. but on repeated viewings, it's got better and better. first things first. it's not the scariest film ever made. maybe back in the day. but now, it's too dated to be shocking and daring. we've seen things far worse in other movies. it is chilling though. the sounds effect of regan in the room, cursing and screaming are bone shaking at best. at worst, they are disturbing.but thats all really. a great piece of film. with brilliant performances. even from linda blair as the child. before she becomes the demon, she gives a highly realistic childlike show. the mystery heightens as it builds to it's climax, and it's gripping. only letting go during the slightly lame final scenes with the priests.but what film doesnt have minor flaws. they are minor. and do not detract from the in your face cinema experience that this film provides</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror films these days aren't interesting, all there is, is a guy with a mechede chasing after you trying to kill you. To many kills these days, and no scares is what I'm trying to point out. These days no horror films scare me at all, you have Jason Vorhees, and Freddy Krueger, they don't scare me, because in the movie they don't bring anything to reality. Instead this film brings the fact that you could get possessed by the devil to reality. It makes you think: "Oh my gosh what if this happened to me," which never happens anymore. Another wonderful thing about this film is that it remains a commercially succesful film while also showing an interesting plot, and story. Everybody's acting, and actressing is fantastic in here. I couldn't believe that Linda Blair was actually playing the role, a little girl playing an evil spirit trapped inside of a body. I know the voices of her weren't real, but her, the faces, lip talking. The special effects were fantastic, they really make William Peter Blatty's novel come alive. I saw The Sting, and I thought this was much better than that, it kept you entertained, while The Sting was constantly boring. I'm not saying this should've won Best Picture, because to tell you the truth horror films aren't the academies style. While I'm a big fan of horror films, I know what's scary, and what isn't, and this is the ultimate scare. If you aren't a big fan of the horror film genre forget seing this because this is truly for horror film lovers. This movie should be looked back at horror films to come. Four Star movie, see this right away if you haven't, and you love horror films, but be prepared for a scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that scary ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure that when THE EXORCIST came out in 1973, it was a pretty scary movie. But, in my opinion, it does not stand the test of time.As everyone knows, THE EXORCIST is about a little girl named Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) who becomes possessed by the devil, and how it affects her and her mother Chris (Ellen Burstyn). Now, as frightening as that thought is, the movie is still not very scary. Things such as thick pea soup standing as vomit seem almost laughable by today's standards. There are those few classic scenes though--the head-turning, the exorcism, and the death of Father Merrin (Max von Sydow)--that remain timeless and brilliant. And, in the newer version, the spider-walk sequence, which certainly stands out in my mind. But other than that, there's not much to say as far as scare factor goes.However, that's not to say that it isn't a good movie. A movie doesn't have to be scary to be good (however, it being a horror movie, that's kind of the expectation). The acting, plotline, and characters are remarkable, and the makeup used on Linda Blair when Regan is possessed is exceptional. Those things make the movie pretty believable, and when you think about it, if this were to happen, you'd be scared s***less.This is the classic horror movie that will always hold a high place in the world of movies, even though to some (like me), it might have lost its scariness. Still, though, a very good movie. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, the consequences are terrible and they're shown through this movie. THE EXORCIST is simply excellent, and has to be the scariest movie of all time. No kidding. If you watch this movie objectively and knowing that the devil exists well you will have a frightening experience.The plot is complex to understand. A 12 year old girl (Reagan) plays the Ouija Board invoking the spirit of a demon that uses the nickname "Captain Howdy". This demon is known as Pazzuzu. Let's not get into details about this "Captain Howdy".Reagan soon gets possessed by this demon, but little she knows that her soul is in risk. Reagan's mother is desperate because her little daughter has been examined by many doctors and they just can't find an answer to her conduct. Convinced that her daughter has been possessed by an evil spirit, Reagan's mother asks the help of the young Father Karras keeping the faith that the priest is going to exorcise her daugher. After meeting the possessed girl, and filling the requisites of the Church in order to "declare" the girl as possessed, Father Karras realizes that an exorcism has to be practiced immediately. But he cannot perform it alone, so he asks the help of Father Merrin, a veteran priest that performed an exorcism years ago in Africa.Both priests will risk their lifes in a battle with the devil, a battle which purpose is to free the spirit of an innocent girl.This movie is shocking, and I mean shocking because it's based on a real situation... Think about this for a second: would you dare to play the ouija knowing that maybe you could invoke an evil spirit? Do you believe in the devil? ... If your answer is yes, watch the exorcist and have a good scare.The excelent acting by Max Von Sydox, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, and Linda Blair deserves a big recognition. Burstyn, Blair, and Miller were nominated for an Academy Award for their acting. The direction is simply masterful, Friedklin gets the feeling of evil and he portrays it with his camera. The scary music and the F/X are awesome for it's time. The scene where Father Merrin arrives to Reagan's house is one of the most memorable moments in cinematic history. Overall, this movie holds with dignity it's title of the MOST SCARIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. It's a shame it didn't win Best Picture in 1974.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film of the 1970s, the best horror movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert William Friedkin's The Exorcist is perhaps the greatest horror movie ever made, and not simply because it is scary. Don't get me wrong, it is scary; but it is also challenging on a political, religious, and even philosophical level. The movie makes no apologizes for what it does. I have a feeling that if it had been made today, it wouldn't have been able to receive an R rating.The opening scene of The Exorcist takes place in Iraq, and when I saw the film as a young teenager, I was puzzled as to what the significance was of opening the film there. The Iraq scene lets the viewer know that they are about to witness a film that is about good versus evil. The opening has very little dialogue, but we are able to sense the presence of evil because of the behavior of the characters, and the images we are shown.The rest of the film takes place in Georgetown, an area of Washington, D.C. The camera goes through the town, and right into the home of Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn). Chris is a wealthy film actress who lives a pleasant life with her 12-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair). Regan is an only child, and Chris is a single mother. Although we may think so in the beginning, the McNeils are not the only main characters. The story revolves in great detail around Father Karras (Jason Miller), a Catholic priest who is losing his faith. Karras's life is mostly unhappy, especially since he spends a lot of time taking care of his mentally ill mother.The changes that occur happen unexpectedly. One night while Chris is having a party, Regan gets the attention of all the guests by urinating in front of them. This is not the kind of behavior that Regan usually displays, but we begin to wonder if the behavior is being caused by Regan when her bed mysteriously begins to shake and jump by itself. Of course, Chris's first thought is to take her to see a doctor. All the necessary tests are run on Regan's brain, and not a problem is found. At home, though, things are getting worse.Regan's body has been possessed by Satan himself. Eventually, her voice becomes raspy, her face darkens in color, and her eyes change to an evil green. She begins using the foulest of language, and is violent towards anyone who enters her room. Chris is not a person who believes in religion, but she wonders if she should ask the church for help, since the doctors are still convinced that Regan's problems are psychological. Chris meets with Father Karras, who is familiar with demonic possession, but does not think he can help her, since his faith is low.Karras tells Chris about an old Catholic ritual called an exorcism, which was used to drive Satan away from the body he was possessing. Karras thinks it is worth a try, but not from him. The church recruits Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow), a priest who can do the job to its fullest potential. The last half hour of the film is the exorcism, and it is the most powerful and disturbing portion of The Exorcist, because we don't know if good will triumph.A lot has been said about the religion in the film. The Exorcist was released in 1973, which was a time when church attendance was at an all time low in America. What better way to help restore faith than with a movie that realistically shows the power of Christianity? We see the disappearance of religion in the scenes with the doctors, who have replaced religion with modern medicine and science. There is another theme in the film that is as obvious as the one of good versus evil. The Exorcist is trying to tell us that men are better than women. I know, it sounds crazy, but hear me out.The movie opened during a period when women's rights were a very hot issue. Gloria Steinem was speaking out for feminism, and women were starting to show more independence. In The Exorcist, Chris is a raising a child without a father. She engages in a lot of acts of sin, such as smoking, drinking, and using the Lord's name in vain. She has a short haircut, which was not traditional for women during the early '70's. More signs of the inferiority of women arise when Regan becomes possessed. The Exorcist is based supposedly on true story, but in the real event, the possession happened to a young boy, not a young girl.When Regan is possessed, we see her commit several violent acts. There is a shocking scene where she grabs a man's crotch in an attempt to tear it off. Later, in the movie's most controversial and scary scene (which would not have been able to stay in the film if it had been made today), Regan masturbates with a crucifix. What do these scenes suggest? The first one notes that a woman's main goal is to destroy men (hence why she was grabbing the crotch). The second scene is saying that women see religion as nothing more than a hoax, which is displayed when Regan stabs herself with the crucifix.There is another clue of women inferiority in the scenes involving Father Karras's mother. After she dies, he has a dream that she is walking down a dark stairway, which we assume leads to Hell. There is a scene near the end of the film where Karras sees his mother's face on Regan's, and later, sees her sitting in Regan's bed. The scenes with Karras's mother and Regan's possession suggest not only that women are lesser than men, but also that they are evil and corrupt.The Exorcist is an observant film. It delivers a realistic story, and displays some of the most disturbing images ever put on screen. Unlike a routine horror film, it contains ideas. Even if we don't agree with everything it is trying to say, we can still appreciate the exploration of the ideas. The film is flawlessly directed by William Friedkin, who uses camera techniques that would have pleased Hitchcock. Every performance is superb, but Linda Blair's stands out above all. I have never seen a child actor show emotional intensity the way she does here. Forget Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense; this is a child performance that takes real risks.The Exorcist is the kind of movie that keeps its impact over time. It is more frightening and appalling than most of today's movies, because it was made during a time when filmmakers could get away with more. It is a masterpiece of genuine terror and spiritual fulfillment. It contains ideas that reflect the decade during which it was made. The Exorcist is what making movies is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The king of horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 30 some odd years, this movie still has the power to shock. I consider it to be the king of horror films. Just watching Ellen Burstyn trying to come to grips with what is happening to her daughter is spellbinding. This movie has aged well (almost all of it; the clothes and hairstyles are atrocious). Linda Blair's performance is splendid; unfortunately for her "The Exorcist" was her only hit movie. Jason Miller (may he rest in peace) portrays Father Karras with sincerity. Max Von Sydow's makeup was outstanding (some people probably thought he was that old).This film however is not for the faint of heart. It contains graphic scenes (the brain test, the crucifix masturbation) and plenty of blue language. The 2000 "souped-up" version was unnecessary (the only worthwhile addition was the spider walk). I'm just happy that when this came out on DVD, both versions were made available; I stuck with the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist wasn't scary, but it is still a good movie. My favorite part is the spider-walk that Regan does down the steps. I know all the tricks that they did to acheive that scene, and how other good stuff was done. This scene was done using a contortionist named Linda R. Hager. In the original version of the scene, she comes down slower, and there are shots where you see a front view of it, and the belt is visible. She then turns over completely and is in crawling position. Her tongue goes in and out of her mouth like a snake, and she chases Sharon around the room, only to be tackled down by her mother. I can't decide which version of the scene I like better, though. If you haven't seen it, you have to, because it is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film! (Spoiler alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know what everybody thinks. Regardless of its age or controversy, the Exorcist stands to be one of the most stellar constructed films of our time. This 1973 movie has not lost much appeal since its release. Perhaps because the content makes it such a unique work of art, people are always talking about it. Inspired by such popular themes of Good v. Evil; Religious Sacrifice; and the triumph of the holy, the creators have put together something people have never seen before, and still is very rare in modern filmdom. It is easy to believe that the plot was conceived by an ill-minded, sick, twisted wretch of a man. That may be true, but it doesn't matter. Seeing this movie, as Friedkin says, will enthrall your emotions. It provokes and motivates in a way few films can. Before 1973, Oscars were never given for a character's make-up in a movie. When this thriller hit the silver screen, it scattered expectations and sent film geeks (like myself) burying their heads in typewriters. To this day, Linda Blair's spinning head; her blasphemous obscenities spewing from her withered throat; her gross and unsettling practice of the crucifix; will influence a posterity of filmmakers. Well done, Mr. Blatty and Mr. Friedkin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film as a kid, and couldn't sit through it. It literally scared me out of the room. Then I saw it as a teenager - same effect. It wasn't until I was an adult that I sat down and watched this thing straight through - albeit it in the middle of the day with all the lights on. I just can't understand how some of you don't find it scary. Perhaps you're too cynical. It's a movie, you've got to go with it.'The Exorcist' is William Friedkin at his best. Interestingly enough, many of the scenes in this film that don't take place in the little girl's room are the spookiest. Friedkin has infused every scene with a foreboding and volatility. Particularly frightening are the scenes in the hospital when the girl is getting tests done. An interesting comment on modern life.</fullReview>

Thirty minutes into the movie and nothing much has happened except some weird noises in the attic.When we do finally see Blair with her gray face, red eyes, messed up hair, she looks like a kid made up for Halloween. The floating objects, the moving bed, etc. are almost laughable now. By the way, it isn't green pea soup she is spewing out--it's the mixture from her feeding tube--but in pop culture, it has become pea soup.I recommend The Exorcist to horror fans and '70s pop culture fans only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Movie from the Scariest Book of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1973 when The Exorcist premiered, I was studying comparative anatomy as a sophomore in college. There had been great media fanfare about the movie leading up to it's release, and during the opening weekend it was reported that thousands of people across the country had left the theater during the movie, some becoming so ill as to need to regurgitate. Whether those reports were true or not, there certainly was buzz about this movie. I decided to read the book the night before I went to see it, and stayed up the whole night reading. As it happened, I had a cat cadavear as did my three roommates which I was studying for anatomy class and it was stored in the entry hall to my suite dorm room (two rooms with four students connected by an small entry hall in the front and a bathroom in the back). When I was approximately half way through reading the book, I heard a crashing sound in the entry hall which scarred the bejeezus out of me. It was about 3:00am and everything was totally dark and silent. I went to investigate and discovered that my cat, and only my cat, had fallen from the top shelf where all of us kept our specimens and was laying on the floor, staring straight up at me with its paws extended toward me. Spooky stuff, considering the book was terrifying and brilliantly written. I went the next day to see the movie with my roommates and was blown away. It was one of the few times that a film adapted from a novel equaled the brilliance of the novel. Ellen Burstyn was fantastic as the mother of a child who had apparently been possessed by the devil. It was her fear and desperation to save her child that drove the movie. Miss Burstyn was nominated that year as Best Actress at the Academy Awards, but lost due to the controversial nature of the film. She did win the next year, however, for Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More, and I've always believed that it was really for her performance in The Exorcist. And by the way, another movie Ellen Burstyn was in for which she was nominated for Best Actress and lost because hardly anyone saw the movie (these were the days before videos could be sent to the Academy members) was Resurrection. If you haven't seen it, don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great DVD... Dreary commentary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The DVD edition of "the version you've never seen before" is technically perfect. But the director's commentary is dreadful. It is of the "descriptive video for the blind" kind, and spends the whole time describing, without insight or originality, everything that happens on screen. The only exceptions give rise to horrendous factual errors. Two of them are in the Irak introduction: William Friedkin talks of "prophet David" (for Daniel) being buried under Nabuchodonosor and comments on the walls of Nineveh being destroyed by Joshua's trumpets (I don't care how powerful those trumpets were, they were in Jericoh, 2 thousand miles away). I would have switched the horrid thing off but I stuck with it to understand the only thing that still bothers me with the script, i.e. how the St. Joseph medal Father Merrin finds in Irak ends up around the neck of Father Karras in the last scenes. [Anyone's input on this is welcome.] Unfortunately, this is not the sort of thing Friedkin has on his mind and this apparent contradiction is never explained. We will have to assume that it is a medal that is very common and that Father Karras came across one independently. P.S.: Friedkin's description of the scene where Regan tears off this medal from Father Karras' neck has "Chris" (Regan's mother) ripping it off the good father's neck...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***WARNING: SPOLIERS AHEAD!*** Aside from being possibly the greatest horror film of all time, THE EXORCIST is one frightening, gruesome, and truly disturbing ride through hell! When I watched it, I was too overwhelmed and scared to even pay attention to the great drama of the fathers and the little girl. It is set in Iraq, where a strange figurine is found of a devilish being. The figure represents a demon that finds its way into a little girl named Regan (Linda Blair), who happens to be playing with a ouija board in America. Then comes a truly tense scene that I find to be extremely creepy. She begins to sketch a drawing of that same demon figure in her house. Then her mother (Ellen Burstyn) begins to notice her daughter's erratic behaviour, including urinating at a party, attempting to sexually attack her mother, and prance around during a physical examination. Her mother finally comes to believe a devil has plotted itself into Regan. She calls upon two ministers to dispel the being. And then, the antics grow more violent and repulsive. If you are a fan of horror, please watch this film. If you got scared in THE SIXTH SENSE or THE OTHERS, please be aware you are about to lose many hours of sleep watching this movie! And why it is such a great film is that there's many surprises in store. It is a philosophical drama piece about faith and religion, wrapped in a truly frightening horror package. Because the greatest films in the world are the ones that keep you guessing with a controversial mystery (ie: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Taxi Driver). The big mysterious question in this film is, "How did it all happen? What is the connection between the protagonist and its antagonist?" A 10/10, as far as a movie goes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, how people still love to deride this fantastic piece of cinema: `blasphemous;' `too scary;' `dated;' `disgusting;' and for our friends with short attention spans and a low threshold for drama, `boring.' Well, what can I say? I suppose these are the same folks who can't sit still through `2001: A Space Odyssey,' `Citizen Kane' or `Chinatown.' I suppose it takes too much time to sort through all of that nasty subtlety. Better have it all neatly sorted out for you straight away instead of having the reward of discovering new insights with each viewing. Chances are our film-going pals (or should we merely say `consumers') wouldn't dare waste time reading my drivel either, so who am I writing for really? For me, I guess. I'm just a snob who likes to write. As a film lover that passion comes with the territory. So, where was I?Ah yes, `The Exorcist!' What does it mean to me? (theme paper lovers rejoice!) First of all, I've always been a horror fan. No, wait, I take that back. I like to be scared. But this does not a horror fan make. There are only a handful of horror movies I've found effective, the worst variety being the tongue-and-cheek teen slasher nonsense of `Nightmare on Elm St.' and `Friday the 13th.' Then, of course, there are the closely related out-and-out gore fests that provide the blood &amp; guts simply for the sake of doing so; suspense, logic and character development be damned! Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude. I can stomach a lot. `The Exorcist' is certainly graphic, but in a way that is necessary for telling the story (`Goodfellas' is another that uses violence as an integral element to its central story). It treats its subject matter with consideration, intelligence and appropriate seriousness. Its characters do not automatically jump to assumptions and neither, likewise, should the audience. The events depicted should represent a challenge of faith and belief, even if it's just on a rhetorical level for those less religiously inclined. You do not forget the images from this film. What's interesting to me is that those who seem most offended by the images (especially the crucifix scene) are so on a religious basis. Director William Friedkin has stated that audiences will `take from the movie exactly what they bring to it' when interpreting the meaning. I can only speak for myself when I say that `The Exorcist' is ultimately a powerful statement FOR keeping faith and the religiously minded shouldn't shy away from the implications it presents just because it's shocking. I was raised Catholic (even did the Jesuit prep school bit!) and have come to believe that one cannot hold any basis for their faith unless they have put it to the test by inviting challenge and a subsequent struggle for its defense. Being confident in faith requires this ? even though it leaves many unanswered questions. Religion is not about being sheltered and unknowledgeable. The `Version You've Never Seen' included a very telling conversation on the stairwell between the two priests during a break in the exorcism. Merrin basically tells Karras that the demon wants to show us that human beings are animalistic, worthless entities ? garbage. Life is meaningless. `The Exorcist' clearly embraces the sanctity of the human condition and its purpose on earth, which is precisely why the possession must be as repulsive and vulgar as possible (the exact opposite of what we value). Otherwise, this challenge of faith is stick-figure and doesn't get at the essence of what could possibly offend the very foundations of the beliefs (whatever that may be) that keep us grounded in our everyday existence. I can't think of much worse than a young, innocent girl uncontrollably violating herself with a central symbol of Christian faith ? the crucifix (and don't forget, there are other contributing elements to this scene as well). The actual Jesuit priest who played Fr. Dyer has also stated in interviews that the depiction of such material was highly justified.Just a few words about `The Version You've Never Seen.' Having never seen film theatrically, I consider it one of the great movie experiences of my life to watch this with a full audience (went twice!). Late on a Saturday night, the place was mobbed with kids and, judging from their reactions, I'm guessing many were seeing it for the first time. Both times I saw it, the same phenomena occurred. Complaints of `boredom' arose midway through the Iraq scenes. Smatterings of laughter broke out during the early possession scenes. Squeamish sounds emanated during the hospital visits. Chalk much of this up to immaturity; it's totally normal and expected for teens to react this way to uncomfortable material. I saw the same reaction to the nudity in `Schindler's List.' Each time during `The Exorcist,' however, one sequence never failed to shut everyone up real quick ? the crucifix scene. After that point, the audience as a whole knew this wasn't a joke anymore. From that point on they were rapt. Those thinking that this film, due to its age, doesn't have the ability to scare are simply wrong. As for the new scenes, some are better than others. The new opening shot of the house and the Virgin Mary statue gave me the chills. I've already mentioned the stairwell dialogue. The `spider walk' was fantastic (I'm glad they cut Reagan with the forked tongue scampering after Chris). The glowing figures on the walls seemed a little intrusive, and the ending was ultimately unnecessary, although interesting. Blatty said that he wanted it in because he didn't want people to `think the devil won.' But I fall hard with Friedkin on this point: `you take what you bring to it.' To me, as with Friedkin, it is clearly a reaffirmation of faith and a rejection of evil. One of the special aspects of the original cut is that it could be interpreted in the other direction, just as with life itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not alive when "The Exorcist" came out in theaters. However I was blessed with the good fortune of being able to experience the film in theater when "The Version You haven't seen" came out a few years ago. This stands as the greatest movie theater experience of my life (barring a Texas Chainsaw Massacre or 2001 Space Odyssey Re-Release). The plot isn't as terrifying for non- strict Catholics I guess, but this is still a great film. Every single frame in the movie is visually spine-chilling. Even the scene where Father Karras is running on the track has no in-the-face cursing or demonizing, but just the scene itself is cold and creepy. THe whole movie has that 'cold' feeling. (I urge anyone with the DVD and a good sized TV to turn out all the lights, and turn off your heat in the winter time. curl up in a blanket and watch this film.) Most people trash this as cheesy and laughable, but if you just see it as a visual piece of art you'll be impressed. I never really believed I or someone will be possessed, but I will honestly say I have had a nightmare about that devil face they show for a split second 3 times during the film. The re-release version has some added scenes, but either way this is quality. I 'll give it an 8...not for being scary necessarily, but for being visually masterful. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1973 Director William Friedkin brought William Peter Blatty's novel 'The Exorcist' to the big screen. It was a runaway success that would remain a landmark of horror films for decades to come. Even now, almost thirty years later, the film hasn't lost its ability to terrify and shock audiences from around the world, eliciting a variety of responses to its underlying themes, its uninhibited dialogue and graphic scenes of possession. Horror films come by the dozen, but there are only a handful of these films which exist as examples of what a good horror should be, and 'The Exorcist' is one of them.The film works for a number of reasons. Firstly, the cast was perfect and the characters portrayed very realistically. In films such as these there is always the risk of the cast overacting to portray certain characters, but in 'The Exorcist' they hit the nail on the head. The actors timing is impeccable, the dialogue delivered effortlessly and the direction and editing superb. One of the reasons the film is so effective is that you believe the characters you see on the screen are real and that you can relate to. The film makes you believe that something like this could very well happen in real life and makes you wonder just how vulnerable you are yourself to circumstances beyond your control or understanding. The thought of something else being in control of your body and mind is the real source of terror in this film and it is this concept that is communicated effectively to the audience through Linda Blair's outstanding portrayal of Regan McNeil. Although her screen time as the possessed young girl is minimal it was extremely effective. Never before, and in my opinion never again, has there been such a terrifying evil captured on film. Throughout the entire movie, the slow pacethere is an air of suspense which deepens the plot and enhances the effect it has on the viewer. The films paceThe lack of out-of-this-world visual and special effects was a blessing in disguise for this film. At the time, they had to rely on minimal visual effects and outstanding make-up to bring the demon to life as such, and it worked brilliantly. The end result was such a convincing depiction of possession that it left people frozen in their seats when the film was first seen. And today, decades later, it has the same effect. So, in my opinion, 'The Exorcist' remains the most terrifying horror film ever to be made and should be seen by all those who would like to see what a real horror film is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cannot begin to explain how it frightened me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I even saw this movie it terrified me. I remember hearing a radio commercial one time (Regan's voice) - couldn't sleep for a couple of weeks. I finally saw it around 1976, actually I DIDN"T see it because I had my hands over my eyes through most of the movie. But I think HEARING it made it even worse....I heard those voices and noises in my nightmares for YEARS after. I slept with a Bible for weeks. I actually watched it around 1979 or so and was frightened senseless. I saw it again a couple of years ago and have to say it still gives me the creeps. IF you are a person who believes in God and Satan this movie will, or at least SHOULD scare you silly because it attacks the very core of what we believe. It is terrifying....I saw this movie when I was 16 years old, I'm now 42 and I would have to say it's the movie that influenced me most with regards to how I think and what I believe.Beyond my own personal feelings though...how can you say it isn't fightening, scary or at least creepy? Can you ever listen to Tubular Bells without thinking of it???? See a long stairway outside and not ponder.....The feel was perfect, the subtley in the beginning really set the mood. 10 out of 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explanation for presence of fear in reaction to Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing the Exorcist, one will have one of two reactions. The first, an uncomfortable feeling that provokes unwanted thoughts and stays with you for quite a while.. or, nothing at all or little more than comical entertainment. It all really depends on your thoughts concerning religion. Most likely, a common god-fearing man or woman will find the film horrifying, while those who haven't really developed beliefs of God will find it simply ridiculous. Its wonderful that a film can affect people like that in accordance to their religious degree of faith. Neither judgment is wrong or right, but I just wanted to put that explanation out there because it is strange to read a comment like "The scariest film of all time" and then right after "The most comical film of all time". If you see this film for the first time, ask yourself about God and what you believe beforehand... and you should already know if you'll enjoy the film or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film will scare the Hell out of you....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film will scare the Hell out of you and the Heaven into you... literally...if you have been brought up as religious as I was. (I am a Catholic right from the cradle and am a former Alter Boy.) If you are religious it will frighten you as it did me. If not, that's okay, too and you'll find it an entertaining entry in the "demonic possession," genre. The film, allegedly based on facts, (that alone made it seem even more frightening at the time of its release) was calculated to keep your stomach in knots and to give you goose pimples as large as the measles or chicken pox all over your body from start to finish, and it succeeds in every way due to the direction, art, staging, and acting of the principals involved. If you do watch it, you'll be riveted to your seat throughout this film as my friend and I were. It all starts as a childish game of playing with an Oui-Ja board, through which little Regan (Blair) accidentally conjures up the devil (an altogether real possibility while playing with Oui-Ja boards) and subsequently becomes possessed by the devil (also a real possibility, because that's, allegedly, how the actual child came to be possessed in real-life, inspiring the book and subsequent film). After all Hell breaks loose in the house, Regan's mother (Burstyn) takes her to a local church, and the pastor calls in the Exorcist (von Sydow) to (hopefully) save her daughter. Will he succeed or will the devil kill little Regan and drag her soul to Hell? Watch and find out. At the time of its release, the film was billed as the most frightening film ever made, and it was. (You gotta remember...this was the early '70s when censorship was still going strong and films didn't show much on-screen, nor did they infer very much in the dialog, either except in "X-rated" films, which this wasn't. It was "only" rated "R".) If you watch this film, don't do it alone. I watched this film in 1973 at the age of 17 at a local theater with a friend (a fellow Alter Boy like myself) when it was first released because our local church banned it (or, rather us Catholics from watching it) and we wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. Anyway, at the theater, they were handing out sickness bags at the door, which I think, but am not sure, was a gag, intended to frighten us even more. Gag or not,it sure frightened us, alright. (Well, ME anyway.) Watch this film, but if you do, be sure to keep your sickness bag handy...you just might need it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Five Definitive Horror Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist, in my opinion, is one of the best films ever made. And is #2 on my top five list of most influential horror movies. The Exorcist crossed a line in 1973. The movie has a young girl uttering almost every foul word in the English language, masturbating with a cross, killing full grown men, urinating in front of a group of adults, and throwing up on a priest. This movie, being the first R-Rated one I saw, effected me like no other. The first time I saw it, I truthfully can say that I wasn't scared, although repeated viewings proved otherwise. I was mystified by the fact that these images were allowed to be shown in the United States. Now, years later after seeing such films as "Happiness", "Pink Flamingos", and "The Evil Dead", The Exorcist doesn't seem as bad, but the punch is still there everytime I watch it. It is my favorite movie of all time and #2 on my list of influential horror films. I recommend it to anyone who wants to be truly scared, horrified, and repulsed all in about 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah... that pretty much says it all. The Exorcist is one of those movies that is going to continue to have an effect upon audiences for a long time. It'll get you, too. Don't worry. You'll find something in it that freaks you right the hell out someday. The performances are great. The use of light is absolutely perfect, particularly when it comes to hiding creepy iconography in the shadows that you're not reeeeally sure you saw in the first place. It is probably one of the only movies that consistently scares me, hand in hand with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It IS dated, and lends itself to moments of retrospective absurdity for audiences more used to modern conventions - both social and cinematic. But, when you get right down to it... it's damn creepy. Really damn creepy. I mean... damn. Creepy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible movie. The best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the most scary movie of all time. And will be no matter what Hollywood manages to produce. I am hurt to see what some of the other viewers have posted such as funny and boring. The acting is, no, not the greatest in the world but is acceptable by, hopefully, most everyone. Any "bad" acting is minimal and can be over looked. The fact that the book was based on actual events should be scary enough in itself. I can't express how deep this movie actually goes. It's so much more than "green puke" and "head twisting". You have to know the characters and their emotional conflicts with the situation they've been thrown into. Please people, if you have yet to see this movie, DO! Even if you end up disliking it, you will be able to talk about it. There are so many takeoffs its worth being in on the joke at least. But I can't see how anyone would dislike this movie. If you would like to have a nice little debate on the matter feel free to send me a message or an e-mail. I'd be more than happy to talk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All-time scariest horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can a film be construed as "the scariest film of all time"? It can if it's William Friedkin's adaptation of William Peter Blatty's phenom novel "The Exorcist".It's hard to believe that a novel published back in 1971, could hold people in the grip of true fear and panic. Then, to have it filmed and released In Christmas of 1973, and cause an all out hysteria (paramedics, priests, nutsos on stand by), obviously says a lot. it surprises me to this day that Mr. Friedkin doesn't view his masterpiece as an actual horror film.I believe part of this film's (and the novel's) success is that it deals with all of our own primal fears. Fear of the unknown, and the fear of actual evil, or evil incarnate existing. The handling of young Linda Blair as Regan; the girl possessed by the devil, is surprisingly handled, since she herself didn't think the film she was making would create such an impact. Aaah, to be young and innocent.It also deals with the concepts and issues of faith. Believers and non-believers can certainly debate the existence of good and evil (or God and the Devil), and if point in fact, out of evil can come good?As for my own experience, "The Exorcist" forced me to keep my bedroom lights on for three months.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have had a strange relationship with this film. My initial reaction to it was much the same as several others on this comment thread; it was and remains to this day the only film I have ever fallen asleep watching.I saw it in a cramped college dorm on a small television screen, and my roommate was asleep in the next bed. When we were awake the next morning, he cornered me and wanted to know what I had been watching that night. "The voices, they got into my dreams," he said.I dismissed the film, but my roommate's comments stayed with me. Several years later, on the film's 25th anniversary, I went to the local cinema to see its re-release. I was transfixed. It was a completely different film. The wonderfully constructed sound effects, the intense characterisation, the immersive and beautiful cinematography, all were magnified into a phychological experience of almost unparallelled intensity. The only thing to which I can compare it was seeing "The Silence of the Lambs" for the first time. The film managed to get into my dreams that night.This was a film made before video. It was not meant for that medium and completely loses its impact while viewed on television. Like "2001: A Space Odyssey" (Another film deemed boring by the video generation) it seems about half an hour shorter on the big screen. Why this is I will never know, but it is true. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most frightening movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think most people are skeptical when they see horror movies, and for the most part I think this is the right attitude. There's absolutely no reason to assume any of the events are at all realistic, and even less reason that anyone should care about the people involved.And yet, the same can likely be said about The Exorcist, because it's certainly not realistic, and I don't especially care about Helen Byrston as the caring mother.I think the secret to the success of The Exorcist is the movie's deliberate pace and subtlety. The real fright fest doesn't come until a good 45 minutes-1 hour into the movie, while all the time things are building. The beginning doesn't seem to fit, until at a certain point much later on, and even then the beginning sequence may not have been especially necessary. For the life of me, I can't understand why the statues of demons are scary, but there they are and they are horrifying. Who would ever makes such things?Then the story shifts to the Georgetown area of Washington D.C. and things get very scary, very slowly. Reagan's unhappiness with her parents divorce allows her mind to be corrupted, or this is what I gather from the movie. This corruption begins with a simple imaginary friend, but that friend has a much different plan in mind. Soon the subliminal images of demons appear, and one must wonder if he actually saw what he thought he saw.Once it becomes clear that Reagan is indeed demonically possessed things aren't quite as bad, because now you have some idea of what to expect. And yet the chanting in Latin, and backwards English, and the levitation scene all add to make the exorcism very frightening.Some may see that the ending is one of the few movies in which evil triumphs over good, but I don't really see it that way. Evil in this movie is certainly evil, and good is . . . well, good is better than evil.I thought I was tough and wouldn't be frightened by this movie, but the Exorcism is such an extraordinarily well made movie, coming out of the 1970's, the best decade in movie making by far, that it is impossible not to be scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Answers questions of faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid growing up in the Mid-1980s, I loved to watch all kinds of movies. When I was about 7, I remember being told that if I ever wanted to be REALLY scared by a movie, to go and see either Friday the 13th or The Exorcist. One night I found myself home alone with an all night marathon of all the Friday the 13ths on HBO. I watched parts 1-3 &amp; when they were over I was laughing at how ridiculous these movies were. I decided that if that was supposed scary, watching The Exorcist would be a waste of my time. So I never saw it.14 years passed by, during which time I got my education 3 different Catholic institutions. One rainy summer night I again found my self alone all night, so I rented The Exorcist. Now as it started and developed characters, I really connected with Father Karras, because when I hit my 20's I began to doubt my faith for some of the same reasons that he explained in the movie. But still, I thought the movie was going to suck. Then came the attic scene with the torch. That gave me a good enough scare to finish watching it. Thank God I did.Now I know its just a movie, but I was believing that a little girl is really possessed by the devil. I never expected any the things that the devil did, and I was genuinely shocked, terrified, and flat out scared out of my mind by all of them. And the ending was something I REALLY never expected, espically the actions of a catholic priest. By the time it was over my hands were shaking like the priest who gave the last rights. I went over to a friends house just so I wouldn't spend the night alone. It was the best scary, and best all time movie I have ever seen.Why? Not because of the first-rate acting, writing, and directing, but because after I saw it a few of my faith questions disappear and I was just glad that the devil was not possessing me. Sounds crazy right? I would usually laugh after reading something like this, except it actually did happen to me.The Exorcist is THAT good of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good and misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the re-release of this incredible movie on DVD with the added scenes and the commentary by the director and think it is one of the best movies I have seen. When I first saw this movie years ago I found it goofy but that was because my first exposure to it was in a spoof by Mad magazine. Well years later I rented the movie again and and that time I was spooked. It's a great story that I think is totally misunderstood.Now I haven't read the book, though I'm planning on it, but I believe the main character of this movie is Father Damien Karras. The movie is really about his loss of faith in God. (!!SPOILERS!!) With his mother's death, and all the other problems he faces daily as a priest, he no longer believes that God is there or, if God is there, that God cares about us. The possession of Regan is supposed to return his faith in God. At first he doesn't believe in the possession as the scientific side of him wants to go along with the doctors and chalk it up as a psychiatric problem. Slowly though he begins to see the signs that this child is indeed possessed. He believes it so much that in the end he is willing to sacrifice himself for the child.(--end of SPOILERS--)If you've seen this movie, re-released or otherwise, and weren't scared or thought it was awful, please see it again not for a gruesome horrorfest that many believe it to be, but for a stimulating journey of belief and for psychological terror. I rate it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie when I was like nine or ten on TNT. Even with all of the really scary stuff edited out for content, it still scared the living crap out of me. And now, after seeing the new version, it scares the living crap out of me even more then before. And I usually don't like movies that scare the crap out of me, but this is the one exception. (Aside from A Nightmare on Elm Street. I saw that when I was seven on TBS and I didn't sleep for three days) Anyway, this is THE horror classic. It just takes a usually simple plot idea and makes one of scariest and the best movies of all time. There may be other movies like it, but this is the cream of the crop.(Even though I can barely watch with other people in the room during the day, but forget about it) Yes, the is the true horror classic that you shouldn't let your nine year old kid watch unless you want him to go without sleep for a few days. Not that I know anything about that.</fullReview>

So when I saw this movie, I wasn't scared of anything I saw because I am not afraid of the Devil and no one else should be either. But to be totally honest, I'm a little bit more reluctant of movie plots that can't possibly happen in real life. For example, take Freddy Krueger. Till this day, The Nightmare on Elm Street movies still make me flinch. But movies that involve demon possessions don't bother me because I know that stuff happens-look in the Bible for goodness sakes. I know some people say there is no such thing as the devil. For all you science buffs out there, you may believe there isn't. But some people like to look at evil actions from a science and spiritual point of view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT HORROR FILM WITH A STYLE ALL ITS OWN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The exorcist is a wonderful horror film that delivers direct, up close and personal terror. **POSSIBLE SPOILERS** This film is a true original because the main scare of the film--the daughter possessed by our friend Mr. Devil--can't hurt anyone. Almost the entire time she is possessed she is tied to a bed, and we know there won't be any surprises or jump-outs, yet we remain terrified. The make-up work and the acting in this film are incredible, and this is definitely one of the top ten best horror films ever made--up there with classics like "Rosemary's Baby" and "Carrie." I highly recommend renting this film--very scary, very creepy--you won't regret it. The script must have been so controversial I can't even imagine the battles over this film--the things the girl does, and the things she says related to Jesus are probably the biggest direct cinematic attack on religion ever filmed (the film isn't against religion, in fact it glorifies the power of priests and such, yet it must have been hugely controversial--see it and know what I mean).</fullReview>

I'm Not Sure What I Would Consider To Be The Most Frightening Movie, Because I Certainly Do Not Scare Easily. Maybe Because I'm A Thriller Movie Nut, I've Been Desensitized Over The Years, But This Wasn't That Scary. It's Definitly Up There Though.

		<shortDescription>um - so, wow - that was ... yup - creepy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ok - so i finally sat down with a friend and watched The Exorcist. I had heard that is was terrifying, and I would say it definitely held up to my peer reviews! first, it isn't scary, like horror-movie scary, but more like suspenseful scary (which is how the older horror movies tend to be). the music adds to it, especially since it often builds you up, and then nothing happens. when something does happen, you only half-expect it. I admit that some of my creepiness was due to my friend being fidgity and moving about the room (not to mention the people singing mennonite hymns in the background - soft, beautiful music made the girl seem more scary!). second, i wasn't scared cause i thought i'd walk upstairs and my roommate would be growling, cursing, and spit split-pea soup at me, but i was more creeped out because it messes with your nerves! also, as a strong Christian, i want to comment on the crucifix scene - i know it's a movie, so it wasn't too offensive in that sense - it just looked so painful and freaky! i had to look away (i dont' take blood well, or spit, or other bodily fluids for that matter). last, i just want to make a few commnents on the film and acting: first, i thought it was very well-filmed - great angle shots (that added to the creepiness), good scenery, great music. now, the acting was overall great. linda blair was good while possessed - but at the beginning, she was awful. i'm not surprised she couldn't get any other star roles. that's it.. i think this movie is either loved (in that it will totally creep you out), or despised (because it doesn't live up to it's hype)... all i know, is i'm glad we have some light in our room!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not just organizing jumble sales</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember all the hype when this film came out, how it was the most gruesome film of all time, people fainting and becoming possessed in theatres etc., but I was too young to see it then. I finally caught up with it a few years later at the mature old age of 19, and loved all the profanity, head spinning and puking, as you do at that age. Then two or three years ago I read Blatty's original book, and last year saw the film for the second time, and found as I enter early middle age I have quite a different perspective. It is not a sensationalist horror film at all, but a rather intelligent exploration of the nature of good and evil (apparently loosely based on a real case, the priests involved were staying on campus when Blatty was a college student in 1947). In a way it resembles nothing so much as an extended recruitment for the Catholic priesthood. Perhaps its tagline should be "It's not just organizing jumble sales ... you too may get to go one on one with Satan himself!"</fullReview>

Taking all of its history and the fact that a new generation are finding out what the fuss was about,this remains the finest horror movie i have ever seen unless you know better.

This along with many other scenes helped me understand that It's not the head spin scene etc.. that makes this movie scary but what the movie stands for. I'll now have to go out and by the special edition DVD that includes the cut out scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I am astonished reading the comments of people who weren't completely terrified by this movie. But I guess it all has to do with our own personal beliefs and fears. I hadn't really heard that much about this movie or had really any preconceptions, so when I walked into a showing of the re-release of The Exorcist, it was with a open mind. AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO SCARED IN MY LIFE! I couldn't sleep for the next two weeks, and I consider myself a pretty tough customer as far as horror movies go (I was sadly deceived). So check this out on the recommendation of a person who is barely ever scared by horror movie, and was completely horror-struck by this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first viewed this film i was a mere 11 yrs old! My father the big chicken he is, made me watch it with him!! Well put it this way i didn't sleep for two months after watching it without my lights on!!I have rarely seen a movie that gets inside your head such as this one. The cast, except for Ellen Burstyn were reasonably unknown at the time! I will tell you they do one hell of a job conjering up the scare factor! William Friedkin is one hell of a director, if you have seen the making of this movie you would know why??It is about a 12 yr old girl named regan macneil who is very innocent yet gets possesed by Satan. The music immagery and the whole aura around this movie leaves you thinking that what they are describing in this movie is definatly true. The special effects for the time are astonishing. A must see fopr those of you that are looking for two hours + of frights and i kid you not! If this movie didnt scare you i would like to here from you I WILL MAIL YOU RIGHT AWAY! fOR NOW SEE YA ALL!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, bit over the top, but still a decent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The exorcist has horrible connotations - people running from cinemas, various members of the cast and crew going mad - but to be honest, if you strip away all the hype then you're left with a pretty good movie with some over the top bits. It's still far better than all the supposedly "scary" horror movies of late (i.e. Scream, I know what you did last summer, etc...), and it is certainly one of the most frightening films of that period (even better than The Omen).However, there are a few bits that had me sniggering into my popcorn - for instance, the catholic religion is presented in the movie as being very much like some kind of organised crime outfit (maybe it is like that, I wouldn't know as I'm not a catholic :) and some of the things that the preists do are slightly laughable (like the whole "The Power of Christ compels you!" scene).The movie has many genuinely scary and disgusting moments, for instance the whole "vaginal crucifix insertion" part, which somewhat nauseated me when I first saw it. Also, the voice of the devil is more or less spot on, being inhuman, scary and yet somehow mocking at the same time. It'll stay with you for ages.I disagree with the people who say that it mocks the catholic religion - If anything, it encourages it - saying that the devil and christ really do exist. I also disagree that it could encourage many people to come back to religion, as I beleive that if you can come back to religion after only watching a movie then I think it's time to re-evaluate what you beleive.But, at the end of the day, we're left with a good film that is great for watching at night time with a couple of friends and some beer.I give it 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am 19, and I have been watching this one since I was at least 6 years old. Believe me , it still scares the **** out of me and I still choose to sit up there and watch it over and over and over again and again and again. It is soooooooooooooo scary how a little 12 year old girl who was possessed knew every thing that was going on even though she stayed in the bed tied up the whole damn time. Think about how she knew about Father Karras's mother so much. Even though she was tied up, if you didn't notice she got up when she wanted to at times. I heard from an older person in their fifties, that when this movie first came out in the 70s, the movie was sold out left and right, and people were coming out the theatres passing out and throwing up. Most People think that the true story that William Peter Blatty based this movie on happened in Georgetown D.C., but it didn't. It happened to a 13 year old Mt-Rainer, Maryland boy years ago which is not too too far at all from where I live. Isn't that scary as hell? Sometimes after watching this movie, I walk around my house and I get so scared that sometimes I think I can here Reagan screaming even when I go to sleep at night!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifying...In The Most Wonderful Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I popped "The Exorcist" into my VCR with the lights off and a bowl of popcorn in my hand. I took it out of my VCR with the lights on and my eyes wide. That's how much fear that this excellent thriller poured into my veins, chilling my blood.The movie begins in Iraq, where two archaeologists find some ancient structures that symbolize evil. The story then takes us to our setting: the home of movie star Chris MacNeil (excellently played by Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter Ragen (Linda Blair). Things seem to be running well for Chris and Ragen, but suddenly, strange things begin in Ragen. During her doctor appointment, she curses and screams at the doctors. Soon, she's shaking violently in bed, doing vulgar things with a cross, bleeding, scarring, yelling obscene things at her mother, and so on. The doctors say it's nerves. Chris thinks, after speaking with someone, that it's possession, leading her to call the help of a depressed priest named Damien Karras (Jason Miller).This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Any scene containing the aftermath of Ragen's "problem" had my heart racing and my eyes bugging. And the special effects were incredible-maybe not as good as recent movie effects, but certainly great for a movie from 1973. I couldn't believe it was made in 1973-maybe 1978, or 1976 even, but not 1973.The acting was great too. The best performances in the movie were those of Linda Blair and Ellen Burstyn-they both gave great passion in their roles and made you feel for their characters. Jason Miller also did an exceptional job as Damien. Acting was great all around.The only thing was that it moved a little too slow sometimes. The majority of the time I was watching intently. But sometimes...like at the very beginning...I'd be intently bored. Never-the-less, this movie is a classic and certainly one of my favorites. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different (and lonely) view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw The Exorcist this year (2001), with some friends.Having heard a lot about the movie, I was persuaded that i'd be completely horrified after watching it... Not at all! I obviously respect any other opinions, but i can't really see what's so special about it! Personally, this is not the kind of movie that makes me shiver... it's just so unreal that it won't haunt when you go home after watching it. I guess that films like Scream (the first one, specially) is what kind of scares me, because you have that everyday-life-component that makes you think if all doors and windows are locked when you're in bed. I'm not saying that "The Exorcist" is a bad movie, not at all, i believe that it is one of the best in its kind, but what i really felt like the dominant key in the movie were not the horrific scenes (good make up, anyway...) but the "fall of an angel", the destruction of that connection between mother and child, the maternal suffering, the constrast between a time of happiness and harmony and a new moment of fallen innocence and despair, that William Friedkin so beautifully and tallentedly portraits. I will finally remember this film not as the best horror movie of all time, but (in my opinion) as a great metaphor of how life and earthly bonds are weak, and of our "stigmata" of divine dependence, the infinite maze of questions about the existence of a superior being. I just wanted to leave here a different approach, a different angle of watching it... Go see it if you can, it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie in every single sense of the word. Not only is it a masterpiece, but in my opinion, it is the greatest film ever made. It is like a showdown, battle or fight between good and evil. Although that isn't the only thing that makes this movie as good as it is. Everything about this movie makes it as good as it is. The characters played very, very strong roles and you could really believe that they were real, everything was explained loud and clearly with no open or loose ends where things didn't get explained, you always knew what was going on and why. The plot is just excellent and every scene is just carried out to its fullest extent and I swear they could not in a million, billion, trillion years have been played better. To me I think a good message or moral if you will to get from this movie is you have to believe or you have already failed. What I like most about it(besides Linda Blair, not with the devil face though)is the exorcist himself and the other priest. I'm not going to ruin the movie in case you haven't seen it because by now you probably already know that an exorcism is performed. The fact that they put their own lives on the line to save this cute, loveable, little girl is what I like because it shows that no matter what they were up against, this young child was an innocent victim in all of this and they had to get her back. I can go on for hours and hours talking about how good this movie is, but I would be wasting your time to watch it, so please watch The Exorcist now and you will see why it is the greatest movie that was ever, ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As we have been desensitized by movies in the modern era, The Exorcist is one of those unique movies that creates controversy to this day. Probably more disturbing than scary it focuses on the demonic possesion of a young girl. Where normally a slow build up is not in a movie's best interest, in this case its the slow build up which adds to the tension and anxiety of the viewer. Its more a case of you know something bad is going to happen and even though you think you are prepared for it, the sheer disturbing nature of watching a young girl act and look so horrible is something you can never forget. Not something you can watch too many times but it certainly makes you take a stand in your faith or lack of and is a one of a kind film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of christ compels you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood knows where to get you, with - your most vunerable places - your own vatican beliefs. The Exorcist came out in 1973, the same year as Jaws. It's the story of a young girl (Linda Blair) who's mother won't believe some of the stories she's been telling until she sees them comes true herself. The young girl is, formatically , possessed by Lucifer, from appearance to voice to behavior. After baffling the doctors the mother turns to the only thing left that can help her, The Catholic Church. This movie combines two scary elements, losing faith and the concept of the devil. The dialogue, to show good and evil, is a combination of authentic biblical quotations - some stated by actual priests - and obscene blasphemous lines. The writer (Blatty)knows exactly where to shock you... well, if you're seriously religious - that is. The 'Defiling a cross' scene is one major example. Nobody in good concience would ever do what the girl did in that scene. IT's JUST PLAIN WRONG. Then, of course, there's Mercedes MaCambridge's wonderful vocal effects. The woman, seriously, was put through some heavy hell to deliver the goods. She was actually tied down to replicate the feeling of Linda Blair being strapped down in bed in the movie. Yet, the outcome was wonderful. You wouldn't even know that it was a woman doing it during some moments. One of her best quotes was, "Do you know what she did? Your Catholic daughter?" She sounded like a refined male British actor! That combined with Dick Smith's state of the art make up effects makes this movie an ultimate hit. Also, the soundtrack shifts from dead silence to horrid clammering at some moments(contrasting good and evil). Mike Oldfield's Tubular bell's has been interperited as the main theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I've expected too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well this movie is called genial and so on, but in fact, it wasn't that exciting to me. My reference for movies like this is still 'Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)', and 'The Exorcist' cannot at all be compared to that one.It is simply far to explicit, and works with direct effects, instead of giving you a feeling of horror without any escape. When the people leave the room with the child, the devil simply has no more influence on them, and when they're in the room, I missed a lot of interesting psychological fights. In fact, when the exorcism itself starts, the end comes soon and suddenly, and left me quite dissatisfied.The movie has however a very good development in suspense. The beginning was simply perfect, with a very subtle danger, and everything could still be well explained. But then the movie becomes too less subtle, even if it still remains on a high level.Another major weakness in the movie was the fact, that one of the exorcists works as a psychologist, and is called a very good one multiple times during the movie, but behaves like anyone but a person with high psychological intelligence.I don't like most horror movies in general, and I did an exception to watch this one, but it was not really worth it. 'The Blair Witch Project (1999)' offered more realism, 'The Negotiator (1998)' offered a far, far better psychology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It never ceases to amaze me how quickly people make comments about something that they don't understand. It is obvious to me that several of you people DID NOT GET THIS MOVIE! Your comments prove that there was much much more going on in this film than you could grasp, and I don't think it's by fault of the filmmakers.Let's start with comments like this....so-and-so in Manchester, England says "What, the devil has an Yorkshire accent? `Did you see what she did, your c***ing daughter?' Quite laughable really. Why not just a demon?"Um, duh! The voice coming from Reagan was not a Yorkshire demon. It was supposed to be the voice of Burke Dennings, the British director that was found at the bottom of the steps with his head turned completely around. (and it was actually the actor Jack McGowran whose voice was dubbed in). His statement "Do you know what she did?" was a reference to the fact that REGAN PUSHED HIM OUT THE WINDOW. That and Reagan's head spinning around was the demon's way of mocking the death of Burke. I'm no rocket scientist, but this was pretty damned obvious to me. Obviously it went swooping right over YOUR head faster than a bowl of pea soup.Next, let's deal with this rather silly comment..."Also, what was the purpose of the demonic items that were found? Satan was supposed to have been summoned up from a ouija board, so why were they ever introduced? One of the characters finds one at the bottom of the steps, but there is no explanation as to how the evil managed to find its way into Regan."WRONG! The object found at the bottom of the steps in Georgetown was NOT one of the ancient artifacts discovered in Iraq. It resembled those items, but that was part of Friedkin's visual lyricism. The item was actually one of Regan's little clay statues. If you notice, Detective Kinderman discovers the clay piece and in the next scene he finds similar pieces displayed in the house ("you're daughter, is she the artist?")The fact that the statue was found at the bottom of the stairs means it must have fallen from the house, perhaps from the girls room. This is partly how Kinderman (and the audience, at least those who are paying attention) pieces together the fact that Dennings was pushed from the house.My point is, dear people, that this movie is more layered and complex than you grasped upon first viewing. Do yourself a favor and watch it again (and maybe even again). New things pop up everytime, and maybe then you'll actually *get* the complexity and the details</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film reall is a work of genius. Everything is good form the camera work to the make-up (which really was something else for a film as old as it is). I must admit that i watched the film with some caution since i knew that it had caused some people emotional distress in the past. But I was impressed with everything about it. This film WAS one of the scariest movies around (at it's time), but since then we have seen films such as clockwork orange, silence of the lambs and Hannibal which have almost matched it. Although i'm sure the film was incredibly scary in the atmospheric cinema on a 14 inch T.V it really wasn't that scary. But none the less this is a great film to see and i was particularly impressed with the girls acting in the film. This film was also based on a true story (although it was eggadurated A LOT) in the 1930's in New York a boy was said to have been possessed by the devil and witnesses said his voice and moods changed dramtically, in this case an Exorcist was called (but the amount of truth in that story is debatable). but bottom line is that this film is a work of genuis and is a must see, and don't be put off by it's reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist - The Best Horror Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is the best horror movie of all time. Everything about the movie (except for maybe some of the fashions which were pretty scarey) was absolutely brilliant. The build up of tension throughout the film was extraordinary and only "The Silence of The Lambs" has come anywhere near it since. It is also one of only a handful of films which has been the equal of the book it was taken from (It is also my favourite book of all time). I first saw the film in 1978 and still after all this time I believe it is the one movie which has left the most lasting impression on me. I am looking forward to seeing the Director's Cut which I have heard will be out here in the next month.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the new DVD Version of "The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen", it's understandable why this movie continues to creep you out of your seat more than a quarter-of-a-century later. The new effects and music cues add upon the original version and the "famous" Spider-crawl puts this movie over the top--especially Ellen Burstyn's reaction before you see what will happen. Excellent acting. The only drawback of this DVD is William Friedkin's narration (should you choose that option). He adds little about the actual movie, but rather he tells you what's happening on the screen throughout the movie. Don't expect a lot of insight on the making of the movie. Stick to "The Fear of God" special on the anniversary edition. Anyway, I watched this movie at home alone in broad daylight, and it still packed a scary punch. **** Four Stars!</fullReview>

And I saw it. Just logged on after seeing it. You know, I had just seen this movie 1 time in my life before tonight. Now it's been 2 times. The first time I saw it, I think I didn't pay too much attention to the movie, and I didn't like it that much. Boy, this time I loved it! This is a great movie, and one of my favorites now. I loved it! I didn't see anything wrong with the extra time, the sound was as good as the first time, but better of course. No wonder why it won the Oscar for Best Sound. Again, great movie. The movie isn't really scary, but it keeps you in suspense, with your eyes wide open. Great acting too. Everybody gave a good performance in this movie. Well, that's all I have to say for now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 2001 Version You've never Seen (DVD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie was originally released in 1973, Billy Graham warned it contained "real evil." Perhaps he's right. This ultimate horror spectacle terrified and fascinated an international audience of many cultures and languages with its truly shocking depiction of innocent, cherubic Linda Blair's transformation into a vile, pathetic vessel of Satanic possession. William Peter Blatty scripted from his best selling novel which was allegedly based on a real case of possession. The original DVD release included a fascinating "making of" documentary that reveals director William Friedkin as an arrogant bully who had no qualms about physically abusing his actors in an attempt to get a desired reaction on camera. This new version is a cut based in part on author Blatty's restoring of deleted material from Friedkin's first cut and includes about ten minutes of new and extended scenes, the most shocking of which is Blair's infamous "spider walk" down the stairs. The informative conversation with Blatty and director Friedkin are not included on this version, but there's an exceedingly strange commentary track by Friedkin that's kind of like a description for the blind of what's on the screen. There's hardly a word about the directing process, the subliminal shots, the brilliant sound design, behind the scenes events or even the spectacular effects. One gets the notion that Friedkin pretty much made this film by himself. Friedkin makes a whopping mistake when, in describing the terrific opening scenes shot in northern Iraq near the ruins of ancient Ninevah, he recalls the Biblical story of Joshua bringing down its fabled walls. Ooops, Joshua battled Jericho! It's Jonah, who is said to be buried in nearby Mosul (where they also shot atmospheric, underground bazaar scenes), who had something to do with Ninevah.The great underpinnings of this story revolve around the resurrection, as it were, of the actual middle eastern demon idol Pazuzu from a place of renown evil by a priest-archaeologist (Max Von Sydow) who has to eventually confront it again in a final showdown half a world away. There is no why to all this, because that's what makes evil, evil; it's irrational.That said, this remains the most frightening of all mainstream films and it still delivers the horrors that generate nightmares. Perhaps that's because when it's over, there remains the unsettling feeling that the demon wins the battle. That fear conquers all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute terror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never seen this film, until it was re-released in 2000. I have worked in movie theatres for years, and seen just about every 'horror' movie that's been released in the last twenty years (The only one that got a few jumps was "Amityville Horror", but that was nothing compared to this film.). I came into the theatre one night, ended up being the only person in the auditorium for that particular showing, and proceeded to watch "The Exorcist".I have never screamed so loud in my life. In fact, I can't remember screaming at any movie before or since. There were quite a few points in the film where I found myself muttering aloud "I can't take this anymore...", and I almost left the theatre... the only thing keeping there was how well the movie was created, even without the horror aspect.I'm sure the fact that I watched it in an empty theatre added to the fright (also the fact that I was seeing it for the first time) and that it wouldn't be the same movie when viewed on my television at home, but still, I was shaking walking out of that auditorium. In my opinion, this film is scariest ever to be released to a major audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: This review includes plot details that might spoil your enjoyment of the movie, if you haven't seen it yet!In my opinion, this is the scariest movie EVER. Nothing else comes close. The only reason I don't rate it higher than 8 is that it takes a while to get to the full-blown possession scenes, which are the best part of the movie. It starts out in northern Iraq with Father Merrin on an archaelogical dig. And when Regan(Linda Blair) begins acting strange, her mother, Chris(Ellen Burstyn) takes her to several doctors before contacting Father Karras(Jason Miller) to request an exorcism. I understand what the author and screenwriter,William Peter Blatty,was trying to do--show that all medical explanations had been explored, but none of them helped Regan. But once the film gets to Regan being fully possessed by the demon Pazuzu, it's fantastic. The voice of the demon was provided by a British woman,Mercedes McCambridge,whose voice was great for the part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People tend to think that Exorcist is a horror movie. I do not see it like this. In my mind the Exorcist is not about possession, the devil or the church. The Exorcist is about the way a good man (father Karras) redeems himself from the evil he has done to his mother. This is the essence of the movie which is conveyed by the "tubular bells" theme. Karras is poor because he has chosen to be a priest and a psychiatrist at the same time. His mother lives alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn. Her mood and health deteriorates until she eventually dies. Then Karras offers his life to save Regan. The message is well hidden under the shocking scenes of the daemon and the way he torments the little girl. But the daemon is a key component of the plot that allows the director to visually express the evil that exists in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Horror Rereleased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw the Exorcist as a child many years ago. It was scary then and is still scary 27 years later. This classic horror story has been rereleased with an additional 11 minutes of unseen footage not shown in the original release. However, I was unable to determine where exactly the 11 minutes were thrown in. I do feel that the film concentrated too much on the relationship between mother and daughter, and not enough on the priests and the exorcism itself. After watching the film, I had a personal hatred towards the character of the mother, played by Ellen Burstyn, because of her constant disregard and selfishness for the safety and well-being of all those persons involved in trying to help her daughter. The film follows the gradual deterioration of the young, innocent girl played by Linda Blair as she is overcome and possessed by the devil until she is barely recognizable. Her Mother becomes more desperate as the film goes on until she finally seeks the help of the priest (Father Karras), played by Jason Miller (I), who does an excellent job. Eventually, Father Merrin, played perfectly by Max von Sydow, is called upon to assist Father Karras in the exorcism of the demon from the child. This film includes some very classic scenes which are very graphic for the era it was released. Excellent supporting cast including Lieutenant Kinderman played by Lee J. Cobb and Father Dyer played by Reverand William O'Malley. An erie musical score adds to the films scariness. I am not a big fan of horror films and if this film had spent more time on the Priests and less on the mother, I would have given it a perfect 10. Instead, 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Not only was the new added footage excellent, but what about those "subliminal messages" being flashed at various points in the film? You know, the images of faces and demons at unexpected points?? THAT in itself was enough to scare you. This movie has always scared me, but I have always been drawn to watch it. I did actually let out a scream and cover my eyes during the "spider walk" scene, only to miss it. I will most likely venture to the theatre again to view this movie, just so that I can make sure I didn't miss anything the first time, other than the spider walk.STILL A GREAT HORROR MOVIE..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...the re-release, that is. Around fifteen minutes were added to the original version of this movie. Not very much new material to see, but it was great to see this movie on the big screen (especially for someone like me who was born after this movie's original theatrical release). I consider "The Exorcist" the scariest movie ever made. No other horror movie has been able to top it. Perhaps it's the subject matter of the movie that makes "The Exorcist" so scary. I was eight years old when I saw this movie for the first time and it scared the daylights out of me. I wasn't as scared now, seeing the re-release. I was more focused on seeing the added scenes and improvements that were made to the movie. The print has been cleaned up (no grainy appearance). The new sound is great--it helps to make the movie scarier. Plus, you get to see Linda Blair's scene of a "spider walk" down a flight of stairs, which was not included in the original version of the movie. The "spider walk" down the stairs caught me by surprise because it was spooky and it occurred at an unexpected moment in the movie. I've seen this movie several times before, and believe it or not, I found some of the more graphic scenes in the movie amusing. I laughed during the crucifix-masturbation scene. However, the scenes of the actual exorcism had my eyes glued to the screen. It's still shocking to see the possessed Regan rise in the air, and then later seeing her sitting on the corner of the bed, giggling mischievously after she has just killed Father Merrin. And of course, seeing Father Karras forcefully jump out of the bedroom window, down the flight of stairs is more shocking. Even if you've seen "The Exorcist" many times before, I highly recommend seeing the re-release, especially if you're a young person who has never seen this movie on a theater screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the reissued "Version You've Never Seen". I wasmortified!Why did they feel the need to add those 11 minutes? Therewas nothing in it that clarified the plot or did anything butmake it 11 minutes longer. Most of it was dialogue that isrepresented elsewhere with the exception of the spiderwalk. And the spider walk doesn't make any sense...whydoes she have blood dripping from her mouth? Did she bite her tongue in her sleep or something?Also, why did they add those effects? When Chris walks inthe night that Burke is killed, you can see one of thesubliminal faces flash in the hood of the stove and animage of the statue in Iraq in the corner of Regan's bedroom. That wasn't in the original release as far as Iknow...why add it? I also noticed a digital effect beforeRegan attacks the hypnotist where her face morphs intoone of the subliminal faces for a split second. Ew.And what's with the extra underscoring and sound effects?Moments that were completely silent in the original releasehad "Shining"-esque chords under them. Also, I noticed alot more background noise in the crowd scenes...most notably when Kinderman is talking to Karras, there aresome obnoxious college students talking rather loudly andobscuring the dialogue.All in all, I'm glad I got to see this movie in the theatre.However, why all the additions that made it less effective?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a strange experience watching the newly-released version of the Exorcist. On one hand, I greatly admired the craft of the movie. The acting is terrific, most of the direction understated (and almost like a documentary) and the low-tech effects still impressive after all the years. The new soundtrack blew me away, with every scratch and eerie howl echoing through the theater walls. The story overall still has power, but many scenes induced laughter in myself and the audience. Inevitable, I supposed. Some due to being very dated (Ellen Burstyn's fashions, the possessed Regan's profanity is tame compared to the "South Park" children, and a doctor's hilariously earnest endorsement of Ritallin as a cure-all), while others were simply too familiar (Regan's bed shaking and convulsions).However, the really "killer" elements of the movie still left everyone gripping their seats. Those semi-subliminal shots of the demon's face still haunt the mind, and the restored "spider walk" sequence is mind-blowing. And, during the exorcism itself, I realized that the audience was dead silent when the priests started shouting, "The power of Christ compels you."The truly strange part of the evening came when I came home. Though a fully grown adult male and well aware that what I watched was the fabrication of a movie studio, I walked around my apartment with a cautious air, checking around every corner, and instinctually flipping on lights. When it was time to go asleep, every shadow and every sound seemed amplified - darker, creepier, larger than usual.For that, I don't care about any of the creakier bits of the Exorcist. It kept me scared hours after the credits rolled, which made it well worth the 8 bucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist has never been my favorite psychological thriller (that would be Psycho), or my favorite 'satanic' film (that would be Rosemary's Baby). But it is ONE of the best films of it's kind ever made.The newly released "author's cut" has some cool added tid-bits (like the 'spider-walk' scene). But the two major additions (a trip to the Dr. before the party scene, and the author's preferred ending) were wisely cut from the first release. The first of these interrupts the building tension and reduces the impact of Regan peeing the carpet in front of her mother's guests. The altered ending doesn't work nearly as well as the original, and adds nothing of substance. I understand that Blatty and Friedkin argued bitterly over this. Friedkin was right!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exorcist comes back after 27 years to haunt us again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exorcist, a movie which is nearly 27 years old, has come back to haunt us again! And it seems people who see it for the very first time seem to be as much shocked as the viewers who saw it in the early 70s.Exorcist, I believe in many ways, is a good horror story. First a little girl's soul being taken over by devil is quite original in its own terms. Innocence falling victim to evil forces. The screenplay, based upon that theme, is quite terrifying. However, there are some parts I have to criticize: 1) There are some scenes in the movie that are left out of context. For instance, the scene in the church where it is showing the statue of Virgin Mary having being tampered with. This scene lasts only about 2-3 seconds and is out of context. Who has done it? And why? Is it the devil? Isn't devil busy taking over Regan's soul? 2) Now here what bothers me most about this classical horror picture: After they tie Regan to bed, she totally transforms from a human being into a demon. I mean she looks just like a demon; she doesn't look anything like a human being. Her eyes, her face, her voice, I mean she totally becomes a demon-like creature. What I don't understand is that they still treat her like as if she is a sick person. I mean try to recall the reactions of the characters that witness a transformation of a man into a werewolf standing next to them. Do they get scared and run away, feeling the presence of an evil being or do they try to speak to the newly transformed creature as if he is the same being. The girl is completely gone, there is almost nothing left of her but they insist to speak to her as if she is still conscious. The way doctors look at her after all that transformation is utterly ridiculous. They seem barely in shock. It is a demon they are looking at!!! But they look as if it is normal, like something they see everyday! Instead they should be more shocked, more scared, more in the awareness of the fact that the being they are dealing with is not a girl anymore, it is a demon. My guess is that, in the original screenplay, the transformation she goes through is not very outstanding, not very conspicuous; she preserves 75% of her original looks, and that's why all the other characters around her treat her as if she is really sick. But when they were shooting the movie they must have gone way too far than what is in the original script in terms of creating her looks. There is no way, anyone can perceive that being as a sick little girl, it is a demon-creature. That is, I think is the mistake, which is bothering me most.What I like most about the movie? The performance of the mother is just amazing. And the unforgettable score, "Tubular Bells" by Mike Oldfield. Here's another criticism: They don't play that score often enough; they should have played it more often. And what about the 11 minute restored parts? I have seen this movie years ago so I am not sure but I guess the only additions are the sudden flashes of devil's image in background, in the dark and the image of devil's statute on the wall of Regan's bedroom. My personal feeling is that these scenes are either totally new or restored because I don't remember seeing them when I have first seen the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic has its soundtrack and visuals digitally spruced up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A new digitally spruced up version of the classic film, `The Exorcist', has been released to theaters. The soundtrack now has subtle and loud and scary sound effects. The visuals contain various subliminal Devilish faces flashed quickly at certain points and 11 minutes of material deleted from the final cut, but included in similar form on the currently available DVD release in a superb documentary. Otherwise, the tale still packs quite a wallop. Its impact is certainly greater on the big theater screen. The key to the film's class is the perfect performance of Max Von Sydow in the title roll. The iconic scene where he arrives at the home of the possessed Regan still sends chills up the spine. The gross out scenes are still there (pea soup, head twirling and rattling bed). In addition there is the cut cult scene of Regan scrambling spider-like down the stairs drooling blood. And, on it goes. If you've never seen it in a theater it is worthwhile. If you like a good scare and don't mind the gore, it's not as disgusting as some of the more recent slice and dice epics. Be sure to rent the DVD to hear William Friedkin (director) and William Peter Blatty (writer, also novel) heatedly discussing the deleted scenes which have been added to this version. The new ending slightly blunts the coldness of the original, but the optimism of the new millennium gives the added scene a definite resonance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually watched the re-release and it was truly incredible. Not that there is much difference, but overall the movie is still the greatest horror-flick of all-time. The one feature in the re-release which I found VERY creepy was the flash-frame shots of demonic creatures. Because of it you the viewer can pin-point the exact moment when she becomes possessed by the devil, and realize that almost the entire house has been taken over by Lucifer himself. Although they look cheesy and are on for about half a second, it still creeped me out. For a second-time viewing, I still had chills throughout the entire flick, and had to look away at the crucifix scene -- the most disturbing footage I think has ever been recorded. Still, when she rises out of the bed and floats on air, you truly see the power of Satan, and the continuing struggle rages on until a climactic finale. Overall, superbly well-done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief Comments on the New Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had a few brief comments on the "New Version", which I saw this past weekend. I won't say too much about the film in general, because the public consensus on "the Film" speaks for itself.The addition of the medical examination and "spider-walk" scenes were a definite plus. The first actually made the story more coherent, while the second was just damned cool!The additional dialogue between Father Merrin and Father Karras was okay, but it wasn't necessary.The new ending is c**p. The original ending was perfect for the original movie, and would be perfect for the new version. Some of the additional subliminal shots of the demonic face were quite effective, but most of these extra touches just seemed gimmicky.The new sound mix. Wow! One or two speakers does not do this movie justice. The DVD, 5.1 digital mix is great. But the new mix for this theatrical release is perfect!So that's what I think. Of course, they could've re-released the original version in theaters, and I would still have seen it. This movie must be experienced in a theater at least once!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In terms of sheer terror this movie is definitely one of the best films of all time. For me, this movie ranks right up there with The Omen. It's too bad that inferior sequels were made to these movies. One subtle scene that definitely underlies the terror of this movie and which describes the character of the devil is the bar room scene, in which The Allman Brother's "Ramblin' Man" plays on the jukebox. Both the subtle scenes like this one and the more direct scenes of the movie add to the appeal of this everfresh movie. I can't wait to see the newly re-released version in the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blood curdling classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film on TV a couple of years ago. When the scary stuff started happening, I shut off the TV in a panic. It took a while for me to gather the courage to watch it again. For those who don't know the full plot, here it is. A normal, sweet little girl named Regan starts to act strange one day. She starts to have an imaginary friend and be isolated. Then it gets worse, she starts to have violent outbursts and swear. Then she pees on a floor. She is taken to psychiatrist after psychiatrist but they all fail to solve the problem. Then, it really gets awful. She becomes horrendously ugly and speaks horrific atrocities in a satanic voice (Kudos to Mercades McCambridge for her beyond excellent voice acting as the demon. She ate raw eggs, rotten apple cores and smoked many packs of cigarettes to get the desired effect). She vomits out pea soup and her head turns completely around. Finally, the shocked and terrified actress mother turns to God. She calls over two priests to perform an exorcism on little Reagan and get out the demon inside her. One of them is young and represents the younger generation of the day. The other is old and represents the old school. The greatest battle between good and evil for the soul of an innocent little girl is going to occur. Who will win. Can Reagan be saved. This is a very sick film. To think of what the whole cast had to go through when making this film makes me sick. Especially poor little Linda Blair who had to wear all that grotesque makeup, vomit pea soup, bear temperatures of well below zero in a nightgown, etc. She didn't even know what this film was about. She thought it was a Frankenstien movie! Also, some scenes and things Satan says are absolutely outrageous. Especially the crucifix sequence. But, this is an excellent film. It's absolutely top notch, everything about it. The hard work put into this film really payed off!! It ends up being certainly one of the greatest horror films ever. And guess what..I'm going to see this awesome film on the big screen tomorrow. But..This film is very very scary. Do not watch this with the lights off! And if your squeamish or have a heart condition, don't even think of seeing this film. The image of Regan's face possessed can still cause bone chilling nightmares. My rating ***** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very powerful overall story, but somewhat confusing at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing I liked about this movie was that we got to see the work of God's hands, through the priests, defeat an inferior supernatural force: Satan. The scenes of Reagan when she was becoming more and more possessed by the devil are absolutely horrifying; I don't think they can ever be outdated. Those of you who don't think those scenes were scary have apparently had too many encounters with Satan yourselves and are just too used to that sort of thing! Or, maybe you just thought it seemed too fake. But that kind of thing really happens to people - maybe not the distortion of their faces and voices in such a way - but that's why there are so many evil people in the world. Anyway, I've never seen anything so scary but it was awesome watching God, the GOOD supernatural force on the other end of the spectrum, working to protect Reagan and the others in the movie. The only thing that bothered me about this movie that I couldn't get past was that the doctors who first examined her when she was starting to act "strange" didn't seem at all horrified by the way she was acting - and more notably, by the way her voice was changing! They seemed puzzled by it, but that was about it. Only her mother seemed rightly horrified by it, and even she didn't freak out as much as I would expect a mother with a Satan-possessed child to! Other than that, the movie was excellent. A true classic that should be taken for what its message is worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can just imagine how this film was the scariest film ever seen when it first came out. Imagine, in 1973 a movie coming out about a 12 year old sweet little girl who is gradually becoming possessed by the devil, and starts spitting out the most vile and embarrassing profanities, that would even have the average movieaudience turning red now. A priest getting green vomit in the face. Physical decline. And thrown in a lot of psychological and emotional pain for some of the characters, played by an extremely well performing cast. Although a movie like this wouldn't shock as nearly as much today, it still hardly seems dated.Most of the "possession" movie have been inspired by this classic, from "Evil dead" to "Fallen".Sequels differ in quality, with the dreadful "Exorcist 2-the heretic" and the almost worthy "Exorcist III - Legion".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece that was ahead of its time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand why this film caused so many reactions back in 1973 now that I've seen the film myself. There are few horror films that attain to be realistic. The Exorcist is one of them and it does it in such a shocking and powerful way that even nowadays, over 25 years later, it has the ability to scare the viewer or at least make him feel very uncomfortable. The fact that the film is based on a true story increases this feeling even more.The Exorcist is closer to perfection than almost every other movie I have seen. The acting is exceptionally good for a horror film. Especially Jason Miller (as Damien Karras) in his first feature film role does an excellent job and never loses his credibility. Linda Blair is simply amazing as Regan/the demon. Another strong point is the location (Washington D.C.) because the evil is not in a dark forest somewhere far away, it is among civilization.State-of-the-art special effects (like the spinning head) make sure that the film doesn't get ridiculous, something that often happens when the plot is more developed than the special effects. William Friedkin, the director, demanded the best from crew and cast. Everything that wasn't exactly as he wanted it to be just wasn't used in the film (in the BBC-documentary you even learn that Friedkin threw the original soundtrack over the street (no kidding!) because he didn't like it). That's why this film became an all-time classic, because every single element was driven to perfection.Everybody should see this film, not only fans of the genre.My rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An experience 'beyond comprehension'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To realistically and justifiably sum up my views and emotions after viewing The Exorcist for the first time I would have to say that the experience was (to borrow from the tag line)'Something beyond comprehension'. Taking the classic confrontation between good and evil away from a bestial netherland setting and into the modernised confines of suburban Washington DC, The Exorcist is probably one of the most plausible supernatural feature films of all time. Beyond the graphic depiction of the evil exemplified in the movie is a very strong and poignant connotation. Be it the importance of Religion in our path of life, the existence of supernatural beings in the world or probing further into the context; the obliteration of the American dream.To say that The Exorcist is a horror film out to give the audience a cheap scare is pure idiocy. Each and everyone of those who saw the movie over a quarter of a century ago walked out of the theatre and learned a bit about themselves... they learned to better themselves! Unfortunately some pressure groups would force feed the media with phoney tales of suicides linked to the movie, but when a protestor gets that desperate... its just par for the course! Having lived in the UK all my life I am aware of the profound affect that The Exorcist had on audiences when released in March 1974, but I know for a fact that whatever reports were made by the press about audience members dying were unbearably blown out of proportion! In 1974 the media wanted BBFC chief censor Stephen Murphy out of the job! Not only because of passing The Exorcist with a theatrical certificate, but with passing Straw Dogs, A Clockwork Orange, Last Tango In Paris and other controversial motion pictures that were released almost back to back from 1971 to 1974, causing the media to fight back! Now, there is an up and a downside to this circumstance. First of all had The Exorcist not caused the moral panic it did back in 1974 I do not believe that the popularity of the movie in the UK would be what it is... soaring! And the fact that it did lead to the video ban in 1986, allowing its re-release to entrap a new generation of cinema goers. Moving all preferred connotations to one side for one moment, it is all important to merit The Exorcist for what it actually is, a superb example of tour de force film making! With a beautifully written screenplay from the evenly stunning novel by William Peter Blatty, director William Friedkin was able to visualise and handcraft the movie scene by scene with the patience and persistence of his perfect cast. The pace and overall build up of the movie illustrates characterization not apparent in your average horror movie. To conclude The Exorcist experience is something that you will share longevity with... you will question the experience, constantly look back on the experience and eventually recur the experience - like it or not! You never see The Exorcist only once! That's why my friends, it is an experience... 'beyond comprehension.'</fullReview>

I usually just fast forward to the point where Chris is in the attic. That's where it starts getting good.

All i got was a bunch of gory scenes and Linda Blair raping herself with a cross, and when it was all over, a very bad taste in my mouth.

		<fullReview>The night before seeing The Exorcist, I watched a programme on TV, "The Fear of God: 25 Years of the Exorcist". And from this it said that when this film first opened back in '73 people were walking out of the film halfway through to be sick, and the remainder exited the film stunned, some even muttering "Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus....". So naturally my curiosity had been peaked. The greatest horror movie of all time, banned on video in the UK. This must be an interesting film. WRONG!!!!!!!! There wasn't a single scary scene in the entire film, and it took so long to finally get going, I nearly fell asleep. To be perfectly honest, it was funny rather than scary. The whole cinema was in fits of laughter throughout. Well how would you react to a deep-voiced 12 year old girl swearing to a couple of priests, a head twisting round and what the hell was she doing with her tongue. I'm sure that when the film first came out, the people were naive enough to actually believe such a ridiculous storyline, but nowadays it's just plain hilarious. Why it isn't released on video is a mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since its release, "The Exorcist" seems to have played a very large role in the popular culture. Even 25 years after its original opening, references to projectile vomiting or someone turning their head all the way around immediately recall this movie. So, when I finally sat down to watch this film, I had high expectations. Sadly, these expectations were not met. The effects were very well done, and the movie was quite scary in places (more so than silly slasher flicks like "Friday the 13th", anyway), but the plot and character development left much to be desired. Ellen Burstyn's character, the mother of the possessed girl, is one-dimensional at best, and is frequently very annoying, while Max von Sydow's Father Merrin seems almost totally undeveloped despite spending a fair amount of time on the screen. The only human character with any interesting development at all is Jason Miller's Father Karras. The most important character, though, and the one whose development is perhaps most lacking, is the Devil himself. He possesses this little girl, and does all sorts of disgusting and violent things with her, but his motives in doing so are totally unexplained. In this regard, the climax of the film also seems terribly silly. Frankly, if the sort of stuff shown in this film is the best that the Devil can do, I wouldn't be too terribly scared of him.Overall Rating: 5 (out of 10), or 2 stars (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do people become priests or nuns?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing the fictional, based on reality, film does quite well is answer why people become priests. The answer is often the same for nuns. Although many today believe that anyone, no matter how poor, can become president or a doctor, there are still many others who think it isn't realistic to do that in one generation. For them the church offers much more interesting and rewarding jobs than the secular world. They don't become forceful, but they do become respected and consulted. As a project for a journalism class several people who had become priests or nuns were interviewed in order to find out why they did that. None gave the expected answer that they were called by the Holy Spirit. They were just poor people whose best opportunity for interesting work was offered them by the church. If in history rich families often considered it a blessing to give one child over to such work, that was not seen in the recent limited survey. Although none mentioned witnessing spiritual phenomena, it is often the case that people who have witnessed it avoid public discussion of it since it is usually not accepted or understood by the public. Although I believe the movie would work fine without the vile and disgusting language and recommend an edited for television version, there is a case made for its socially redeeming value. The movie paints a clear picture of the poverty that Karras left for his "prestigious" job in the church. It seems real priests and nuns have that much in common with the fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1973...you had to be there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing much to say about "The Exorcist" these many years after it first caused a nationwide sensation. Is this the "scariest movie ever made"? Perhaps. And perhaps not depending upon how old you are.Without going into the particulars of plot, which everyone knows by now, this film is rife with the most mundane terrors piled up until the viewer feels suffocated. I saw this astonishing film the night it opened in Cincinnati, 1973, right before Christmas. Everything you've heard about initial audiences' reactions to this film is 100% true. The USA was a kinder nation in 1973, the wounds of the 1960s were healing, Vietnam was gone (or nearly gone), the world seemed more at peace, and life went on. No one, even readers of William Peter Blatty's novel suspected what was in store when they paid for a ticket (around $1.25), so within moments of the film's start, entire audiences were struck dumb, horrified, and looking to get away from the images on screen. I wish all the naysayers who rate this low because they've been jaded over the past decades by increasing violence on a pornographic level substituting for fear and the overuse of CG effects, could experience what I did that night. The audience was gripped, something I've never seen since. Yes, there were those that ran out, and several who fainted. William Friedkin's unrelenting pressure was a painful thing. Once over, I walked out speechless with my father and sister. No one had anything to say, because no one had ever seen anything like this before. The echoes of "The Exorcist" stayed with most people for years, matched only by the shade of Norman Bates and an unfortunate shower.Watching this slow ride to Hell in the millennium hasn't reduced it's power. Seeing "The Exorcist" again several times over the decades reveals a number of creeping terrors that have nothing to do with the possession of Regan. Loss of control. Loss of faith. Loss of power. Loss of identity by old age. Loss of loved ones who might have been saved. Loss of rational thought. Loss of faith in medical science. And many others. It's impossible to think that anyone could improve or remake this film. Perhaps the most frightening thing left to those viewers over 50 years ago is that they could see themselves stranded without hope in a situation beyond their capabilities to control. Naturally, the intense direction, razor- sharp editing, special effects and brilliant acting by all involved helped to make this film something many wished to forget. As if they could.Laugh all you wish if you think this "movie" is clunky, overrated, and just plain silly. It's OK. We now have erupting world violence and public beheadings to keep you awake at night. However, you weren't there at a crucial time in American history, one which was ripe for the terrors unleashed by one of the most astute directors who ever helmed a major project. There's a reason this film hasn't been remade, and that's simply because it couldn't be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist is one of the scariest and most original horror films of all-time, and it's listed as the scariest film ever made; many critics, fans, websites and more include it in their/its top ten scariest films list. There hasn't been a list (that i have come across) that hasn't had it place there in one of the spots. The Exorcist isn't as scary as many people make it out to be. Certainly, it's a creepy, scary, and haunting film that will guarantee children (if by chance see it) or most teens will get scared after the viewing. Now, I first seen it when I was about eleven or maybe twelve years old. I didn't think it was THAT SCARY --- then again, that's probably because it doesn't scare me now, back then I was probably terrified of it, but i'm trying not to say HOW SCARED i really was of it. It's pretty eerie, with some right horrific scares and dream-fiddling moments that will probably leave you with a jaw the size of Jaws the shark. You're probably thinking "What's this guy on about?" but the truth is, it's nice to throw in some mixes of hyperbole/similes/onomatopoeia and then some. But yes, quite literally, it will make your jaw drop and your eyes bash together as if there's something wrong - that's JUST HOW SCARY some of the scenes in this chilling horror are. Overall, it's a great film, and it's a proper 70s classic. 8.0/10.P.S. the second film's a let down if being made as a comparison to this one, and I would only rate it a 4 or 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another overrated movie of all time from the director of THE FRENCH CONNECTION</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the holy grail to modern horror movies. Although i didn't view it upon its initially released in 1974, nor was i terrified by it, i found the film to be deeply moving. Since it's reality based in it's storytelling and style, it came across not as horror film but as a supernatural documentary thriller. It was the scariest story of demonic possession ever put on film. I don't know what's its contemporary modern equivalent. If anybody is going to say Paranormal Activity, well you're wrong. Viewing the first one left me seriously bored. The 2010 bluray release for this film is an amazing transfer. I would highly recommend owning it if you're a fan of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ground breaking horror film, unmistakable 1970s style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this film again for the first time in over 30 years. I had forgotten much of it. It is a really fine film.Great performances. Ellen Burstyn makes you feel a mother's anguish over her daughter's distress. Linda Blair's performance was challenging in ways that were unique for a film of that time, and she pulled it off well. Max von Sydow is always solid.The outstanding performance was Jason Miller as the troubled Jesuit priest/psychiatrist. One of the great things about 1970s film-making, in the days before CG, was the depth of character development. The script, the director, and Miller himself give a highly nuanced perception to this man, his personal demons, his fears, and his will to do battle on behalf of the possessed girl, Reagan.Well worth watching a first or second time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist (1971): The Good, the Bad and the UnholySynopsis: The "original" tale of possession and exorcism with rich, religious undertones that set the world ablaze with it's audacity. A young girl is possessed by Satan himself and aided by two priests fighting demons of their own.The Good: Even now, forty years later, the film is disturbing. That means something to an avid horror buff like myself. Deemed a classic or not, I call a spade a spade. If it's no longer gory or scary or disturbing in the here and now, I don't mince words. Too many films have lost their sparkle as the years have faded, but not The Exorcist. The film is as shocking and audacious as it was the year it came out. There have been far too many possession-style movies heaped into the market as of late and all will pale in comparison to the original. The idea was too brilliant: take a young, angelic girl and have her possessed by the devil himself and don't hold back on the shock factor. The result is chilling even by today's standards. Sure, the effects look a tad dated, but the core theme burns into minds like it's a new film and it affects you. That's the real trick... being affected. It's why we watch movies. This movie, regardless of how many times viewed, affects you. That is success in the horror genre.The Bad: At times, the pacing is horribly slow. It is, in essence, dramatic horror, but there are far too many scenes that bog the movie down in dramatic dialogue. The movie could be just as effective if it was twenty minutes shorter. Despite the poor pacing in parts, there are also portions of the movie that feel rushed, like the onset of the possession. There are moments where the characters "tell" you that Regan is "getting" worse, but you are not shown, and it gives a bit of a "huh?" effect to the plot. These are minor gripes though and at times the slow moving parts allow for a more shocking affect when the possession scenes come.The Unholy: To think a parent allowed their eleven year old daughter to act in this movie aside, Linda Blair's performance lends credence to the whole movie actually working. Had Regan's part been cast to an adult, the movie falls apart. It would have been a forgotten part of cinematic history like so many others. The chilling affect is only because you see a child doing very un-childlike things. The audience is fully disturbed by thinking of their own child behaving in such a way or using vulgar language. It's a shock to the senses. The angelic look and portrayal of Regan in the beginning of the film only adds depth to the stark contrast of the demon she becomes. Brilliantly conceived and brilliantly acted on Blair's part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest Horror Film Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Peter Blatty's disturbing novel is graphically brought to life by director William Friedkin in this terrifying film about young woman Regan Macneil(played superbly by Linda Blair) who gradually becomes possessed by an evil demon bent on destruction, and defiance of God. Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow play the two priests called on by the church to repel the demon, but both men have inner demons of their own, which the possessed Regan uses to taunt and kill them. Ellyn Burstyn plays her mother, who is in way over her head. Lee J. Cobb rounds out the cast as an investigating police detective.Disturbing, no holds barred thriller goes right for the viewers throat, and never lets go, resulting in arguably the most frightening film ever made, further helped by the unsettling and unforgettable "Tubular Bells" music store. Whole cast is superb, script first-rate. Though undeniably shocking and profane, it serves a purpose dramatically, and still has the power to move the viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>40 years. In 4 decades it has reigned as King of horror films. Hundreds have tried and failed to leave so much as a mark on its epic notoriety. And it's legend is in no way over exaggerated. First of all, the fact that this was the first film of it's kind, garners immediate intrigue. Whats equally impressive is that it smashes any boundaries that may have been there; the gruesome scenes, the cut throat dialogue, everything just appeared limitless. It is one of the reasons why every film that has followed has been unable to surpass it, to better it. It has left no room to improve or outdo it. You could say that it is pointless trying, but maybe one day someone will find the genius and innovation to overcome it's iconic stature. The acting is superb by all, but of course the ultimate plaudits have to go to Linda Blair as Regan. To go from a sweet little girl, to a seemingly mentally troubled child, to then a possessed, demonic entity. As a child to act that way, to be part of those scenes, to be the main focus of such a horrific film can only gain praise. Over the years we have seen action films become more explosive, more adventurous. Comedies have become more versatile and more inventive. Thrillers more thought provoking, with twists and turns. But in regards to horror films nothing has came close to The Exorcist9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This contains spoilers so I suggest you don't read if you haven't watched the film: I saw this on its 25th anniversary remake under perfect conditions (alone, sober, on a dark November night in the cinema). 15 years later it still affects me. I was intrigued by the most scary film ever made epithet but thought that this surely didn't apply any more to a film made in 1973. The first 40 minutes confirmed my thoughts - slow, boring, with a poor special effect of the Pazuzu statue and barking dogs in the desert. Yup, this was a dated, boring film. But suddenly, the psychologist comes along and speaks 'to the person inside Regan', and it all changes. That voice is heard, and it gets scarier and scarier from then on. A few of the scenes which stand out for me: the fit she has at the hospital, which we watch on a CCTV type screen - very creepy; the holy water scene, with the water ripping scars in her legs; the talking backwards tape replay when the phone rings suddenly (is it her? I wondered); the demon's voice; the horrific sound affects when they're downstairs looking at the bedroom; the scene when the objects in the bedroom are spinning around; the headturning scene and its sound effect; teasing the audience by slowly zooming in on the bedroom door - what does she look like now?, I wondered in terror. Excellent use of light and sound really increase the fear affect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Scariest Films Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is a horror film directed by William Friedkin and that is adapted by William Peter Blatty from his novel of the same title which is inspired by the 1949 exorcism case of Roland Doe that deals with the demonic possession of a young girl and her mother's desperate attempts to win back her daughter through an exorcism conducted by two priests.This happens to be the last known Catholic-sanctioned exorcism in the United States. The film features Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Jason Miller, Lee J. Cobb, Linda Blair, and Mercedes McCambridge.The screenplay is about a little girl named Regan. Suddenly prone to fits and bizarre behavior, Regan proves quite a handful for her actress- mother, Chris MacNeil. When Regan gets completely out of hand, Chris calls in young priest Father Karras, who becomes convinced that the girl is possessed by the Devil and that they must call in an exorcist: namely, Father Merrin. His foe proves to be no run-of-the-mill demon, and both the priest and the girl suffer numerous horrors during their struggles. The film rides its supernatural theme to magical effect, with remarkable special effects and an eerie atmosphere, resulting in one of the scariest films of all time and also if are, among other things, opportunities for escapism, then it is one of the most powerful ever made.This notorious battle between good and evil is both a hysteric scream and an intentional as well as unintentional hoot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very slow deliberate pace may not be to everyone's taste, but it gradually picks up and this gives more impact to the actual exorcism scene. Although I did find there were scenes in the movie that didn't make an awful lot of sense, I still found it quite a compelling watch. I'm not a religious man but I can understand how certain scenes may not be welcomed by some of those that are. I really liked the pacing of the film and the way several threads were woven together at the end. The only thing that was missing (for me) was a little more background on Father Merrin. Over all though, an excellent piece of work and one I have no problem in deeming HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 8.9/10IMDb Score: 8.1/10 (based on 156,543 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 82/100: (Based on 24 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 85/100 (based on 47 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 83/100 'Liked It' (based on 308,690 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only interesting for specific audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorzist is a rather long movie. And yet you get the feeling, that crucial scenes and information are missing in order to shorten it. Maybe it's because the movie deals with a story, that takes place over a long period of time. Still there would have been better ways to keep the playtime at a reasonable length. For example, you see a lot of scenes with Damien and his mother. But the maybe most important scene about her death and him finding her is only referred to in lines shortly and not even shown, even though it affected his live greatly.There were many discussions about The Exorzist, after it was aired. It is understandable, since there are many gross and violent scenes involving a child (Linda Blair). You don't see this kind of things happen oft in movies and it's kind of disturbing. At the same time I noticed the poor effects used in the movie. Regans face changes in some scenes in an unlikely way. That may be because those scenes were played by Eileen Dietz instead of Linda Blair, due to youth protection reasons. A lot of the lines are surprisingly amusing, such as the talks about clean rats at the loft.This movie might be interesting to watch, but it draws its appeal almost entirely from the violence and nastiness. The acting is sometimes bad. The Exorzist is altogether uncommon enough to keep you interested but the story is rather superficial, so I'd recommend the movie only to a specific target group, that enjoys this kind of things. For anyone else, it's maybe average entertainment. 5/10</fullReview>

The head spin the crucifix spider walk all little things its more disturbing that scary. In the day yes it would have been proper scary horror but even now people still hype up the exorcist to be a brilliant scary film when its clearly not. OK the appearance of the girl the make up the thought of it questioning your beliefs or whatever, it is still a generally good film i just wished that it wasn't hyped up so much to be shockingly scary i gave it 5 out of 10 mainly for the fact that its a good film and the plot is very well put together. but i realised that it is disturbing so i gave it a 6 ! don't watch it if your looking for scary i recommend REC or paranormal activity 28 weeks later or if your still looking for that same exorcism genre then the last exorcism will do it watch this for being disturbed not because you want to be scared !</fullReview>

And your maybe thinking that people my age only like incredibly bad, unfunny and un-entertaining films like white chicks, scary movie etc. But like most film fanatics i do have taste in films unlike other people my age.The exorcist. Number one on every scaries movie ever poll.But is it?Of course at the time of it's release my mother went to see it. And like hell she warned me not to watch it. But i watched the directors cut.First of all. The cast was all very well chosen right up to the priest who was played fantastically. The mood of the film starts off on an easy pace,but then everything begins to become unsettiling. After unsetteling everything builds up to a terrefying melanchony,dark and disturbing atmosphere.The special effects were all well done considering that they weren't done in post production.But what makes the exorcist so blood curtling? Is it the atmosphere,the effects,the make-up. Perhaps it's all the events. Like the 360 head spin or the spider walk.You only know how scary it is until you see it.But please don't watch it expecting a scary film keep in mind it is a drama toooverall. Why doesn't this bloody site let you put above 10 starts?!!!!?????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huge fan of horror movies yet just for the thrill as I'm not one who gets scared easily. But more than thirty years on, The Exorcist remains a very powerful film and was a cinematographic milestone in 1973. Repeated duplication of the genre has, no doubt, 'desensitized' a new generation of movie-watchers, though it remains an unnerving masterpiece. It is not difficult to understand why the film sent a shock wave around the world all those years ago, since it imposed an unprecedented sensory attack on the viewer. Regan's vile physical appearance, combined with her vile language and blasphemous diatribe sent a shock wave around the world. Moreover, many people seemed to believe the claims that the film was based on a true story and could therefore actually happen to them. Electricity consumption must have soared for several months in 1973 as people who had seen the film slept with their lights on! It is still not a film I would feel comfortable watching before going to bed. On another level, I found parts of it profoundly moving and actually cried at the end when Regan was finally released from her possessor and cried in the arms of her mother and Father Damien, having lunged himself through a window and down a precipitous flight of steps managed to find just enough life in himself to indicate that he had retained his faith and repented of his sins by motioning his fingers in the sign of penitence when comforted by a distraught colleague. Possibly the only thing that lets the film down if one really sits and thinks about it is the underpinning concept that an ancient demon which had existed since the dawn of time should wish to possess the body of a twelve year old child and emit a string of juvenile profanities. But then the film was designed to shock all along!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie came out, there were more than a few people who were very disturbed by it. My mother was one of them. She stayed for the entire movie, but told me there were people literally crawling up the aisles in the middle of the movie. She called our pastor to talk about how the movie bothered her. That the movie bothered people speaks volumes. The topic of evil, true evil, invading our lives and the lives of our loved ones is one we rarely face, but the Exorcist forced many to face it. But the topic is a gripping one. The story was well written. You are drawn in to the story and soon feel the terror of the principals. The acting was outstanding. Linda Blair was very good in her role. She was believable as the young girl and she was extremely creepy when Regan was "possessed." Jason Miller, who was new to the silver screen, was incredible as Father Karras. Of course, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb and Ellen Burstyn were outstanding. While the acting was great, some credit should be given the casting direction, not only for casting the actors I've mentioned, but for the inspired casting of non-actors in some critical roles. First among these were Vasiliki Maliaros, who was cast as the mother of Father Karras. She had no previous acting experience and was discovered working in a Greek restaurant. It was her only movie. There is also Father Thomas Bermingham and Father William O'Malley. O'Malley was very good as Father Dyer and his acting was not only extremely good, but if you had told me he was a priest while I was watching the Exorcist, I wouldn't have believed you. I thought he was a trained and experienced actor. The direction of this movie was second to none. Not overly loud, but not silent, shocking when it needed to be, but not so much so that the shocking moments lose their punch. The movie starts quietly and builds to it's climax. It isn't rushed, but was actually crafted to keep you in suspense and giving you the shock of your life. This is how horror movies should be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist tells the story of a young girl who becomes possessed by the Devil. Her mother doesn't know what's wrong with her, hiring doctors and psychiatrists. Eventually, the possession gets so bad that she finally turns to a priest who is losing his faith to perform an exorcism on her daughter.The Exorcist isn't my favourite horror film, but I can definitely see why some people love it so much. I'm of the opinion that any horror movie that involves religion at all is especially creepy. This movie is no exception. Every scene that deals with the possession is strongly disturbing. Linda Blair does great as the possessed little girl and she really has to be congratulated for her acting here, considering the things she had to do and say in this movie were far too mature for her. Every role in this movie was expertly played, so you can't really complain about corny 70's acting.The plot of the film is really good. The fact that it is loosely based on a true event makes it creepy going in. Then you have all the disturbing scenes in the film like the spider walk down the stairs, or her head spinning 360 degrees. Mercedes McCambridge makes the film, providing her incredibly creepy voice for the voice of the Devil. The creepiest thing about this movie however, isn't the Devil's voice. It's his face. Subliminally throughout the entire film, the Devil's face pops onto the screen for less than a second and disappears. This is what leaves you scared after viewing the film. Just the thought of seeing that face on your wall.The Exorcist is the definition of a classic horror film.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Exorcist" is one of the funniest unintentional comedies made.**SPOILERS**Father Damien Karras, (Jason Miller) is worried, since the death of his mother has caused him to loose his faith. Meanwhile, young Reagan MacNeil, (Linda Blair) has been acting quite unnaturally, and her mother Chris, (Ellen Burstyn) takes her to a series of doctors and psychiatrists to determine the cause of her actions. When they prove useless, Chris finds that an exorcism is the only answer to what has happened. Father Lankester Merrin, (Max Von Sydow) is asked to help Father Karras, and together they try to drive the demon out of Reagan.The Good News: I hate to say this, but I was laughing at this movie. I know it isn't a funny situation or had no funny dialog, but the film has several events where a well-timed joke makes the scene laugh-out-loud funny. It's more of a result of the kind of joke you can make on the situation on hand. It might've been the scariest movie when it came out, but it was pretty hilarious. All hilarity aside, the exorcism scene is one of pure thrills. It's completely compelling, exciting and will never lose a viewer's interest. The events to show Reagan's possession are some great disturbing moments, and all of them combined together give the illusion of something far more shocking and terrifying than any human could ever be. They're all quite impressive and shocking than these scenes.The Bad News: I probably shouldn't have laughed at this movie. It's quite scary, and for the time, this is something that would freak people out. It's quite powerful and shocking.The Final Verdict: I know I shouldn't have laughed during this movie, but I just couldn't help it. It's funny for all the wrong reasons, though, as you make jokes about the situation on screen rather than the situation itself, but it's still not supposed to be hilarious. As this differs from the popular opinion, though: it's your choice to follow, the popular opinion or the loner in the corner laughing at the movie.Rated R: Graphic Language, Demonic images, and a mild masturbation scene</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Exorcist" stills frightens since '73!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Novelist William Peter Blatty &amp; director Willam Friedkin collaborated to create one of the most frightening, thought-provoking, &amp; shocking films of all time. "The Exorcist" challenged the questions of religious faith, mental illness, &amp; validity of demonic possession. In 1973, the film caused quite a stir with moviegoers such as heart attacks, anxiety episodes, vomiting, &amp; theater walk-outs. The public at large was simply terrified by the film's strong adult content, horrific scenes of demonic possession, &amp; strong language. "The Exorcist" is the story of the demonic possession of young Regan Teresa MacNeil. Regan is daughter to Chris MacNeil, successful actress &amp; divorcée. The MacNeils moved to Washington D. C.'s Georgetown area to start over as well as be on location for a film Chris is shooting. All seems well until Regan's behavior &amp; physical appearance begins to take a strange &amp; ugly turn. Somehow, an African demon named Pazuzu &amp; several of his minions escaped from the attic &amp; found their way to poor unsuspecting Regan's bedroom &amp; entered her body. Things really begin to go bad when Regan urinates slime on the floor in front of friends during a party held by Chris. Regan tells party guest Burke Dennings that he would die in her room. The following night Dennings was found dead having fallen out of Regan's window &amp; suffered a severe broken neck so that his head was turned completely around, facing backwards. Lt. William Kinderman, lead police investigator, questions Chris about the murder with little to go on. Kinderman next questions Fr. Damien Karras. Karras gives the detective not much to go on either other than sarcasm &amp; standoffishness. Karras is a priest who has lost his faith &amp; is thinking of leaving the priesthood. Karras cares for an ill mother who needs to be institutionalized. Tired &amp; wayward, Karras lives a life of inner turmoil, alcohol dependency, &amp; guilt for his mother's condition. Fr. Karras meets with fellow Jesuit &amp; longtime friend Fr. Dyer to talk about his lost faith &amp; consideration of leaving the priesthood. Unbeknownst to Karras, his faith or lack thereof will be surely tested to the breaking point soon enough. Worried &amp; distraught, Chris takes Regan on a painful journey of hospital tests that reveal nothing concrete. As a last ditch effort, Chris has a hypnotherapist visit the home to help Regan. While under hypnosis, the secret of Regan's behavior is revealed in demons possessing her soul, lead by Pazuzu. From here on in, Regan's possession racks her body with ulcerated sores, foul smells, blistered skin, a very mature &amp; evil speaking voice, &amp; superior strength. The demon's true form has surfaced, turning Regan into a twisted, hideous, &amp; frightening entity. Desperate to help her sick child, Chris enlists the services of the cynical Fr. Karras to see, authenticate, &amp; possibly perform an exorcism. Karras sees Regan &amp; believes her condition to be "psychological" in nature. Karras audio taped &amp; used fake holy water with Regan during his session. After another session with Regan &amp; more strange behavior displayed, Fr. Karras believes that Regan is in need of an exorcism. During the night, Fr. Karras is summoned by her Chris' assistant to show her a message of "Help me" written on Regan's stomach. Fr. Karras now knows that this sweet child is trapped inside herself &amp; needs assistance to be set free.Karras goes to the Archbishop to get his blessing &amp; was turned down. The Archbishop agrees to let Karras perform the ancient ritual under the guidance of weathered Jesuit priest &amp; archaeologist Fr. Lankester Merrin who has performed exorcisms in the past &amp; is the most experienced in the field. When Fr. Merrin arrives, the possessed Regan calls out to the priest &amp; bears down for battle. Fr. Merrin &amp; Fr. Karras conduct the ritual of exorcism with little results. Regan curses, raises her bed off the floor, shakes the room, moves objects, twists her head in a complete turn, &amp; spews green slime in buckets. Regan's demons lie &amp; curse the two priests in hopes of breaking their faith &amp; their will. Fr. Merrin tells Fr. Karras not to listen to the Devil's words &amp; stay strong. But Fr. Karras is afraid, afraid of his diminished faith &amp; the guilt of his mother's death. Regan speaks to Fr. Karras in his mother's voice to shake him even further but resists. The two Jesuits continue the Exorcism Rites, slowly wearing down the defiant Regan. Fr. Merrin, tiring fast, stops to take his nitroglycerin pill for his heart condition. Taking a break, Fr. Karras leaves the frail Merrin alone with Regan. The weary Merrin proceeds to counsel Regan with disastrous results. Fr. Karras returns to the bedroom where he finds Fr. Merrin dead lying next to the bed of a jubilant Regan laughing evilly. Angered by Reagan's treachery, Fr. Karras attacks the demonic Regan &amp; begs her to allow her possession to enter his body in order to release the girl from her curse. The demons leave Regan &amp; invade Fr. Karras who leaps out of her bedroom window, falling to his death with a fractured skull. Shortly thereafter, Chris &amp; a recovered Regan leave Georgetown to begin again. Karras friend &amp; fellow priest Fr. Dyer stops by as Chris &amp; Regan prepare to leave. Chris tells him that Regan remembers nothing about the possession, killings, or the exorcism. Fr.

		<shortDescription>this is without a doubt the scariest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>amazing. its a good plot and a great cast. Linda Blair gave a good strong performance as a young girl who starts to have some nerve problems.... but after a while it starts to get much worse. It starts some odd normal preteen behavior then some sick profound language and an unforgettable scenes: the infamous masturbation crucifix scenes. which is still the most shocking piece of footage in cinematic history. Ellen Burstlyn gives a fantastic performance as the mother of the daughter in unspeakable jeopardy. a good story of god vs Satan. a story of a 12-year-old girl possessed by an demonic force. the language, the masochistic voice, the amazing strength. and the amazing makeup make her extremely sadistic. . the mother first goes to doctors for a medical explanation, then to shrinks for a psychological explanation, then after Regen spins her head and does sick things she goes to "witch doctors" to drive out the evil spirit. Let's not forget the famous green slime puke scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OMG, people are really nuts if they laughed at this movie! It is brilliance in a camera lens.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fifteen year old girl and I whole heartedly believe that this movie really does live up to its reputation. It truly is the scariest movie of all time. The cast, the settings, the whole idea behind the movie. Brilliant. I don't care what anyone says. And for the so called "horror movie lovers" who openly admitted to saying that they laughed at the movie, well they really need professional help. A true horror movie lover would know that you need suspense, a lot of it actually, for the really scary parts to live up to it's potential and for them to really make sense. I don't get why people find an 80 minute slasher really that horrifying! Any oversexed teenagers can be in the middle of expressing their "oh so apparent love" to one another and SLICE, the guy's head gets cut off, oh yes, defiantly SOOOO SCARY! (Sarcasm PEOPLE!) Another reason why this movie is absolutely superb is the proved fact that a young boy did become possessed by a spirit. It REALLY did happen. I mean in movies like Darkness Falls and The Fog, I highly doubt that a psycho tooth fairy lady is going to come and get you in the dark. Lol. GIVE ME A BREAK! If you want a real scare, no, not just a scare, something that you will remember for the rest of your life, you have to see The Exorcist. This is the movie that all other wanna-be horror movies look up to, The Exorcist is their reference. I'm not to sure if any other horror movie has lived up to the brilliance of the SCARIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! And frankly, I don't think no other movie ever will. Scariest movie of all time seems like something that one or two movies could be called, I think The Exorcist is part of that statement for sure. But, hey, don't just take my word for it, see the movie, I dare you! It is something that you truly will never, ever forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landmark film greatly weakened by the passage of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't bother to repeat what others have said about the impact of this film in its time. Some of the things that were strengths then are still strengths now. 'The Exorcist' was one of the first films of supernatural terror to feature a committed cast of first-rate professional actors and a very strong script that took its story seriously. Friedkin's direction, the relatively slow pace, and the clarity and restraint of the cinematography and almost subliminal soundtrack work as well as they ever did. For example, Friedkin makes effective use of silence and very quiet sounds instead of smothering everything in the pounding rock soundtrack that has since become the norm. The special effects, however, are primitive and largely unconvincing, and many of the most 'horrific' moments simply don't work for an audience conditioned to a far higher standard of realism. (For this viewer, thirty years on, some of the most frightening things in the film were items of Ellen Burstyn's wardrobe.)The biggest problem, however, is that 'The Exorcist' is now a victim of its original popular success and subsequent inflated critical reputation. In the thirty years since its appearance, the film has been plundered mercilessly, with the result that almost everything that made it distinctive at the time has since attained the status of cliché. By the time the film re-emerged it had inevitably lost much of its aura of originality. This accounts for some of the impatience of the younger audience with the film; the rest follows from disappointment that 'The Exorcist' simply isn't, in 2005, 'the scariest movie of all time'. If you can watch it without preconceptions, it's still a good and serious movie, and one every fan should know. Watch it back to back with 'Constantine' and ask yourself whether the old guys didn't know a thing or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I still cannot believe this film ever got made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's safe to assume that there will never be another film like The Exorcist. Never.It's not so much because of the subject matter, which is highly controversial even to this day...but the conditions of the filming. Actors were strapped into harnesses and violently yanked across the room, Friedkin shooting off guns to get a startled effect from the actors, having them work in a room that has been refrigerated to such a level that their breath shows up on screen, and everything that 14 year-old Linda Blair had to go through in this film.Friedkin also used several single-frame inserts of the "devil's face" that some people will not even notice. Also, the strange sounds coming from the room is actually the sound of pigs being slaughtered. All of the subliminal touches and hellish conditions really add to the effect of the film. Another technique that I noticed was that there's often a cut from a loud, violent situation to a quiet, calm setting. The effect is extremely unnerving.The climax of the film, the infamous exorcism scene...is one of the most brilliant moments in film history that still has a HUGE impact even to this day. Keep in mind that all the effects were accomplished without the use of CGI. Which is great, because if they were done with computers, it would look 1000% fake, even if they did it today.Friedkin really shines here as director, creating many memorable scenes and dozens of physically and aesthetically brilliant shots. His use of the camera is impeccable, and this is surely the greatest film he has ever made to this date, and most likely his best of all time. It's clearly one of the most impactful horror films ever made, and one of the greatest films, period.If there was one complaint I have, it is the archaeological dig at the beginning of the film. It really doesn't give us any necessary information and doesn't fit with the rest of the film. Other than that, everything is great, especially the cinematography and music (Tubular Bells is a classic).I'd like to end this review by pointing out something that you will NEVER see in another film ever again. A doctor smoking in a hospital. Watch for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good? Definitely. Scary? Hell no.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's just get one thing straight off the bat: I do not find The Exorcist scary in the least, and I'm getting pretty damn tired of being insulted for it. As if the people who aren't scared by "The Exorcist" and either immature, have no imagination and/or are completely dead inside, and we are adviced to go back and watch teen slasher flicks instead, since that's apparently "our type of films". Not everything is black and white, folks. I should know, I'm the king of the gray area.Personally, I absolutely detest "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "Urban Legends" and all of that mind-less, commercial, so-called horror movie crap. Just because "The Exorcist" doesn't scare me, doesn't mean I need half-naked teens with surgically enlarged bodyparts, knife-wielding murderers in raincoats, and tons of splatter and gore to please me. Nothing irks me more than barely dressed bimbos and there is nothing scary about blood and guts, to be honest it bores me to no end. Unless of course it's done deliberately OTT and tongue-in-cheek, like in "Braindead" and "Evil Dead 2", then it's absolutely hilarious.Another argument often used is that we can't appreciate older films. That's a bunch of crap. Out of my collection of over 6.000 DVD's and VHS tapes, 85% of the movies were produced between 1920 and 1975, and over half of them were made in the 50's and 60's. Just because a film is old, doesn't mean it can't be scary. The scene in "Psycho" where Lila is sneaking around the Bates manor whilst Norman is in the motel only a few yards away down the hill always puts me on the edge of my seat. Or how about the horrific murders in "Peeping Tom"? Not to mention the slow-moving and ever-growing number of zombies in "Night Of The Living Dead", which still freak me out. And these are all movies that were made before I was born. Let's not forget the grainy, shadowy, high-contrast footage of Count Orloc in "Nosferatu". My grandparents weren't even born when FW Murnau made that one, and it's still one of the most frightening piece of cinema I have ever laid my beautiful blue eyes on.Maybe I would find "The Exorcist" more frightening if I was religious. If I was catholic, I'm sure I would soil myself silly. But then again, many reviewers have said you need not to believe in God and the devil to be scared. Come to think of it, I don't believe in zombies and vampires either, but I still find them scary if it's done the right way, so I really don't know. All I know is, this film is not scary to me.In my opinion, the Japanese and the Korean have totally taken over the horror genre, with films such as "The Eye", "Ring" (yes, I liked it better than the remake, feel free to send private messages explaining to me why I am a complete idiot - I promise to delete them as soon as I spot them), "Audition" (which admittedly was more of a psychological thriller), "Dark Water", "Ka?ro" and "Ju-On". If I may say so, there hasn't been a truly scary, unsettling American horror/thriller since "Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer". "Se7en" had it's moments, and "Silence Of The Lambs" was kinda creepy towards the end with Buffalo Bill watching Clarice through the nightvision goggles, but the main reason I return to those two films over and over again is the tight story, the claustrophobic cinematography and the wonderful performances. Whether they're scary or not comes in second to me. Which is exactly my point (betcha didn't think I had one).Alright, enough nagging. To round this review off on a positive note, "The Exorcist" a great movie. The whole setup and the perfectly balanced structure of the film make it a joy to watch. The opening sequence with Father Merrin (the majestic Max Von Sydow) in Iraq is superb in so many ways. Not much is said (and when something IS said, it's in Arabic), instead Friedkin devotes the first 10-15 minutes of the film to haunting images and music as a way to get us inside the head, or rather the heart, of Father Merrin. Then he disappears from the film for a good hour or so, and the focus changes to the parallel storylines of the torn Father Karras and his aging mother, and Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) and her 12-year old daughter (Linda Blair), until these three stories finally meet under horrific circumstances. Unfortunately, this pace and rhythm is completely destroyed in "The Version You've Never Seen", where additional (and superfluous) scenes have been added. Sure, the spider-walk scene and all that is interesting to see from a nerdy cineast POV, but they add very little, if anything, to the film. I would suggest to anyone who hasn't seen "The Exorcist" to firstly see the original 1973 version, and then move on to the aforementioned, newer version for it's trivia value, for that is the only value that version has.The performances are great through out, in particular Von Sydow (who is always great, even in the suckiest of films), and Ellen Burstyn. The cinematography and the set design are flawless, especially Regan's room during the actual exorcism. And of course Mike Oldfield's haunting music. Sure, the special effects have dated and look cheap, but that has never gotten in the way of good storytelling.I really like The Exorcist. I would even go as far as saying I love it, I've seen it fourteen times and I'm looking forward to the fifteenth. But I wouldn't call it a horror film. To me, it's always been a drama. But it's a damn fine drama, that's for sure.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of extraordinary depth and power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As popular as THE EXORCIST is, in my opinion it's *underrated*.THE EXORCIST is not just a "great horror movie"; it is one of the most morally and intellectually serious films to come out of Hollywood in the 1970s. This is why it doesn't compare to such things as NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or THE OMEN. Whatever you think of those movies, they are in the end just horror flicks, while THE EXORCIST is far more.Unlike THE OMEN, THE EXORCIST does not take a couple of lines from the Bible and use them as the basis for goofy pseudo-theological speculations. Underlying THE EXORCIST is 3500 years of Judeo-Christian theological tradition, which the film not only respects, but treats as the Truth, without a hint of irony. This unabashed acceptance of Christianity gives THE EXORCIST a philosophical depth and coherence that few films, and even fewer horror films, can match. This is the source of the film's power, even for those who see it as merely a great horror film.Most supernatural horror films try to make the audience believe in fairy-tale monsters: vampires, witches, zombies. THE EXORCIST makes the audience believe in the Biblical Satan, but that's not the terrifying part.The terrifying part is God.Satan, after all, says, `Do as thou wilt.' God says, `Take up thy cross.'Now *that's* scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once you realise that the start is actually The Exorcist and not some bad american film that has been wrongly put in the box....this film gets no better. The start drags out for ages in some desert, twice I had to rewind this film to make sure the director and writer at the start corresponded with what it said on the box, I was more than convinced that this was not the film that the media hyped it up to be! A little more action takes place when the mother 'thinks' that there are rats in the attic...hmm, how *scary*, yet this storyline is neither interesting or believable.The scenes of possession are however a delightful reminder of why I am watching this film- To see what everyone said to be 'the scariest film ever.' Maybe in the 70's this film was groundbreaking, but now it has aged and the special effects are poor, ofcourse I have the respect that this was made in the 70's, but still, this film is out of date. My opinion is watch it for experience, but not really worth buying, a good experience of film history, but I can not say it is much more than that.</fullReview>

And to think that they had the nerve to try and make a sequel. Good thing that it bombed.

I heard that during this films 1973 theatrical run in theaters, one man died of a heart attack and many others suffered severe head trauma. Hands down to the greatest horror film of all time. A movie will never surpass this. William Peter Blatty did a great job of taking a real life incident and turning it into fiction. If you haven't already, visit the trivia section.

		<shortDescription>Return of that "chill" down my spine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING SPOILER ALERT THROUGHOUT!!! I just purchased THE EXORCIST on DVD and watched it for the first time in years. Once again I was reminded just how disturbing this movie is. It is one of the few movies that actually makes it hard for me to sleep with the lights out. I've heard from those who claim not to be frightened by this horror masterwork, but they must be a.) lying b.) extremely pious c.) agnostic or d.) fatuous. If you have any belief in God, Satan or evil spirits then this movie has to affect you. The most chilling aspect of this work is the nefarious comment by the demon to Father Karras that "we've got your mother in here too." Can you imagine? What an invidious attack on the psyche. This iconoclastic stab at our filial ethos should be studied in a sociology class. In addition the perversely piquant "crucifix masturbation" tableau challenges our emotional endurance. And while I believe that this scene is germaine, I can understand the calls to expurgate it. I do find that Friedkin and Blatty walk a thin line with the ending by centering it around an underdeveloped character (the priest who is the common friend of Chris and Karras). It is odd because it seems that including him in one more scene would have solidified his character and added credibilty to his apperance in giving the last rights to Karras as well as being the last person shown before the credits roll. I think if he had been included in a scene with Karras and the demon in which he has to leave the room, because he is too weak. This would add to his relevance and serve as a good lead in to bringing in Father Merrin. I also agree with Blatty who thought the final scene should have been the one shot with the priest (Karras' friend) and Detective Kinderman, which is less ominous (see DVD special features- MISSING SCENES). Speaking of which, I must add that leaving the "spiderwalk" scene on the cutting room floor was a good idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies simply have to be seen, if only to understand what all the fuss is about. Citizen Kane is one of them, The Godfather and Raging Bull are probably a couple more, and The Exorcist is another. When it was re-released in British cinemas after a generation-long ban, I felt obligated to see it. After all, this was a movie so scary that you weren't actually allowed to watch it.There were always stories going round about it; when it was first released, people fainted in the cinemas, one woman had a miscarriage because she was so scared... But the Chinese Whispers don't represent the movie at all. The Exorcist is not the scariest movie ever made. For a lot of it, I was trying not to laugh.The first hour or so was great, genuinely unsettling and creepy. Noises in the attic, and candle flames rising up then going out made for a tense build-up. But once Linda Blair's possession became more obvious the movie lost its ability to scare and became only laughable.This fault lies not so much with the movie but with me. As an atheist it's impossible for me to be scared of the devil because I don't believe in him. This doesn't come from small-mindedness; Luke Skywalker doesn't really live in a galaxy far, far away but I can still love the Star Wars movies, but films that deal with religion can't be seen in the same way because they believe they're telling the truth. This isn't a fantasy, this kind of thing really happens! People get possessed, the devil is evil, and only God can stop him. That's laughable to me, and that is inescapable.I know Christians who are so scared by the concept of this film they don't even like to talk about it, let alone watch it. I envy their fear, because it would have made for a great horror movie. As it was, it was nothing. The church is laughable and outdated to me, and so too was The Exorcist.Moments such as the possessed girl masturbating with a cross should have been shocking, but I thought they were great. It put a smile on my face to know how many religious people would be offended and outraged. Freedom of speech is forgotten when it comes to religion: in England we still have a blasphemy law; there are no atheist programmes on Sunday mornings in amongst the Christian shows. Atheism is always under-represented because it is seen to be offensive, so blasphemy is always refreshing when it is finally voiced. But I can't even praise The Exorcist for its blasphemy, because it was there only as proof of evil. These were the kinds of things I was thinking when I should have been scared.Atheism isn't the only thing stopping the movie from working. The biggest problem was that the devil was funny. His insults were great, coming up with the ultimate `your mother' joke. The pea soup vomit is embarrassingly fake and the shaking bed looked like something from the Fun House at the end of Grease. I hate saying that dated effects can ruin a movie, but they really do this one no favours at all. Any credibility that may have remained was lost.Despite these criticisms, I can't say that The Exorcist is a bad film. It didn't work on me, but I know why, and I understand why so many people would see this as the scariest movie ever made. Even with its technical flaws this must be terrifying to people who believe in the Evil that takes over Linda Blair. Like all religious horror, it was wasted on me because its basic concept was laughable rather than scary. Like Citizen Kane, The Godfather and Raging Bull, The Exorcist is a disappointing, over-rated movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Back in the theatre 27 years after the initial release, and everyone with any interest should spend the $7.00 and check this out the way it was meant to be seen. This was William Friedkin's third consecutive, and last, great film (after "Boys in the Band" and "French Connection". Anyone under 35 years old can't understand the controversy and impact of this film on its original release. The giggles and laughter in the theatres are typically from those movie-goers who historically jump and scream everytime some clown in a hockey mask reappears to hack someone to death. If this is not your first time, pay special attention to Jack Nitzche's musical score. Nitzche, who died this year, composed music for some wonderful films including "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", "An Officer and a Gentleman", "Stand By Me", "Starman", and "The Hot Spot" (one of personal favs).He had an uncanny ability to capture the essence of the film in his music. Also admire Jason Miller's marvelously understated performance as Father Karras. He is now known as Coach Ara Parseghian in "Rudy". It is also fun to watch for some "set bloopers" (items misplaced or moved between scenes). A couple of tidbits from this one: the writer, William Peter Blatty also co-wrote "A Shot in the Dark", the first Inspector Clouseau flick; and the composer, Jack Nitzche also co-wrote the 60's hit "Needles and Pins".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserved Best Picture Award of 1973</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mindboggling feature that beautifully mixes physical and psychological horror. It was well directed by William Fredkin. This came on the heals of his award winning film for Best Picture, The French Connection(1971). The director had made a drastic shift from doing an action crime flick to making a horror picture. The new director's cut released this year adds a little more to the film's frightening images.The only thing I didn't enjoy about the director's cut is the new ending. The Exorcist(1973) is based on a true incident. The Exorcist(1973)'s success would spawn numerous knockoffs(the best would be Richard Donner's The Omen-1976). Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair give the performances of their life. At one point, Exorcist 2 director John Boorman was offered to do the first film.The scene where Max Von Sydow stands at one corner and a statue at another corner is reminescint of the chess match from Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal(1957). Jason Miller does wonders as a priest who is tormented and has lost his faith. One reason The Exorcist is a classic compared to The Blair Witch Project is that when Regan starts swearing its shocking because she's a sweet faced young girl who turns nasty(The swearing in TBWP is irriating because the characters like some humans are stupid). The scenes of the exorcisms and the desperation to cure Regan are related to the darkness of the human soul. The infamous spider walk is one of the film's shocking moments.Its pathetic that The Exorcist(1973) was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won only two. This proves that the people who pick for Best Picture have no clue in what they're doing and that the best film never gets nominated or wins the Best Picture Award at the Oscars. The director pushed his actors to the limits and tested their human spirit. The author of the book does a good job in translating it unto the big screen. The Exorcist(1973) is a serious horror film that is nothing to laugh at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT** Two years ago, I was fortunate to see THE EXORCIST on the big screen at the Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary film festival. And watching it on the big screen made me change my opinion of the movie from weird to excellent. I first saw EXORCIST when I was nine on late night television. I couldn't make any sense of it, and I though it was very bizarre. I saw it a few years later on video and thought it was so-so. But watching this on the big screen really makes a impact of the film. And now, we are lucky to see THE EXORCIST on the big screen, and it is the uncut version. In case you never heard or saw THE EXORCIST, this is based on the popular novel by William Peter Blatty. Blatty loosely based his story on a factual incident of a real exorcism during the 1940's. Exorcism became a thing of the past since modern science discovered various mental illnesses including split personalities and insanity. In the film famous film actress, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is noticing that day after day, her twelve year old daughter, Regan (Linda Blair) is acting more bizarre and scary. From using constant profanities to even hitting her mother and doctors. After going to several different doctors, Chris seeks the help from Father Karras (Jason Miller). Father Karras is having problems of his own, he questions his own faith after being guilty over his mother's death in a mental institution. When Father Karras discovers the horrors of the deamon that has taken over Regan's body he wishes to use a exorcism, a ancient ritual where a priest or rabbi drive the evil spirit out of a person's body. But since Karras is inexperienced, he gets the help from the distinguished and experienced Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). While a police detective, Lieutenant Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) is investigating the murder of film director Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran). The original EXORCIST I think is one of the most frightening and scariest movies of all time. Although it's not about a shark in water (which scares me the most) this is about a evil that lives amongst us. Some people don't believe this, others strongly do. This is a film that is different and better than the slasher flicks that are being released by the dozens. I am here to review the new and uncut version of the film, so here is what I enjoyed and didn't enjoy with the new version. LIKED: I enjoyed the new digital transfer, it was excellent! I kept jumping as I heard the voice of the demon from behind me in the theater. It's rare that I can recognize the new digital transfer with classic being rereleased and digitally transferred. I also enjoyed some of the deleted scenes that were shown. I found the best to be the first examination of Regan, where later on the doctor reveals to Chris that her daughter was using strong profanity towards him. Unlike the original version where the terror just jumps out, it creeps up in this version. I also enjoyed the more visions of the demon and the nice quiet dialogue scene where Father Merrin and Karras are discussing the evil they are up against. DISLIKED: I did enjoy the visions of the demon, but on the windows? And the doors? It looks more comical that scary when I see those. Unless director William Fredkin and writer/producer William Peter Blatty can come up with a good reason on why they did that, I won't accept it. But the biggest flaw is the end, I am one who always enjoys a director's cut, THE ABYSS, ALIENS, and even the STAR WARS films redone were fantastic. But the final scene in the film where Lt. Kinderman and Father Dyer (Reverand William O'Malley) are talking about movies, takes away the errie and suspense of the original. Where the original suddenly ended with the Jack Nitzsche "Tublar Bells" being played then...BOOM the credits. It ends in a terrifying and creepy note. But with this new ending, it's almost like a "happy ending" a ending that modern movie goers would enjoy. I am a person that would always say, "more is better." But with this version, it ruins the film. This is a movie that I would find to be very scary. It would be a great film to watch on Halloween night. But what upset me while watching this film are the rude people who would laugh and find this movie to be funny. Why? What's so funny about a young girl spitting up pea soup? I would be horrified and disgusted. But the people who laugh at this film, are the kind that find a stupid teenager wearing a white hollow mask carrying a knife around killing teens, to be scary. These imbeciles are the ones who find THE SIXTH SENSE to be "stupid" EVENT HORIZON to be "weird" but find SCREAM as "the bomb" and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID... as "freaky." You can point the fingers at those who ruined the terror of THE EXORCIST. I'll point my finger at the Hollywood director's who do countless rip-offs and spoofs of EXORCIST (Leslie Nielsen's REPOSSESSED and ABBY come to mind). Also, EXORCIST, after twenty-seven years is still getting ripped off with END OF DAYS, STIGMATA, and most recently LOST SOULS. And the violence shown on t.v. news shows and programs just to get raitings. If I told a majority of teens that the EXORCIST has been banned in the U.K. until two years ago, they would think that I am kidding, but I'm not. Like JAWS, STAR WARS, PSYCHO, and any other modern classic movie, if a plot works, other Hollywood studios try the same thing to cash in on the popularity. By doing this, it causes the film's impact to die, and become cliched. I can see THE MATRIX, SIXTH SENSE, and AMERICAN BEAUTY to be the next set of films with countless rip-offs. It's a shame, what did really kill THE EXORCIST, why Hollywood, of course! But anyways, this is a film that is a must see! See it on the big screen instead of blowing 3 bucks at the video store to think it's cheeper. That's like going to your swimming pool to go fishing, since it's closer and cheeper. Just go see this in the theater, and Halloween night would be the perfect night! 1973 VERSION: ***** 2000 VERSION: ****1/2 (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Version Pros &amp; Cons; I pity younger viewers today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE EXORCIST is the only truly "scary" movie I have ever seen, and I'm a horror fan of 38 who has viewed fright films from the Lon Chaney silent days to the current year 2000 (and what garbage we've got today!)I HOPE I'M NOT A SPOILER IF I DISCUSS NEW SCENES:I feel that the new edition has its good and bad points, but overall it has helped the film more than hurt it. I thought that the spider-walk scene became the hit of the show and I also felt that the added scene with Regan's doctor added much to the eerie progression of the girl's illness. A beautiful moment that is not discussed often is the bit before the exorcism where Father Merrin asks Chris what her daughter's middle name is, as an attempt to ease the tension. Outstanding!On the down side, I didn't care for the opening which shows us shots of Georgetown; the film works better originally by simply seeing the title of the film amidst that chilling soundtrack. People are asking why a scene is added where Karras listens to a tape of Regan's real voice? Well, to familiarize himself with the changes that have occurred. Don't forget that he's never heard her speak before she became posessed.For me, the only major problem I had with the New Version is the adding of CGI effects (the death of horror films these days) to cater to the MTV crowd of youths. I also didn't think we needed new music cues to accentuate the more quiet moments.As for the ending, I prefer the original one; but being a fan of EXORCIST III I must say that it perfectly sets up the relationship between the characters in that sequel with this restored conclusion.Now onto the jaded kids today: I pity you. Of course, there's the old saying: "What they don't know won't hurt them". How anybody could watch this film and feel indifferent as to its shock value is beyond my comprehension. I've scrolled down the reviews here and I was almost as terrified by people calling this masterpiece dull and non-scary as I was while confronting the demon within Regan. Have we really forgotten what tension and fear is all about? Do we truly get no jolts from THE EXORCIST in the 21st century? I've seen it dozens of times, and I get uneasy every time Regan first goes bonkers in her bedroom as the perplexed doctors struggle to restrain her.Many teenagers were yawning in the theatre at the "slow parts," and I think it's tragic that everything must constantly move like an MTV video to keep younger audiences interested. Don't they realize that there used to be things in movies called "character development" and "motivation"? We need to know about Merrin's dealings with the demon as well as Karras's guilt regarding his mother. We likewise have to see Regan as a sweet and innocent young child to fully gain the payoff later in the film, when all hell literally breaks loose! That's what makes the frightening scenes potent!Bottom line: THE EXORCIST hasn't lost an ounce of its power to terrorize when seen on a theater screen. It's possibly THE BEST HORROR FILM OF ALL TIME, and the only one of thousands that scares me to this day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You must see this in a real movie theater if you get the chance. I saw the revised rerelease today and was chilled by it all over again! The overwhelming skill of the film is the affection it creates in you for the characters. No one is perfect, but everyone loves one another very much, and you grow to love them too. Merrin says in the book (and touches upon it in one of the new restored scenes) that is the Devil's key: to destroy this love in this family, and make us despair of being lovable. One restored scene could have been done away with; it's shocking but doesn't add much. The new ending is OK, but it does set up the relationship that grows between Dyer and Kinderman in LEGION (which is the TRUE sequel to EXORCIST, so you can just skip that EXORCIST II piece of trash!). 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was about 8-9 years old and thought it was the creepiest thing ever back then.Well I have always thought that you need to see a good movie twice in order to really appreciate it and that is what I attempted to do with "The Exorcist". Ten years after my first viewing I had forgotten why it had scared me so much.Well, I shouldn't have bothered. Granted, now I am 18 and not quite as easily scared, but really I have to say that I struggled to keep my eyes open. I guess some of the scenes were "powerful", for the early 70's, however most movies have at least one "powerful" moment in them.Definitely a great big bore, but I guess for an 8 year old kid who is easily scared this is the film for you!</fullReview>

It has nothing scary except earthquakes and vomits (green) and some irrelevant flashes of ghost pics.This movie could be good for people from 1973, but it seriously has no good in 2015 and ahead.JUST Don't WATCH IT Bad Bad VeryBad, The story begins with 1 hour of nothing, then 30 mins of little ghost faces and rest nothing then next we have a girl peeing and stabbing herself in her privates, using ugly words and then vomitting. the end is very similar to anabelle where the ghost gets into someone else and that someone else suicides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of story compels us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist in my opinion is one of the best horror films ever made, yet I didn't find it really scary. Seeing Linda's Blair's head spin around and vomit some green muck was a little unnerving to see I guess, and there were a couple of other little moments, piths of unease you could say. This was when director Friedkin was making great films, yet there's no film I really hated of his, except may'be for The French Connection which I just found slow, where I just didn't sit out the battle. The film has a fantastic script, and brilliant story structure, where we sympathize with Blair's unhappiness, as Daddy's split and left her with her single Mum (Burston) a famous actress as in the story, which I liked. What I liked though here, was we really got to know the family, where sadly for Blair, despite her richly deserved Academy Award, he career sadly plummeted into B grade. Noticing changes in her daughter, matters become worse for Burston, when suddenly Blair becomes one of the possessed, where an evil spirit has taken over her body. A young reclusive priest (Jason Miller, who very much reminds me of Gabriel Byrne, even with the accent) is called into perform an exorcism, and flush the spirit out. Where finding other doctors have failed, and this is over his head, he sends for a master exorcist (Max Von Sydow) to try his hand at it, at ridding the evil in the possessed Blair. He's virtually the last hope, so the scene is set for quite an intense ride. What I liked too, was how we were taken into Miller's life in the priesthood and personal, where his Mum is very sick. Scary or not, I just love this movie, first seeing it back in 2001. It may stretch reality some, where we wanna believe it is possible and it may not be a terrifying ride for some, but what gives the movie it's buzz is as I said, the finely written script, and the lives within in the characters in it, something most horror films fail to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist is a classic no doubt about it. it was released in 1973 and it still scares people today the story is that a demon possesses a young girl called Reagan. Her distressed mother seeks the help of a priest by the name of Father Karris who refers to Father Merrin a priest who has defeated the demon before. When people laugh at this film and call it "cheesy" it is absolutely ridiculous this film is amazing and is one of the best films ever made it has lasted 40 years and people still call it the scariest film ever made. This film was based on the book by William Peter Blatty and directed by William Freiken and starred Linda Blair, Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow.****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few movies to genuinely unsettle me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror genre is a genre that has been growing on me overtime, and I genuinely believe The Exorcist is a landmark of it. Not just how much it's talked about or parodied, but also its ability to unnerve and unsettle me even years later. The Exorcist is a fantastic film, both as a film of its genre and of film full-stop. The effects are superb and have held up very well, and the sound is marvellous and adds to the many startling moments. The cinematography and scenery are also incredibly well done. The macabre, obscene demonstrations of manifest evil on display still startle even now, while William Friedkin's direction is one of his best and most intelligent of his career, not just making the scares genuine but also combining these with allegorical religious subtleties. The performances also lift, Linda Blair is really quite startling, and you couldn't have had more perfect support from Max Von Sydow and Ellen Burstyn. Overall, genuinely unsettling and effective. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

And the acting job by Ellen Bursyten ( I think I spelled that wrong) is phenomenal and creates such a real life situation to an event that is out of comprehension. I give it a 10 as the greatest horror movie I have ever seen. Wish the sequel would of been a haunted house type thing of someone moving into the house where the exorcism was done and having odd visons. I think that would of been cool. But maybe some movies of course are probably left better as one original and done. Very cool though still scares me today. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie scared me when I was a little kid. Now older and agnostic, watching it last year I was floored by how dull it now seemed. I think the Exorcist can really only work if you are religious. I had some Catholic education as a young child, and in a weird way I appreciate that it made me more susceptible to the Exorcist's scare tactics. In a way, going to church was an unintentional years-in-the-making Halloween prank, which culminated with the genuine fright I felt watching the Exorcist in the early '80s. Which is cool, because a scary film can be exhilirating. Thanks. But The Exorcist now has quite the opposite effect on me. Decent acting, but leaden pacing. Not much happens. A priest is doubting his faith, and a young girl suffers the embarrassment of being possessed by the devil. There are LOTS of scenes featuring the possessed girl in bed, scowling in the devil's raspy voice. The priests chant, she scowls, etc.  True, some of the images of the girl thrashing about her bedroom are unsettling. But overall I was so bored the last time I viewed this, I'm not sure that I'll ever see it again. And although it is far from a perfect film, I think Exorcist III is much better than the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One Hope. The Only Hope. The Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Th Exorcist is probably the only hope to keep Horror alive! Granted there are some great old horror flicks (Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street) and some new ones (Scream), but the horror genre now a days is in a huge mess -there is nothing scary anymore. But then the Exorcist was re-released, and released for the first time in over 15 years, in the UK. I have read some comments on people who say that The Exorcist is long and boring and rubbish - but I say to them, either it scared the hell out of you and you are too scared to watch it again, or that you are too stupid to be able to understand possibly one of the best horror/drama flicks of the 20th and possibly 21st Century. The Film is all about a real city (George Town), in a real street, with real people living in the street, and in a house, is a real girl, who happens to be possessed. After playing which a Ouiji board, Regan (Outstandingly played by Linda Blair) begins to act strange and demonic. Finally, when an exorcism is granted, Father Lancaster Merrin (Max Von Sydow) is called to cast out the evil spirit. Granted, the film may start off with no real point - but if you look at it properly, you will see the magic and points it makes. Many people say "What's the Iraq sequence about?" My answer is the head that Merrin breaks and cleans away from a piece of rock from a small cave, is the head of Pazuzu and so is the statue which he goes to see - these happen because after seeing the head he realises that Pazuzu is back (you see more of this in Exorcist 2 The Heretic and the forthcoming prequel, Exorcist Dominion). Basically the whole Iraq prologue is to do with Merrin knowing that something will happen and he will be called to deal with the situation, hence, why he has to leave Iraq. The Iraq sequence is easily understood if you really bother to get into the film and listen to what the people say in it. As for people saying "Yeah but the whole film takes a long time to get into it's story" My answer is that there is a party and all of the film making stuff, etc, at the beginning because this film is not your average horror flick, people who don't like the lengthy bits at the beginning obviously don't have any sense of the real world and would much rather watch the worse horror movies like Friday The 13th, Talisman, etc. I love the lengthy beginning because it helps to show that these are REAL people and how REAL people deal with things like this. As for people saying "How the hell could she not remember?" the answer is that the real life events of which this film (and supreme novel) is based the boy remembers nothing of his possession. This film is probably the most realistic horror/drama movie I have ever seen. People who say it is unrealistic obviously don't know what it is like to be in the real world -they seriously need to get a life and to get out more. This film is one of the best movies ever made and did shock the world when it was first released - it is much more scary then The Blair Witch Project (which was crap) and other films like that. William Peter Blatty's novel is the bets novel I have ever read, William Friedkin directs this movie beautifully (even if he did use methods that not all actors would like) he has done a supreme job on this. All of the actors did a great job as well (especially Fr Tom Bermingham and Fr William O'Malley who were cast in the film because they were priests). Linda Blair give the best child actor performance ever, and Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller (RIP), Max Von Sydow, Kitty Winn and the great Lee J. Cobb (RIP) all give great performances, as do the rest of the cast. Dick Smith and Marcel Vercoutere did brilliant jobs on SFX and Make-Up. I would also like to say that Mercede's McCambrige did beyond what any actress should do for a part - she was VERY committed to this project and if by far the most underrated actor in the whole movie (she did the demon voice), she is one of the best actresses ever! I also think that Eileen Dietz should have gotten more credit for her role. the Exorcist is a piece of art and will live on when Blair Witch, Friday 13th, etc, are all gone. Watch The Exorcist and you will know what a real movie is like!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't be fooled by people saying how 'scary' this movie is, deep down it is just propaganda for the Christian religion, nothing else. The movie itself isn't that bad, the special effects, music, and acting are great but it is still highly overrated. I rented this movie 5 years ago and was unimpressed and I recently saw it in the theater and was still unimpressed. I remember the scariest thing to the audience was a phone that went off in the movie when everything was quiet and even the projectionist had to turn it up as loud as possible to get people to jump. How pathetic. I remember yelling out, "Save me, Jebus!" during all the 'scary' scenes and people actually joined in! Most people get upset of the 'crucifix masturbation' scene. I thought it was pretty funny actually. Hey, I could make a killing selling crosses! I mean, girls would have something to pray to and masturbate with at the same time! I'm a genius! But what the scariest thing about this movie is isn't the fact that a demon possesses an innocent little girl, it is that the fact people actually BELIEVE such things exist. Now THAT is scary!</fullReview>

The p..ac...e and jerkyness really killed me. It would go from a very tense scene in the bedroom and straight back to normal, largely weak dialogue in other locations. I really got rather bored. 2. The time that passes before it attempts to be scary. 3. The fact that this movie thinks it's too scary to have a soundtrack. It slows to a crawl in the first hour in particular without any music. Only the best of movies, the first one that comes to mind is "saving private ryan", can keep your attention all the time largely without music. And the best horror movie ever, in my opinion "The Shining (Kubrick), had a soundtrack which made it even scarier. 4. The mainly silly makeup that was used in the bedroom made me feel as if this was one of those clay animation things at times. 5. It's not scary.To summarise, this simply doesn't live up to the hype, for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am in my 40s and love old movies, and am very dismayed when I see the reaction of younger people to great old movies. I went to see the Exorcist wondering why I couldn't remember the details very well, like I can other movies of that era. Its because it just is not that good a movie. The problem, as usual is the script, its not well written, much of the dialogue is about very little. The pacing of the film is unendurably slow. That can work, but you need much tighter direction and a better script. There is very little tension, and the direction is flaccid. The opening Iraq scene is totally lifeless.Susan Sarandon has said that any scene does not advance the plot or comment on the characters or themes should be cut. This movie breaks that rule big time - it is full of dead space- people walking,nothing happening, uninteresting dialogue.There was a long list of music credits at the end, but it seemed to me most of the soundtract was almost inaudible, at least where I saw it.I think most of the reputation of this movie comes from Linda Blair's antics, which I guess were once shocking but now are nothing more than comedy. Similar movies of this era, like "The Omen" and especially Rosemary's Baby, are much better written and still pack some punch.I wish I liked this movie more, I really do. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angelic little 12 year old Regan (Linda Blair) is possessed by the devil. Her mother (Ellen Burnstyn) tries every medical cure to no avail. She finally tries exorcism with Father Merrian (Max von Sydow) and helper (Jason Miller) performing it. This film was considered the most horrifying film ever made back in 1973. It's still horrifying to this very day. Blair screaming out obscenities, finding new uses for a crucifix and doing projectile vomiting are still hard to watch--this film is NOT for children! I saw the new version this weekend. With the addition of the now infamous "spider walk" and another doctor visit, the footage added nothing new to the film. In fact, it made the film a bit too long. It does have great acting, especially from Blair, Burnstyn and von Sydow. Also the special effects still hold up today. Well worth seeing. A very scary, graphic horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Achievement and Probably the Most Under-Rated Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Exorcist" was a smash hit both critically and financially in 1973, but many complain that its effect is not as potent today as it was nearly 30 years ago. I disagree with this opinion and feel that the film gets better and more complicated with age. The film deals with a young girl (Linda Blair in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is possessed by someone or something unholy. Enter young priest Jason Miller (also Oscar-nominated) who tries to convince Blair's mother (Ellen Burstyn also Oscar-nominated) that her problems are merely psychological and not supernatural. However, Miller slowly begins to realize that there is something wrong with Blair that cannot be explained with psychology. A key sub-plot is Miller's own inner-demons. He is a man who has lost his faith and due to this fact is slowly descending into an abyss of emptiness. The mysterious exorcist, played by Max Von Sydow is the only known individual who can free Blair from her personal prison. Needless to say "The Exorcist" appears to be an example of a "sure-thing" at the box office. The film was directed by William Friedkin who was the equivalent of Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorsese at the time of this film's release because of his work on "The French Connection" just two years earlier in 1971. Of course the film was a sure thing financially, even though it appeared that the movie would sit in a Warner Bros. vault due to its questionable material. The film is still a shocker that has never lost its luster to me. Many of the images shown in this film would have trouble being approved today by the Motion Picture Association of America. William Peter Blatty's screenplay, based on his equally potent novel, is one of the most impressive in the history of film. Friedkin's direction is flawless and Jason Miller gives one of the most complicated performances the cinema has ever experienced. This is a film which is much deeper than it appears on the surface, the questions and concerns that it raises make it one of the best films of the 1970s and probably the most under-rated film of all time. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with a family member who actually saw this when it first came out in the theaters. They told me it was a lot better in the theater. They also told me that film was one of the greatest movies that came out in their time. I thought it was so-so, nothing to write home about. Yes I know, it's a classic and how can I say that. Come on? Really with the "special effects" I laughed out loud. Not scary at all, but of course my family members were still scared to this day. The filming was okay, the camera work wasn't what I thought it would be. But I have to say I did enjoy the sound effects. They were different from what other movies I've seen before. My favorite character was the priest, I felt bad for him but he was a good actor. Not so much for the young girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I know that I first saw this film in November 1998. But going of the old cliché 'once a good movie always a good movie' I expected something amazing.What I got was dated and, I have to say, boring film. The scenes of gore that were supposed to send people home, with visions that would haunt them forever were no longer significant as today's TV made them look less sickening than an episode of the Simpsons' sub-series Itchy and Scratchy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mechanically engineered for scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young daughter of a famous actress demonstrates such strange, violently self-inflicted behavior that her mother is eventually told about the Catholic practice of Exorcism. Some audiences start giggling during "The Exorcist" right about the time Linda Blair's bed starts shaking, an understandable response since the film's shocks are occasionally outlandish, and the possessed girl's mother curses as much as the demon! The film is intense (sometimes glumly or heavily so) and also very scary (battering the viewer with graphic obscenities), yet there is art in the way director William Friedkin shaped William Peter Blatty's story, and many scenes are now classics: a haunting shot of Regan's scarred face overlapping the arrival of Father Merrin; Regan being promised a nice day out on her birthday, instead overhearing her mom on the phone trying to contact the estranged father, telling the secretary, "He doesn't give a s**t!" "The Exorcist" is definitely a horror movie, but it's also a psychological suspense story; if viewers do laugh at the freaky moments, that's because the shocks are engineered mechanically--they provoke either fright or nervous laughter (and in a crowded movie-house, reactions can go either way). The extra scenes included on "The Version You've Never Seen" were long overdue, however they do not add nor detract from the original product (although I found the "ghostly apparitions" a distraction). The expanded ending is fun for those who know the original by heart, but for the uninitiated viewer I would stick with the '73 goods. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly dated in most areas, but still as disturbing as it was in 1973...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Friedkin's "The Exorcist" is disturbing, scary and ultimately haunting at the same time. Viewing it now, in 2003, it seems a bit dated in some areas--but the film's gruesome depictions of possession are still as horrifying as then.Part of the fear, I think, is because it's so real. Let's face it, as scary as Norman Bates (or Freddy Krueger, for newer generations) may be, the chances of him walking into your house and repeatedly stabbing you are slim. But if you believe in any sort of religion, obviously you believe in God, Satan, demons, or some of the above. And, if you want to take it a step further, the Bible itself says demons are all around us, invisible to the eye and some, almost definitely, incarnate. Scary, huh?Stories of demons, ghosts, and so on go back thousands of years. They've always given me the creeps, mainly because the supernatural is a whole other universe. There are no human boundaries for those from the parallel universe, if you believe in such things. I come from a Christian upbringing. Whether you have religion or not, it's still disturbing--but if you do have faith it's all the more terrifying. I don't know if you do, but watching "The Exorcist" with faith sure will scare the bejeezes out of you.Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is a struggling actress raising her twelve-year-old daughter, Regan (Linda Blair), all by herself. Her husband has left her and refuses to speak with Regan, even on her 12th birthday. Regan has been experiencing some mild disturbances lately, ranging from her bed shaking to speaking evil and/or hurtful sentences to close friends and family.And so the realization finally hits that a demon has possessed Regan. Satan himself, supposedly, though it could just be a demon claiming to be Satan. He terrorizes the girl's body and inflicts harm. Regan turns into a beast--she has no idea what she's saying or doing. Her soul is still in the body somewhere...but the demon has completely taken control.And so an exorcism takes place, held by two priests, one of whom (Jason Miller) has recently started to lose his faith after the death of his elderly mother, and one of whom is a sort of legendary figure (Max Von Sydow). Will they be able to rid the demon from Regan's body?When "The Exorcist" came out in 1973, it scared everyone. Audiences held their breath. There are reports of movie-goers passing out in their seats. One man is rumored to have sued Warner Bros. because the film caused him to faint and hit his head on the edge of the seat in front of him. All this because of one horrifying film.Even stranger are the rumors of deaths on and off the set--the character of Burke Dennings, played by the famous Irish actor, died on location during filming, and so the author of the novel and script, William Peter Blatty, had to go back and make revisions. He and director William Friedkin eventually decided that the best thing to do would be killing off his character early on. It worked, and it only added a more evil overtone to the movie, and it really let the audience know that the demon wasn't just mean--it was homicidal.Other such rumors have been reported on the Steven Spielberg produced "Poltergeist." Many of the cast members later died in odd cases. Perhaps it's a subtle message that we're not dealing with something to be taken lightly.Luckily, no one watching the movie did. "The Exorcist" has dated in its past thirty years, yes, but the horrific possession scenes are still as gut-wrenchingly disturbing as they were back in '73. Hard to imagine that a film so gory and sickening was made prior to some of the teen flicks available on the market nowadays.But, if there's one thing you can credit "The Exorcist" for, it's that it isn't another teen slasher movie. This is an intelligent and surprisingly disturbing horror film. Some films, specifically those that are set in an unspecified year, date very well. "The Exorcist," in my opinion, hasn't dated quite as well as one would hope. But the scenes that everyone remembers, the scenes that really scare people, are just as terrifying as they were thirty years ago. And so, in that sense, the film hasn't dated at all.4.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A weak story that relies heavily on special effects and shock to hold the viewers' attention. For a film to be regarded as 'great' it needs: i) a story that gives us depth of character, ii) strong motivation for the lead character/s iii) themes that lie at the heart of the viewers' values iv) film techniques that draw us in to the story v) believability within the context of the film's story The Exorcist has none of these elements. It has achieved its fame through manufactured controversy (often thanks to religious zealots) and the use of 'horror' just for the sake of it rather than for a purpose. For examples of horror that works consider The Cabinet of Dr, Caligari, the original Frankenstein and Dracula, Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby, all of which draw the viewer into caring about the characters, empathising with them, questioning the antagonist's motives, allowing us to enter the world of the film rather than stopping us at the screen by reminding us of the filmic process through special effects and inappropriate spectacular visuals. Even the low budget, simple Blair Witch Project provides horror through enabling us to imagine being in a similar situation. Even the comedic Scream provides some occasions of horror through scenarios we can briefly relate to. But The Exorcist? No, it provides none of this. It's a third rate, unpleasant, unimaginative film lacking any subtlety and ends up abusing the medium of film. Tao902.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is the exorcist scary. Not very. Is it shocking Yes but so what anybody can shock you by having a little girl grab a psychiatrist in the private parts and then show a close up camera shot of the man's face as he writhes in agony. or doing unmentionable things with a crucifix or swearing about Jesus. Does it make any sense. Not really. Why would the devil enter the body of a little girl who is then strapped to a bed and has holy water thrown at her to torture her. If I was the devil I'd enter the body of someone with more power or the son/daughter of someone with power not the teenage girl of some old movie actress and I would hope that they'd make a better movie about my possession than this one. If someone's head rotated 360 degrees then they would be dead. It make for interesting shocking effect but it doesn't make any sense. Peasoup vomit. Please. I would give this movie 1 out of 10 and that only for it's shock value. Go see The b&amp;w version of the Haunting if you want to be really scared. Even Damien is a more interesting well told story than this one. The only scary bit for me was when the priest listened to what Linda Blair was saying on the recording and it turned out to be in English but backwards. "Dimmy why you do this to me". And the first 10 minutes or so was about the most boring 10 minutes I've ever spent watching a video. The clock that stopped ticking for no reason was the only strange and interesting bit for the first 1/2 hour is this boring overrated overhyped movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Playtime with Pazuzu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mary Russell published "The Sparrow" in 1996. The novel opens with Jesuit priests intercepting a message from an alien planet. This message consists of beautiful singing, which the priests interpret as the holy songs of religious aliens. Believing that God wishes them to make first contact with these aliens, the priests hop aboard a spaceship and fly to the alien planet. Once there, the aliens torture the priests, rape them, break their bones and reveal themselves to be both cannibals and serial abusers. The priests also learn that the songs they intercepted were a form of alien pornography."The Sparrow" used gore and sensationalism to make a simple point: either the Jesuit priests misinterpreted signals and God doesn't exist, or God exists and he is a vile monster capable of unimaginable horrors. William Friedkin's "The Exorcist", based on a novel by William Blatty, does the opposite. Here a little girl is subjected to horrible torture at the hands of a devilish creature, only to be eventually saved by faith in God.Released in 1973, "The Exorcist" became one of the decade's most profitable pieces of backlash cinema. The film puts agnostics, atheists, science, medicine, knowledge, universities, libraries, liberals, hippies, female sexuality, drugs, single woman, feminists, rebelling children and swearing on one hand, and the church, men, Christ, traditional values and clerical paternalism on the other. The film's reactionary stance on the generation gap - and the civil rights movements of the 1960s - becomes apparent early on, when mother Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is shown working on "Crash Course", a celluloid tale of campus revolt and student riots.But most of "The Exorcist" centres on the plight of Regan (Linda Blair), Chris' daughter. Months away from becoming a teenager, Regan's possessed by Pazuzu, a creepy demon. This demon causes Regan to swear, spit, attack others, masturbate and slander Christ. Chris believes she can cure her daughter ? she's a strong, independent woman after all ? but Pazuzu proves to be too powerful. Enter father Damien Karras (Greek for "conqueror of darkness"), a troubled priest played by Jason Miller. Because his mother died, Karras is questioning whether or not God exists. Regan's possession settles his doubts. The film climaxes with Karras sacrificing himself, Christ-like, so that Regan may be free of her demons. A recruitment film for the Catholic Church, the film led to a massive increase in church attendance."The Exorcist" co-stars Max von Sydow as a priest who mentors Karrass. Max von Sydow, of course, starred in a number of Ingmar Bergman's films, Bergman being a director renowned for numerous films which deal with God, faith and existential crises. One of Bergman's masterpieces, "Cries and Whispers", itself resembles "The Exorcist". Released in 1972, "Whispers" watches as a dying woman is confined to her bed. Around her, atheists and believers wrestle with various moral and/or philosophical problems.But Friedkin is no Bergman. Though packed with religious iconography, his film has little to say about religion, suffering, God or disbelief. Friedkin's God is itself neither punitive or loving, and instead reduced to a kind of sports team mascot, the film more interested in violent slugging matches between Team Good and Team Evil. A form of spiritual blackmail, the film asks you to reconsider which Team you're on - the heroes or the monsters ? lest you too be condemned to hellish suffering. That the heroes here are Catholic priests fighting valiantly to stop child abuse is an irony lost on Friedkin.The 1960s and 1970s saw European neorealism making its way to Hollywood. Once there, the movement became almost immediately perverted, now married to special effects, shock tactics, gratuitous violence, gore and sensationalism. "Realism" was increasingly important only insofar as it sold a heightened form of fantasy. We see this in "The Exorcist", what would ordinarily be a Bergmanesque chamber piece turned into a war-zone, heads spinning, vomit spewing and children torn to shreds. "The Exorcist's" bludgeoning tactics would pave the way for every sensory-overloading quasi-religious picture from "Saving Private Ryan" to "The Passion of the Christ"; spiritual blackmail with state-of-the-art gore.Though a film about crises of faith, "The Exorcist" is largely devoid of spiritual or psychological introspection. This is largely because William Blatty's a bit of a nut (he's currently suing Georgetown University for not being Catholic enough, and for being too pro-choice and pro-contraception). Friedkin's aesthetic, though, is mostly masterful. This is a film of creepy spaces, chilling blues, disturbing images, nauseating ideas and grotesque faces. Though its shock tactics are largely crass (pulverizing a cute girl), and though it's almost half a century old, "The Exorcists" primal sights and sounds are likely to torment even contemporary audiences raised in, or familiar with, Judeo-Christian culture.6/10 ? See "Heart of Glass" (1976) and "Cries and Whispers" (1972).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the setence that always comes to my mind when I think about the Exorcist. Don't get confused this is not a Church Movie ! But it will make you think in the Good and the Evil (that is now all around us). Don't get scared. You need to be on top of the Evil thats all around us (sounds easy but it is not). The Movie explains this all in detail... To be good is not easy... like we can see in all the characters .. as they struggle through life... Like ourselves ... the Evil comes and want to take you ... and you struggle too ... don't give up this struggle as the good normally wins ... This Movie is an Analogy of Life itself ... Don't get caught by the Evil !!! Be aware and protect yourself ... I recommend this Movie to everyone that is uncertain ! After THIS .... you wont be uncertain anymore :) Great Story and great acting of everyone ! A true Masterpiece by Friedkin ! I am not a religious person but this Movie makes you think of so many levels that it sounds like you are a priest. Recommended 100 %%%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is for the Extended Directors Cut. There is not much that they added except for one quick scene I believe. I never saw the original version. This film is so creepy especially if you were raised Catholic while watching this and believing that possession is real. My mom believed this and was legit scared of this movie.Now on to the movie itself: It is brilliantly done. The acting by Linda Blair as Regan is amazing. She will be one of the best actresses of all time and it all started here. The story is told already by the title of the movie. Many creepy disturbing moments throughout the movie.There are many sequels after this, but this should be the only one you watch out of them all.I would recommend this movie for anyone who loves creepy movies and isn't afraid of jump scenes. For anyone who is deeply religious, I would not recommend this movie unless it will not bother you.The scene that is added is so creepy and should be added in the top scary moments as #1 in every list possible. It's so disturbing.Loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil's in the details.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story goes that future Hollywood scribe Blatty while a student attending the Jesuit University at Georgetown back in 1949, came across a curious item in the Washington Post involving a 14 year old Mt. Rainier youth plagued by demons, not the psychological or drug-addled kind but the bona fide supernatural variety, undergoing the ancient ritual of exorcism (the casting out of said demons). Flash-forward after years of paying his dues in Hollywood, Blatty would later base certain aspects of the incident mostly entailing the ritual and cant involved as the basis for his runaway bestseller "The Exorcist". Oscar winning filmmaker Friedkin ("The French Connection") realized it as the perfect follow up as he was on a winning streak, and, the rest, as they say, is cinema history. It was certainly a blockbuster when it premiered in 1973 and has earned its reputation as the scariest movie ever made over the years. Those unseen forces and invisible agencies for both good and evil notwithstanding, it's also quality filmmaking. The effects by Marcel Vercoutere are more mechanical in nature rather than those effects involving traveling mattes, matte art, etc. but are no less compelling in its depiction of bilious graphic horror (a later reissue was retouched using a few digital effects) and the demonic makeup by Dick Smith goes beyond grotesque, it's downright sickening. Not to mention, language so strong it would make David Mamet shrivel up in a corner and die. But it was those powerful four letter invectives along with other aspects of the script that won Blatty his coveted Oscar for Best Screenplay.</fullReview>

I brought the "Version you have never seen before" It is supposed to have 10 minutes of deleted film in this movie but I worked it out it only had 6-7 minutes. Overall I was entertained by this film. But not overjoyed. Acting 7/10 ... Death Scenes 4/10 (There was only about 2 or 3)... 11/20 :) Overall Okay Film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Revelation of Truth that Shocks and Frightens!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hollywood ploys for "shock and awe" are employed in this film which has false starts to get the heart pumping and the adrenalin flowing. This movie has great impact because it may have great spiritual truth attached to it. The blasphemous, swearing, Godless mother who is perhaps cursed from the start, placing all her faith in man and science, is sure to meet her fate. She becomes fertile territory for attracting evil spirits and as a result her daughter is attacked by demons of high placement. This movie is clever in its research because it is based on actual events that took place in and around Washington D.C. in the 1940s (Georgetown). This movie really frightened me and it is because, I believe, that there may be a spiritual truth to what Jesus reveals about demons in the New Testament. This film will touch your unconscious mind powerfully because it is revealing secrets of the supernatural world that surround us daily in a spiritual warfare that we need protection from. This movie will haunt you long after viewing it and I think it would be unwise to watch this film more than once because there is a potential to stimulate an awakening curiosity of a prurient and depraved nature that could steer some people down a dangerous path. The two priests are well portrayed, (Max Von Sydow in particular). I would be cautious about watching this one. Good film though! A good one for Hallowe'en.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The exorcist gets under your skin... That's the best way i can describe it's effect. There's a sense of evil emanating from every frame. It's gritty and real. It pulls no punches. Even days after watching it, the effect still lingers... A deep chill in the very core of your being and a feeling that nothing is safe. I've seen the film 6 or 7 times now and it still hasn't lost it's punch.It's a very rare kind of film. You have a top director, at the height of his talents with top collaborators working on a project with an aesthetic that's as extreme and dark as any low budget European horror movie. It has many scenes that would guarantee a NC17 rating in our age. In fact, the only way to really make this movie now would be to release an unrated version straight to video. It would suffer from the tighter budget and it wouldn't be the same.Every image and sound is calculated to maximize the oppressive atmosphere. It's like watching a nightmare unfold, only more real. There are some pacing issues that bother me. The opening is a little slow and you might get bored, but it's necessary to establish the film's realism and make you believe in the characters and their world.It may not be the best horror film ever.. But it's probably the scariest. Jaws and the Shining are better films overall, but the exorcist is more disturbing and frightening then either one of them. Taken as a whole it's more shocking and unforgiving than any Fucli film. Even the most disturbing films, like Joe D'Amato's "beyond the darkness" and Takashi Miike's "Visitor Q" barley surpass it in terms of vileness. The exorcist doesn't really show anything visually or contain any content that equal's films like visitor Q, but the way the subject matter is handled causes it to hit home very forcefully. There is no humor. It's utterly serious. If you've never see it, believe the hype. The Exorcist is an astonishing creation, and there is nothing else like it out there. If your returning to it after a few years absence, you'll find that it hasn't aged at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately many people are beginning to claim that The Exorcist isn't all its cracked up to be. According to a whole new generation of audience it's just not scary anymore. In all truth, I have to disagree.It's a rare occasion when I'm truly scared by a film - but this movie freaked the hell out of me, to put in simply. And its easy to see why. Unlike the Eli Roths of today Friedkin is an extremely talented director. Sure he's made some flops, but this definitely isn't once of them. Taught, psychological and really very clever, this movie deserves its classic place in the history of cinema.Again, unlike Roth Friedkin uses subtle gestures to terrify his audience. There are never any exceptionally violent moments. Instead a cold feeling of quiet horror begins to build up in the audience member's mind.Some scenes, such as a deep male voice emerging from the mouth of a tiny girl are utterly unforgettable. I know I've said it before, but I'll say it again: its these moments of quiet horror that are much more terrifying than Roth's bloodletting will ever be.In short, see this film instead of popping out to watch the newest Alien clone, or the brand new Rob Zombie film.You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt the scariest movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attempted to view The Exorcist for the very first time on what turned out to be a worn out VHS copy from the video store. The soundtrack, picture were so bad that it was pointless to try and watch it. I would've rented the DVD but they did not have it at rental store. The re-release of the film a few years ago in theaters was my first real chance to see it. I sat in a packed auditorium with people ranging from late teens to 40 somethings. We were all scared to the core from the images presented in this film. I cannot comprehend how any normal god fearing human being could think this movie is laughable or a joke. I have been a horror film fan since i turned 8rys old in 1980. The Exorcist makes all the other horror films i have watched seem mild mannered. Almost everyone knows the story behind this movie and its basis in factual events. In real life it was a 14 yr old boy who was possessed while in the movie its a 13 yr old girl. Regan, as played by Linda Blair, is possessed by a demon because of her innocence,vulnerability,and insecurities. The opening of the movie takes place in Iraq where we meet Father Merrin on an archaeological dig. A member of his crew discovers a small/hand sized carving of an ancient,powerful evil. Father Merrin recognizes the carving as the likeness of a demon he fought decades prior as a young priest. He is terrified to the point to leaving the dig sooner than expected. Next is the set up for the circumstances by which Regan is possessed by the demon. The version with added scenes gives more insight into the intense frustration felt by Regan's mother Chris,played by Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn,as she continues to take Regan to one specialist after the next to get a medical or psychological explanation of what is happening to her daughter. In between doctor visits Regan becomes more violent,sadistic,and disfigured outwardly due to the demon's presence in her body. Finally, Chris seeks out the help of the Catholic Church,through a young priest/psychologist serving at the local university, to save her daughter and this pulls together all the horrific elements that lead to the exorcism of Regan. Father Merrin is called in by the younger priest, played by Jason Miller, to aid in the performing of the exorcism of Regan. Again this pulls the back-story into the present situation thus making it even more terrifying. Do not watch this film by yourself. Have one or more people with you and be prepared for the after affects of the film on your subconscious mind. Basically, you will more than likely have bad dreams over this movie. However, its an excellent horror/suspense/psychological film that set the standard very high for all other films of its nature that followed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film on Faith and Sacrifice!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the religious films I've seen this is my favorite. I just watched it on last Saturday and I was moved by it. I was especially moved by the sacrifice that Karras made which represented Jesus' sacrifice to save us from Satan. The ultimate sacrifice. The Devil and God are both very real and they are here. One tries to help one tries to destroy. To me being possessed would be worse than burning alive or starving to death. The way I see it its the worst pain a person can suffer. I really felt sorry for the boy that this movie was based on. This movie kept me up most of the night and I'm still glad I saw it because it shows us the never ending threat that evil poses. People say that if you believe in God then you shouldn't fear Satan. WRONG! Watch this movie people. You'll see that even the elder priest is frightened.9.5/10.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just solidly made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is just solidly made?good tempo, everything tempered perfectly?plot arc, characterization, acting, boldness of photography?all of it making a strong stand but tempered?as if to say, we are well aware of the traps around us; we will be a movie that avoids them. It is remarkable that a scene in which a girl's head makes a complete revolution while her body remains stationary?it is remarkable that such a scene avoids being cheesy. I like how dark the movie is, how it does not insult my intelligence with vulgar and obvious scares (somehow the vomit and the girl's iconoclastic use of a crucifix aren't vulgar in this movie?we can take them completely seriously). The movie is horror without being fantastic or folkloric. It enters into the region of our consciousness that houses certain impressions about real life and informs and influences others. It is not allegory or parable?it is rather more like a fictitious history, an intelligent and rich account of something that we are able to believe, at least temporarily, might happen or might have happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, Scary, and Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scary and suspenseful thriller about a young girl who becomes possessed by the devil and is in need of an exorcism, in a movie that will scare you into become religious. 12-year-old Reagan is the daughter of a well-known actress named Chris MacNeil and has a happy life despite her dad not being in the picture. Her happy life is shattered when Reagan begins to experience strange things. Reagan'room becomes cold, she starts cursing, and when her mom sees her body moving back and forth on the bed yelling "Make it Stop, it burns". Chris knows something is terribly wrong. Reagan sees many doctors who have said this and that but nothing has cured the girl. As Reagan's problems progress, her voice changes into an eerie man-like voice and starts torturing her body and hitting people. She is put in straps to restrain herself. Chris keeps telling Reagan to stop and Regan responds "I'm not Reagan, I'm the devil." The doctors recommend a controversial treatment, an exorcism. Father Damien Karras is a poor priest who is suffering and feeling guilty over his mom's death. Karras observes Reagan and believes it isn't the devil, but when Reagan mentions his mom's death, Karras then believes it is in fact the devil since the girl had no knowledge of his mom's passing. Karras cannot perform the exorcism and enlists Father Lankester Merrin, an aging priest who almost didn't survive his last exorcism, to help rid the young girl of the evil inside her. Will they succeed? Will Reagan be normal again? Find out in this thriller.My parents continually said to me, "don't see it" and "you'll get nightmares", but I saw it anyway. Before watching this, I had already known that it was mostly fake. So when I rented the VHS version it was the 25th anniversary special edition video. So it interviewed the original cast and people that worked on the movie, showing all the tricks and how they did it as well as some deleted scenes not used. As I watched the movie I became entranced and a little bit bored, but it was still scary and realistic film. It is a must see if you want a good horror movie to watch. As for any nightmares, I slept like a baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human and disgusting and frightening and fun all at once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Exorcist in a crowded theater when it was first released (and I was 22), and that night was one of the most entertaining I've ever spent at a movie. The audience shrieked during the shock bits, and then broke into nervous laughter at the utter grossness of it. Grossness in movies was unheard of in 1973, and so we were all seeing something new and fun.This movie scared me so badly that, on the way home from the theater, I ran in the dark from the bus stop to my house, looking back over my shoulder most of the way. I slept with the light on that night. So I got my money's worth.I love this movie because the main hero, Damien Karras, is such a likable and human character. Father Karras is a priest who has lost his faith. Paradoxically, he regains his faith in God and goodness only when he is exposed to supernatural evil. Karras is presented all through the movie as a human being, instead of the Godlike father figure that Bing Crosby and Spencer Tracy used to play. We see him smoking and drinking beer and trying to talk his elderly mother into moving into a nursing home. Father Karras is the most realistic, and therefore the most sympathetic, priest ever to appear in a movie. If it weren't for that, The Exorcist would just have been a silly gross-out horror movie, instead of the classic that it is.</fullReview>

I don't know how they got the kid to be so damn creepy and sick but the rest is movie history. The words on the front of the box tell you "THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE" and this was probably true when it came out in 1973 and may still be true today. If I had been say 9 or 10 or even 17 when I first saw it I probably would not have slept for two months as it is pretty shocking and graphic. I know that when people saw the opening day release they left shocked and horrified like in a daze or trance. I also know for a fact that people actually threw up in the theaters which I have never heard happen with any other movie. Max Von Syndow has done many many good film presentations and this may be his most famous. Lee J. Cobb is also well cast and so was the other father even though I have not seen him in anything else to date. I would not watch this one again like I would other horror films such as "Halloween" as it is not something that entertains or enlightens one but everybody should watch it once in order to say they have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror film ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is truly excellent.I understand where people are coming from who don't find it scary - or even find it amusing (although thats probably just being contrary).Sadly the shallow World we live in today, and the graphic horrors on our screen in everyday newsreels has made people less imaginative and less prone to actually examining their actual feelings.Everything happens a warp speed, is noisy and so "in your face" that many people today don't actually realize what it is like to have to "imagine" things and many don't have time to look deeper than the surface of their own emotions.Some of the scariest stories I ever read are ghost stories by M R James - not fast paced, not gory, but genuinely scary and thought provoking. Sadly modern day living doesn't ask people to think much at all.I also think that - as a parent - the movie raises disturbing images that wouldn't be appreciated by a younger person or someone without children of their own.It has become "trendy" to scoff at this film and claim it didn't frighten, but it is a powerful film nonetheless.I think the power lies in it's subliminal, disturbing message and imagery. It will certainly affect people in different ways - but rest assured those with a real imagination and with an enquring mind will find this film genuinely uncomfortable.You wouldn't expect it to affect everyone the same, especially from different eras, but the message it puts across is disturbing - perhaps those who don't find it so are just not hearing the message - and thats a shame, and their loss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atheism as a sin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being utterly based on the Judaic-Christian beliefs, it's very hard to understand this flick without having such background. This movie gives no chance to science and looked to me a real retrospective towards middle-age superstitions. It tends to cause deep confusion, in example, when one tries to figure out what the point was of showing off a powerful demonic entity refusing to telekinetically open a drawer or responding a question in Latin, but still so interested in using a defenseless child to create segregation among tumbling religious characters. If cheating devil is so smart, why does he waste time ridiculing a girl? Because he is so mean? Does he really need to prove it this way? Atheism is exposed as a weakness, not as a matter of choice, and the so-called possession is presented as an, &lt;sigh&gt;, undeniable fact: if you don't believe in it, then the whole movie concept is nothing!Please forgive me, but I just can't think of God as the `my way, or the highway' kind of guy.My IMDB rating: 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid I was terrified of Jason Voorhies. I had nightmares and couldn't sleep. I told my aunt- a teenager at the time and an avid fan of the movies, of which two existed- and she told me that I didn't have anything to worry about because "Jason only killed white kids at summer camp" and I was neither. I saw the logic in this and was then free to enjoy each new Friday the 13th film.That having been said, I have watched 'The Exorcist' numerous times starting at the age of 12, and it has never scared me. I've realized, in trying to find out why it's often considered the scariest movie of all time, that those who are afraid of it usually believe in God or have been brought up in a household or community where faith was central and often imposed from a young age. If you don't believe in God, who cares? It's about as scary as watching a third season episode of Star Trek. Oh no! Captain Howdy has stolen Regan's brain and he's using it to power a giant computer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have a funny story about this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I'm in one of my film classes at USC and check the syllabus--today's film is THE EXORCIST. Now, I've never seen THE EXORCIST and had barely remembered even hearing anything about it prior to that week.Well, one of the Theatre Freaks in the class (hey, I was one of them, too, so I can call 'em what I want) admitted that her father, a preacher (or some such), quit the church after seeing this film, he was THAT disturbed by it. She refused to stay and watch the film, even though old professor Too-Many-Facelifts was supposed to finish the second half of the lecture when the film was over.So, I'm thinking, "Great. And I hate scary movies. Maybe I should sit this one out, too."Chickensh*t that I am...But the first lecture was already over, the film was starting, and I figured if it got too hairy for me I'd crawl right over movie theater seats, right over the chick who played "Six" on "Blossom" (Hey, I told you I went to 'SC, whaddaya want?) and make a bee-line for the door.Do you know that I laughed my way through the entire film?Tears were streaming down my eyes when old girl's head started spinning... ...and when the film ended and the lights came back on, the first thing the prof. (who used to be a Jesuit priest, mind you) says is, "Who WAS that who was laughing? What is wrong with you?"So, of course, me being me, I raised my hand, still chuckling, and explained.You see, due to the fact that I was raised a strict-catholic schoolgirl in the midwest (yeah right), I hadn't been allowed to watch THE EXORCIST, but I had seen a little Leslie Nielsen flick called REPOSSESSED...For those of you who don't know the film, it's a spoof of THE EXORCIST, starring Linda Blair as an adult. If you're like me (a chickensh*t), but, like me, are an avid film buff and must see all the 'classics'--I highly suggest that you watch REPOSSESSED first. It makes the original a lot easier to take in. ...Then again, I'm the one who laughed my way through SE7EN (Seven), so maybe I'm just a little--twisted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Movie I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is less a review than a rant. I can't see how anyone cannot appreciate this movie for what it is. I've seen other reviews on here talking about how the movie isn't scary at all, how slow and boring it is, and how they think it is more a comedy than a horror film. I would love to know what movie these people think tops this one in the horror genre. Would it be Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Halloween, or the countless other movies of the same ilk??? These are all movies that follow the exact same plotline...a bunch of teenagers get drunk, have sex, get killed, then one lone survivor outlasts the baddie and somehow "beats" him in the end only to have him respawn in the next movie. WHOA!!! SPOOOOOOKY!!!Now I know The Exorcist isn't a splatterfest like these other movies, but people, can you please grasp the fact that this is the reason that The Exorcist is so good. The movie actually has a story to tell, so that means there are going to be times in the movie where plot progression takes precedent over all out gore. The movie actually wants you to *gasp* think...about the battle between good and evil (both in the world and in the minds and hearts of the characters)and the conflict of faith and science in modern times. So with this in mind, if you like your movies to spell everything out for you and tell you exactly what to think or not think (i.e. you're not very bright), then this is not the movie for you. You'll be bored to death with it and the things that catch your attention such as the little girl spinning her head around or jamming a crucifix into her crotch will be amusing to you on a base level. And then you'll come here and write a review about how you think the movie isn't scary and how boring it is.But if you like horror movies with an actual theme and a plotline that supports that theme superbly, and a film that makes you pay attention and actually think about what the movie is trying to say, then The Exorcist cannot be beaten.</fullReview>

If you watch it theres a very good chance that you will have nightmares. This movie does have flesh (human tissue), blood and gore. Ellen Burstyn was great in this. She acted very well.

		<fullReview>And why? Well this is why...The Exorcist cannot be surpassed by any movie. The acting in this movie, the scares, the drama and more just make this movie untouchable. People may think that demonic possession is just a load of crap but i'm sorry...you're wrong people. This is based on a true story and it is the best tale of a true story ever made.The acting is what makes this movie so great. For a start Jason Miller plays the troubled psychiatrist/priest who's mother is very sick and lonely and who later dies. His name is Father Damien Karras. His faith has deserted him because of all of this suffering and death, is there really a God? He dies in the end, getting rid of the devil and getting rid of the spirits in Regan Macneill. His performance is masterly.The other one I want to explain in detail is regarding Ellen Burstyn. She plays the mother of a very happy and healthy little girl, Regan. Her name is Chris Macneill. She has rented a house in Georgetown with her daughter, her assistant Sharon and her servants Willie and Karl. She is estranged from her husband who is in Europe at the time. Her life starts to turn upside down when Regan becomes very ill for some unknown reason. The doctors think it's brain-related and they have'nt got a cure. As we all know her illness is being possessed by the devil. Chris is very upset and shocked. Her performance is also masterly.These actors plus, Father Merrin(Max Von Sydow), Regan(Linda Blair), Lt.Kinderman(Lee.J.Cobb), Dr.Klein(Barton Heyman), Burke Dennings(Jack McGowran), Sharon(Kitty Winn) and others make this movie fantastic.My five favourite moments were these in order...1. The exorcism. 2. The conversations between Kinderman and Karras/Chris Macneill. 3. The prologue. 4. The ending (both of the movies). 5. The whole movie!This is truly the best movie of all time...if you have'nt seen it...well...go see it as soon as you can!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"For its time" this is one of the best films ever made. In my opinion, how you feel about this movie depends on when you first viewed it. I saw it for the first time when it came out in 1973, I was 13, and it scared the living crap out of me (being raised a Catholic, living 5 miles from Georgetown didn't help). The Exorcist was so UNLIKE any film made up to that point, it astounded people. Throw in the "weak" link to the truth and anyone who wasn't scared by this movie in the mid-70's was either in a comma or dead.Of course 30 years later, we've been exposed to thousands of similar demonic-type scenes and it's lost much of its impact. A couple of years ago, my teenage daughter and I watched it and she, like many others, thought it was hilarious. I myself wondered why I was so scared. The answer of course was "timing". Great movie appreciated by those who are old enough to have seen it when it first came out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a slasher pic. This is a serious drama--so much so that it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture. What really makes this film still chilling is the fact that there's a serious subplot about the priest (well-played by Jason Miller) doubting his faith and guilt-ridden about his mother's declining health. I suppose what I like best about this film is the positive portrayal of the priests--a practice long since eschewed in modern day, Marxist Hollywood that is hostile to Christianity (see "Priest", "Dogma", and most recently Larry David urinating on a painting of Jesus).Another reason why this film works so well is that there are serious actors in this film: Cobb, Miller, Burnstyn, Von Sydow, not 20-something females with scanty clothing screaming constantly.I just watched it for Halloween, and still find parts difficult to watch. This is not a slasher film. It's still a great film and holds up today, in my opinion.</fullReview>

Anyone giving it less than a ten is either a liar or not a fan of the horror genre (nor a competent critic of the genre.)

		<fullReview>Somebody needs to stick up for this great film, since all the emphasis here seems to be on how "freaky" or "unscary" it is. The Exorcist is more than a mere horror movie- it's a powerful story of good versus evil, and of a man's battle to overcome his own (inner) demons. It's also a triumph of acting and direction, and features an effects soundtrack and musical score that ranks among films finest. The final scene is also, without a doubt, one the greatest movie "battles" ever. Many people rent this one to try to scare their own pants off or to prove they sit can sit through it. The Exorcist is not just a horror classic, but a MOVIE classic. Make the mistake of treating this one like a cheap popcorn thrill and you'll be missing out on a great movie going experience. And yes, after being hyped up (and parodied) so much, some of the Regan's antics may not shock you the way they might have a few decades ago. Still, do yourself a favor and watch this one in an empty house with the lights turned off and (VERY important)- the sound turned up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those people who saw this movie 35 years after it was made it may not be "scary". You have heard all the stories and have many preconceptions. You have seen the parodies and saw bits and pieces before you ever really sat and watched the movie. So I'm going to sound like the geezer that I am... buuut... In 1973 - - in the dark - - in a spectacular theater in New York City after waiting 2 hours . . .this movie scared the living ( expletive deleted ) out of me and my friends. Nobody slept right for days. It was groundbreaking for it's time. There had never been anything like this movie. You children who pan this movie and then say that "The Perfect Storm " was scary - - -HUH! What's scary about computer generated waves? GET CAUGHT IN A REAL OCEAN STORM - NOW THAT'S SCARY! And the person who said it didn't scare him in daylight... scary movies are to be watched in the dark . . . alone . . when it's raining out and when there's a nice wind slamming up against the house.Most of these computer generated effects are fascinating but hardly scary and pretty boring. Live and learn kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story dealing with demonic possession is much more than a "scary" movie. I was in high school when this movie first came out and recall the way it affected some people. A friend was so spooked he spent a night in a psychiatric ward. My dad didn't want me to see it because my sister wouldn't sleep with her bedroom door shut after seeing the movie. Me, I could handle it, but still was forced to wonder, could this happen to me? What an intense movie, I still get chills whenever I see this movie on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spectacular "Horror" Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who say this movie isn't scary and laugh at it are ignorant of the truth. What a lot of people do not know, is that this movie is based on a true story. It REALLY happened. Possession is a REAL thing and does happen to people. Real exorcisms are far worse and terrifying than this movie portrayed them. The reason why nobody came out with the truth is because it is said that Mr. Blatty obtained his information in an illegal manner. I know this because I did a project on it. I researched and found all this information on the real case. The real exorcism happened to a boy, not a girl, because he was contacting his "Aunt Tillie" from a Quija board. There were no stairs, and no one was really flung out the window, that was all made up. But the priests involved in the real case were abused terribly. One priest was stabbed very deeply in his arm and knocked around. They said that the possessed boy need ten strong men to hold him down. So, when you watch this movie, approach it seriously. So what if some of the special effects look a tad cheesy, remember, it was revolutionary technology when it first came out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very scary film if taken seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Exorcist" is a cult classic of horror cinema. The plot is known by everybody: a girl(Reagan) is acting strange, her attitude has changed drastically, and she's experiencing strange changes in her body. After her mother tried to discover what was her "sickness", she asked help from a priest who was convinced that Reagan needed an exorcism. When I watched this film in it's re-release in the past year, people laughed when Reagan showed symptons of possession, and when the superb special effects for that time were shown, people laughed their socks off... I can't believe the little criteria that some people have, and it's sad that people that do not appreciate new attempts in horror movies. When it first came out in theaters, back in 1973 it receieved excelent critics, and it was as huge box-office hit. This movie was even nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 1974 -including Best Picture, and Best Director-. Anyways, if you wanna experience something new, feel the fear for the devil, TAKE SERIOUSLY "The Exorcist" because it shows that the devil is something nobody should play with. Expect a scary film, and great acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>30 years later, this classic still delivers. if you haven't seen it or a consider yourself a movie buff, the version you've never seen is the best excuse to blow money on a surround system for your home system. and unlike most films today, friedkin takes the time to show all the events in the natural progression of regan's possession. a great mix of horror and drama and still one of the best movies of any genre. if you haven't seen this in the crisp, digitally remastered version with added scenes do yourself a favor and go rent this. and make sure you watch this late at night, with all the lights out and a lady by your side.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE EXORCIST is a truly great film that has had its reputation marred by terrible sequels, countless parodies, and a lot of talk about the "shocking" material. Look past this if you can; this film is definitely worth a look.THE EXORCIST is labeled by most people as a horror movie, but it is really much more than that. Director William Friedkin and writer William Peter Blatty avoid most horror movie conventions in favor of more subtle material. The film never goes for the easy scare to make the audience jump; it opts instead for great characterization.Most horror movies would open with something really exciting to get the audience's attention. THE EXORCIST begins rather quietly, with only the hint that there are great things to come. Some call the film's first half boring, I see it as completely essential. We are introduced to the main characters, but at the same time we see that all is not well. Father Karas, a priest who is struggling with his faith, has to deal with the death of his mother. Father Merrin is another priest who wrestles with more obvious demons; everywhere he goes he sees evil at work. Even the seemingly happy MacNeils struggle; there is the divorce, the misbehaving Ouija board, and strange sounds coming from the attic.The care taken to place these elements in place pays off when the story really gets going. Regan's problems begin and grow in magnitude, Chris MacNeil is forced to question her beliefs about God, and Karas faces his own demons as these characters struggle against a terrible, faceless evil. The supernatural horror story, combined with elements of a character-drive drama and a murder mystery drive this movie to an amazing climax, one that will not soon be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people mistake this film as purely horror. But! If you can get past the pea soup, bizarre sounds and turning head, you'll be able to see a wonderful drama masterpiece.I feel that the true representation of this movie is a Mother and a Priest facing their own inner demons that are then played out in Regan's possession. Chris's being from her husband's abandonment and fame as a movie icon has left her feeling empty, guilty and lost. And as for the Priest, the loss of his mother and his dying faith.</fullReview>

You don't quite understand what this movie is expressing. When i saw this movie i was so amazed. The story blew me away. It's unbelievable. To make this movie really seem like a horror movie they added some pretty creepy music which really helped it become a horror movie. I was astonished by this film. It's like the power of God verses the power of the devil. I was really impressed, and it will still remain (in my opinion) a movie with an amazing and astounding story, and also the creepiest and scariest film ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Horror Flick Of all time .............period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is one of the shining examples of classic cinema can be made even with the most limited tools . Released in 1973 , 4 years before George Lucas revolutionized the use of special effects in a little known sci-fi flick called Star Wars.The Exorcist relies more on a few but powerful tools like darkness and silence to scare the living daylights out of you . William Friedkin , who earlier in that year had won an oscar for the french connection weaves a frightening and at times fascinating tale of the devil's possessing a hollywood actress' young daughter .I First saw this film about two years ago on vhs and it really spoilt the the entire experience . The dialogue was unclear and the picture would detiorate at the most important junctions in the movie . But last year , i hired the vcd and it was awesome .The Sound was terrifying , and the climax with jason miller's transformation for a second became even more chilling . Filmmaking as we know is a process to tell a story , and this story is told perfectly .Director Will Friedkin does another excellent job earning him another oscar nomination for the second year in succession.Performance-wise Jason Miller as Father Damian Karras Steals the show .The performance is subtle but so captivating that it blows you away . The character is so well etched , the young priest is in a predicament with an ailing mother and he himself questioning his own faith and then comes along this situation where an innocent girl's life is put in jeopardy by a sinister demon .Whenever he's on screen , there's an amazing feeling of assurance, that he's in control of everything around him .Something the demon puts to test ,with a little help from father Karras's mother.The rest of the performances are pretty good as well . Linda Blair 's impressive as young regan macneill and the transformation of her face and body is equally impressive .Rounding up the cast Ellen burstyn , Max von Sydow and Lee.j.cobb all come up with decent performances .This film will no doubt stand as a lesson to all young filmmakers as well as too youngsters that you don't need a dude with a hook for a hand chasing people around to scare you , Fear can also come for subtlety .I Must mention that i had to sleep with the lights on for a month after watching this movie .So if u think u can watch this in the night and sleep after that , best of luck .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely the Scariest Movie of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since "Night of the Living Dead" (1968) has a movie so terrified me when "The Exorcist" was released (1973). Both films for all its visual grandeur captures horror like no other. This film about demonic possession and its effects is captured brilliantly by William Friedkin's skillful, detailed direction and acted out by a superb cast. Even the novel by William Peter Blatty, which I also read, is spine-tingling and chilling. Not only is it a horror movie, but also a psychological drama. Pay close attention and you'll find how much it really plays into your psyche. That's where the horror draws itself from--in your mind. When I first saw this picture back in '73, I was 11 years old. It was so disturbing that I couldn't sleep with the lights off for about 2 weeks. Now upon seeing the re-release and the uncut footage, it's still quite a disturbing film but also a bit dated. This horror movie is definitely supreme above all others. Films like "The Blair Witch Project" (that really bad camping movie), "Scream" (really bad teen angst slasher film) and others don't hold up to this classic. I'll take "Halloween" (1978), "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "The Haunting" (1960), "Black Sabbath", "The Omen", "Psycho" over the likes of today's horror pics any day. They just don't scare us like they use to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From what i heard, The Exorcist was supposed to have been this really scary, disturbing movie. And im sure it was for 1973, but it had no effect on me at all. It was a good movie i admit, but it was very slow at times. It took a while for the good stuff to start. I actually fast-forward alot of it, just to get some action. But there were some disturbing parts i guess. Like the head spinning part. I don't know why, but on that part i HAD to turb my head, yet it didn't actually scare me. But then again, the idea of a young girl, or as a matter of fact anyone, getting possessed by a demon is just creepy. I think this movie deserves a 7/10. ( Only because of the slow beginning )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Horror flick I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scariest Movie EVER", "A Masterpiece", "Film turned my son into devil worshipper" "Gerbil possessed by Devil" (okay I made that one up) - these were the reports and headlines surrounding the film at the time of release. Whether you believe all of the hysteria is up to you. Since I watched the film at the age of 13 - 24 years after it's release it is difficult to comprehend how a film, which is relatively tame by today's standards as far as horror films go, could even be considered scary and have people running from the cinema, being sick and having houses blessed.. But it did, and if you are looking at it as purely a horror film you are going to be disappointed. For the more, religious and more open minded people however, it is a masterpiece.You get from it what you take to it. If you are looking for a horror film, you get a horror film, it's not particularly scary, but it does enough to make you leave the lights on for a couple of nights.If you are deeply religious, it does a lot more than that. Speaking as a respectful atheist I can see this in the movie. People say there is evil in the movie, well that's up to the viewer.It is about God versus the Devil. Pure (or as near as) Good against and Pure Evil. It's not the good guy versus the bad for an entire planet full of stupid unappreciative defenseless people. It is about God and the Devil, and in between this war of Good and Evil is a little 12 year old girl who just made the mistake of playing with a Ouija board.That's why people don't understand it. I'm not saying for one second that I understand it, lot's of this goes over my head. But I do see why people say this film is a masterpiece, they see it, I see it. Not everybody see's it. You take from it what you bring to it. I took to it an innocent imaginative mind, TV's kinda screwed that up since then, but at the time it was (almost) clean. I think that's one of the things that makes a difference to how you perceive the film. Belief is another, if you're cruel you could say gullibility.Possession has been reported for as long as people can remember. This was, and to my knowledge still is the only film ever to tackle the story properly and seriously. It doesn't take the easy route and turn itself into a kooky, sideshow horror flick that doesn't take the subject matter seriously.The book was awful, I don't mean to sound rude, maybe watching the film before reading the book was a mistake but let's face it. The book is awful, yet good. It's both, some is good, some is bad.The thing about this book is that it never says for definite whether Regan is possessed or not, I mean, in the film Regan is possessed by a Demon, no question. Father Karras half-heartedly attempts to find other reasons for the change in behaviour, but she is definitely possessed in the film. The book however tries to take a different look at it, so it becomes almost a nonfiction read. Everything is disputed, with case after case being used against the suggestion that Regan really is possessed. In the book, okay we may know in our minds, especially if we have already seen the film, that the sweet little 12 year old girl is possessed but the book does at least try to put an element of doubt in the readers mind, that I liked, but Christ it's boring, give me a Wilbur Smith novel anyday.So the film has finally been released in the UK, this is good, and with a Clockwork Orange getting it's release maybe the censors will realize that films of significance, such as the Exorcist will always be there, and one day the public will realize that we are in control of everything and if we fight enough and battle enough we will get what we want.NOTE: I have recently bought A Clockwork Orange, IT'S TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How the hell I got banned I don't know! I think we were done a favour actually. Saved the public from that crap for 20 odd years! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What an excellent day for an exorcism"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having grown up on a staple diet of Freddy Kruger, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers as a youngster, by the time all three of these franchises had come to their end, they had become so laughably bad the horror genre seemed to have lost its ability to scare the living daylights out of us, and NO!!!, not with boo scares but actual pure psychological terror.... yes, pure evil.As a youngster I never caught The Exorcist, as in South Africa it was banned until late 1994, and then still released in a cut form. When I eventually did get my hands on a copy, I remember I couldn't sleep for nights afterwards, it had left something deep inside the back of my mind that made me cringe and shudder each time I thought about it.With great glee, I was one of the many who lined up to see the 2000 version, The version you have never seen before. With its digitally altered shots and its newly revised 5.1 soundtrack, this film still remains a visual tour de force. As a pure study of evil, nothing comes remotely close to this Grandad of horror films. As I sat through the film I couldn't believe that this had come from 1973. The film makers really took a risk in putting this vision onto celluloid, and thank God they did. I keep finding more and more so, that fewer film makers of late have that courage of their convictions when it comes to getting something told, but I suspect those niggly little studio heads grubby fingers are ruining almost everything we see today.Acting from Burystn, Sydow, Blair and Miller is all top notch, and the film rightfully earned those 10 Oscar nominations. Its being hailed as the scariest movie ever, personally I wouldn't classify it as such as this film is in a class of its own. It will be a long time coming before I see a film as remotely powerful as this, stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many scary movies in my life but the exorcist is the scariest of them all. I was watching them with my cousins with the lights off. in the beginning of the movie, we we're all on separate couches, but toward the middle we we're all huddled up on the same couch with pillows and blankets hugging each other as the girl spun her head around *cringe*. after that, i couldn't stop talking about it. i asked my history teacher if he had seen it and he did with his girlfriend and it scared him too. i never ever get scared and this was the first time i ever did! i went home and read the bible every night and couldn't sleep without my cat beside me. the night i watched the movie, my cousins slept with their dad and none of them wanted to sleep next to the wall. so, my uncle, (who was a little big around the hips) rolled over to the wall sided and the one side of the bed collapsed! one of my cousins zoomed outta the room and ran down stairs while the other cried all night. i on the other hand, stuck next to my boy cousin like he was my boyfriend. i was afriad to go near doors and we stayed on the couch and watched snl. we tried to change the subject but it was way to hard. i heard a noise, screamed, and ran into the room where my mother was sleeping. i jumped on the pull out couch and shook my mother until she got up. my cousin was right next to me (a little mad because i ran out on him)i told my mom to move over but she mumbled that there was no room cause my brother and sister were sleeping there too. i begged and begged then she told me to go on the other couch. i did but i needed someone there with me. my cousin slept on the other couch next to mine but it didn't help. i kept on having horrifying visions from the movie and i complained to my mom. she got up and slept on the couch while i slept on the pull out couch with my brother and sister. that didn't help either because i still had visions yet again. but, the very nexy morning, my boy cousin and i wanted to watch it again! it was a great movie that you can get hooked on very easily. if you haven't seen it, you gotta. PS, i even brought my bible to school!</fullReview>

After seeing The Exorcist, I concur, it was then and still is the scariest movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot.I was so spooked by The Exorcist that I refuse to ever see it again. In my opinion, no one has topped it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Latest version will scare you beyond belief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the unfeeling losers on here who claim that The Exorcist is laughable or silly are dumb, cheese-eating rats.Let me tell you - I just saw the 2000 Director's Cut DVD version and this movie is still vastly unsettling and frightening. Most horror movies we can laugh at, knowing that they would never happen in real life...This movie however, tackles a subject that perhaps DOES happen and that's what gets to us the most. In the end, we're left with the startling images and sounds of a young girl screaming in pain and evil from within her room. And we're left with the thought that although good can always defeat evil, it's always with a sacrifice.Check out the director's commentary on the 2000 DVD version....Friedikin's insights are helpful and help flesh out the real depth of the movie's themes. The extra 11 minutes of footage add a bizzare "spider-walk" scene where the possessed Regan comes down the stairs in a horrifying fashion as well as some medical exam scenes. Particularly interesting in the medical scenes is the doctor diganosing Regan with a form of ADD and putting her on Ritlin! Friedikin must consider this particularly ironic in light of the mass prescrptions of Ritilin in today's children.One of the Top 10 movies of all time and certainly one of the Top 3 horror/sci-fi movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Movie I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I love horror flicks. I have recently seen this film for the first time. Not knowing what to expect out of it. As a strong Christian, even I felt the need to go to church after seeing this film. I agree that one should not see this movie alone. If you want to see this movie, than watch it with someone who has seen it before. It gave me nightmares. As far as todays horror flicks are concerned this doesn't hold up. It is a classic. For fans of horror flicks watch this movie and not be disappointed. One more suggestion is that you should never watch this movie at night. Freddy and Jason have nothing on this little girl. She is pure evil and will make you believe that there may very well be a Satan. My hats off to Linda Blair for her performance in this movie. She gave a great performance. Watch this movie horror fans but don't watch it alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>modern classic, milestone, masterpiece and must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is a classic, and a modern one at that. So what's a `Modern Classic'? How about this: a landmark work of art that stands the test of time and is immune to criticism, from generation to generation. That, at least, was what I thought until I saw the re-release in the company of a typical weekend multiplex audience. Even a masterpiece like The Exorcist clearly needs to be watched with the historical context in mind. How else is it possible to explain the audience's laughter at the film's most disturbing and shocking scenes? (A generation ago, audiences were fainting en masse.) Admittedly, the film was made in the Middle Ages ? or was it only 30 years ago? ? and the effects (the revolving head, say, or the strange spider-walk down the stairs), though pretty special at the time, do not bear comparison with present-day computer-generated imagery. (Anyone who went to see Dungeons &amp; Dragons might beg to differ!) But The Exorcist is still one of the best and scariest (horror) films ever made. Maybe the giggles served only to mask the nervousness or tension that such an effective movie can create, and not just among the more faint-hearted members of a cinema audience.This new version of The Exorcist is what they call the `director's cut'. Eleven minutes of previously unused footage have been included in what is by now, though, generally accepted as writer William Peter Blatty's version. But that is not to say that the studio too will have been perfectly happy to rake in even more money with what is already one of the highest grossing horror films of all time. Only last year, Britain saw the release and subsequent box-office success of the original 1973 cut, but only with this version do we finally get close to Blatty's vision, based on his best-selling novel. Nothing really important has been added (or rather, nothing really important was left out in 1973). There is a stronger religious dimension, which gives the film an eerie undertone, and just a few more gruesome details to satisfy today's horror fans. With so few changes, you could really just as well get the original cut from your local video store. But the fact is that nothing beats the experience of watching The Exorcist, complete with great picture quality and surround sound, on the suitably large screens at the Utopolis.Luxembourg's `cinéphiles' breathed a huge sigh of relief when a print of the film did at last reach the country ? one day into the Cinénygma film festival, although not as part of the festival programme. (Director William Friedkin had personally refused to allow it to be shown as the festival's opening film.). Friedkin, a very popular and talented director, and incidentally creator of the best chase sequence ever shown on film (in The French Connection), now seems to be on something of a downward curve from the cult status he acquired with back-to-back successes The French Connection and The Exorcist. A flop like the politically ambiguous Rules of Engagement would be enough to put paid to most directors' careers, though Friedkin might just find his way back into the A-list of Hollywood film-makers.Let us hope that, disappointing audience reaction notwithstanding, this timely re-release of The Exorcist will introduce a whole new group of (serious) fans to the movie ? or should that be `franchise', what with the fourth instalment, Exorcist: Dominion, now apparently in the pipeline.At the moment, The Exorcist is, alongside Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, probably your best chance of seeing a real masterpiece on our local screens. It is, after all, a milestone film, a genuine must-see, and ? that very rare commodity ? a universally acclaimed horror film. You just need to allow yourself to be frightened by a film that relies more on atmosphere than on shock effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why can't modern films be this good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is no lie when they claim this is the scariest film of all time!It does not rely on pathetic lines or surprises to build tension. There is no 'teen' aspect that just about every scary/horror film has today! The topic is something we don't really know much about and probably don't believe in but we still wonder. The victims are truly ones we feel for (anyone who does not want to cry for Regan obviously cares for no one!). And finally it truly is shocking. So many time have certain things been built up in films of this style only to be revealed or shown completely simply for us to realize that they aren't that schocking at all!The closest film to this one in modern times would have to be "Silence of the Lambs". They both have an intelligence and an emotion that no other film has. And at the same time you still wonder "is this real". The films suspend disbelief.Unfortunately the film is old now, according to our standards today it has poor sound and picture quality, old SPFX, and so on. Which means it no longer scares us so much as it seems fake. But ignoring that you cannot deny it is leagues ahead of anything hollywood or anyone else has produced since!Don't believe me? Can you name a film made in the last ten years that truly scared you! I mean truly scared you! I am not talking "that's disgusting" or "I jumped out of my seat when that happened". I am talking "I am not going to sleep well tonight"! By the way if you say "The Blair Witch Project" I would ask you to stop smoking whatever it is you are on!</fullReview>

For those people reading and saying What and A** I have one thing to say to you people, try and understand the movie. This movie is brilliant becuase it is the greatest battle of all time Good vs. Evil, God vs. Satan ( in my opinion it doesn't get much better than that. And Linda Blair gives the best performance of her carrer.

		<shortDescription>Yes, It's Still The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the Exorcist is a masterpiece, and quite possibly the greatest horror movie ever committed to film. Maybe the problem the younger crowd has with it is that a):Religion,especially Christianity, has come to be regarded as a vague superstition at best...there is no God, therefore there can be no Devil and b): after 20 years of slasher/hacker/blood and guts type movies, this one probably looks pretty tame and wimpy by comparison. As for those who think it's too "slow"...get an attention span! The devoted fans of Friday The 13th/Halloween/Scream/etc. must be a bit baffled by the presence of actual intelligent conversation that lasts for,golly, minutes! The idea that a quarter hour can pass by without a beheading,boiling,burning or topless starlet must be the sign of an inferior movie. I saw the Exorcist on it's original run in 1973. I love horror movies and this is the only one that really put a scare on me. I think what spooked me was that this was about a true story...Blatty based his story on an actual incident that occurred in Maryland in the late 40's. It involved a young boy, and of course a lot of the details were different...but there were some very big similarities. I think the most frightening, primal part of it all was the concept of monstrous evil inhabiting the body and soul of the most innocent and vulnerable. But of course that's just my opinion...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that won't lose its shock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays not everybody is still used to slowly built-up plot lines like in The Exorcist. Then again, futile details like a plot have been thrown overboard in most recent horror movies. Apart from setting the story and confronting us with the growing terror lurking underneath, this slowly built-up story serves another purpose: when the horror finally does come, it hits you all the harder.If The Exorcist has become a classic, this has largely to do with the fact that it was the first mainstream movie that used splatter and gore. The movie isn't a complete success: the second time Ellen Burnstyn and Linda Blair share the screen (the first time they have to act) isn't really a highlight in the history of acting. The acting seems a little wooden. The same can be said for some of the scene transitions. Never mind that, though. Once the horror really starts, the movie is a rollercoaster of all kinds of horror. Like Mürnau's Nosferatu, this movie will always keep shocking you. In 2001 the movie is still as repulsive as it was in 1973 (even though considerably less people will run out of the theatre because they have to throw up). Not that many horror films can shock you this much. Ellen Burnstyn will always remember this movie because of her spinal injury (the pain on her face when she's thrown through the room is real), just like we will always remember her for this movie. The same can be said for all the actors in the movie: you'll always remember them from this movie (except possibly Max von Sydow).The biggest shame is the ending they had to make: the original one might have been too shocking, this one is definitely too ludicrous. It's a very bad spot on an otherwise remarkable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had avoided "The Exorcist" for many years because I am not the kind of person who likes to be grossed out when watching a film. Some intriguing interviews with author William Peter Blatty on the subject that in the end the movie is an expression of faith finally compelled me to rent it and give it a shot.On the whole, I was impressed. The movie is an eerily effective accomplishment by taking the subject seriously and by not forgetting the more important theological implications, which in a movie made today would be totally lost or mocked given Hollywood's current penchant for cheap, gross-out exploitation. The moments that repel in this movie are shocking but they do have a context for demonstrating that they are still shocking, and are tailored in fact to the sensitivities of those who still regard such scenes as horrifying, whereas the jaded minds of today think that the dialogue the demon possessed Regan utters is probably okay and normal.There is one thing however that I have to get off my chest, and that is my total disgust with both Blatty and director William Friedkin for their shameful assertions on both commentary tracks of the DVD that Peter Falk's Columbo is a steal of the Lieutenant Kindermann character. For the record, the Columbo character was introduced by Richard Levinson and William Link in their original 1961 stage play "Prescription Murder" a full seven years before Blatty began writing his novel. Second, Peter Falk first played Columbo in a February 1968 television adaptation of "Prescription Murder" a full three years before the "Exorcist" novel was published and the show was already airing on television for two and a half years when the movie was released. The "theft" charge of Blatty and Friedkin is outrageous and a demeaning insult to both Levinson and Link, who didn't need Kindermann to make Columbo a classic character.Having vented my anger on that point, I will still say "The Exorcist" is worth a look, especially in the expanded version that more clearly articulates the theological message Blatty wanted. It is not an explotitative slasher/horror film but a compelling drama that this Protestant found refreshing in contrast to what gets served up today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrifying and brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is clearly a standout in cinema history. The screenplay, which was originally a novel by William Peter Blattly, is brilliant and terrifying. The special effects are very vivid, but seem very realistic. I think that the greatest thing about "The Exorcist" is the acting and directing. Director William Friedken does an excellent job, some of the best directorial work I've ever seen. It's been said that he jerked Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair around in a harness in order to get the terrified looks he wanted from them. He deserved the Oscar for best director. Ellen Burstyn is perfect in this role. Never have I ever seen such a realistic and touching performance. She put 150% into this film. She deserved both the oscar and golden globe for her performance and she lost it somehow to Glenda Jackson. Jason Miller is also very good, and deserved the oscar as well. Linda Blair didn't do much in this film by the looks of it, and this leaked out by the time of the academy awards, which is probably why she lost. Mercedes Mccambridge's voice is very creepy. This is a 5 star movie in my opinion (out of 5).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this I was a high school student. I went with my friend Linda and we laughed our heads off through the whole thing (such camp!). Then I went home, went to bed, turned the lights off and...YIKES!...after about 30 seconds that light came right back on and stayed on for the rest of the week. Although I *thought* I no longer believed in the boogey man, I soon found out I wasn't quite as sophisticated as I thought. Since then, I've watched THE EXORCIST many times - it's still a well made movie. It's a mistake to think this is simply a horror movie - it's a story about guilt, regret, courage, fear, loss of faith, maintaining faith when faced with God's inscrutable plan, etc. Some interesting notes: some of the priests in the movie were in fact played by real-life priests; and Max von Sydow was only about 44 when he played Fr. Merrin, just 4 years older than actress Ellen Burstyn who played Regan's mother. Also, The Exorcist was based on an actual incident that occurred in about 1948, but the characters and place settings were changed completely. A made-for-TV movie that followed the actual events more closely (it was a boy, not a girl, who was possessed) recently aired. Just one minor nitpick: why was Fr. Karras a Catholic priest with an obvious Greek background when Greeks are virtually all of the Greek Orthodox religion? BTW, Mercedes McCambridge is an American actress, not British has one poster has commented here.</fullReview>

It's the scariest movie of all time, hands down. What makes it scary is how the story is told and the idea that something like this could happen.

		<fullReview>Not really much of a spoiler...just don't want to be blacklisted.I saw the Exorcist for the first time last night and I LOVED IT! Unlike most "horror" films who use the jumping-at-you-from-dark-corners method, this was genuinely scary because the subject was so real and the topic so fantasy like. There are many classic scenes in this. But it was a classic because of its ability to make the contrast between Regan as a cute little girl and then turn into this ugly demonic THING. Also to show Father Karras' personal struggle. The foreshadowing was good, as when the old priest faces the statue in Iraq. He knows what is waiting for him. Kudos to the makeup artist! The film was not overproduced or overhyped and its grainy feel gave it that down to earth feeling. Overall, this deserves a 9 or maybe even a 10 because of its good and fresh (at the time) cinematic qualities. Also, of course, kick ass performances by Father Karras, the mother, and of course Linda Blair. If you haven't seen this yet, GO SEE IT NOW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dislike two things about this movie, the editing and the screenplay. But everything else is great, it still managed to deliver the same aural presence that I remembered when I saw it as a kid. I think it could be the fact that Jack MacGowran and several other people died making this movie, they are probably getting all the people who are watching this film, and bravo to them (poor guys)!! Although the editing in all the scenes that foreshadow this movie didn't seem to be planned very well, it had little impact on the rest of the movie, which is rare. The screenplay has one small thing, a SPOILER to be sure, but a small irk nonetheless, the crucifix scene (I can't see how she's raping or masturbating w/ it) looked a little silly to me, it should've had more eroticism to it, better subjective lighting would've been a plus. The way it's presented would make me think, "Oh, what's she doing now ?" rather than "!" But I think that was the only way to get it past the censors back in 73', everything else is precision and atmophere, which this movie carries well. A 9, with another hand to the people who died on the set of this film, it'll carry on if they have a say in it!</fullReview>

It was very gripping, very thrilling. Stands out from the horror genre we're used to (all the Scream like slasher flicks).

I didn't have the luxury of seeing it the original time in the theater as I was born in 1973, but I've seen it MANY times on video/DVD and just recently in it's newest incarnation in the movies. It has never "scared the hell out of me" as most say, though I think it is absolutely intense and very much a fearless film in its presentation. They depicted scenes so graphically and most importantly INTEGRAL to the story...no movie has even come close! The list of pretenders is seemingly endless: Stigmata, Lost Souls, End of days, Ninth Gate...so many like themed films...and all nowhere near as good! I feel sorry for current moviegoers think that they maybe scared when seeing a current film because it just doesn't happen anymore...The House on Haunted Hill, the Haunting...these "horror" films are simply HORRID!! I've seen Exorcist twice now and it is still 100 times more enjoyable than seeing "The Watcher", which is dubbed on tv commercials as "the scariest movie you'll see this fall". So everyone, rejoice in our late 70's religious horror flicks (Exorcist/Omen, etc.) because filmmakers have completly chickened out...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers, etc.I saw this movie for the first time in 1997, when I was 15. I guess since I'd heard so much about it, and seen so many parodies, I didn't fully appreciate or understand it. For instance, since I already knew about the head-spinning, when the homicide detective showed up at the MacNeil's townhouse after Burke's death and told Mrs. MacNeil that Burke's head had been turned completely around, it came as no surprise to me. Had I not known about the content in the movie beforehand, I would have been perplexed about Burke's broken neck, and then shocked to see the possessed Raegan do the same thing in the very next scene. That's just one example - I could cite many others that presented the same problem. Also, I watched it on TNT, hosted by Joe Bob Briggs nonetheless, so it was heavily edited and had frequent commercial breaks peppered with Joe Bob's humor (and Joe Bob is great - I definitely would have appreciated his presence more were it not the first time I was watching The Exorcist).Yesterday, however, my friend and I rented the movie (VHS) and watched it straight through. It was upon this second viewing that I realized the network television version of The Exorcist does not do justice to the original. It was only after renting it, and being able to truly concentrate on the characters and plot without frequent interruptions that I felt truly impressed with the movie. I guess I need to catch up with everyone else and watch it on DVD as well as in the theater, but my friend and I didn't have time to go to the movies, and neither of us own DVD players :).Growing up in the 80's and 90's has, as can be expected, exposed me to plenty of dumb, gory movies. The Exorcist is in a dying breed of subtle, intelligent horror. People seem to like mentioning the particularly memorable sequences: the vomiting, crucifix "masturbation" (looked to me like she was stabbing herself in the crotch), etc. Those definitely add to the movie's impact on the audience, but at the same time, there were greater complexities that transcend mere gore and actually require multiple viewings to catch. I certainly didn't understand the beginning scene set in Iraq the first time I saw the movie; the second time, it made more sense (pay attention to the background noise, and the clock, and not the specific incidents but what they may have elicited or what might have caused them). Unlike most current movies, The Exorcist does not spoonfeed the audience and explain every little glitch and mystery - and in The Exorcist, there are plenty of these. From what I can tell, most modern films either have them but explain them, or don't have them at all. My generation may ridicule The Exorcist for its subtlety, because we're used to being fed information in movies and not having to come up with it ourselves (I don't mean to sound condescending toward my peers - I do the same thing).It's a lot easier to make a "horror" movie these days. All you need are computer-generated effects to plug into the same basic plot format. While some of the special effects in The Exorcist look cheesy now, they were a hell of a lot harder to pull off back then. And the movie itself did not follow the horror movie formula we're all so used to now. It plays with the viewer's mind, leaving much to the imagination. I thought it was visually and psychologically haunting. I was frightened when the director wanted his audience to be, 27 years after the fact. I believe that, despite the very non-technical special effects, The Exorcist has withstood the test of time (though I'm not sure I'll be able to say that ten or twenty years from now). It's success lies in the ingenuity, the nonfictional basis of the story, and the incorporation of what is for many the most evil and fearsome entity of them all.Some bad points: poor editing! The scene changes are so abrupt, and in the version I saw, Raegan went from being a healthy, normal child to having been ill for some time with no transition in between (I hear this is fixed in the version in the theaters). I would have liked the soundtrack to have had a more significant presence, and for the character in the title role to have been more developed. On the whole, however, The Exorcist delivers. I'm looking forward to watching it again, and possibly getting more out of it each time.Obviously, some hate this movie and some love it, and there are others with feelings of varying intensities between the two extremes. I recommend at least watching it since it has had such a big impact on society. Trying to take it seriously may help. Watch it alone, or in a small group - not in a large, raucous group. Ultimately, it's not my place to say whether or not you'll enjoy it. I, personally, did. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this with an audience indicates changes which seem to have occurred since the original debut of this film 27 years ago.First, and most annoyingly, audiences have no idea how to behave in a theatre (but we won't go on about that here).Second, Friday the 13th and other films in the intervening years have changed expectations about what a horror film can and should do. Drew Barrymore was not stalked and gruesomely murdered in the first 10 minutes of this film. Instead, the film opens with 10 minutes of an archeological dig in Iraq; the most graphic "horror" element is a strange statue silhouetted against the sunset. The audience made no effort to disguise its boredom with the film by the time this segment completed. Indeed, it is probably an hour into this film before there is any image that could be construed as graphically shocking. As a result of the intervening years of horror film boundary stretching, I have trouble imagining exactly what scenes elicited the vomiting and other extreme reactions the film generated the first time around.Third, elements of this specific film have become so ingrained in our culture (or, at least in me) that I'm still not sure whether I had ever actually seen the film before. Some scenes and images seemed vary familiar, but other portions were entirely new to me (and I don't mean the scenes that were added for the re-issue).Oh, and the film itself?? Excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scariest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was only 6 when this movie was first released so the first time I ever saw it , it was on tv heavily edited, it still scared me more than any movie ever (or will ever) has. Linda Blair is so convincing as a child possessed it's eerie, how much research could a 12 year old girl do to prepare for such a part? I saw the re-release with the cut parts that were too controversial in 1972 to show. The backwards crab-walk spewing blood out of her mouth as she decended the staircase was horrific , but I don't think it was in the least bit as controversial as "Let Jesus f_ _ you" and then "lick it" I would HIGHLY recommend this movie !! It's worth the money and the re-release is even better than the first.</fullReview>

I found the new footage to be an aid to the already greatest horror movie of all time. I was very shocked to see the new footage showing what I will call the Regan/spider sequence. This scene simply took my breath away. And it came at a moment that I didn't expect. You will know it when you see it.The "Exorcist" is the greatest horror movie ever made.

		<fullReview>Why is THE EXORCIST still effective almost thirty years after it was made? Because possessed Regan is both classic horror chic and disturbingly freakish. Because there's so many shocking scenes co-existing with the sophisticated, long attention-spanned "hey we actually have a story here" portion of the film. Because its antagonist is the evil our American Puritan society fears most. Because it's the granddaddy, the original, that's been duplicated again and again many decades after. Because it plays like a documentary, dragging the audience into a bedroom it doesn't want to walk into. Because it holds so many realistic performances, including the treasured scene-stealing by preteen Linda Blair, and Ellen Burstyn doing a great Shirley MacLaine impression before even Shirley herself could master it... not to mention real-life priests in bit parts, a playwright showing marvelous vulnerability, and a legendary Swedish actor who can't stop playing old men (no matter what his age is). Because this is the last great film directed by promising William Friedkin. Because so many squares out there hate it. Because these reasons, and perhaps more (or maybe less), THE EXORCIST, in all it's glory, will not be forgotten any time soon.P.S. The original cut by William Friedkin is the best cut no matter how many times you've seen it!</fullReview>

The emotions displayed in the film are what make it so good. A girl has been acting very strangely, masturbating with a crucifix, floating in the air, and turning green, so when her desperate mother who is tired of seeing her daughter medicated and spinal tapped, she gets a priest/psychiatrist who is questioning his faith/sanity. The young priest finds another priest who has done an exorcism before, and than a fight against satan ensueths.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see some people who claim to be writers take the opportunity to make this a forum for their hate-propaganda against what they call "christians." This ignorant attitude blinds them to what makes this film so great. It is by far one of the most thought provoking and effective chillers ever made. It covers the gamut from faith to God to the devil to puberty to parental dedication and scientific understanding and how we humans grapple with these issues. A deeply emotional study of the human psyche and the human being. And another thing: the movie doesn't scare you because it was made in 1973? Well, I guess being desensitized to violence has its effects.This film isn't meant to shock as so many viewers and even critics seem to think so. Not at all. A quick look at Friendkin's other films clearly demonstrates why. What's the scariest thing about the Exorcist is how many people just don't seem to get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects hold up, and so does the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: This review may reveal portions of the film plot.The big question for movie makers in the year 2000 -- will the classic 1973 film "The Exorcist" still sell tickets with its "home grown" special effects in the age of digital realities appearing on the screen every few weeks?In my opinion, the answer is a resounding "yes!" The film scares you, rather than shocks, horrifies, or disgusts as the typical "horror" film of 2000 tends to do. And it does it with what are truly "special effects." In the year 2000 every special effect seems to be digital -- and it shows. There is nothing special about the effects anymore -- they are all done the same way. I'm impressed instead with "The Exorcist." When Linda Blair is being jolted back and forth in her bed, upright then prone, upright then prone, slamming forward and back, you can't help but wonder how they did this to her, because it LOOKS real -- there isn't a digital glow around the edges. And somehow you know that whatever they did, she really was tossed back and forth in that shot. The effects here are still "special," even 27 years later.The one thing that did date the film was something else beyond the effects, and that was the medicine in the film. The technology for scanning Blair's brain when the doctors are convinced she has a brain lesion are positively horrifying -- did we really do that to people just 2 decades ago? The machines are big, clunky, and terrifyingly old, and that dates the film more than anything.The second area in which the film fell short was the ending. It is quite abrupt, and seems to leave you in the lurch -- a bit of a letdown really.Overall though, you won't be disappointed. Great acting and great writing combine with the camera work to make the film a top notch thriller, with combinations of suspense and terror, and plenty of blood thrown in. This combined with the extremely adult language makes for the film's "R" rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that I´ve seen `The Exorcist´ again in its digitally remastered version (some underlining effects, quite nice but not necessary) I have to confess: The Exorcist is the one and only scary movie. Settled somewhere between Independent, Art-Film and, of course, Mainstream it´s high above this inflating Urban-Legends-Scream-stuff. A film that needs only a few moments to scare you, deeply. Moments you will never forget, contrary to so many horror movies. Just think of this naturalistic atmoshpere of this scaring seventies.

		<shortDescription>A Very Thought-Provoking Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I AM including SPOILERS!!!!! SPOILERS!!!! SPOILERS!!!I just saw this excellent movie at the theatre on Friday when it opened. I've seen it before but never on the big screen. As horror movies go, this is the leader of them all. It's a very intelligent, thought-provoking film. Thr horror and evil in this movie cannot be categorized or rationalized in any human capacity. For this reason, it is so unfathomable and so unrealistic to some people that they come away amused and confused. But for those that dare to understand the meaning in this film, the reality of it all leaves you shaken to the very core-reaching for what little faith you have in your humble human existence. The evil portrayed in this film is not physical or tangible in any form: there are no serial killers here, no Jasons, no Freddy Kruegars. What we're dealing with here is evil in its' purest form. We avoid this movie, we're ignorant, or we nervously laugh off its' implications but it's there. For how can we fight something that has no form? Something that is nowhere yet everywhere? Something that knows past, present, and future? Something that is a part of you yet apart from you? Surely these are the questions little Regan must be asking herself in whatever awareness she has of herself apart from the spirits presence within her. The reality of this brings up other questions and realizations. Specifically, theological ones. The spirit is powerful, yes, but he has his weaknesses but not in any human sense. For he is as much a servant of Jesus as we are although on a different plane of existence. He knows this and as Father Merrin mentions in the movie, he seeks to make us despair about our humanity. As you can see, he does this in the most obscene, most disturbing, animal-like ways as possible. (The masturbation with the cross). He takes our weaknesses and uses it against us. (Father Karras and his guilt over his mother.) In the end, we are only sure of two things and these two things we can never prove in any human capacity. One: Our faith in Jesus to love us and forgive us for our sins if only we realized and accepted it. Two: Jesus bestowed upon us a beautiful and powerful gift that we humans have. This gift is FREE WILL. For it is this free will that enables us to hold on to any vestiges of ourselves in struggling with these powerful spirits. (The HELP ME that is written across Regans' stomach)It is this free will that manifests itself in the physical inner and outer struggle between Regan and the spirit that results in her convulsions and physical attacks on her body and her senses. (It burns! It burns!) Regan is fighting It but just barely. Serious human and theological issues. For those of you who are already shaking your heads, I'd like to add this. Science is forever seeking to find life on other planets. Life has been found to exist where it was thought impossible. Life has been found in the deep abyss of the ocean trenches where no sunlight penetrates, to the hot, gaseous internal of a volcano to the extreme cold of ice core samples. Knowing the biological tree of life: humans.... animal... bacteria.... nanobacteria... life is apparently in abundance. How arrogant are we to believe that life and intelligence stops with us? That if we can't measure it with our meager tools, we are to conclude that it must not exist? What if the existence of Jesus and evil spirits is something that we will never be able to measure in any human capacity? What if their existence is something we will never have the tool to measure? These are the questions that THE EXORCIST raises. For those who dare and are willing and able to search beyond the surface , the answers we might find are unimaginable and quite terrifying. For those of you are are interested in reading factual cases of demonic posession, I'd highly recommend MALACHI MARTIN'S HOSTAGE TO THE DEVIL. It is a scholarly look at case studies of modern day demonic posession. He goes into much detail about the stages of demonic posession and he explains wonderfully the relationship between Jesus, Lucifer, and humans. If you want to challenge your beliefs, I dare you to read this book and consider its' implications.</fullReview>

I think the effects are excellent considering the time when the movie was filmed. The fact that the actual room was spinning and moving and not the camera are some of the best effects I have seen. This movie will be one of my favorite to watch. I say definitely, this is a unique movie and that is what sets it apart from any other thriller. I mean, anyone can pick up a knife and kill people (scream, I know what you did last summer, urban legends, etc.) But this is something that no-one can control, that's what makes it scary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh! What a Fine Day For An Exorcism! ... Regan Meets Mr. Howdy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Sp-Sp-Spoiler Alert!) Yep. It's true - Actions always-always-always speak louder than words.And with that in mind, never-ever forget this - If you're ever called upon to perform an "at-home" exorcism, and all of the so-called religious "rigmarole" seems to have completely failed you, then I strongly suggest (as was clearly demonstrated in this movie) to use your fists and proceed to directly administer repeated sharp, brutal blows to the face and head of the "possessed" one.This "tried-and-true" approach, I assure you, is the one and only surefire method for beating the devil right out of any person (regardless of their religious beliefs), as was proved, beyond a shadow of a doubt, by Father Damian Karras, your friendly, neighborhood priest here in The Exorcist."The power of Christ compels you!" said Karras to the demon-possessed. - Ha! That's a laugh, and a half. It was more like - "The power of my blows to your face compel you!" Yeah. That (when it came to this movie) made a hell of a lot more sense to me.I mean, let's face it - Religion is pretty much on par with Voodoo. It is. First you must agree to believe in it, whole-heartedly, before it can have its desired effect on you.If nothing else, The Exorcist certainly opened my eyes to the amazing revelation that priests are, indeed, a mighty troubled bunch. Like, why else would the church have a resident psychiatrist on site, if it wasn't to listen to their many internal conflicts, and then attempt to counsel them, and keep them from straying away from the dubious path of righteousness.If this really is the case with priesthood, then it would certainly seem that being a "man-of-the-cloth" was an even less fulfilling and rewarding career then, say, that of being a cop (yet another do-gooder position). And that spreading the word of god was not at all what it was cut out to be.Now, isn't that a damn shame? Anyways - I could certainly go on and on beefing about this and that when it came to this movie and the subject of religion, but I won't. OK? Instead, I'll simply end my review by saying that, even though (from my perspective) the origins of this film's demon, and how it got to Georgetown, USA, and then, from there, chose to possess this particular young girl completely defies common-sense thinking. But, all the same, The Exorcist was, in the long run, absolutely ferocious and a pretty darn-good Horror movie, in, and of itself.I'm completely satisfied that The Exorcist served its purpose. It was a very persuasive form of mockery. Going at full-throttle, it did its damnedest to ridicule the infuriating subject of modern-day Christianity without blinking, not even once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest movie ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start by telling something - I love horror movies. I love to get scared. After all; what scares us, fascinates us. But I am a hard person to scare. Only at very few times, horror movies works for me. But to give you examples: I love horror movies like Poltergeist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Alien. While those are movies that makes me get scared, there are movies people consider scary I only laugh at - The Shining is a good example. One so-called "scary" moment there is when we see the boy sit in bed and shake his head. Personally, it's THE most funny moment I have ever seen in my entire life. I laughed so hard, I had to pause the movie for five minutes. How could I get scared of a movie that makes me laugh? That's the same problem I have with The Exorcist. It's considered the most scary movie of all time. I heard of these before I watched it, and therefor thought it would really be scary. So I sat down to watch it, and... I seriously still have a hard time to convince myself it was not a comedy. A girl cursing, doing awkward stuff, looking butt-ugly, sounding like a person getting choked and tries to impersonate Gollum at the same time... what's scary in all of this? It's so over-the-top, I can't keep a straight face. The girl is possessed by the devil, who's a nutty perv! And at one time, she pukes big time on the priest... oh help, I'm SO scared. And what's up with when she crawls down the stairs upside down? It makes no sense, is a little confusing and disturbing - but scary? Not according to me, anyway. This movie is nothing more for me than a unaware comedy. It's entertaining to watch, though. If it was intended to be a comedy, I'd probably give it 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I viewed the majority of this movie at a Halloween party a few months back with some difficulty. I actually could not even watch all of it. I turned away during the pea soup scene, and left the house to go get pizza shortly after Regan mauled herself with a crucifix and did that famous head spin. Whew, that scene gives me the creeps. This movie alternates between complete gross-out scenes to more subtle yet chilling scenes. It would have been better if there was more of a medium.I spent a lot of the viewing of the movie distracting myself from it-- doing things like munching on candy corn and playing guitar. One of my friends complained "I was playing the same song for too long". I guess I can see what he means. Bob Dylan's music doesn't mix too well with The Exorcist soundtrack. Tubular bells actually formed a very good soundtrack for the film. I didn't read the book, but, when researching it on IMDb I thought it looked like it could be a great horror film, and I wanted to watch it.I was disappointed though. While there were parts of the film that were really well-done (the beginning and end for example) overall it kind of left me cold. It was just too unsettling. Things that would have helped The Exorcist would be toning down the language, some of the gruesome violence, and set a mood for the story that incorporated more suspense and less horror. (The suspense level was very sustained in the beginning but most of it was lost towards the middle, and the movie switched to switched from creepy to disgusting).The language in this movie was actually offensive to me. I am very rarely offended by profane language, so if I am, its got to be pretty bad. Other than the language, there were two scenes that really ruined the movie for me, just two little scenes. Those were the Hospital scene, and the Crucifix scene. It would have been so easy just to edit those scenes, and maybe one or two others, and the director probably could have had an improved movie that relied on suspense rather than shock value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the Exorcist. I did. But it didn't scare me.That's somewhat fatal to the "best horror movie of all time" moniker, as I'm a pretty easily scared moviegoer. Ultimately, it left me disappointed.As others have said, the movie starts out amazingly. The scenes in Iraq: trembling hands, frightening statue, fighting dogs. Excellent. By the time it cuts to Georgetown it has you ready for the worst.The next forty minutes lose some of that momentum, but still hold promise. Between the increasingly ghoulish series of medical experiments inflicted on Reagan and Father Damian's incredible visits to his mother (the second being the most impressing), you're really ready for the horror to begin full bore.But it never happens. We're treated to what amounts to an hour long montage of 2 minute "shock clips" that range from silly to disturbing, but never exactly scary. Promising earlier devices such as the Ouija board, the evil statues and the noises from the attic are all frustratingly abandoned.The claustrophobic atmosphere of the bedroom and upstairs hall are repeatedly interrupted for no good reason. The introduction of a totally unnecessary police detective both wastes time and provides disastrously unneeded comic relief. There's no way to maintain a persistent atmosphere of dread when the Mother of the Possessed is signing autographs over coffee in a sunny morning kitchen with a smiling, mustachioed detective who apparently wandered in from a different movie. Talk about a mood killer.I'm coming off as overly negative: The Exorcist is not bad. There are a thousand and one worse horror movies. But it's not nearly as great as I had been expecting, either. No doubt in '73 it was unlike anything audiences had ever seen, but in '07, I'm sorry to say, it appears to have lost its power.</fullReview>

A 12-year-old girl is possessed by Satin, and her only chance is a doubtful psychiatrist/priest, who's lost his faith. Freidken has beautifully crafted Blatty's harrowing novel into the best horror film; nay, the best film period, of all time. This film is best watched in surround sound, and in the dark alone. I, myself, have seen 'The Exorcist' 25 times, and feel that it gets better each, and every time.Although Linda Blair was only a child at the time, she delivers an outstanding performance. The vocal effects, as well as every aspect of this film, were way ahead of its time, and therefor resulted in its success. Many people disagree with this, however they only have the attention span for an hour long Freddy Kruger gore-fest. 'The Exorcist' is an intelligent movie that brings to mind out deepest fears of the unknown. I give it *****/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting &amp; compelling? for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the films that nobody can believe I hadn't seen until recently is 'The Exorcist', William Friedkin's screen adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel. Starring a young (and pretty weird looking) Linda Blair as Regan, the unfortunate 12 year old who Satan decides to possess, Ellen Burstyn as her mother and Max von Sydow and Jason Miller as the priests who attempt to exorcise Regan's demons, the film has been called 'The Scariest Film of All Time'. I think that in 1973 it probably WAS the scariest film of all time. Unfortunately, as with so many films that hold any substantial amount of notoriety, the film has been so pervasive in pop culture that nothing is up for grabs as a surprise anymore for anyone who genuinely hasn't seen it. We know about the 360 degree head turn, the pea soup, the vulgarities spewed from the mouth of this little girl with a Mercedes McCambridge voice (probably one of the most frightening aspects of the film). What I was prepared to base my opinion on was the actual film. How did the film progress from one shocking scene to another? Unfortunately, I found that it is pretty weak. Friedkin's jump-cut scenes are almost as startling as anything else in the film. There are many things that go unexplained, or are at least barely weakly supported, (for example, why Regan ended up in the hospital going through testing in the first place; all she had said at that point that she had felt her bed shake) and plots that are built up go nowhere. (I'm still confused as to what the excavation in Iraq had to do at all with the end results) The acting is decent in The Exorcist; Burstyn is always good, and Blair is good enough to see that she was probably completely miserable for the duration of the filming. The version I saw was fortunately the director's cut, which featured the very effective 'spider walk' scene that Friedkin had removed for thirty years, and some really great flashes of what I kept calling the 'zombie face', which turned out to be extremely effective in terms of scare value. Every time there would be one of these 'subliminal' shots, you could hear people in the audience ask one another 'Whoa! Did you catch that?' The print was also stellar, which allowed us to see Friedkin's excellent lighting in this film.I caught the midnight showing at a locally owned theater on the eve of Halloween, and the crowds 'The Exorcist' drew is a testimony to its long-standing reputation and its inherent appeal, even thirty years later. While the film itself is just okay, and the actual 'horror' portions are almost passé in this day and age, the film should certainly be remembered for its impact thirty years ago, and in reality, because 'The Exorcist' raised the bar for horror films, the eventual emulation by future directors of horror films probably caused its own impact to be lessened. I also believe that once the dust cleared on the shock value, it is clear to see that the rest of the film is not as strong as it maybe should be. Still, the film is an important one, even with its shortcomings. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Sunday I saw this legendary horror classic (it was the cut version, not the director´s cut that I checked out..!) for the first time and it was something like a little disappointment to me, because William Friedkin´s "The Exorcist" was not that disturbing it ought to be..! No doubt, the atmosphere was creepy and the performances of Max von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn, Lee J. Cobb and especially Linda Blair in the role of her life time were all stunning, but the rest of the film was oddly empty and didn´t come up to the founded expectations! This flick is okay for rainy Sundays like the last one was, however it´s no classic or a cult movie in my eyes! Perhaps I should just watch the director´s cut...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After 30 years the fear is always big</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen "The Exorcist" for the first time for this new release and I've been quite frightened. But I have to say that after 30 years this isn't anymore the most terrific movie on earth. I don't want to say that I've been bored because it's still a fantastic opera. The scenes with the devil are very effective and the performances of the actors (especially by the tormented Jason Miller and the newcomer and astonishing good Linda Blair) are very very good. The scenes I liked much more are the beginning in Iraq with Max Von Sydow, who begins to fear that there's something strange, the arrival of the already possessed Regan at the party in her house and the final fight against evil with the sudden and brave decision of Father Karras. William Friedkin does a very good job in directing with a lot of subliminal frames of the devil and also compliments to Rick Baker for the make up, Mike Oldfield for the famous music and Owen Roizman for the livid photography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never permitted by my parents to see this movie, so at age 25 I thought it was time to check it out and see what all the commotion was about it. I went to see this at the movies. I must say that the language at times was disturbing. But the craziest part that was included in this movie that wasn't included in the 1973 version was when Linda Blair was crawling down the stairs in a back-stand manner, with blood poring out of her mouth. One word: FREAKY!! I wanted to see that again, but of course, there was no rewind. Other stuff that was added was mostly medical tests that were performed on her. I think the devil statue idea was lame. The ending was quick and disappointing. That thing killed two priests, and all the jibber jabber they did to try and exorcise this girl didn't work. The only thing that worked is a priest beating the H E double L out of this girl and telling the devil to go into him instead, which "they" obeyed and did so, thus saving this girl from death. Other than that, it kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched "Exorcist" recently and was surprised by the fact that it was not as scary as I imagined it to be.I think the "Halloween" series, and "Amityville" were much scarier. Perhaps it helps if you have had more of a Christian upbringing, which I didn't. In fact I was more worried about having it confiscated in Heathrow airport after buying it in New York. As a film it is very good but not the sort of film that people of may age (20) have been brought up on. We're from a generation that are used to Friday the 13th etc... Obviously the Exorcist is infinitely better than that, it's just totally different. Anyway, to each his own I suppose, but I've definitely seen better and scarier for SURE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To see in 2010 a film made in 1973 which is billed as 'the scariest movie ever made' is to get off on the wrong foot. Common sense tells us that even if we wouldn't watch rubbish like Saw, Hostel, Nightmare On Elm Street etc on a bet they have to contain gratuitous footage far more disturbing than anything Friedkin and Blatty could dream up 30 odd years ago. That out of the way it is still psychologically difficult to forget the hype whilst watching the movie. Of COURSE it has more depth than any dozen so-called 'horror' flicks of today put together plus well-drawn fully rounded characters so that essentially it is more a conventional drama with excessive behaviour than an out-and-out horror movie. For myself I could have used about three times the footage that Lee J. Cobb was allowed. His lonely film-buff cop was one of the best things on view and I have a feeling that in the novel he had much more exposure. That aside the cast were uniformly good if slightly overshadowed by Cobb. Still a fine movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I didn't see it in theatres. Perhaps it's because of my age. It might even be because I had overly high expectations after reading the book. Whatever the reason may be, the fact is I don't think that this film is nearly as good as it's reputation would tell you. It is certainly a well-made film, all the actors involved are great, the effects aren't bad, and Friedkin directs the film superbly. I especially enjoyed the hidden "faces" that show up in numerous scenes. Is it scary? Not as far as I'm concerned it isn't. Perhaps a devout Catholic would think differently, but I wasn't frightened in the least. I don't believe in these occurrences, and that takes away any scare factor that there may have been, unless you're afraid of projectile vomit. Though the actors work well with what they have, the characters are all very flat. Very few of them are fleshed out, which is a shame. For a much better experience, read the book. The characters are all more fleshed out, more occurrences are explained, and it still leaves room for your beliefs.5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie killed by its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many surveys "The Exorcist" is voted as the scariest movie ever. To be stated as good gives pressure to any film. To be stated the best gives a movie a weight which is almost unbearable. In my opinion "The Exorcist" is not the scariest film ever made, it's not even close. Sure, it has some goods scenes, but they all come after hours of boredom after uneventful story.Also Friedkin's direction fails to bring out much needed tension and feeling of uneasiness to this film.Another reason why I didn't find this movie scary is, that I am not a catholic nor a religious person by nature. The whole possessed by the devil is too straight forwarded as an idea for me to bring thrills through my spine.As for actors the mantle goes to Max Von Sydow, as he is clearly the best actor of the film. Other actors and directing is average at best.I can recommend "The Exorcist" only as a curiosity not as a frightening horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The passage of time has not been kind to The Exorcist.A re-viewing of the flick will show that it is slow, dull and ultimately empty Catholic propaganda which doesn't make full use of its source material - for which we can only blame William Friedkin. This is not to say it is worthless, merely that it is too full of its own self importance to actually have anything worthwhile to say or to even deliver the modicum of shocks that one would expect from a movie that carries its reputation. As for the anecdotal stories of people vomiting, fainting (and even dying) at screenings - I don't believe a fricking word of it - unless cinema audiences in the seventies were a lot more sensitive - the reverse is probably true considering some of the violent and nihilistic movies that this decade produced. Exorcist II was nothing more than B movie exploitation fare that fails even within its own limited scope. Exorcist III - thats another story for another time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the this film when it was released many years ago but decided to watch it since this was the version that had never been seen before. I remember many years ago of my friends telling me how scary this film was. A girl that can turn her head around and vomit green stuff. By today's standards this film was not as scary but the girl running down the stairs backwards on all fours like a beetle was interesting. However, Father Karros was a rather pathetic character. It is hard to believe that the demon would choose to take his body over the girls. There was an opening story involving Father Merrin, the real Exorcist in the desert but I cannot figure out what was the point except to introduce a statue of the demon. Overall, it was a fair movie but certainly not a classic demon picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight. I head to the family room in the chilly basement, turn ALL the lights off. Pop in 'The Exorcist: The Version You Haven't Seen' (or whatever the hekk it's officially called; I could care less). What do I see? An intrigueing look at demon possession. "What?!," you say. "Not a scary movie? Not a horror movie?" Can't say I did.I can pinpoint exactly two points in the movie that were in any way creepy. The first, when the demon's actual face (not the girl's)suddenly pops up out of nowhere (such as on the door to the room) - which actually happens a couple times, if I recall correctly. The second, is the added footage everyone sees in the commercials where she crawls down the stairs backwards.Said scenes were creepy, not scary. The movie as a whole was neither creepy nor scary.If you're renting this film to see something that hasn't been rehashed in a million ripoffs since its theatrical release in the '70s, i.e. something that's unique from other movies, then please do, it's worth it.If, on the other hand, you're renting this because it's supposedly scary - don't.

		<shortDescription>Hokum of a high order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing "The Exorcist" again after all these years (albeit in a 'new' director's cut) only confirms what I originally thought of it - that it is hokum of a very high order and in no way to be taken seriously.The cast act their dear little hearts out and in Max Von Sydow's case go well beyond what should be expected of them but in a film in which (very) bad language, swivelling heads and projectile vomiting amount to satanic possession and hence 'real' evil, this adds up to, well nothing more than Hollywood overkill.Real evil is, I'm afraid, much more insidious than some clever special effects. If you 'want' to be scared by what the Devil can do to ordinary human beings look no further than "The Boys of St Vincent" (the destruction of childhood and innocence by those who profess to speak in God's name) or "Conspiracy" in which a group of Hitler's henchmen sit around over lunch and plan the extermination of an entire race while making jokes and being 'polite' and even 'nice'. (And note both of these were made for television).So while "The Exorcist" works on a sophisticated horror movie level it is a travesty of a serious movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For God sake, I just finished watching this horrible movie for the first time. I never been bored to death so much. I don't it is scary or even funny. It is just boring. William Friedkin never make at least one great movie in his career.Here is the story thanks to John Vogel. Beatty's novelization of a real case of possession that happened in a Washington Suburb (Mt. Ranier, MD) puts Regan, an adolescent girl, Living with her mother in Georgetown in Washington, into a more and more difficult situation. She exhibits strange symptoms, including levitation and great strength. When all medical possibilities are exhausted, her mother is sent to a priest who is also a psychiatrist. He becomes convinced that Regan is possessed and he and a second priest experienced in exorcism try to drive the spirit from Regan before she dies. The direction is very poor, Friedkin does not know how to create suspense at all. Linda Blair gave her worst performance in her entire career. If you want at least better film, try the Heretic, much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for film fans (but that doesn't mean you'll like it)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie defined horror in a whole new visual language, and for that reason it is a must see. The film actually has positive Christian messages to an extent, but there a lot of facts that are too misconstrued for this to be recommended as a Christian. Demon possessions and exorcisms are real? but how the devil himself works is not in this manner. If evil were always so ugly and sinister, then so many people would stay away from it? but that's not how it works. Keep in mind that this film was 'inspired' by a true story, not based on one. It is very fictitious, and more of a catholic vehicle than anything. Linda Blair actually shows promise as a young actress that never really developed. Max Von Sydow is wonderful in a limited amount of time. Ellen Burstyn does a good job, but really got on my nerves with her emotional outbursts. Like I said, see it at least once. Then pop in a cartoon or something to get it out of your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others on here, I recently saw this on its first UK network showing on channel 4.I have to say, there's nothing like banning or hyping a film to utterly distort the audience's expectations.Yes, there are definitely controversial images on screen, such as the girl stabbing herself with the crucifix, but on the whole they seem to rely upon simply combining religious and horrific elements in a fairly simplistic way. There doesn't seem to be any logic behind it except throwing one special effect at the audience after another. The effects aren't always good either. Did audiences ever really find an obviously fake head spinning around anything other than laughable?The excellent opening scenes in Iraq are no guide at all to the rest of the film. The girl is possessed in her bedroom, her parents and various professionals go in to look at her, she swears and vomits at them and they leave the room. Then a few minutes later a different combination of adults go back in and repeat the process. Even the actual exorcism takes this format of endless repetition supposedly enlivened by the odd touch of levitation, cursing or glowing light.Ultimately, there doesn't seem to be any kind of driving force behind the events. Instead of the action peaking at any point, we have a dramatic plateau, reached within the first 20 minutes. At least other non-eventful horror films like The Shining and The Omen had a situation steadily getting worse, or a threat to the protagonists slowly getting closer.If this isn't a horror film, what is it? Some have noted that it was intended as an affirmation of religious belief, that if there was demonic possession, then there must be angelic salvation, but little more than angst-filled lip service is paid to any of the complexities behind faith and spirituality in this film. The hamfisted dismissal of medical science by an anxious mother in the face of moving drawers and levitating beds is not anything like a reason to become more interested in the higher purposes of life.Perhaps this could have been a brilliant psychological thriller, if they hadn't kicked all scientific explanation in the teeth through obviously supernatural special effects early on. Some disturbed people *do* exhibit symptoms of possession and multiple personalities. Hollywood always opting for the supernatural explanation over the more frightening possibility that the girl's mind (or brain) had created the demon within her doesn't help society's understanding of mental health.Moody, well shot and well acted, but plotwise of little more value than an episode of the X-Files. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Sabbath was a work of genius. Star Wars was a work of genius. The Lord Of The Rings was a work of genius. What do these three pieces of art have that The Exorcist doesn't? The ability to entertain as well as offend certain people. The Exorcist is just plain offensive, and not for the most obvious reasons that are beaten to death (and then some) in the film.To put it simply, The Exorcist is a film that set back the cause of mental health by decades. Having done several tours of state mental hospitals in the past ten years, nothing offends me more than the absolute garbage in this film where everyone screams at the young priest that he is wrong simply because he is using his head rather than an ambiguous tome of lunacy as his guidance. And let's not ignore the fact that, in reality, Satan is the hero of the Old Testament. Don't think so? What would you do if some absolute jerk where you happen to work made himself out to be omnipresent and omnipotent, and threatened to destroy you the minute you got out of line (ie you didn't brownnose adequately). Speaking as probably the only rational man who is going to comment on this atrocity of a film, I would quietly pretend to worship him, then kick his miserable butt at the first opportunity. Which is exactly what Satan did in the Old Testament.This film is almost as bad as the Blair Nazi Project. It's just a bunch of ignorant Christian scum jerking off in front of a camera. I can't wait until genetic engineering becomes a dominant science and puts these Nazis right back where they belong.As for the film itself, now that I've discussed the mentality behind it, I am just going to say this much: this film offends me as a human being, as a mental patient, and as a writer who is expected to check his facts at least somewhat properly. The fact that this film is hailed as a classic just goes to show how weak the Christian disease has made humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculously overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a scary flick alright - it registers that there is evil, it is personal, and it has supernatural powers. The movie properly shows the contemporary ridiculously exaggerated trust in medicine and "science" to the extent of being absolutely foolish about the reality of the spiritual world. That's the first half of the second star. However, if you will be addressing supernatural powers of evil you must put God in the picture as well, and in his true light - the Almighty Ruler who reigns over evil and the devil through the Name of His Son and the work of His ministers. Not in this flick.Instead the whole story is told from a perspective that misrepresents the New Testament treatment of unclean spirits and the devil. Evil wins in the end; the deliverance ministry (the exorcism) contains a lot of relevant aspects of the ways this prayer is done, and how demons behave, but contains also a lot of misrepresentations. Was this the director's take on the Catholic church or just simply he did not know there was a better way -- that will remain a secret.The acting is believable, that's the other half of the second star.I will quote David Wilkerson, a preacher who wrote in a book of his in 1973, the year this sorry production was released: "The movie The Exorcist was an attempt of satanic forces to ridicule and humiliate everything related to the blood of Christ." He got that right. So watch it and fill yourself with fear and demonic deception (as if it is lacking from the rest of today's brainless entertainment).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My review is not perfect, as I never saw this film on the big screen. This, combined with the extreme reactions on the part of the audiences must have really heightened the fear in the theater. I remember reports at the time of people leaving the theaters before the movie finished as well as the furor it caused because it was so scary. Well, tonight I watched in on my computer. Sure, I've got a huge computer screen, so it wasn't a claustrophobic experience but it sure wasn't like being in a theater. Keep this in mind--theater patrons probably were much more scared--especially because the film was extremely terrifying compared to anything previously seen--making ROSEMARY'S BABY look like a Disney film! Now before anyone sees this movie today, I sure wish they'd insert a "kids: don't try this at home" warning. No, I am not specifically talking about performing exorcisms but following Father Damien's example in how he treated Father Merrin when Merrin's heart stopped. This character, who supposedly had an MD began hitting Merrin on the chest harder and with more intensity than George Foreman could have! Darn it, if the heart attack didn't kill Merrin, those "Mortal Kombat" style punches sure did. KIDS: DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!!! As for the film, there are so many, many reviews already that I don't feel like doing an in-depth analysis--especially since there are already so many good ones (as well as a few stupid ones, but I won't go there). The bottom line is that this film was exceptionally well done and the special effects were amazing and ground-breaking--and generally impress even today. As far as how scary the film is, I wasn't so much scared as emotionally impacted--some of the not so scary moments still were hard to watch--such as the impact of Regan's "illness" on her loving mother. Scary-wise, it is possibly the scariest film of all time, but I still think FREAKS has a certain visceral scariness that beats all other films. Still, THE EXORCIST is a darn scary and exceptionally well made film from start to finish. However, I think the most evil thing about this film isn't the demon, but that they went on to make some god-awful sequels--so bad, even demons would probably avoid the theaters!!One final comment. While the film is exceptional, part of me felt uncomfortable with much of the film as they had a young child saying and doing so many gross and abusive things (masturbating with a crucifix, using VERY colorful language and the like). While an adult can elect to be in a film and say and do these things, in the case of a child it seemed awfully exploitative--even if the parent says it's okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genre classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Exorcist is set in Georgetown in Washington DC where famed actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) &amp; her twelve year old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) live in a large house. Having recently moved there after separating from her husband Chris becomes increasingly worried by her daughter's odd behaviour, Regan spouts obscenities, masturbates with a crucifix &amp; acts very violently towards people. After various tests Doctor's are at a loss to explain medically what is wrong with Regan &amp; suggest Chris contacts a psychiatrist or even stage a exorcism. Things continue to get worse as is turns out Regan is responsible for the murder of film director Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran), desperate Chris turns to Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller) for help who after his own investigation is convinced Regan is possessed by a demon &amp; recommends to the Church that an exorcism be performed...Directed by William Friedkin one probably has to say that The Exorcist is one of the most famous &amp; widely regarded horror films ever made with reports of audience members vomiting, fainting &amp; mass walk-outs in theatres the film has a definite controversy &amp; legacy surrounding it. Originally released on Boxing Day 1973 in the US at around the two hour mark The Exorcist was re-released in 2000 with about twelve minutes of restored footage &amp; some subtle CGI work under the title The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen &amp; it is this longer cut that I will be basing my comments on. The script by William Peter Blatty which was based on his novel stands up pretty well when viewed today, there's real building of momentum as the film starts off with a very normal mother &amp; daughter only for the film to show Regan get worse &amp; worse &amp; the effect it has on the people around her &amp; as it all snowballs. At first Regan's mother tries to cure her daughter with modern medical science but when that fails more unorthodox methods are used. The film has lots of religious overtones which probably didn't go down to well at the time of it's release with some really foul language, scenes of defiled statues in Church, Regan masturbating with a crucifix &amp; the eventual exorcism which the film ultimately builds up to. The character's are very good, the film certainly held my interest throughout even though I generally dislike long films &amp; there are one or two iconic &amp; memorable set-pieces like the head twisting scene &amp; of course the green vomit the possessed Regan spews over Karras. My only real problem is that The Exorcist goes on for a bit too long, while I didn't get bored I did start to look at the clock, it's never explained what the mysterious noises in the attic were &amp; I wasn't keen on the new ending with Kinderman &amp; Dyer walking off to the 'this could be the start of a beautiful relationship' line.With a filming schedule that was originally planned for 85 days yet went on for 224 the film has a certain intensity &amp; a cold matter of fact style about it, the camera remains quite static &amp; the shots are very long unlike films today where it looks like the cameraman is having a fit &amp; the editing is so quick you can barely tell whats happening. There are some great moments &amp; I especially love the unexpected jump scare in the attic when the candle bursts into flame, it's such a cheap scare effect yet so effective. The Exorcist isn't the goriest or most violent film ever made, there's only two dead bodies in it, some blood in a medical scene &amp; that's about it, it's probably the disturbing nature of the things that happen that are so effective &amp; memorable rather than because they are graphic. The special make-up effects by Oscar winner Dick Smith are superb as you would expect. Watching the extended version last night I was very aware of how little music there is in the film, in fact apart from the opening &amp; closing credits I can't actually remember any during the film itself at all. There's a definite sense of unease &amp; dread as the film builds up to it's climax &amp; this is where I personally think the film fails to deliver, after such an excellent sustained build up the ending is nothing more than two guy's standing around a bed chanting silly sounding religious lines of dialogue.With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 The Exorcist is very well made &amp; certainly looks good if a little basic by todays standards. The special effects are good &amp; the new extended cut doesn't go overboard on the CGI. Filmed throughout New York, the Warner Bros. studios in California, Washington &amp; Iraq in which an all British film crew were hired since the US had no diplomatic relations with Iraq back then, not that they do now of course either! The acting is very good from a strong cast, although Linda Blair played the possessed Regan &amp; was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for the role she was actually dubbed throughout.The Exorcist is regarded as some sort of landmark classic in the horror genre which I suppose it is &amp; while it's an undeniably great film all round I don't hold it in such high regard since it's just not that much fun to watch. Followed by the entertainingly awful Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977), the average Exorcist III (1990) &amp; the rather excellent prequel Exorcist: The Beginning (2004) which itself was re-cut &amp; altered &amp; re-released as Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist (2005).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt proud of myself after I watched the Exorcist. The reason why is because I resisted the overwhelming urge to throw up. I feel anyone that does resist this urge should receive a pat on the back. This horror movie does not deserve a bit of the praise that people give it. It is one of the best grossout films of all time. That was not a compliment. Some people claim that it is better than any other scary movie. This is a joke, Psycho kicks the Exorcist in the butt. No movie has ever made me laugh more than the Exorcist, especially when the girl starts slamming the cross in her unmentionables. I still laugh to this day whenever I think about it. I don't think the point of the movie was to make me laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A landmark among horror films???...I don't think so...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE EXORCIST was a novel I read years ago and never saw the film, disliking the novel too much. Not even all the hype about the movie could make me interested in going to see it and stories I heard about people getting sick from the shocking reality of the fright scenes.Now I've seen it on AMC (with all those annoying commercial interruptions), and I see that I wasn't missing anything. It starts out painfully slow (for a film regarded as a landmark among horror films), and only vaguely begins to suggest what is about to take place in the girl's bedroom. (It's based on the true story of a boy's possession, not a girl's). I guess they figured it would be racier if a girl was involved.ELLEN BURSTYN is the worried mother who is told her daughter has a chemical imbalance in her brain after the girl appears to be deeply disturbed by something. Of course, none of the doctors can explain why her bed was moving convulsively up and down--the first tip-off that this is indeed going to be a horror film. It's almost an hour into the movie before the girl's first big attack comes on and she has to be sedated. By that time, I felt like I had already had a tranquilizer myself.But from this point on, as medicine fails to pinpoint the girl's illness, the mother turns to the local church for guidance and the story begins to exploit the theme of possession. LINDA BLAIR is highly effective in her manic attacks and those around her seem to be in real danger of the demon possessing her. It's only until the middle of the movie that the word "exorcism" is even used by a doctor who suggests that the mother consider using it to rid her daughter of the spirit.The main shock appeal of the story (which made the book such a best-seller) begins as soon as Father Damien (JASON MILLER) begins the rituals--which, unfortunately, takes until midpoint in the film. By that time the viewer has mainly been treated to various glimpses of Georgetown and some pretty autumnal photography and a couple of cozy scenes with LEE J. COBB as a detective interested in a murder that took place near the girl's home. MAX VON SYDOW's entrance into the film is an impressive one, cinematically, as fog drifts around the Georgian brownstone and he shows up to assist Father Damien.While it's the snail pace of the story that defeats the film from the very beginning, it's this very fact that makes the actual exorcism scenes more shocking by contrast. And they do have shock appeal.ELLEN BURSTYN's drab looking mother is hardly the vision of a movie star who could stir LEE J. COBB into asking for an autograph. She looks about as downtrodden and upset as LINDA BLAIR in all of her garish green-paste make-up. Sure, THE EXORCIST is a shocking story but it now seems obviously contrived to upset anyone who hasn't heard of the practice of "exorcism" as practiced by the Catholic Church.Here, director Blatty exploits his theme with professional polish and theatrical effect--but it's still far from a landmark horror film, in my opinion. Why it became such a box-office smash, I've never been sure.</fullReview>

The special effects that were once so shocking are now just funny, some films last for ever and some just get old and I'm sorry to say this has aged very badly. To sum up if you are under 30 years old and you grew up with "A nightmare on elm street" and "Candyman" just to name a couple of the more modern horror films, you will find this as scary as an episode of "home and away" not a film i will watch again.</fullReview>

Maybe I'm just jaded, or maybe it's because I'm an atheist, but this a terribly pathetic movie.

		<fullReview>The Exorcist was banned from general release in the UK until 1998, where people watched the film for the very first time at home. After seeing various clips on documentaries about the film, I was gobsmacked by the terror the trailer registered. It looked absolutely shocking. Horrifying. You hear all the hype about people fainting when they first saw this film ? it couldn't really be that terrifying, could it?I was 16 when I first watched the film from start to finish. After the video ended, I was shocked. But this time I was not shocked at how terrifying the film was ? I was shocked at how such an over-hyped snooze-fest could be labelled as the scariest film ever.All this film represented is a few memorable images ? the exorcist in black, looking up at the window, and the grotesque possessed child. Shame then, that the actual film itself does not justify the attention it got. It takes more then a few turning heads and pea-soup hurling to get me scared. All the cursing and profanity adds nothing, this is nothing but a mediocre horror flick.I don't think I could sit through the whole film again. I didn't miss anything on my first watch, and I don't think I'll be rushing to Blockbusters to rent it again. &gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the years, I've often found it curious that this movie always rates so highly on people's film lists (to say nothing of horror film lists). I've always thought it one of the most tedious pictures I've ever had to sit through. It really doesn't have much more than shock value going for it, and the strength of that has faded a great deal in the thirty-odd years since its release. The psychological aspects of the picture are about on the level of Dr. Phil (I thought Exorcist III was much more engrossing in this area). To be perfectly honest, I found this film so boring when I first saw it that I fell asleep during the exorcism! I put "The Exorcist" right at the top of my "Emperor's New Clothes" list of excessively hyped movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promotes Religious Bigotry and Ignorance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the day, the Omen and the Exorcist were the most talked-about horror flicks that even kids had to see somehow, even though I didn't get to see this one until much later.However, as an adult, I cannot imagine how idiotic it is to call a child the devil because bad things are happening around him or caused by him.We know nowadays that there are normal youngsters as well as those who are challenged, who are capable of bad things, even things so bad we may call them ''evil''. Now come on, if I saw a tween girl even commit murder, I would say that she's definitely in need of help. Something's going on for her to have so much anger and confusion inside. She's either under a tremendous amount of stress or in need of psychiatric intervention. If Father Karas had held his ground, we may have had a totally different and more intelligent film, rather like Exorcism of Emily Rose.Yes, I know that this is a supernatural film and has nothing to do with reality. Nevertheless, the viewer cannot really enjoy the film unless she or he finds the plot somehow plausible, at least a little. If you do not believe in a girl capable of being possessed, you would never enjoy this film.The success of this film, the Omen and such feed on the ignorance of many, unfortunately. How do you know that after watching this film, a parent may not take her to a 'which doctor' rather than a real one or associate things like use of profanities or sudden change of character (nornal for that age by the way) to being possessed? Many films are based on similar situations in real life, except in horror movies many mundane issues are often given a supernatural explanation. I enjoy spooky films, even those which I know are unintelligent (like a curtain moving may be caused by some unseen hand!), but I cannot stand seeing a child being considered the devil which much be destroyed or harmed. That makes me afraid for the consequences of watching this film.I'm not religiously affiliated, fortunately. I also understand that many people are not directly affected and will not make life choices based on a horror film. However, this film teaches that a child can be evil, rather than stressed, mentally ill, in need of help, or maybe simply innocent.Please do NOT watch it, don't let your kids watch it, and don't let any religious people watch it. The last thing we need in this day and age is more people embarking on a crusade against children who have problems.p.s. What's with the devil being seen in Iraq? Am I imagining things or has it been an effort to symbolically represent the Middle East as evil?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 23 year olds review of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will state that after seeing countless good reviews from this -- and I will acknowledge this as a classic; nonetheless, it is a film that I was left incredibly bored throughout the entire 2 hour process. I am a 23 year old male and I have seen every 'new age' horror movie in the books -- as of recently there have not been many good ones so I thought I'd give this one a try. That was a mistake. It was incredibly boring. I apologize to all you fans from an older generation than me, this review (my first and the only reason I made an account) is to warn those in a similar position that I was in -- you do not need to watch this movie. It is by no means a bad film -- but it is very, VERY boring and is not scary in any way. If you were born in the range 1985-1995 there are plenty of better options out there -- this is not the solution. Do not watch this and do not let this be a let down like it was for me. Let this film be something ineffable and know it for what it was -- a foundation for better movies to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Description of an existence - page of cruel history. Facts and words. And a cultural myth. It is not only adaptation of biography. Regan MacNeil may be everyone. A silhouette in the autumn of a century who fight for an ideal. I enjoyed it as an offbeat comedy-horror jaunt, but it wasn't a dusty jewel like Tremors or The Beastmaster or whatever I was expecting... just a funny idea stretched out for 80 minutes with the help of Von Snydow and a solid little cast.So, no masterpiece, nothing spectacular. But a very important occasion to discover the world more that shadows collection. A film about roots of sense. Steps of exception, behind ordinary rules or soft lies. Good acting and sensitive solutions to describe the reality of politics and answers of a man for who culture is real religion. Sad and melancholic, delicate and precise, , base of a public image in literary life, this movie must be good occasion to meditate at the soul of things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I am a Christian, I could not even get a chill out of this movie. It seems quaint to see many of the scenes of possession such as Regan masturbating with the crucifix and the classic pea soup scene.Where the movie gains much is its use of subtext and implied resources, wherein Father Merrin's past weighs heavily on him and ultimately hinders his battle with Pazuzu. Also, Regan's family being divorced is also obviously a nod to her behaviour.Today, this movie is not so jarring and scary, but it remains a classic.6/10</fullReview>

It's so thrilling and exciting to be scared out of your mind by something, so I had to buy this when so many, even the caption on the movie itself, said that this was THE SCARIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.I wanted the effects to be good, so I sat down in my cold basement with the lights off, and the speakers up loud. I was waiting and waiting and waiting for something scary to happen but nothing did! Tell me please... somebody... what makes this movie scary? Okay... her face gets all twisted and she screams out a few demented things. But nothing happens! URGH THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY! I hate slasher movies. I hate those movies like scream, I know what you did last summer, etc... but even those scared me way more than this movie.Yes it is original, yes there is good acting in it, but where does the scary part come from? Did I miss it? This will never be anywhere near my top scariest list...Yeah and who was dissing the F13 and Freddy movies? Now those are movies that at least ATTEMPT to scare you! Personally, the scariest movie I've ever seen is:A) Pet cemetery B) The Ring C) The Micheal Myers series D) other movies by SKif you think the Exorcist was scary try some of these and wake up to something that really WILL keep you awake at night, the lights on, jumping at ever little sound you here.Scariest movie of all time my ass...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist was the first film about demonic possession that was a huge hit late in 1973. The hype was amazing. They had theater managers dressed up as paramedics to promote the film because there were reports that people were fainting, vomiting, and getting all kinds of other sick symptoms when they saw this movie.The premise was good for it's time. Demonic possession in a pre-teen girl, parent doesn't know what to do, doctors run all the physical tests, including blood-work, and MRI's, everything is normal so.....AHHH HA!, the girl's possessed! We get the dramatic effects of head-spinning, vomiting, bed-levitation, and "F*** Y**!" bombs enough to nauseate ourselves (at least in the uncut version.) Young Linda Blair certainly makes a good devil child. But the problem is that all of the adults in the movie, ranging from her Mother, to the doctors, to the clergy, serve as little more than reactionary figures to what Reagan does, or simply say, "We don't know what the problem is." So when the exorcism is finally performed, you KNOW that Reagan's gonna have a hissy-fit tantrum, scream profanities, and throw up.The beginning of the film goes on forever and is downright boring. It is almost as if the writers needed to add some subplots because obviously you can't have 2hrs of "What do we do about poor Reagan's fits?" A great music score is a plus and you might get some scares and gross outs ONCE the first time you see it. If this was 1973 and I was writing this review than, I would give the film a higher rating because for that time, this was cutting-edge horror. But now, there are SO many films that can do the "satanic child" story with even stronger supporting characters where you don't have to wait for 45 minutes for something to happen. (i.e The Omen.) The Exorcist has some good shock moments, but the story is too predictable, and the other characters are too one-dimensional to make it a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no polite way to say it, really. _The Exorcist_ simply isn't *that* good a movie. It really had too much buildup and not enough of a conclusion. What was really the point of the beginning scene in Iraq? The significance was never really explained. Early on Father Karras mentions a lack of faith. This was never resolved either. Later, there is also a scene involving his recently deceased mother. What about this? The first half of the movie is way too long and slow when you consider that the scenes bring up too many issues that are never really resolved. Although the possession scenes are well done, I don't think this movie is way more scarier than any other run-of-the-mill fright flick. The ending is way too brief and I was left wondering, "is that it?" I also wasn't very scared. Seeing the child possessed was scary at first, but I soon became used to it. I also didn't feel the so-called eternal struggle of good vs. evil was highlighted enough, especially in the conclusion. Although this is by no means the epic, frightening masterpiece many make it out to be, it has some entertainment value if you can handle it. The lack of a good conclusion really diminished my enjoyment of a film that had a great deal of potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie in 1973, I was scared and confused by it. Iwas also 15. Seeing it again for the first time since then, I can say itheld up well in one respect: it's still confusing as hell.The movie suggests at the outset that Evil is Afoot with a prolongedsojourn to Iraq, where Max von Sydow's archeological crew has comeacross some biblical knickknacks and ugly statues. One of theseknickknacks apparently has Great Significance, because von Sydowspends a long time looking at it. Later on this tchotchke will inexplicablyturn up at the scene of a suspicious death. How did it get there? That'sthe least of the unanswered questions that this movie leaves strewn allover the screen like so much projectile vomit.Meanwhile over in the good old USA, the daughter of Chris McNeil(Ellen Burstyn), Regan, is acting strangely, and not just because LindaBlair can't act. She has gone from the sweet, sensitive pubescent girlwith the drawing talent of a precocious 6 year old, to a foul-mouthedmasturbating demon. Sounds like puberty to me. But in this film,nothing is as simple as it seems. Cue "Tubular Bells."Along the way William Friedkin sets the tone of omnipresent menace bysuggesting that Reagan's possession is part of a Larger Pattern ofThings Falling Apart, pieces of which include antiwar protests, a risingdivorce rate, and gay film directors. William Friedkin, meet Bill Bennettand Lynne Cheney; Bill, Lynne, William Friedkin.The film strives for big statements about Evil and Faith, but doesn'tseem to have a clue what it's talking about. Why does the Devil pickthis nondescript preteen to toss around like a Cabbage Patch Doll?Father Merrin tells the guilt-ridden Father Damien it's so that he canconvince us humans that we are nothing more than rutting animals. Oh,I see. And all this time I thought it was Linda Blair's subsequent filmcareer that did that.The film is not without its shocking moments (the most grisly, perhapsironically, being an excruciating spinal tap scene), but the payoff is sobrief, the buildup so tediously portentous, and the happy denouementso absurdly improbable (why doesn't the Devil just hop back intoRegan?) that all we're left with are those nagging unansweredquestions, the biggest being, WHAT THE HELL IS LEE J. COBBDOING IN THIS FILM?</fullReview>

The actings nothing special, the film is so slow that the suspense just dissolves into thin air. I find myself watching it for a few laughs now. The crucifix bits bloody funny, as is the bit where she pee's herself! The confrontation between her and the priests is equally laughable, 'your mother sucks co*ks in hell'?!? Thats not scary, just silly!This is coming from a fan of the horror genre, and despite all this i guess the Exorcist did influence many of the supernatural thrillers of today, most notably 'Stigmata' (which i think is much better film, almost a remake of the exorcist, and had 'The Exorcist' been made now im sure it would have been as good as Stigmata).</fullReview>

The opening sequences in Iraq, which drag on interminably, have nothing to do with what comes after. When we finally arrive at the locale of the action, a lot of nothing ensues very slowly and to no frightening effect. It's hard to see what it was about this film that scared so many; perhaps it was simply the shock of the sacrilegious comments coming from a little girl's mouth. Truly, "The Exorcist" commits the worst two sins a horror film can; it bores and it fails to frighten. That said, it is still a well-made film with intelligence and a nice visual style; it just fails totally as a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The least-scarriest movie of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When The Exorcist was first screened I wasn't even born, so the director's cut came as a "blessing" to me. The trailer was pretty scary so I thought that it would be something special. But it wasn't. The first half hour of the movie is totally "out" of the rest of the picture. It's a series of short scene of father Merrin in Iraq. This scene show him being almost runned over by a carriage, him encounter a one-eye blacksmith, a looking at a winged statue. All this scenes have one thing in common. They don't have anything to do with the movie. In fact it would be better if the movie started with Merrin arriving in front of the house where the possessed girl lives. Then there are scenes of girl's playing and seeing the doctor... like they didn't know how to fill two hours of movie time. And doesn't the devil have something better to do (like trying to destroy the world) then possessing a little girl in Georgetown?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although The Exorcist is considered a classic and very well deserves it, there is a very big degree of unnecesary character use. The story is good but is told in a very slow, overdrawn detail. The movie could have been a lot better if it was cut shorter and told more to the point. Nonetheless, there was some very good dark humor with the confrontation between the possesed girl and the priests.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few short little clips and an intense ending. So what; you have 2 more hours to wade through to see those parts that are far more shocking than scary. There is no question she's possessed, there is no suspense other than who might die by the end of the movie; but quite simply who cares, I knew so little about the characters from weak acting and story that they could all, or none of them, die.A title that quickly comes up in discussions of scary movies but simply doesn't deliver if you actually watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having recently been able to see The Exorcist for the first time due to it being banned in the UK, I was prepared to watch the scariest film, the most stomach-churningly horrific film ever made.I was terribly, terribly disappointed. In my opinion, this is the most over-hyped film I know of. Its main aim, to scare and shock, fails utterly. Most of the time the supposedly horrible events are actually rather amusing, due to the stupidity of the characters or the rather lame and over-ambitious effects.Despite some good moments, such as the final moments of the exorcism itself, this film is simply *boring*.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist is always ranked amongst the best horror films ever made. I was bored to death by the whole thing. I don't have even the slightest belief in the devil or the Easter bunny for that matter, so I thought that Regan(Linda Blair) spitting out pea soup while her head spun around in a circus like manner was just downright silly. Blair, along with Max Von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, and Lee J Cobb are all very good but I thought that Rosemary's Baby and The Devil's Advocate are better movies in this genre than The Exorcist. William Friedkin directed and stayed loyal to the book with a cold and dark atmosphere but the two hour running time seems longer as the run up to the climactic battle between Father Karras and the prince of darkness was too much build up. I remain unimpressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>False legend?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not worth a view, nowadays, and everyone calls it's a legendary horror film, much like The Shining (1980). I'm sorry folks, the truth is, back in the 70s and 80s, a slow-paced movie was common. Nowadays, we need shock, scares and fast-moving horror films with tender moments now and then.This film goes very slow and while back in the day, I got scared psychologically, this movie doesn't give me the chills one bit. It's a false legend because it's nothing special. In fact, is builds no suspense as the cast is short-list and the best part is the end. It doesn't come quick enough and feels even longer with all the anticipation they try to build up.Doctors back in the time it's set seemed to be brain-dead and unbelievable. I can't believe I sat through this movie, once again, thinking it was terrifying when all it was, was a bunch of ADR's of someone doing dark and disturbing voice-overs to make the "possessed" seem scary.No cheap tactics, no scares at all, just a bunch of profanities and some make-up and you got The Exorcist. I wonder how this movie is so praised when it took no talent to make it. Pass!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The natural world scares me enough, so I am not exactly dying for the supernatural stuff of horror flicks. I watched The Exorcist all the same because the director did some movies I really like (The French Connection, To Live and Die in L.A.) and there are some very good actors in it. But, frankly, I was not very impressed.The Exorcist tries to scare people the same way a house of horrors does in a fun fare. The story somehow very much remains on the surface. I mean, It does not seriously explore fear and its source, it does not offer any explanation for what is going on and leaves the viewer stunned and with many questions (is it the specific location or the little girl that was the prime target? what has Iraq got to do with it? whatever happened to the movie director - why did he enter Regan's room? etc. etc.) What remains is a bunch of special effects that are pretty ridiculous, not unlike The Gremlins. Val Lewton must have turned in his grave! Somehow I feel that The Exorcist represents a chance missed. It tampers with serious matter. Exorcism actually is a used practice even today (in ?private circles", with disastrous results), it is really not a good method for a surefire American success story, as presented here. I was bemused by the character played by Ellen Burstyn, Regan's mother (took me quite some time to find out what her profession was and long assumed the Max von Sydow character was Regan's father). To me she represents the American pioneer spirit. There is a problem that has to be solved, so you find a solution - period! On the positive side, director Friedkin really has a great talent for capturing the feel of specific locations. Northen Iraq as well as the Georgetown are filmed in a way, almost like a documentary, that will stick in your mind for a long time (that's what I like about Friedkin's afore mentioned movies).And one thing I know now: Never ask the devil what your mother's maiden name is. He doesn't like it.</fullReview>

Nowadays, it's a little shocking to us that the opening scene happens in Iraq. Fr. Karras' (Jason Miller) first name is Damian, which was later the boy's name in "The Omen". I believe that it was around the time when this movie came out that Ellen Burstyn was active in the campaign to free Rubin "Hurricane" Carter from jail.

I don't really understand what gets people so freaked out about this movie. I've never really understood the hype about this movie since the first time I saw it in 2004. I had heard that there are disturbing moments (such as Linda Blair masturbating with the crucifix), and the image of the demon on her bedroom wall when her mother leaves the room, but beyond that it isn't really something that I find scary. It's easy to see why most people with probably a weak stomach may be turned by it but to tell you the truth this movie is actually funnier than it is scary. Someone's head spinning and them giggling maniacally, isn't scary unless you're just an idiot who's never seen a horror movie before.I feel saturated by false hype.The Exorcist : 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** Some spoilers included ***Now I've heard that The Exorcist is one of the scariest and one of the best horror films of all time. So my wife and I rented it, both wanting to see it because of these two facts. Well we started watching it and after about 15 minutes looked at each other saying "Is anything going to happen". Well finally the kid starts showing some signs of possession and we hear some scratching in the attic so we're starting to get excited that we're getting to the good part. Well nothing really happened. Yeah she gets possessed and she throws up, swears, floats, and walks like a spider. This is all more humorous than scary. Maybe if I would have seen this movie at the age of 10 when I saw Nightmare on Elm Street (which scared the living poop out of me, and I couldn't sleep for a week) it might have been better. I can say there was one creepy part in the movie, and it's when the mother is walking through the house and the lights are going on and off and we see some faces on the walls. So due to that one scene, I will give it a 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

Even if you do take into account the limits of the special effects of the day it still was a letdown. Personally if you want a scary film I recommend Rosemary's Baby or any other Roman Polanski movie, if you have seen some of his films you know what I'm talking about. This movie was a serious let down and for me a waste of money. Rent the movie first before you buy, you may end up regretting it if you do buy it first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What were people made of when they made this movie, its a joke. The scariest movie i have ever seen was Pycho and that was scary without doing anything. The Exorcist really relies on its title of 'the scariest movie ever made' to get people to watch it. The Exorcist tries to do what most 'classy' horror movies do by not showing much action until the end and just trying to build the tension the whole movie but instead it is just long winded by doing endless tests on Regan to see whats wrong with her.The Omen (the original) and Pycho are easiest the best horror movies i have seen because through the whole movie even though you know what is going to happen and who the killer is going to be it still keeps you on the edge of your seat saying "WHY ARE YOU GOING INTO THE HOUSE, THE GUY IS OBVIOUSLY A KILLER AND YOU ARE GOING INTO HIS HOUSE".The only people who like this movie are people who saw it once back when it came out and they were ten and haven't seen it since and remember it as being really scary. If you asked a 15 year old who like Pokémon when they were a kid and haven't seen it in ages if they think that Pokémon is a really good show they will say yes. If you think this movie is good then go and watch it and come back and tell me if it is still as scary as you remember it.</fullReview>

Let's see: First the priests mother dies because she is too old, then the demon kills one guy who is thrown out of the window. (You don't see that BTW). In the end the exorcist gets a heart attack and finally the priest jumps out of the window because the demon has possessed him. The scariest movie ever?

		<fullReview>Channel 4 screened the Exorcist last night, after 30 years of its banning. I've seen this film before, a few weeks after it was released from its ban in 1998, and wasn't too amazed by it. But maybe I missed something. This so-called `classic' is undoubtedly the most hyped up horror in movie history. The daunting thing is, they screened the `making of' documentary two years before anybody was allowed to see the actual film.I couldn't help but chuckle at the warning before the film started: `Warning: this film is strictly for adults, and contains scenes of horror, strong violence, demonic possession, and very strong language.'The start of the film is absolutely incredible. People are digging in the sand, and discover some strange items beneath, jewellery, and small demonic statues. The imagery conjured up here is powerful and sets the mind racing of what is to come. The scene where the exorcist looks at the huge demonic statue in the blazing sun, with dogs fighting in the distance, is a beautiful piece of film. Unfortunately, the setting changes to an North American home where a mother and her delightful daughter Regan are visited by the devil via a ouija board. Regan is the victim of a rather unique `illness' which causes her to speak in different voices, have flaky skin, and enables her to turn her head 360 degrees at will. Regan is demonically possessed. What's more, she's possessed by Satan, the devil himself. Ooer! That just took the biscuit I'm afraid. Whereas I've been brought up to believe the devil is one mean mother, you would have thought he'd be capable of a bit more than squirting pea soup and screaming schoolboy obscenities. What, the devil has an Yorkshire accent? `Did you see what she did, your c***ing daughter?' Quite laughable really. Why not just a demon? Another problem with this film is the dubbing. As the devil, you would have thought his voice was a little more terrifying. When his voice comes from the girls mouth, it appears to come from all directions ? did he install some speakers in the room? And what wattage were they?As a mother, she really must do more to help her child. In one scene she opens her daughters bedroom door to find the window open, gale-force winds blowing through, the room at sub-zero temperatures. Does she do the right thing and help her warm up in front of the fire to stop her freezing to death? No, she just closes the windows and pulls her blanket up. Also, what was the purpose of the demonic items that were found? Satan was supposed to have been summoned up from a ouija board, so why were they ever introduced? One of the characters finds one at the bottom of the steps, but there is no explanation as to how the evil managed to find its way into Regan.As for all the profanity in this film, coming from a non-so peaceful area myself, I hear worse `mother' jokes coming from peoples mouths every single day. I have seen more shocking things then the cunnilingus scene. Look around the Internet and you will see far more sicker things today, people who take pleasure in killing animals, torture, self-harm, mutilations, suicide. And those are REAL. Of course, I highly object to all of these things, but it certainly would have made this film more grotesque and disturbing. Animal cruelty always disturbs the audience. In Hellraiser we saw a man eating crickets, and rats being hammered to the walls by nails through their heads. This was far more shocking then any of the things I saw in the Exorcist. Bless my heart, I really did try to be scared by this film. I tried to put myself in the mothers shoes: `What if it was my daughter that did those things?' Is it just the religious types that are scared by this? Why are they offended by a four-letter word rhyming with `puck'? Why are they offended by sex? To me and you, religion is man-made and was only used by people to take care of their tribes. But the imagery of the devil in a small child was too unbelievable to be taken seriously. I want Satan to do something truly terrifying. Here he did nothing but open and close a few drawers. Yes, ever done anything that scared anyone before? Hell, during the exorcism everyone seemed fearless, as if they could take the devil lying down. But at least one person died due to the devils work, but we don't actually get to see how. We could have had the devil actually appearing and having everyone scarper. We didn't get that either. Don't get me wrong, I think this could have been THE most terrifying movie of all time. It has the atmosphere there, it builds it up, but in the end, I was left thinking `Is that it?' It really does make me laugh when I hear people talking as if the Exorcist is the best horror movie ever made. It is not. These people have not seen enough horror movies, because there are certainly more terrifying pieces of work out there. This is strictly average viewing if you are not taken in by the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Steaming Pile of Demon Puke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ridiculous and laughable "horror" film about demonic possession. "The Exorcist" is simply terrible. William Friedkin directed with an iron fist, and there isn't the least shade of subtlety to this story. You may feel assaulted, but you won't be scared.Poor Ellen Burstyn has to wade her way through this crap in the thankless role of mother to Linda Blair's possessed daughter. The two actresses are quite effective in the film's early scenes, when the possession has yet to fully take hold, and these scenes are the creepiest in the movie. But once Blair is relegated to the bedroom, strapped down to the bed and bedecked with caked-on prosthetics, this movie gives up all claims to seriousness and becomes a procession of shameless shock moments. Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow wander around and intone imperiously as the two priests assigned to the exorcism, and Mercedes McCambridge gives the film's most lively performance as the demon's voice.Disgustingly, Friedkin actually claimed that this film was religiously significant, a ruse that worked, since it became a blockbuster. Times haven't changed. Religious fanatics turned Mel Gibson's bloodbath, "The Passion of the Christ," into a cultural phenomenon, and they've done the same to this. If religiously-themed films have taught us anything, it's that religious people certainly do like their Sunday school messages to come packaged in pain and suffering.Grade: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has dated very badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The showing in Chesterfield was sold out, just like the one in Derby which I had tried to book earlier. Clearly the reputation of this film is such that it can fill cinemas even 25 years after its original release. The word on the street and in the film mags is that it is still a great film well worth the price of admission. Casting my mind back all those years to the days when I was a slim young lizard, rather than the over-stuffed Gila monster I am now , I can still recall the terror that this film instilled in me. Even though I had seen it in a matinée and emerged into a sunny afternoon I was scared. And sleeping on someone's floor in a strange house, as I did was that night, turned out to be an endurance test of sweaty fear as I started at the slightest sound or tried to close off the evil visions that would not leave my mind. Why, even Barry Norman admitted on TV last week that it was the scariest film he'd ever seen.OK. Audience reaction test first. Lots of shuffling and restlessness as the film dragged on and on. Many trips to the toilet and to replenish dwindling food supplies (they don't see popcorn in Chesterfield under normal circumstances. They can't even get eggs except in powdered form). Muttering and girlish laughter as some card jokes with his girlfriend. Then when the action eventually starts most of the audience find it funny and continue to laugh at all the scenes designed to send them into paroxysms of fear. On the way out the guy behind me is saying "It was rubbish. F***ing rubbish." Another guy is saying "Fifteen years since I last came to the cinema. I shan't be coming again after that!"Me? I was mostly baffled by the fact that this was no longer a scary film. Not even in the slightest. It just doesn't work as a horror film. Where once I lost sleep over the contents of the film I now ran the danger of sleeping through the film. It was a big disappointment.In its defence I would say that it is well made and well acted, particularly by Jason Miller as the young priest. The framing and cinematography is excellent. I particularly liked the longish prologue set in Iraq and the extensive close-up work involving the main non-possessed characters. In fact the level at which it worked best for me was in the story of how the priest has to struggle to maintain his faith and how the possessed Linda Blair plays on his guilt about his mother. This is by far the most interesting aspect of the film. Otherwise it's a film that looks very dated, is poorly structured, has plot holes bigger than asteroids the size of Texas and goes on and on and on. How could we ever have been taken in by this film? It's a mystery.One question I am sure pro-censorship supporters would like us to consider, is to ask whether "The Exorcist" is no longer frightening because we have become desensitised through watching too many horrific events on film? I think this is correct. I also think it is something about which we should be pleased. We are desensitised to the kinds of horrors portrayed in "The Exorcist" because we all understand Linda Blair is just a young girl wearing contact lenses and gory makeup; that the demonic voices are merely the result of clever sound recording techniques; that the bed is shaking because there is a mechanical device making it do so; that defiling religious icons is a trivial act in a world full of fanaticism and people who kill for some crazy religious belief or other. We just don't care about the events portrayed in this film and why the hell should we?An interesting film that has dated very badly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made Movie Has Slow Pacing and Lacks Scariness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many, many, positive reviews of The Exorcist on IMDb. Apparently, people consider this movie to be the scariest ever, or the best horror ever made. Reading these glowing comments, I rented it to improve my horror movie education. I expected to be scared and entertained. The former never occurred, and the latter was only found in a handful of scenes (basically all the ones involving the little girl).This movie is well acted, well written, and well thought-out. It just moves at an exceedingly slow pace, building up to scenes that are bizarre and entertaining but ultimately not scary. The lack of scariness is actually not a deal breaker for me, as Rosemary's Baby was hugely enjoyable without any scariness whatsoever. It's the slow, boring buildup that sinks this movie. I can't stress this enough because if you're one of those people that can't stand slow movies, then I strongly suggest you skip The Exorcist.Some people will suggest that I didn't find this movie scary because there is something wrong with me, or my circumstances while watching the movie, rather than the movie itself. Therefore I also think it's important to mention what kind of a person I am. I'm 22, male, rational (ie. no beliefs in the supernatural), and have a BSc. I saw the movie at night with three friends. I'm not a cold person by any stretch of the imagination, but having been raised in the 90s, I may have developed an insensitivity to on screen violence contributing to my immunity to this movie. Perhaps if I were a devout Catholic, an artsy person, or someone raised in the 70s, it would have been a whole different story.So the moral is, if you're anything like me, don't bother. If you're like me but can tolerate a slow buildup involving a lot of mild drama, you may still enjoy it for a good laugh.~G for Gregarious</fullReview>

The first 10 mins are so boring its unbelieveable and most of the movie, we ended up fast forwarding through the beginning scenes because it dragged on so much. And then when the supposedly 'scary stuff' starts happening we laughed. When Reagan turns her head all the way around, it looks so fake but i guess you have to give the movie makers credit for it being made in the 70s, but still. What is scary about seeing a girl, making stupid noises, having green stuff on her face, spitting and jumping up and down on the bed. i did sleep that night, i wasn't freaked out. the only remotely scary part was the black face which comes up once and is shown for about 2 seconds. we laughed through most of it and i couldn't stop laughing when she was using the cross for a certain something!!!!!! most of the 'scary' stuff happens in the last 30 mins, and then suddenly Reagan is back to normal. There is so much hype about this movie i can't believe it was banned and i saw the uncut version so i dread to think what the cut version was like! strange but true is scarier than this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic + i don't think for the right reason.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this was a hard one to mark out of 10.A classic but, after watching it I don't think for the right reasons.I was picturing the film to be scary and even a bit disturbing and spent a lot of time getting my self excited watching the horrified audience reaction and seeing scenes of it. I was incredibly let down as there was not one scene that scared me at all. Without knowing anything about this film before hand I would of thought It was a spoof as there was some terribly hardcore scenes. Some of which left me embarrassed.The things that the girl said and did on a regular basis was utterly outragous.As the girl is possessed by what turns out to be the devil (not a plot spoiler or twist there) you seriously think the devil is some kind or perverted, drunken, cruel and rudely un-acceptable some kind of drug abuser. This film really was a let down for the scary side of things and the crude scenes really didn't impress me. Besides those scenes was a gripping plot with brilliant characters which could have been made so much better.It starts with a terribly slow start and th whole ,what felt like, 25-35 minutes could had been totally left out. The first plot in iraq seemed completely irrelevant.While watching the film it was a let down but, afterwards you do think about how much you did enjoy it. (6.5/10) I would say the film was good verging down to OK. But even now as i ramble on it really did bring entertainment. NOT A FILM TO SEE WITH SENSITIVE FAMILY AND NOT ONE IF YOU WANT A HORROR. seriously not scary at all, just twisted and as i said before- perverted.The theme tune is amazing though, brilliant! one to s but, don't bother it on halloween as it Will disappoint. Not great but glad i saw it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people say that this is perhaps one of the scariest horror-movies ever made. But, without rambling on about this film, I don't agree. Actually, I didn't find it scary. Some perhaps disturbing scenes, but not really scary. But then again, I've never been much for older horror movies. In my opinion there's only one horror movie from the 70's that is actually scary, and that's "Jaws".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist- all that fuss about nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all movies I think horror movies date the most. Horror films just don't have the same impact they had when they first released. Two movies that come to mind are Carrie and the Exorcist. When released they were heavily praised and were hits.I watched it a couple of years ago and I was unimpressed. I had such huge expectations but I was severely let down. Just because it was disturbing does not make it a good horror movie. It would have worked as a psychological drama but not as horror. The theme tune however is memorable and chilling. Im sorry if I have offended fans of this movie,it may have appealed to you but I was disappointed. Maybe I should give it another go to see if I enjoy it second time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion this is one of the most over-rated movies of all time. Scary, yeah in your dream. The Exorcist is one of the earlier horror movies that used graphic depictions of the devil and those type of things but in the 90's this movie stinks!! Wow, a girl possesed by the devil, lying in bed looking all wicked, spinning her head around and vomiting, SCARY STUFF. The Exorcist is a slow and boring watch and I wouldn't recommend you watching this movie. There are no scary parts, no suspenseful moments, no terrifying parts, no disgusting parts absolutely nothing that makes it a good horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Willaim Friedkin director (The French Connection, The Hunted, Killer Joe), based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, this is called "the scariest movie of all time", it is certainly one of the most talked about, and deservedly so. Basically in Georgetown, Washington D.C., actress Chris MacNeil (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ellen Burstyn) is filming her latest film, she is taking temporary resident in a large house, and she has her twelve year old Regan MacNeil (Oscar nominated, and Golden Globe winning and nominated Linda Blair) with her. Chris starts to notice changes in Regan's behaviour, slowly becoming stranger and frightening, including swearing and abnormal strength, medicine fails and hospital tests are negative which confuses doctors, they are not aware that she in fact possessed, due to an ancient Ouija board, by the spirit of Pazuzu. Chris's British film director Burke Dennings (Jack McGowran) is killed in mysterious circumstances, falling out of Regan's bedroom window, investigating a suspected murder is detective Lieutenant William Kinderman (12 Angry Men's Lee J. Cobb), he questions Chris, and also young priest and psychiatrist Father Damien Karras (Oscar nominated Jason Miller), who is losing his faith, and his elderly Greek mother eventually dies from illness. Following Regan assaulting a psychiatrist, the doctors conclude the only option to cure the girl is to have an exorcism, but Chris questions this as she and Regan have no religious beliefs, Karras agrees to see Regan, who has hideously changed facially, he refuses to perform an exorcism, but further terrifying supernatural phenomena force him to accept. Karras gets permission from the bishop, as long as an experienced priest assists him, archaeologist and priest Father Lankester Merrin (Golden Globe nominated Max Von Sydow) has recently returned from an archaeological dig in Norhtern Iraq, where he found evidence that Pazuzu, who he defeated many years ago, would return, he is called in to help. Karras and Merrin work together reciting from the Bible and splashing holy water in the hope of removing the demon from Regan, who is tied down to the bed, but the spirit taunts them, especially Karras knowing his weakened faith and guilt of his mother's death, he is dismissed during a break and told to wait outside while Merrin continues the second attempt. Karras returns to the room, and finds Regan free of her binds and Merrin dead on floor, in rage he attacks Regan and demands the demon to enter his body, Pazuzu does so and in a moment Karras throws himself out of the bedroom window, his friend Father Dyer (Reverend William O'Malley) gives him his last rites before he dies, days later Regan is back to normal and remembers nothing, the MacNeills leave for Los Angeles, and onlooking Kinderman walks with Father Dyer. Also starring Kitty Winn as Sharon, Titos Vandis as Karras' Uncle, Wallace Rooney as Bishop and Mercedes McCambridge as the Voice of the Demon. Burstyn is great as the distraught mother trying desperately to help her daughter, Sydow is great as the elderly priest and exorcist of the title, young Blair is brilliant as both the innocent girl and the demon claiming to be the Devil inside her, and the rasping voice of McCambridge is suitably evil sounding. Released at the cinemas this became the highest grossing scary movie, but there was also at the time reports of people fainting, walkouts and vomiting while watching, this has only added to it's reputation. The most memorable moments are the masturbation with the crucifix, the spider walk down the stairs (often cut out), the head spinning and the girl floating while the priests repeat the words "the power of Christ compels you". I admit the first time I saw this I found some of it funny, but the second time being uncut I respected it much more as a masterpiece, with it's fantastic makeup, special effects and sound effects, you could argue that over time the terror has lessened slightly when you watch, but no matter what it will always remain a quality horror film. It won the Oscars for Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for William Peter Blatty, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound Track, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Regan MacNeil was number 9 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 2 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 91 on The Ultimate, and it was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Exorcist" The classy shocker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horror film with subtext. This is why William Friedkin's film of "The Exorcist" far surpasses so many films in the history of the horror genre. When the sensationalism of the various stage effects has faded, the questions of faith and family remain. From its inception, author and screenwriter William Peter Blatty was not satisfied in telling a mere campfire tale of shock and suspense, he invested his story with philosophy and characters with purpose. This attention to character nuance gives the story its true power, humanity. Characters struggle with loss and depression, each fighting the seduction of hopelessness.Friedkin's instincts for the direction of the film were intelligent, artful and most importantly, compassionate. This is humanist filmmaking which begs questions of its audience. "The Exorcist" remains a brave and graceful motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film... but no masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the Exorcist quite a few times by now (including the director's cut or the so-called "version you've never seen") but not once did I feel like I was watching a true masterpiece. It's a solid film with intriguing characters and groundbreaking premise but it depends too much on only a few powerful and mesmerizing sequences instead of a being a coherent wholesome. The truly eerie images of a possessed 12-year-old girl cursing and mutilating herself are very shocking but the all the rest sadly isn't much more than a dramatic family portrait and a Catholic essay on evil. Don't get me wrong?.I also regard this as an essential movie and one of the few films that co-formed the horror genre but I definitely think it's a slightly overrated. The story develops rather slowly and it lacks involvement. Once the "Devil" makes his entry, Friedkin and the cast take you for a wild ride of shocks, ahead-of-its-time brutality and unseen atmosphere but it finishes as abrupt as it started. Luckily, there's the class-A cast, of which all members bring extra depth to their characters. Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow are impressive but yet my vote for best actor here goes to Lee J. Cob who adds some welcome humor to the devastating substance. The young Linda Blair made herself immortal and she still is everybody's favorite head-tolling girl. The rude voice of Mercedes Cambridge (who dubbed the "Pazuzu"-lines) only gives more impact to the image of evil. Anyway, no matter how sublime the soundtrack is?no matter how strong the reputation is by now?The Exorcist certainly is not the scariest movie ever. As far as I'm concerned, it isn't even the best tale handling about "religious evil" (check out "The Omen" for that). Let's just say it is fundamental viewing in case the horror genre fascinates you.A few words about the re-edited anniversary release: aside from a very professionally made digital soundtrack, there isn't much to discover extra. There's the notorious sequence in which Regan (Linda Blair) rushes down the stairs spider-style but those 5 seconds are hardly worth purchasing the special edition. Other than this sequence, the re-release stresses the Catholic treatise even more (with lots of pointless talking) which actually makes the film dull and uninteresting at times. And it's really hurts to use those words while describing a classic title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(2008) A Disturbing and Disgusting film (2012) One of the scariest movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This movie is about a 12-year-old girl who gets possessed by the devil or some kind of demon. According to critics and audiences around the globe, this is one of the scariest movies they've seen. And it's gotten a lot of attention and went through the roof at the box office. This is my opinion: It's probably one of the worst horror movies I've seen in my entire life. It wasn't even scary. It was just disturbing and disgusting. I, like the rest of my family, didn't like it that they exposed Linda Blair to all of that stuff when she was twelve years old. She didn't even know what all of that meant at the time. I'm actually trying to block this movie out of my memory entirely. It disgusts me to even thing about it. Personally, I think that they should either have taken all of that stuff out, gotten someone else, or not even made the movie at all. I mean, it's a good story and a good script, but it just didn't serve up the scares like everyone said it would. Now, don't get me wrong, the scene where she spider-walked down the stairs was pretty intense and the scenes where you see her eye turn white and her head spin around were pretty intense as well, but all in all it's just another downer. I will never see this movie again as long as I live nor will I recommend it to anyone unless they enjoy watching 12-year-old girls do horrible things that I won't even list here."That's what I wrote in 2008. Cut to 4 years later, and I think it's one of the scariest films of all time. It messes with your head and has some of the greatest make-up and special effects ever to be captured on film. Friedkin's direction is topnotch, and you're totally convinced that Max Von Sydow is an old man. It can be argued that it's just as effective today as it was when it was released in 1973. If there was ever a movie I'd watch again for Halloween or whenever, it would be this one. Do yourself a favor and see it. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

Linda Blair and Lee J. Cobb were very good.Watch this once to see what all the 'hoopla' was about. Nothing here, except hype.

		<shortDescription>The Most Overrated Film Of All Time: The Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, this was never a good film, it sucked in the 1970's when it was made, and it still sucks today when it is worshipped. How it ever passed for a good film is beyond me, but somehow millions of people still flock to screenings of this stinker while the Catholic Church continues to be outraged for some reason. The honest truth of this film is simple: it is not a great film, and it shouldn't be a controversial film. Its portrayal of the Church is if anything rational and progressive; "What do you mean your little girl is possessed, what are you, stupid? This is the 20th century." Face it people, the emperor is naked. There's barely anything passing itself off as a plot, just a series of sad, scary and sometimes silly scenarios that are largely unrelated to each other and a rather ridiculous premise when you actually examine it. Not to mention the lamest portrayal of a character in film history; that of the Devil. It is established that young and unfortunate little Regan is possessed not just by a demon, but (oooh insert scary music) the Devil himself . . . because she played with Ouija board . . . Right . . . Honestly, this is the best the Devil can do? His major forays into the world of mortals consist of puking green slime and making lewd remarks? When did the devil become little more than a drunken frat boy at a kegger? I mean sure when it's a little girl doing it, it's kind of odd, but throw a backwards hat on her and a baggy Lakers Jersey and she'd fit right in at the next Kappa Beta Gama pledge night. Why didn't he do something creative and take over the president and start a nuclear war, or take over a Georgia Prosecutor and then get her to leave law after a string of misconducts only to start her own lousy talk show? If I was Father Merrin I'd be relieved that this is the worst thing the Devil could come up with, pull up a chair next to the bed, throw on a Cheech and Chong movie and have some laughs, and then wonder if the reason Lucifer was actually cast out of heaven was for being obnoxious and lighting his own farts while everyone was trying to watch UFC.Meanwhile all of the other supporting characters have an emotional range that spans the vast gulf of human expression ranging from "concerned" to "disturbed", oh there's a few party scenes but those get spoiled too and everyone goes back to "concerned". There's a sort of half-assed side plot involving a priest losing his faith because his mother dies, a half assed side plot involving a movie actress, and another of a sort of wandering exorcist priest wandering through poor countries looking to cast out demons (apparently demons don't hang around in country clubs or boardrooms, but only in those Sally Struthers countries). The widest range of emotions come from Regan/Satan who goes from looking uncomfortable while being probed by doctors to grinning like an idiot while she grosses everyone out with her cooky demonic antics.If you're going to watch this film for the first time, watch it objectively. Ask yourself what exactly is scary about the premise for this movie. Ask yourself why the devil couldn't come up with anything better than freaking some people out and making a big mess of a little girl's room. Then after you've done this, go and pick up a copy of the only good Friedken movie: The French Connection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What means, I wasn't that scared during the movie as i supposed too, since it is a horror. But than again, horror movies aren't really my type of genre, that's why i was more focused on play and movie effects. Sadly, none of them were that special to call this one the best horror movie of all time. A girl gets possessed by devil. She got save by the priest. Plus some vomiting effetcs and bed moving. And that pretty much covers the action. On the other hand, this movie provides some unusual scenes. such as the one in hospital, some interesting dialogs and "strong" language, which wasn't so frequent in seventies. Most of this praise goes to the director of this movie.  Maybe this movie was way ahead when it was made, but since it didn't make me fall from chair when the scary scenes were played, I can only rate it by4 out of 10,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very ground breaking when it came out way back in 1973 or whenever with a lot of very scary scenes that are still frightening and stick with you today. They didn't have those kind of effects a lot back then and when you add that to the real religion of the movie it made it real and terrifying for many people who watched it, unbelievable by today's standards this movie was even banned for a very long time in many countries. I don't mean to crap on this movie because it clearly was a great and ground breaking film and the acting in it is even very good today, Max Von Sydow as the older priest was so fantastic in this I can't believe he didn't get tons of awards for the role... but the truth is that this movie doesn't hold up that well.

But I didn't. I went to the theater to be frightened. Maybe disturbed. I wanted to see an evil spirit tormenting this young girl, not trying to make the audience gag.

The effects SUCKED - don't get me wrong, I'm all for the original stuff (CGI should go to hell) but the whole head spinning thing and the crawling down the stairs and the horrible makeup was just PATHETIC! Question 1: The all powerful Devil possessed the little girl's body, right? So how come all he did was mess up the bedroom and crawl down the stairs backward once he was inside her?Question 2: Why is it called "The Exorcist"? The exorcist himself isn't even in it until the very very end of the movie... Seriously, don't see this movie.

		<fullReview>There's basically two premises at work in this movie:1) Satan is alive and well: suck on that, you 'sophisticated' yuppies; cower in fear, lapsed Catholics; know that your worst fears are confirmed, Southern Baptists. And for no obvious reason, he might just possess your daughter! Yes, _your_ daughter, you skeptic in the back. Scary, eh?2) Nothing- no, nothing at all- is more utterly disturbing that seeing a young girl commit various acts of blasphemy, unless its perhaps seeing her exercise some of her bodily functions. Satan's special effects team can even make your daughter look like her head's spinning around! Scary, eh?Personally, I'm not buying what they're selling. The movie's extremely well-made, especially for a horror flick, but at the very bottom of things, it's about as unsophisticated as they come. Satan's a bit of an idiot in this one, or at least he's not given much of a character beyond taunting the protagonists (i.e., the audience- yes, YOU- by proxy). Its main point of interest, to me anyway, is the cultural phenomenon surrounding it. More interesting horror movies have been made, but this one seems to push the right buttons for many.</fullReview>

Though I feel in assessing a film or any other piece of art then one must judge it objectively. And so we get to the Exorcist. Well-acted, by Jason Miller and Linda Blair especially, it cannot be faulted in terms of direction. Though light and shade contrast beautifully in the Georgetown sequences, it is the cinematic vision of Iraq in the prologue that deserves special praise. On a technical basis, the film is not quite as good, particularly the scene where Blair has an obviously artificial stomach with "help me" written on it.This is a film that was banned for fifteen years in England until 1999. While I would stand against censorship and welcome the release of "A Clockwork Orange" next year (if only to discuss how good it is in this country without fear of being arrested) part of me wishes The Exorcist had stayed banned.Fans of the movie protest its psychological, and maybe it would have been if the director hadn't removed huge chunks of scenes between Regan and her mother at the beginning. (And what kind of mother would play a game of ouija board with her daughter?) It's supporters also protest that the film is religious, though again maybe this would be the case if a dialogue scene between the two priests hadn't been excised from the final cut. What remains is a depiction of the Devil that demonstrates it's wickedness by defiling a young girl. This is where the film ? nicely shot and acted though it may be ? falls down.I do not call a girl's head spinning 180 degrees, spitting pea soup or badly lip-synching to a demon's voice psychological. Creaking in the attic IS psychological. A cherubic young girl lousily miming to someone saying the "f" word is not. Take away the choreography and it's a schlock-horror film just like any other, but with fancy trimmings. Seeing a priest punch a girl three times in the face is not horror but gratuity. In order to show the evil, Regan (Blair) attempts to force her mother (Ellen Burstyn, Oscar-nominated but largely one-note) to perform oral sex on her. Before this happens we have Regan soaked in blood after masturbating with a crucifix. And there lies the crux of my argument. I don't like minors (Regan is identified as just 12 in the script) being placed into scenes with sexual content or connotation. Seeing a nude girl being scrubbed in a bath or having her top pulled down to be examined is content that would be used for titillation with a much older woman. Lastly we see Regan (actually a 22-year-old body double, but still presented on film as a 12 year old) inserting the metal object inside herself. Think about that for a moment. If you met someone who claimed to have seen a film where a minor is made to appear to be masturbating with metal object and conducting sexual relations with her own mother ? faked or not ? you'd have them arrested for indecency.Yet hype tells us we have to regard what really is just a tacky piece of filmmaking as classic modern cinema. The Exorcist ? 0/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest movie experiences ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Exorcist" is often considered a landmark when it comes to horror films. I only saw it once and one was enough. I was never very much into horror films, but there was a time when I still had some curiosity in watching some horror films."The Exorcist" isn't totally scary, but it contains some of the most frightening scenes ever made in a motion picture. This is *not* a pleasant movie: it is shocking, deeply disturbing, brutal and can be uncomfortable to watch. People should beware of this, especially the most sensitive ones and those who get easily impressed.I guess that this movie is so generally praised by critics and people all around the world because it was probably one of the first movies of its kind, along with perhaps "Rosemary's Baby". Nowadays's terror films are not as praised as this, for example, except maybe for teens but even teens don't always praise them forever, I suppose.Anyway, I didn't like this movie at all. Not that I get easily impressed with this kind of movies, but it just is too strong and disturbing for my tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay why does everyone think that this stupid movie is a classic. THere is no point what so ever to this movie at all. It is about a girl who goes from a nice, sweet person to this awful looking murderous monster. I particularly feel bad for Linda Blair considering the bad reputation this movie gave her. A quote from her was " When I was young and would meet someone they would generally seem to be afraid of me. They couldn't separate me from the monster I became in the movie. You wouldn't believe how many people have asked me to spill my head around". I thought that this movie was scary, but the special effects didn't convince me enough to think that Linda Blair could actually make her head spin. I saw the DVD where there were extra scenes, including the famous spider walk where Linda Blair walks down the stairs in a back bend. This was one of the most disgusting things I ever saw. And to top it off the second Exorcist movie was even worse than the first. But I must say if you are a thrill seeker, wanting to see a movie that will get a few jumps out of you, then what the heck watch it. But if you are a person with a weak stomach I recommend that you do not see this movie</fullReview>

The greatest horror flick of all time? I don't think so...I found nothing frightening at the visceral-level when viewed at age twelve (immediatly following the film's release -- well, OK! The 'rolling' sound in the attic was kind of creepy) --- Neither do I presently descry a shred of psychological 'intrigue' at 45...Moreover I regard plots featuring minors in explicit prurient roles as inappropriate (at best) --- Artistic license be dammed!!! --- Granted, ugly subjects must, at times, for the benefit of the aggrieved, be brought home to the public in the starkest possible manner --- However The Exorcist is no PSA --- Rather it's an artistic void 'garnished' with a smattering of gratuitous 'kiddie porn' -- all guised in 'cinematic integrity'...My rating: (NEGITIVE Aleph[0]) Sincerely Dan Sarandon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having waited 30 years to see this film and having suffered some of the hype, my overall feeling is that this has to be one of the poorest films of all time.It is poorly characterised, there is no story, none of the performances stand out, none of the characters appear to have any great motivation the effects are weak and dated, and there wasn't one moment where I felt even remotely scared. It's not only that not a great deal happens, I could not relate to any of the characters, they were so bland, that I just didn't care about what happened.This film has no redeeming features, that I am left amazed at the reactions it has had over the years. Despite its controversial subject, the only awards that this film should have received would be ones that consigned it to permanent B-list status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It will scare the HELL out of you...and the Heaven back into you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film will scare the hell out of you...literally. If you've been brought up as a Christian as I was (I am a Catholic right from the cradle) and start having doubts about the existence of God, Satan, Heaven, and Hell, I strongly urge you to watch this film. The direction, art, staging, and acting of the principals involved was calculated to keep your stomach in knots and goose pimples as large as acne, all over your body from start to finish, and it succeeds in every way. You'll be riveted to your seat throughout this film, and don't be surprised if you have an extremely strong desire to go to the nearest church afterword, because you will. You'll need to, after you watch..."The Exorcist." Watch this film. But don't do it alone. I watched this film in 1973 at the age of 17 at a local theater with a friend when it was first released (they were handing out sickness bags at the door). Afterword, you'll have no doubt WHATSOVEVER of the existence of God and his powerful and saving Love and Grace. You'll also have no doubt WHATSOEVER of the heinous evil of Satan and his horrific powers of destruction. I was an Alter Boy dropout as well as a Church dropout. But after seeing "The Exorcist," I went back to my church. This film is ABSOLUTELY the scariest, most frightening, and most vivid film in the history of film making. This film was based upon a real exorcism (in real life, a young boy was possessed) and one of the priests involved with the real exorcism was interviewed (I forget on which network) sometime in 1999 along with William Peter Blatty (who was a news reporter at the time of the real exorcism) who wanted to write a series of stories based upon that possession and ultimate exorcism. He was allowed to (by the Church) only after agreeing to change the identities involved and their location, (the people involved craved privacy and Mr. Blatty, being an honorable, decent, and responsible man, acquiesced) instead using pseudonyms and other locations. The result was the book and film, "The Exorcist," a very true, and very real story of the horrors of demonic possession, the exorcism of the demons, and the aftermath. After seeing this film, you'll ABSOLUTELY have no doubt WHATSOEVER of the existence of God, Satan, Heaven, and Hell, for they all DO EXIST! It's up to us to decide which we want to follow. I choose God. Whom do you choose?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, at least I saw a girl talk like a hobo. That was entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a hardcore horror fan, who has seen the majority of what the genre has to offer, it's a little weird of me to wait so long to see a "classic" like The Exorcist. I think the reason was because I've seen so many faux masterpieces?that include everything from A Nightmare on Elm Street to Suspiria?that I've given up hope in anything and everything that people claim to be a "classic horror piece". The Exorcist is no different.I assume that the hardcore fans of this movie either (1) grew up on it, or (2) were scared the first time they saw it, then build it up to be something it isn't in their mind, and if they were to see it a second time, I'm sure they would realize how boring and cheesy it is. I also assume there are some people out there who truly see this as a perfect movie, but I simply cannot come close to understanding their reasoning, and here is why: - Cheese. The voiceovers are downright HALRIOUS. At one point it sounds like the girl was trying to talk like a hobo or something, which had me laughing more than any comedy I've seen in the past year. Also, some of the dialogue may have been vulgar in its time, but now just sounds a lot like the script for a bad teen comedy.- Boredom. I'd say that close to 80% of the runtime of this film has nothing to do with exorcism, but has everything to do with boring daily life that doesn't make me sympathize for the cliché, stereotypical characters, but certainly make me sleepy. There is literally no plot, and without a plot there is no suspense. I'm someone who finds the original Alien to be a fine movie, but the difference between The Exorcist and Alien is that Alien understands suspense whereas The Exorcist does not. There is a MAJOR difference between suspense and just downright pointless scenes, and The Exorcist fits into the latter.- Unoriginality. Yes, I can understand that The Exorcist was the first movie to bring exorcism to the big screen, but come on now. It is not an unknown subject by any means, and though this is my first exorcism movie, the subject just bores me because I know everything about it long, long before I watched it. It was like watching someone drink coffee to me?I can care less because I've seen it so many times. I have read many books about exorcism that actually bring something original to the table, such as Ted Dekker's novel "Adam", which is so far superior to The Exorcist it feels weird even mentioning it in this review. Exorcism with nothing else original attached was a bland, unoriginal subject in the 60s, and it's even more so in the 21st century.- "The scariest movie of all time" lie. I'll be blunt: this movie had me so board I was on the verge of fast forwarding if something didn't start happening. Calling this scary, much less "the scariest movie of all time" is an utter joke. The cheesiness had me laughing, and the lack of originality and plot had me bored to tears. There was not a single scene in this film that scared me, or even came close. The stairway scene was a little?very little?jolt of shock, but other than that, I've gotten more scared choking on food. I wouldn't even say this is even 1/10th as scary as a realistically portrayed exorcism. The majority was just intentionally hilarious. "Oh no, it's a little girl possessed by a perverted hobo!" - Lack of realism. I've studied real exorcisms, heard firsthand accounts of them, and seriously, folks, this is a trip to Never Never Land compared to a real exorcism. The majority of the things the girl does are completely retarded, and no more based in realism than a tree is based in Jell-O. The "Help me" scene just downright had to be THE absolute unintentionally funny scene of all time.Overall, I just want to say this: just because something is old doesn't mean it's good, and just because something is new doesn't mean it's bad. Just because some people got scared as little kids from a movie then grow up and label it a classic doesn't mean they aren't just as wrong as the kids who label Hostel a classic in our generation. If this movie were released today it would be laughed out of the theater. Age doesn't make up for the lack of entertainment or scares or thrills and cheese?it just makes something old. And usually boring.Watch the hobo-possession scene on YouTube and laugh your head off. The rest isn't worth watching.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the quintessential story of Good vs. Evil. The story is powerful, compelling and credible. Further, it's not a horror movie. Rather, it's a movie about faith, sacrifice, and self-exploration. For this movie portrays a struggle which brings out self-doubt and renders the characters utterly helpless in the face of a force so overwhelming and malevolent that the protagonists are literally thrown against the wall. A little girl is possessed ... or is she? The situation tests the characters' faith and belief in powers beyond the ability of science to detect, accept or control. Even the young priest himself has doubts and undergoes a test of faith that transforms him from a self-doubting and guilt-ridden hypocrite into one of the great heroes in the history of cinema. As such, it is a true work of art and definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

I got so pumped after reading reviews like "This will never get out of your mind.., You won't be able to sleep..blah blah.."That I decided to watch it last night. Here is my take on it. First 45 minutes, nothing happens!! Barely any dialogue, which could sometimes cast magic spell in movies, but here it was horrible.I was actually laughing while watching this idiotic movie. If anything, this movie is full of expletives and swearing coming out of that girl, who is possessed. It is amazing to see how sometimes movies like this can acquire space among classics. Utter disappointment. I can't think of any actor who stood out. Screenplay was splattered all over. I am disappointed to say that there was NOTHING scary in this movie. Nothing that would make you cover your eyes, no sounds, no story, nothing.If you want to watch a true horror classic, watch Gregory Peck's, THE OMEN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is downright boring and not scary at all. What's the use of the opening sequence when it has nothing to do with the rest of the story except introduce the priest. That is already a waste of time and film.Secondly I though the Demon would be very powerful and instead, the possessed Regan is easily confined in a room. C'mon you can do better than spit, curse, levitate the bed and the rest of those petty tricks. All the special effect is not disturbing at all, although the neck sequence is fairly amusing. Thirdly, many of the scenes don't fit into the overall plot at all. I can't believe it is still on the Top 250 list. If I have it my way, I'll reclassify this as a soap drama. Truly, The Exorcist didn't stand the test of time.I whole heartedly recommend other much higher quality horror films like Ringu, The Shining, Alien, and The Thing than this crap. A ZERO out of ten in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, So, So Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit this film is good, but it is not, I repeat is not the greatest scary movie of all time. That loving honor should befall to much greater films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974, of Course), Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter, Pet Sematary, Dawn Of The Dead, Hellraiser, SAW, The Devil's Rejects, and what I consider to be the best horror film of all time Carnivale of Souls. There are many others that are better I just named the ones that are at the top of there game. The Exorcist has huge gaping holes of logic missing that you could only believe and fall into it's trappings if you were a catholic. I am not. I find the movie to be painstakingly slow and uneventful. I guess if you find jump cuts and loud noises to be scary then this movie is for you. I also hate how William Fredkin is so prissy about everything, like he is the grandmaster of cinema, sorry that spot goes to Wes Craven who himself made a far, far better film only a year earlier and in a shorter amount of time and with a lot less money. That film was of course Last House on the Left. I suggest seeing that as it will shock you far more and it is indeed grounded in reality unlike this turd of a film. I do however think that Jason Miller is a fine actor and I wish he could have gone on to a better career than he had. Sad that this film is what he'll be remembered for. Sit this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of you might get mad at my review, but hear me out.If I saw it if I was younger, I might have been scared by the movie. I was only three years old at the time the movie came out. I got a chance to see this much later in life. I'm 36. At this point, I am completely desensitized to most horror movies.As the title of my article stated, I had a great time ripping on this horror movie. The logic behind the story is completely messed up. It starts out as a Christian concept, and then it turns Pagan at the last 20 minutes of the of the movie. I turned out to be a Mesopotamian deity, called Pazuzu, which was actually worshiped in Ancient times. I know this, because I studied folklore and mythology in college.Other than that, the moments that most people considered scary were just flat out ridiculous. The dialogue to me was corny. The things they did were so cheesy, I laughed until my stomach hurt. I loved the parts where Regan's head spun 360 degrees and ralphed split pea soup on the priest. Political statement, a definite possibility.I told you that you might get offended.</fullReview>

It should say something about evil in everyone of us, but this is completely overshadowed by the worst cinematography, storyline and acting I've ever seen. Max von Sydow, after working with the great Bergman, should be deeply ashamed to have taken part in this crusade of failure. I'll probably never understand why this is the 'scariest movie ever'.

Instead of screaming from fear the entire audience was laughing hysterically because the whole enterprise seemed dated, amateuristic and pretentious.If this is supposed to be the scariest movie of all time, I'm very disappointed.

		<fullReview>I remember when THE EXORCIST was first released in Britain , I was 7 years old at the time and living in Edinburgh and a neighbour called Ann Lyon was just back from the cinema telling my parents how the movie lived up to the hype and what a truly shocking , gut wrenching experience THE EXORCIST was . My parents went to see it a few days later ( In 1973 this was the ONLY movie people were talking about ) and their verdict was that it was a bloody stupid film unworthy of all the fuss . I don`t know if that prejudiced my view in later life but I also found THE EXORCIST a bloody stupid film unworthy of the hype , but I will give it credit where it`s due - It`s also an extremely funny film too I congratulate everyone for this classic comedy , the tears of laughter ran down my cheeks watching it . A young girl called Regan is possessed by a demonic force that causes her skin to turn blue , turn her head 360 degrees , float in mid air , speak in a booming voice and spit out large amounts of chocolate fudge . I bet David Blaine is cursing his luck about being overlooked by Satan . This is funny enough but it`s the words coming out of Regan`s mouth that caused me to split my sides , you`ll understand that I`m paraphrasing here " Go stick your toffee apple up his bottom you naughty priest " and " Your mother sucks toffee apples in hell " Be honest girls , does that second qoute seem like a fate worse than death ? I do concede that this is a well made movie but this only adds to the unintentional laughs as the cast give genuinely shocked expressions as the profanity keeps spilling out of the mouth of young Regan . This is what I describe as " THE EXORCIST factor " ie the more the cast and crew try and convince the audience that all this is sickeningly horrible the more laughably ludicrous it all becomes . That`s why horror spoofs like REPOSSESSED an SCARY MOVIE 2 fail to out do THE EXORCIST as a comedyAs a footnote I mentioned that many people in Edinburgh saw this at their local cinemas as did a great many people in British cities in 1973 , but one exception was Glasgow where the local council banned the film from cinema chains in the city . Other films Glasgow city council have banned since then include THE LIFE OF BRIAN and ROMPER STOMPER</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist. Whenever you ask anyone about it, they go on saying how scary it is. *WRONG!* To be honest, I really don't see what all the fuss is about. I'm Quite Young, And before i watched it my Mum warned me that It would be too "scary" for me and that she was frightened watching it. I was Totally Surprised, It wasn't Scary At All. It Takes A Lot to scare me, But my 9-year old brother was rolling around the floor Laughing. How can ANYONE call this Film " The Scariest Film Ever Made " ? I just Don't Understand it. The Acting Wasn't Much Special, And the Storyline was Rather Simple. A Good Horror Film Needs Suspense, Excitement And a Chill running through your spine. I'd Give this film a 1/10 Because It was COMPLETE and UTTER RUBBISH. At The Start, It was Very boring, I Couldn't Help But Fall Asleep. During the Supposedly Scarier Parts I Was in a Fit of Laughter. Honestly. If you want a REAL fright, Watch The Grudge, Creep Or My Favourite horror movie ever ; The Shining. To Put All Of That Very Briefly, All I Can Say Is.. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist (1973) Review: Once again, this movie topped the most scary movies list. How? Do people who get the survey get paid to say that? This is possibly one of the most unintentionally funniest movies ever. How on earth did this get voted best horror movie ever? This movie had me on the floor laughing so hard I was in convulsions! Seriously, what is the big deal? Do people follow the leader and say this is pure horror in order to keep their popularity, or do they really think this is scary? I am aiming to the former. This is actually funnier than "Repossesed", a movie with Linda Blair and Leslie Nielsen that was labeled a comedy.The Last Word: Stop it. 100 years from now, our descendants will look in the history books and see that in 2007 that this was the top horror film. They will then say, "Wow, our ancestors were such babies." Well, I didn't even flinch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I too waited 30 years to see this film. I remember there being lots of talk about it when it came out even though I was quite young. A mythology has build up around it over the years and I was expecting to jump at least once during the film.Not remotely scary.Not remotely interesting.No real storyline or characterisation. I really believe that the time I spent watching this over-hyped rubbish was wasted, probably more so than having watched "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" and that was pretty bad too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Un-scary, rather silly, not a bad film alltogether and doesn't grasp the likness people say!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will write a short review for this film as that is the scariness and greatness it provides, the exocist is not scary and it is titled the scariest not the best horror of all time. as some people were disopointe people this is meant to be the scariest not best! Now you have that in your head, the script and diologue is weak and pathetic! But the movie about a posessed girl turning demon is quite a good movie but the best horror ever is halloween as we know "halloween is best horror exorcist is scariest"! simple!overall the movie from me gets 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not scary at all. GROSS? yes, but not scary. No suspense. At times this movie is just boring. I was very disappointed. I don't understand why this movie gets talked about by critics as being a classic. =(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a typical pile of trash that is used to become the "scariest movie of all time" If anyone watches this movie they could say "ooooh, I've seen The Exorcist, I'm so big." Before they realise they have become paranoid and get put in a mental hospital. The director is insane, the actors and actresses are insane, the writers are also insane. If they really want people captured in this eternal prison of evil. All I have to say now is "may God have mercy on the soul of anyone who rents, buys of steals this movie,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i rated a lot of movies (not on this website) but in general, and i've been fair on almost all of them, in fact i have found things good in some of the so called "worse movies ever". now with The Exorcist I found really now redeeming plot and in fact it's one the very few movies i have rated as low as a 1. it was horrible boring and i think i got scared a total of once (not from the content in the film but just a startled moment, like if someone comes out to your and goes BOO when you don't expect it.) all in all i would definitely pass on this movie. if boring movies and plot holes are your things then by all means. i gave it a 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly boring and awful "classic."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I set out to watch this movie since many rate is as the scariest of all time. Boy, was I ever disappointed. My wife is scared of *everything*, but we watched this snoozefest in a dark bedroom, and she barely blinked (except during the spider-walk scene). I was so bored after 30 minutes that I wanted to turn the thing off, but no, I had to keep going to see if it got better. I want those two hours of my life back! 1970s scary does not equal 2002 scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie SUCKED</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was horrible to me. It made me so frightened. If you watch it you will be frightened too so you should probably not see it. I don't like it when something frightens me and this movie did that to me. That is something I can't forgive at all.Even from the moment the film starts where a man is in some sand looking for some stuff he lost, there are big statues and scary music. Then he goes to America and it gets even scarier. There another man who is a priest and he has to investigate the mysterious exorcist of a little girl. This girl has a face that turns green and a voice like a box of smokers, and because she has an exorcist inside her it turns out she does horrible things to herself that make her mom angry. Those things are just horrible in ways you can't even imagine.Even the music in this film is scary. There is lots of shouting and I just felt so sorry for that poor little girl. This film made me so miserable and frightened. Just thinking about it now and making a comment on it has made me scared all over again. I don't ever want to see it again.</fullReview>
