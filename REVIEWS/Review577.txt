		<shortDescription>Hardcore horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most horrifying movie I've seen (gave it 10, though). I had the sensation that I was witnessing somebody die - and like Selma in the movie, I just begged for another musical-show to begin... I couldn't stand it. Everything is so tormenting and you just need that last (but not last!?) dance... Bjork is stunning as Selma, and the music she has composed blew me away. Even though this is perhaps the movie that has left the strongest impression with me ever, I don't know when I will be able watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie To Break Your Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It feels awkward to attempt to put Dancer in the Dark into words. Von Trier's film is one of those movies that truly change the way we think about cinema and its possibilities, and for such a film, words do no justice. Dancer in the Dark centers around Selma (Björk), a factory worker, who loves her 10-year-old son above everything else in the world. Selma is a happy, innocent creature who enjoys musicals for "nothing bad ever happens in them". These elements (mother's love for her son, joyfulness of musicals versus the hardships of every day life) create a whole unlike anything ever seen on silver screen. Selma is rapidly losing her eye sight, but not her vision: she's the 'dancer in the dark' who is prepared to sacrifice herself to keep the light in her child's eyes. Very early on it becomes obvious that this story can't have a happy ending. However, once you've accepted it, you can put your mind at ease and see the film as it unfolds from Selma's point of view. And what a view it is! Björk gives a performance of a life time - this little woman with a huge voice is all emotion all the time without ever appearing overtly dramatic or cheaply sentimental. There's no weak link in the rest of the cast either, Peter Stormare as Jeff, Catherine Deneuve as Kathy and Siobhan Fallon as the prison guard to name but a few. The biggest star is still the director himself; von Trier demonstrates his talent in a superb fashion by both telling a simple story that will most likely break you heart and examining the ever-persistent ills of the life of the lower class of the American society. What about the film's musical character then? This is where von Trier triumphs the most by understanding the very essence of the whole genre - hope; hope that will live in our soul for ever if we'll only follow our heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd, bleak, but ultimately transfixing musical drama, pop singer Björk immerses herself completely in this tailor-made role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviews were extremely black and white for this art-house film. People were either enthralled or bored to tears by the whole experience. There seemed to be no middle ground. Now, that's my kind of movie. Any picture that can reap awards (Cannes Film Festival) and get lambasted by the general public at the same time will always pique my interest. In respect, it was a rich, rewarding odyssey, much easier to get through than, let's say, even half of "8?." My initial respect for the unique, uncompromising style of Danish director Lars von Trier goes back to his compelling work in "Zentropa" and "Breaking the Waves," both bleak, surrealistic studies of man vs. reality. His pieces usually center around some innocent, simple-minded, self-sacrificing soul who inevitably succumbs to the cruelties of life.I found the central role of Selma (as played by the extraordinary Björk) to be very much the emotional equivalent of Emily Watson's touchingly childlike, near-sociopath Bess in "Breaking the Waves" -- blessed and cursed with a naive, soulful purity. Selma represents one of God's little quirks of nature. A bespectacled, pathetically infantile little ragamuffin completely out of touch, Selma has somehow survived like the runt of a litter would - through luck, will power, and the extreme kindness of those around her. An impoverished Czech-born emigré living in a small Northwestern U.S. industrial town during the mid-60s, this luckless creature manages to eek out a meager Airstream-like existence as a factory worker, despite the fact she is legally blind.Selma is, amazingly enough, a mother. Seemingly ill-equipped to care for a child much less herself, she has nevertheless managed to provide for the 12-year-old boy, while nurturing the child as a young girl would her rag doll. The fairly adjusted boy suffers, however, from the same optic disease as the mother, while the crux of the story revolves around her attempts to save up money for his inevitable operation. The fascination of "Dancer in the Dark" lies in Selma's musical world. With her eyesight failing, her ears become the only sense of joy, falling periodically into bouts of fantasy anytime she grabs onto a rhythm or beat (like machine sounds, train engines, etc.), wherein she becomes the star of her own working-class musical production. These compelling sequences become mere extensions of her real-life circumstances, i.e., the musical interludes at work will include the factory itself as a set piece and the other workers as her ensemble. A strange mix of Fellini neo-realism and Busby Berkeley illusion, these daydreams (sparked by Vincent Paterson's inventive choreography and von Trier's purposely puerile lyrics) become her only escape. Björk's odd musical talent and vocal style may be an acquired taste, but she is so mesmerizing here it becomes a non-issue. In addition, there are brief moments of levity as a hopelessly inept community theater production of "The Sound of Music" goes into rehearsals with the very awkward Selma playing Maria.The subordinate cast is equally in tune. The wonderful, beguiling French star Catherine Deneuve downplays her ethereal beauty as Kathy, Selma's co-worker and trusted friend. And a strange, maternalistic friendship it is indeed, for this woman seems to have no other purpose in life than to be this girl's eyes and hands, looking out for her practically day and night. Peter ("Fargo") Stormare shies away from his ruthless killer image with this touching portrayal of a sensitive, almost pitiable boor who only has eyes for the ungainly Selma. David Morse is gripping as a seemingly compassionate but despairing policeman whose one desperate act involving neighbor Selma results in tragedy. Joel Grey has a brief, telling moment near the film's end as a faded musical star idolized by Selma.As in his other featured works, von Trier's gritty, hand-held camera work may be dizzying to the point of distraction at first but its overall impact to the stark proceedings is unquestionable. Moreover, the grueling paces he puts his actresses through to achieve absolute truth borders on misogyny but the rewards are tenfold. As in the case of Emily Watson, Björk has never shined brighter as an artist.A harrowing, refreshingly original piece of filmmaking that should be experienced by anybody who dares to be different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film so perfect it hurts to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite possibly the most moving film I've seen, it ensnares you within the first minute, or Bjork does with her interpretation of the sound of music, which is both hilarious and introduces one of the main themes: the magic of musicals. Not one of my favourite genres (but everyone loves The Sound Of Music, right?) but Lars Von Trier makes you re-evaluate your perception with a gentle loving pastiche of the way for no reason people and things in musicals spontaneously erupt into song, made more credible in this film by implicating a reason for it: Bjork's character is going blind so she hears music in the slightest thing and she, in her mind, sees how moves should be choreographed with the music she hears, reminiscent of her own ?It's Oh So Quiet' music video. And the best thing about this film is the way Bjork charms you with her portrayal of the nicest person in the world, she will do anything for you if she could. She is essentially an innocent and though this is her weakness you can't help but love her all the more: a sparkling performance from a unique singer in real life.However from this don't assume that this is a light happy film as there is a dark tragic side also, and this side is full of injustice, agony- and I mean agony-, sorrow- like you'd not believe-, and an intense emotional pull as I've ever felt in a cinema before, and it's this half that propels it from being just a great film to becoming one of the greatest. Its greatness is in telling a simple story of a woman trying to stop her own genetic sight disorder afflicting her son, by working every hour to afford the operation, working heavy machinery despite essentially being virtually blind, its greatness is its ability to inflict upon you the gift of feeling every conceivable emotion you posses and you do, you really do experience so much during this film. But I'll not say too much as my enjoyment of this film increased due to, for a change, not second guessing what would happen but to just let it be, I would say to passively watch but there's nothing passive about this film. It really moves you. It makes you feel alive.This film should be seen alone, in the quiet when you are all by yourself, but more importantly than that it should be seen: this is more than mere movie this is art this is real this is the greatest film I have ever seen: even better than Casablanca, and Shadowlands, and The Piano.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Cinematic Unemotional Streak- Broken!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was not familiar with the director's previous work, but had picked up the soundtrack by Bjork and was intrigued.Selma (incredibly portrayed by Bjork) makes the audience laugh and weep simutaneously just by following her heart. Every character is played flawlessly, and the cinemetography is innovative and dynamic. The musical numbers jump to life in a 'colorized' style, emphasizing the break from the dismal reality of Selma's painfully decaying life.I will say only this. I hate crying at movies. Yet, as I was driving home, mad at the fact that I was still sobbing uncontrollably, I realized how much I loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Musical" like no other before it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Kelly's musicals may never have tempted a tear, but this film sure did. This is the most creative and powerful film I've seen this year. I just got back so it will take a while to absorb where it fits in the hierarchy of great movies, but it is one of the few 10's I have ever given on IMDB. I went in knowing nothing other then that Bjork was the lead and that it was a Cannes favorite, I and was rewarded greatly. I am not closed minded, but I thought I would never again find a musical that so wrapped you up in the emotional core of the piece, such as the musicals that I enjoyed in my youth. Its style is experimental enough that I would be surprised if it got a Best Film Oscar nod, but never would I be surprised for any honors bestowed on Bjork, who torturingly WAS Selma for those two painful hours. She is a goddess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary, quietly exploding film - a fantasy and musical, it emanates with human spirits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is distinguishably different from the general Hollywood films or independent projects. It's not like anything done before. LARS VON TRIER, and BJORK, simply blow your mind away: such totality in delivery!It's gut wrenching - an absorbing tearjerker - but not sentimental. It is in strong doses. (NFE: it may not be for everyone.) The theatre audience was very quiet with occasional sniffing heard. The film may be a fantasy, yet there are subtle jabs at certain social norms and contains hints at how we treat life and lead life.Bjork made it natural, innocent, and naively good. It is all Bjork matter: she is feeling all the joy and pain and daydreaming, saying all those words, singing all those songs, and dancing along to the music she so ingeniously composed. Lars von Trier once again wrote and delivered a 100% powerful film. He packs all kinds of emotions into 2 hrs. and 20 mins.: from the endearing friendship of two working women Kathy and Selma; to the faithful loving pursuit of Jeff for Selma; to the quiet exchanges of seemingly trusting souls of Bill and Selma; to Selma's son, Bill's wife, the crime, the court, the prison's loneliness within; the anguish pain of a determined mother; and the integrated mood changing musical numbers in-between. One scene of Bjork lying motionless with just one finger moving with quiet sobbing heard is powerful imagery.Catherine Deneuve as Kathy is well at ease in her supporting role. She continues to exude her charm quietly. You can tell she thoroughly enjoys the company she's in at this production. Musical-wise, Deneuve is no stranger: besides "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" 1964 - every word in the film was sung, I also remember Jacques Demy's "The Young Girls of Rochefort" 1967 - she danced and sang with her sister Francoise Dorleac, along with Gene Kelly, Michel Piccoli and George Chakiris.David Morse as Bill (the policeman and neighbor) reminds me of what a memorable performance he delivered in Sean Penn's "The Crossing Guard" 1995 opposite Jack Nicholson and Robin Wright. 'tis great to see Joel Grey dancing again (hm, in the most improbable setting!)For a 5' 4'' singer-songwriter from Iceland, Bjork is a giant impact in this quiet powerhouse of a film, "Dancer In the Dark." Lars von Trier's vision and confidence in Bjork truly paid off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bjork gives performance deserving of Oscar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was driving to see this movie, I wondered how I was going to react to the film. Lars Von Trier had always been one of my favorite directors, but I was unsure if I was going to enjoy this film. After watching the film, I half to say that this was one of the best films I had ever seen. Lars von Trier used handheld cinematography perfectly and I was especially impressed by how he operated the camera himself. Also the way he used lighting and still cameras in the music sequences expressed the surreal daydreams of Selma.Selma, played by Bjork, is a strong willed yet kind character who is hit by a series of bad events. Bjork plays this role so convincingly it is almost uncomfortable to watch. She doesnt act more than emote the character.With Lars Von Trier directing and great acting, this is far and away the best film of the year. Its unfortunate that America didn't give the recognition the film deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark haunted me. This film was an amazing view into the human mind as well as a tragic story of hopeless hope, betrayal by others, and still remaining true to yourself. Bjork produces an inspirational performance, of which one would never think she is not primarily an actress. Some of her moments in this film bring you to tears with their absolute honesty. The ensemble cast are a godsend as well. Peter Stormare, Catherine Denevue, and David Morse in particular. Morse, playing the most varied and difficult character, succeeds with apparent ease. The only complaint I had of the film is that it was slightly drawn out and slow paced. However, it is still spiked with moments of surprise that knock you so hard, you are pulled back in immediately. With an incredible closeness to these people, Dancer in the Dark will make you think and stretch your emotions to the limit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Lars Von Trier's earlier works, as well as Bjork's music videos, I was quite excited to see a collaboration between the two. I tried not to expect much, however, as many reviews of the film were quite poor. I couldn't have been more delighted by the film. Bjork's acting ability was superb (it is a shame she will not be acting in the future), and Lars Von Trier's writing and direction proved to be intense and incredible. While he played with different themes in the genres of the Musical, the Neo-Realist film, and the Melodrama, he created a meta film, investigating human nature as well as the nature of film (or digital video) itself. An incredibly emotional film, it also proved to be poignantly intellectual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standing up for those that HATE this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone is entitled to their opinion. But with a movie like DANCER IN THE DARK, it's very easy to get the sense that those who didn't like it are simple-minded sour-pusses with artistic tunnel vision.Plus, most people who hated it don't take the time to write a comment. Why waste another second of your life on this dreck?I'd like to congratulate everyone who has the guts to trash this film. It is not entertaining. It is founded on characters who make ridiculous decisions to facilitate melodramatic story points. It plays to the weaknesses of every one of its participants.Some of the comments can be paraphrased like this: "I like a film that causes such intense reactions, good and bad." If a film isn't good, why in the world would we indulge the amateur auteurs who created it? This means Lars Von Trier will be encouraged to make MORE horrible films!Being forced to watch Bjork act is like being forced to listen to Anna Nicole Smith play the saxaphone. Why can't we let people who were trained to act do their job? Bjork vacillates between a caricature of her weird childish stage persona and a poster-child for OverActing 101 (especially the prison scenes).Selma, as a character, is by turns stubborn, stupid, unreasonable and selfish. Not a very good candidate for a martyr. David Morse's Bill, the antagonist, goes from benevolent protector to psychopath on the thinnest of motivations. Peter Stormare practically drools to show how stupid he is when he is wooing Bjork. It's a condescending repulsive love story.Part of me wants to not submit this comment, because in the end, the film isn't worth this much thought. But if everyone thought this way, the comments would be overwhelmingly positive. And I can't believe that that is representative of the audience reaction to this film.Unless you have a high tolerance for arthouse highbrow crap, don't see this movie. It's a waste of your time.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insulting melodrama threaded out by the stupidity of main character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, a 7.8 on IMDb? My wife and I got roped into this from a fairly interesting summary: A woman losing her sight turns her reality into musical numbers as her life spins out of control. Little did we know that every single awful thing that happens to her is because of her own stupidity.Actually, I can't blame the character - I think she was losing her mind along with her sight (it's the only explanation for her moronic behavior) - but I sure as heck blame the director. NO ONE acts like this Bjork character. Covering up for the guy who stole your kids eye surgery money because he made you promise not to tell anyone about his money problems? Even when you are on trial for his murder? Even when he begged you to kill him because he's a scum who steals from a blind woman? PREPOSTEROUS. I would've made the leap of illogic if she would've sprouting wings and flew into the air. But this? Come on! This has to be one of the most insulting movies to the intelligence of film audiences everywhere. All that was lacking from the forced emotional suffering of this character was having her dog get run over by a car because she forgot to put on the hand-brake or something. There was no dog but I really don't know why the director didn't throw that cheap-shot in as well. Something to do with Animal Cruelty laws in Europe or something? It's the only explanation.Blech, I just had to vent something about this awful film but I refuse to go deeper. I think a quick scan of some other comments will provide you with a body of evidence to avoid this one. The one star reviews are the only legitimate entertainment you'll get out of this disaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of the comments here are full of exaggerated praise for this film. And most of those comments are coming from people who are fans of the singer Bjork. But if, like me, you think Bjork is completely weird and her music is awful, then read the rest of this review, because this will be your fair warning about the film "Dancer in the Dark"."Dancer in the Dark" is from Danish director Lars von Trier and may be the most unwatchable film of the past few years. It stars Bjork in an over-praised performance, because she really doesn't have a screen presence at all and is overshadowed by any one of her co-stars (i.e. people who actually can act) in any scenes in which they are together. Bjork plays a character who may be the most pathetic character in film history and who's foolishness leads to her fate in a depressing plot, which is both ludicrous and manipulative as it leads to an unrealistic outcome that only a sadistic screenwriter and director could force-feed to an audience. As for filmmaking, the movie is shot in a shaky-camera style reminiscent of bad home movies and absolutely guaranteed to promote nausea. This shaky-camera look that dominates the movie, though, is occasionally broken up by colorful fantasy musical numbers, which have two major flaws: (1) they are not staged very well, and (2) they contain Bjork's music (which, as I said earlier, is pretty awful).Some claim this movie broke new ground. If having a completely pathetic lead character, bad musical numbers, a ridiculously contrived and depressing plot, nausea-inducing camera work, and lacking any entertainment value whatsoever is new ground, then yes, this movie does break new ground. It's also completely unwatchable, but there are a lot of unwatchable movies, so it wasn't breaking any new ground in that regard.** You have been WARNED. Now watch, if you must, at your own risk **</fullReview>

This movie has everything what it needs: excellent cast &amp; director, superb script and probably It has the best soundtrack ever. I can't really say if it has what is need in a movie for being nominated to the Academy Awards, but I know that, surely, It might have reached some!!! But the prizes aren't always what counts most, But the message that the whole is for the viewer... I just know that, after all, this superb story caused a multitude of feelings within me: pain, crying, joy, despair, afraid and shame. Is unbelievable, isn't it?!

		<fullReview>Sophomoric profundities. And what are they?--Dogma about verity and the omniscience of the camera. Done much better with 'The Limey,' in terms of the faceted eye. And mined as a subject itself in "Snake Eyes."--Self-reference about people in the film imagining that they are in a film. Done so much better in dozens of films -- the ones that come immediately to mind are the ambitiously conceived 'Nurse Betty,' the truly cinematic 'Sex, Lies and Videotape,' even the glossy-arty 'American Beauty.'--The tragic grind of fate. Done better (plus self-reference to film studies) in the recent 'Hamlet,' the one with Hawke and Stiles.The songs did not work for me, did not transport. And that's strange since this is supposed to be deeply welling from the visual.But it is not very visual. Think how much better the effect of 'Drowning by Numbers' was.Bjork DID work for me. The strongest criticism I have heard of her performance was they she was fey. Yes, and damning too, but that's all right with me in this case because she is risking her soul. And that is something one can't avoid watching. What is truly interesting is the self-referential nature of her performance. She (Bjork) is only effective because she imagines herself to be in a movie.A final comment, which I am surprised to not have seen before. It may be difficult for a Scandinavian to appreciate, but one cannot do a piece about tragedy in the US, a piece about sweatshop factory labor in the 50's, a piece about the penal system, without including blacks. There are essentially none here, minus one (two?) of the Danish dancers. (The friend was supposed to be black, and I suppose we are better off without a completely artificial character.)The DVD documentary on the choreographing is much more 'dogma' than the film itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It must be the climate or something. Why is it Scandinavians have such a penchant for making the most depressing films in the most tedious manner? I'm a very tolerant movie watcher, American or foreign. A film has to go out of its way to get me not to at least accept it. So naturally, I got sucked in by all the wonderful reviews this has received. I watched two "downer" movies this weekend -- "Dancer" and "Requiem for a Dream," so it's not depression I'm put off by. But at least "Requiem" was somewhat interesting. "Dancer" was a pretentious crashing bore, and the choreography was downright stupid. The shaky "nervous" camera technique is nothing new. It was one of the reasons I could never stand to watch NYPD Blue. My wife, smarter than I, left the room halfway through. I let von Trier drag me at a slow crawl to the bitter end -- an end I was anticipating with relish before it arrived -- and not just the end of the movie, but the very specific end of Selma, the most satisfying scene in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am shocked that this film has been so highly praised. Over and above the filmmaking style (which seems to be deliberately `in your face' and begging to draw attention to itself), this film asks the audience to accept, over and over again, situations and actions that are just not believable. It is a great tribute to the actors (including non-actor Bjork) who deliver wonderful performances, that they can act in situations that are so totally false on every level. Without going into the many, many falsehoods on which this film builds its narrative, I will mention just one. The core of the plot is a medical condition which is inherited and can be treated by an operation(?) that needs to be performed within a particular 2-week period of a person's life. Is there anything even remotely like this in medicine? But worse are the numerous actions of the characters that just defy any honest human behavior. It is a greater tragedy that this film so manipulates the audience with such fine performances. Filmmaking like this should be a crime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved Bjork's performance in this movie. I didn't get all of the song sequences, however, (some were just completely bizarre) but I understand that this doesn't make the musical part of the movie bad just because some of us don't relate to it. I loved the character they developed and really got into her troubles. I found myself drawn to her strength and admired that. I really liked the "I've Seen it All" song on the train too. This movie shows that Bjork is a one of a kind and creative genius.One thing about the movie that bothered me was the constant camera motion. I am sure the director did this purposefully in order to achieve a more intimate look into the lives of the characters. It almost seemed like a hand-held camera filmed the movie. The only problem is that I just about regurgitated from the constant motion. It is nauseating after awhile. Almost unbearable.(I reveal some of the movie here. Stop reading if you are afraid to have important details know to you).My conflict here is that I really fell for the character and love the movie, but at the same time I think the plot line is just borderline stupid. It is just COMPLETELY unbelievable. Bjork's character is going blind and her son has the same disease. She saves money for an operation and things are going great. Then the director introduces the tragedy and suddenly she is on death row awaiting execution. And why? Why? Because she must keep a man's secret. And this isn't a secret of monumental importance either. The secret is that his inheritance ran out. God forbid we let this terrible truth get out. It could mean the end of us all! Then she refuses to let her friend tell her son about his eye disease because he may worry and if he worries, then he can go blind and then he can't get an operation. HELLO HONEY! WAKE UP BABY! His mother is on DEATH ROW and refuses to speak to him! This kids days of worrying have only begun. The problems with this go on and on and on.The only way this whole thing makes any sense is if this is really a story about a simple, vulnerable, blind woman with a love of music who has a serious mental illness. She can't tell the fantasy world from reality and is almost insane from this skewed view of life. In the real world, however, this would be the very thing that would have saved her.Also the fact that she was convicted of overpowering a 6'4" police officer with his own gun and bludgeoned him to death while being completely blind is insane. I could go on for hours with the ridiculousness of this movie. It almost looks like the writer created the first half of one story, then second half of another and just cramped them together. It simply doesn't work.I think that the writer and director were so desperate to create a tragedy that they lost touch with reality and forgot to make the story BELIEVABLE. Check the movie out. In spite of the fact that it is inane and stupid, it is also a really interesting and beautiful story.</fullReview>

It makes me sad that some people walked out of the cinema theater at the beginning of the movie, thinking they paid money to see this movie and it makes me happy that the bags of popcorn remain untouched until after the end of the movie and the final credits. ...and it makes me happy that people shed a tear, impressed by the story of lars von trier's movie and the by one of the greatest performance in history...bjork's performance</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER!!! As if this movie needed help. Stinkeroo, as they used to say in the good old days.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD This movie is so unremittingly "TRAJ-EEK" it is funny. My friend and I went for coffee afterwards and wound up laughing so hard while dissecting it that we were crying! I'm afraid we made a bit of a scene, but hopefully the other coffee drinkers got the message to stay away from this one. One wonders why the filmmakers did not just send Selma (Bjork) straight to hell -- do not pass Go, do not collect $200. Apparently that is the only terrible fate she managed to escape in her short, unkempt, unbelievably harsh and unbearable life. What really kills this movie -- I refuse to call it a flim -- is that nothing about it makes any sense. A near-blind, delusional young mother would rather let her and her 10-year-old son, a true innocent, suffer unnecessarily in silence than stoop to asking for and accept help from well-meaning co-workers. She quickly goes blind from this hereditary disease that also affects her young son and because the United States offers a better life and medical care (except the neurotic director -- and I am being kind -- wouldn't take a plane to the USA for authentic locales so the movie was shot in Sweden, which throws the whole thing off kilter from the get-go. You keep thinking, what the hell? You don't even see a filling station, TV antenna, McDonalds -- nothing that would make it recognizably America -- and this is the early 1960s. A major distraction.) Selma and son wind up isolated in Sweden-America in the bleakest of circumstances. She works in a factory that looks like it is located behind the old Iron Curtain. She apparently thinks she is being noble by not accepting any help from anybody, including a perfectly nice man who is in love with her!!!! -- she refused a ride home from him and is almost run over by a truck. She'd rather stumble along the railroad tracks to find her way home than accept this small favor. For psychic relief, she fantasizes about Hollywood musicals (only her fantasies are as bleak as her real life, so how can they offer any escape?), deprives herself and her son of any amenities (she doesn't want the son to know he is destined to go blind) and pretends to send money home to her father while socking it away for her son's eye operation only to have it stolen, clumsily (and most artifically) kills the friend who stole the money, goes on trial, is convicted and hanged because she thinks it is nobler to be hanged than betray the friend who stole her money. Oh, how noble can you get. And she won't see the son in jail, because she's too noble Bjork does a fantastic acting job. It's just too bad she couldn't comb her hair at least once. I can comb my hair with my eyes shut, for goodness sake. That's it, folks. If this is what you want in a flick, they be my guest. At least you might get a good laugh out of it afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, I believe that Von Trier scores purely on originality alone. The hand-held technique, the mix of Bjork's music with the rhythm of machines in a factory, etc. The whole thing falls apart at the two main turning points in the story: the murder of the cop, a complete manipulation that Bjork just couldn't explain her way out of . This strikes me as fake. The other being the courtroom scene leading to Bjork's sentencing. The prosecuting attorney acts like a completely soulless jerk out to ruin someone's life with accusations and the entire American judicial system is made to look like it's out to crush people with "alternative" views (communist) and outsiders. This all leads to the depressing and deceptive conclusion. I love Lars Von Trier but was sorely disappointed with the simplistic attack on the U.S. without the comment on the cruelty of human nature as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Melancholia and Antichrist, and after reading lots of stuff about Lars von Trier and his movies, I thought I understood what kind of director he is. When I started watching his filmography, I was expecting everything, really, because I know people who've seen a lot of his movies and they were always telling me that his films are good, but extremely tough to watch. Especially Dancer in the Dark, a friend of mine said. So when I started watching it, I found out I was unprepared.Dancer in the Dark is a movie about Selma Jezkova (Björk), a factory worker from the '60s, who is slowly going blind. She has a genetic disease that she knows her 12-year old son will inherit, therefore she is saving up money so he can get an operation when he turns 13. She's extremely poor, she lives in a trailer she's renting from the town's policeman, Bill Houston (David Morse), who lives with his wife near Selma's trailer, and who is helping her with the money. Her only friends, Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) and Jeff (Peter Stormare) help her as well in her everyday-life routine. Everything starts to go downhill when the policeman doesn't have any more money to give her and, taking advantage of the fact that she's going completely blind, steals all the money that she saved up for her son's operation. That's when Selma starts to 'dance in the dark', both literally and metaphorically.Dancer in the Dark is the third film in the so-called "Golden Heart trilogy" by Lars von Trier. I don't really know why the trilogy's called like that, but I can assume it's because the main character is a pure-hearted person, whose life gets destroyed by the people that surround him (in this case ? her) and by the situations he finds himself in. At least, that's Selma's story. I think von Trier's goal here was to rip your heart out of your chest, squeeze it and make it explode. He took something so pure, innocent and beautiful as Selma, and made her suffer as much as he could. And all that you can do, as a viewer, is just watch the main character perish. I suffered along with the character, and it was really difficult to watch. I usually spontaneously empathise with the character, I try to experience what they're experiencing ? and that surely didn't help. At the end of the movie, I was a train wreck, crying my eyes out. But maybe, the movie's problem is just in this.The movie wasn't particularly well-received, especially by the critics, and I see why people don't like it. It's not a pleasant movie to watch; everything in it makes you feel uncomfortable, and especially mainstream audiences feel uncomfortable, since the movie is so unconventional. It's filmed by following almost all of the Dogme 95 rules: it uses hand-held digital cameras to create a documentary-style look, with no background music. I didn't mind those characteristics, I actually loved them. What I think we all really agree on is that the real eye-candy of the movie is Björk. Her performance was outworldly, something unique in the history of cinema. Many said that Björk was so convincing that she became the character herself ? and I agree with them. That wasn't acting, as her co-star Catherine Deneuve said: that was feeling. And what's even better ? Björk was able to use her main talent, music, in the movie as well: Selma is a great musical fan, and she would often daydream, creating musical numbers in her head. In the movie, we would see what Selma imagined. The colors would brighten (this time using static cameras to film), Selma would be singing along with whoever surrounded her, and everything would be cheerful. The result of the combination of Björk's phenomenal voice and incredible acting performance was astonishing.But, as I was saying before, maybe the problem with the movie is that von Trier was using this 'destroying something beautiful' to get to the viewers. One could call it 'cheap storytelling', but isn't that the most effective way to get to someone's heart and then break it? Yes, it actually is. So, no, von Trier's masterplan here wasn't genius ? he's just doing what he does best. But I don't really care. I don't think it's actually that easy to make someone feel such strong emotions. You've got to choose the right story, with the right characters (main and supporting), the right twists, the right directing, the right screenplay, the right tone and the right actors. Choosing Björk as the main character was a risk, since that was her first acting job. But her sweet, innocent appearance had an even greater effect on the whole movie experience, because it enhanced the beauty that was getting destroyed. I'm certain that the movie wouldn't have been this good without Björk's acting and music.So, personally, I loved the movie. I'm all for the emotions, and this one struck me good. But I loved everything about it: its uniqueness in the way it's filmed and directed, the dark but sometimes cheerful tone, the characters and the actors, etc. The above mentioned problem that many had with the movie wasn't a problem for me at all. Maybe it was too raw and harsh, but Lars von Trier really got everything right, in my eyes. Some may call it tedious and overly-melodramatic, but I think it was all done on purpose. The initial slow pace created the right situations and the right tone, and the twists that happened later in the movie felt earned and right-timed. It all felt very real as well. When the final credits started running, and my tears started flowing like crazy, my first thought was "F**k you, Lars". But then, it turned into a "thank you", because, as a critic said, ultimately, it's a tribute to the power of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film student's perspective on Dancer in the Dark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancing within Trembling Imagery."What is there to see?" In this sentence, Selma, the protagonist of Dancer in the Dark, a movie by Lars Von Trier, almost attacks and aims to destroy the main core of Cinema itself. Ironically, what makes this movie so intense, breathtaking, and monumental is Von Trier's exquisite use of cinematography, color selection, and highly saturated DV cameras. Moreover, as an artistic whole, this movie is outstanding in its coherence, intensity of effect, and originality. Utterly, if viewed by a critical audience, this movie also achieves in depicting very complex symptomatic meanings.It is very particular the fact that Von Tried decided to depict Selma's "musicals/reveries/ breaks from reality" sequences utilizing highly saturated DV cameras. This aesthetic element produces a sense of confusion for the viewer whom, since the beginning of the movie, had been visually accustomed to the "unsteady" LOW-FI hand held DV camera perspective. Furthermore, the use of this perspective sets the audience right in the middle of the scene and, consequentially, the viewer feels fully accomplice to the exposition of the plot and story. For example, the first scene is set in a small theater and the camera is shooting Selma through the eyes of the spectators, of the producers of the play, and of the actors of the play themselves. Nether less, the audience feels, senses, and participates to the exposition of the plot objectively and intensively because there is no external music overlapping the action ? the viewer is thus not guided by any external mood-setter but rather engaged in and challenged with the scrutiny of the acting itself. This factor alone could constitute why this movie is so attention grabbing, stimulating, and viewer worthy. Furthermore, the camera often captures the reaction of certain characters in response to a specific situation rather than the subject itself. In the court scene, for example, when the judge verdicts Selma to death, the camera immediately zooms and focuses on Kathy's shock and then slowly scrolls towards other characters. This use of cinematography leads the audience in understanding the relationship between Kathy and Selma and how that relationship is in contrast with that one between Selma and the other characters. Without a doubt, this technique stresses in analyzing tension and psychological evaluation of the characters rather than the action itself. Dancer in the Dark, indeed, not only (somehow) follows the Hollywood three-act structure but is also a beautiful example of European character driven film ? where the examination of a characters' existential circumstance is much more important than the development of the story itself or, at least, where the action or development in the story is marginal and has the only purpose to consolidate a socio- political or philosophical symptomatic meaning. Moreover, in Dancer in the Dark the audience not only feels sympathy (in the literal Greek etymological meaning) for Selma and for the complexity of her relationship with Kathy and Jeff but also for Kathy and Jeff themselves because they are all intricate characters who contribute as a whole in describing detail fully the situation and thus help the audience in discovering and in unfolding the main themes. For instance, throughout the movie Jeff is depicted as a simple and static character. However, Jeff was the function of the two most intense and memorable scenes: the train scene and the phone conversation in jail. During the phone conversation in jail, Jeff becomes a complex and dynamic (or rather utterly significant) character because he is the first one to put Selma in an immediate dreadful situation without having Selma escape in her dream world.During Selma's reveries the aesthetic presentation of the movie changes completely: All of a sudden, the audience is shattered in one hundred different angles of the shooting location and there beholds a mesmerizing and epileptic collage of brief shots which, for one second or less, photograph the movements, expressions, and voice of Selma in her dream- world. The use of ultra saturated colors, slow motion, and external music during the dream sequences, in contrast to the dry and cold exposition of the rest of the movie, is coherent within its context. As a matter of fact, when talking to the guard in jail, Selma declares: "...in musicals everything is so beautiful ?(and) nothing dreadful ever happens?" In this scene, Selma explains how her archetype of relish is embodied in the aesthetic of Hollywood musicals. Perhaps, more than a Hollywood Musical, the dream sequences resemble the way contemporary music videos are shot ? videos that are, in this specific cultural and historic circumstance, just as hectic and epileptic as Selma's reveries. Therefore, the audience does not undergo a sense of disruption throughout these scenes because Von Trier's aesthetic representation of such moments is expressed in a familiar language. Ultimately, this movie is about contrast of imagery: Selma's mesmerizing dreams are in contrast with the cold reality she faces, Selma carelessness for her status is in contrast with her struggles with giving Gene the operation from becoming blind himself, Selma's wonderful and "movie-like" conception of America (for her represented through the musicals) is in contrast with the way she is then treated by the American Jury and with Von Trier's portrayal of America as a materialistic, capitalistic, and anti communistic country.Fabio Brienza, a film student.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have enjoyed some of the director's other films, but was sorely disappointed by this manipulative, self-indulgent "musical" (the first song is about 45 minutes in). Being a musical, of course, everyone bangs on about how much they love musicals, but I digress.Frankly, I am sick of characters hiding their life savings in shoe boxes, and them having them stolen to drive the plot forward. Why didn't Bjork move to a country that would do the operation for free, and has proper benefits for disabled people? Why was the court case such a travesty, with no attempt at balance shown? Are friends and family really allowed to rush from their seats to give things to people at an execution? Misery upon misery is piled upon Bjork for no reason at all.Ridiculous.</fullReview>

'Cause you've seen it all before when you have seen Trier's latest films.He did it in "Breaking the Waves" and "Dogme 2 - the Idiots". Gave us a glimpse of somebody "good" or perhaps "pure". "Dancer" is also said to be the last (thank God!) film in the trilogy titled "Golden Heart".But does the Trierloved characters posesses golden hearts? No - they are merely being silly, not to say stupid. They are all quite anoying, especially Selma (Björk) here in "Dancer".von Trier wants us to see that she is driven by love to her son. But I think she is rather driven by nothing at all, being so foolish as she is.We have seen it again and again. And now yet again. This time I hope they will give him the golden palms. Perhaps he then get's new inspiration...Björk is alright, David Morse and Cara Seymour are better. I really do not know what Catherine Deneuve is doing in this film, and it looks as if she doesn't know herself either. The rest of the cast are Swedes, Germans and Danes. And the story takes part in USA...He is a marvelous director. But I hope he would be looking for new - really new - material.</fullReview>

(I'll skip the part about her role as Maria in the "Sound of Music" because it's just too ridiculous to go into.) She refuses a ride home and almost gets hit by a truck. She is warned not to daydream at her drudge of a factory job because she could ruin expensive machinery if she doesn't pay attention, so she daydreams and ruins the machine, thereby cutting off her only supply of money, which she was socking away to pay for an eye operation for her son, who will go blind if he doesn't get one before age 11 or so. Let's see, oh yeah, the friend she rents a trailer from (he's a cop!) spies on her to see where she hides the money and steals it because he can't bear to tell his wife to stop spending money because if he does she might leave him (what she spends the money on remains a mystery because they also live in a hovel.) But this supposedly makes him suicidal but can't kill himself so he begs our girl to when she comes after her hard-earned money. In a really contrived and artificial scene, she winds up shooting him and then bashing in his head for good measure --is arrested, convicted and hanged. As Porky used to say...that's all folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the defensive comments. I *love* Bjork. I *love* great filmmaking. I was hoping this movie would be a story wrapped around some "Oh So Quiet" type music/dance numbers.But I think this movie is horrible! I'm not even concerned with the style of filming, which isn't my cup of tea, but has it's moments. The plot was full of strange holes, and the characters were horrible.First off, I'm pretty sure Selma was only supposed to be going blind, not mentally impaired. I'm sure some of that is Bjork's acting style, but Selma came across as dumb more than anything else. Maybe there was something in the air in the town, because just about all the other "characters" (if you can call them that) seemed equally mentally impaired.(Spoiler Alert)Also, how in the world did Selma's friends end up with her money? The state doesn't just give these things back to you after a trial, even if people are telling them that you're just trying to help your son.And, the singing/dance parts did *nothing* for me!I can't believe how many positive reviews this movie got. I was all excited when I saw the DVD at the local video store this weekend, and was extremely let down by the first 45 minutes in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was told by a friend that this movie was unnecessarily depressing, and had an unrealistic story-line, and thus I started watching it with low expectations. Yet it turned out to be an incredible film. Bjork is an excellent actor - i was very surprised, actually. After a short while, you hardly notice her accent (which, admittedly is not the right one for a Czech person, though it doesn't really matter, i think), and are riveted by her performance, which is stunning, and so real that it sometimes makes you squirm. The story is not exactly unrealistic, as my friend thought it was. The dance scenes are surreal, but the story is gritty. All the characters are realistic and likeable, and mean well, but their desperate and sometimes foolish decisions conspire to create tragedy.The second half of the film is hard to watch, and is perhaps the most depressing thing i have ever watched on film - far more depressing than 'Requiem for a Dream'. Yet it was not 'unnecessarily depressing'. It was simply unflinching in its portrayal of events that have probably happened in real life, but which are much easier not to think about.This film is definitely worth watching. If you hate Bjork's music, you won't like the dance scenes, but you'll have to hand it to her for her acting.Just don't expect to feel cheery at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm one of the so far 3000+ people to give it a 10, why? Because of the misanthropic misers (500) who have given this film a 1/10. A score that should be retained for use against such evil creations as "Titanic" and the plethora of TV Movies smacking you upside the head with their blunt educational themes (if you're lucky). How, and I'm pointing fingers, a person could possibly detest this film to such an extent - to be filled with such revulsion - to grade it a 1 when all around the world a hundred thousand hours of TV is flooding through your little goggle boxes eating into your days and wasting your brains - hah, but you'll happily sit and watch that.To me this was as finely crafted piece of work as you could wish for. It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, there are no flashy soft tone film effects or colour responsive film to make it all look glitzy and flash - the camera work does its job. Maybe it could have been different, maybe the camera could have been held steadier. Perhaps it could have stayed in one position and filmed everything from one spot - but it doesn't and that's the Directors privelege. So to criticise his choice is fair enough. I don't much mind if you batter his reputation to death with your hatred for his work, just don't twist the elements of the film to suit your purposes.Realistic? I didn't realise it needed to be in order to explore emotions, nobility of thought and deed. Who are we to judge the desperation of a womans love for her child? To want her child to see the same musicals and love them as she did and continue to love them into old age without the fear of losing the ability to see their spectacle. Two deaths worth one persons eyesight.....that's called sacrifice, the Director could have let her live - nobody could have died and the boy have his eyesight saved "wahey!" now what? What would this film be worth? What would we learn or find in ourselves if it all turned out nice again? How many movies do you need to watch where the final credits scroll up over the image of a hugging mother and child before you'll let a single "miserable" ending pass before your eyes without instantly leaping out of your seat in outrage?Selma needs to be destroyed, she ultimately is there to be sacrificed and I think I would be right in saying that enough parents swear they would sacrifice themselves for their child - well, here's your chance. You have the opportunity to give your child a life beyond compare in a world of opportunity; it may well be a world in which Selma herself can never adjust for her expectation of America is a purely Musical based one (and as such the Director provides you with a 'reality' - those streets aren't pathed with gold and the USA isn't the only land of opportunity and was the death of many, many hopeful immigrants), with your opportunity in hand would you not take it? Are we really that shallow as to say "yeah I'd do anything for you, except that, oh and that, and that, and that, and that, oh and that - and lets not forget that too" when it's your progeny on the line? I'm sure your ancestors are very happy to know that the sacrifices they made are being looked upon from afar with sanitised rose tinted spectacles.Sometimes you have to fight for your principles, sometimes you have to die for them. Selma is a martyr, her songs are her hymns and the musicals are her religion and the stage her church - but in the real world she is isolated and her childlike 3rd innocence (how many tales do you need to read about the wonder of seeing the Statue of Liberty as the Immigrants sailed in?) is slowly compacted in by the reality, her only escape is her art. Her singing, her religion and her child. Her musicals are taken from her, she pines for them in the jail cell and she has already lost what little sight she had so the spectacle of them is gone also....all that is left for her is her child and affording him the best opportunity to have a full life.Maybe the film isn't perfect, but it isn't a 1.</fullReview>

This film made "Erasurehead" and "Brazil" seem as happy as "Golddiggers of 1936" or some cheesy 1930s musical. I am the kind of person who knows what depression is and I tend to listen to a lot of unhappy, bitter music, so it's not as if I only like films when they're happy... but for me this film was simply too DOWN, too gut-wrenching, and the final half hour or so (from the trial on onwards) was sheer mental torture. By the end I couldn't help screaming in my head, "Just kill her, kill her, and made this END!" I felt nauseous, dizzy and just plain angry afterwards. The people with me felt the same way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dismal failure of American dream shown by a European filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark confirms Lars Von Trier's status as a talented director.It is for the first time that he has worked on a musical genre film and has succeeded in infusing dramatic elements into it.His film is a boon for those film enthusiasts who would like to have tears roll down their eyes while humming a couple of nice songs.Some of this film's major themes have a direct bearing on the quintessential American dream.This has been highlighted by showing the hapless plight of an immigrant woman from Eastern Europe whose sad story reveals the victory of evil over good.A major problem of this film is its casting which is just on an above average level as some of the most talented actors like Jean Marc Barr and Catherine Deneuve have largely been ignored.They have nothing more than supporting roles to take care of.This is the reason why they appear as long lost souls.As it is a Dogma 95 film,one should not feel bored if there are irregular,unruly camera movements.They have been wisely introduced to create a sense of heightened tension in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing from Lars Von Trier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an enormous fan of Lars Von Trier. I own "Element of Crime" and I also have great reverence for his thematically charged "Breaking the Waves. "Dogville," although slow moving and a bit forceful at moments, was still clever and effective. "Dancer in the Dark" is the worst I have seen from him. I guess it's fair to disclose that I'm not a Bjork fan. I think she has produced some OK songs in the past, but I don't care for her vocal style. She's decent with the Celtic influenced pop wailing routines, although not nearly as good as Sinead O'Connor, but since the songs written into "Dancer in the Dark" require more traditional Broadway style vocals, Bjork just can't do it. Her voice has no strength and her projection is poor. She's not singing from the diaphragm which shows very clear in the train scene by the frequency and depth of her breaths. I want to know why Lars Von Trier picked a modern Celtic singer to perform in a more or less traditional or Broadway style vocal role, with the exception of a couple of odd style scenes like the factory scene and so on. Even then, Bjork's vocal performance was very weak. To make matters worse the music itself was very poorly written. These song writers were of the belief that you can take a bunch of dialog and just say it in a melodic manner and suddenly it's beautiful music. Come on, even the earliest rappers know you have to have some rhythm and rhyme or else it's not going to sound good.***Attention Spoiler Below*** As a story it's forced and unrealistic. It's about a girl who is going blind but won't tell anyone even though she can barely walk on her own, a woman who is nominated to play the lead role in a theater production but has no singing or dance talent, a woman who tries to shield her son from any small hint of stress yet is quick to smack him if he skips school, a woman who has built a complete lie around her life to keep her son from knowing she's going blind, a man who will do anything for her even though she rejects him on a daily basis and shows no appreciation for him even when his life revolves around her, a man who is in severe debt but is able to get away with claiming he keeps a stack of 2056 dollars in ones, fives, and tens in his safe deposit box, and a correctional officer who is used to watching people executed but can't keep herself from developing a strong emotional attachment to the woman she has to execute. Well is about all that or is it really about a woman who is either retarded or has extreme psychological disorders? Incredible stories are good as long as the people in them don't act unbearably stupid. ***Attention Spoiler Above***Despite some major flaws the movie is not awful. Bjork's performance is good, probably because she's a misfit and she portrays a misfit in the film so she didn't have to really act much. Although, I did find the absence of tears in the movie ridiculous, because she's crying in about half the scenes -- would it have broken the budget to keep an eyedropper on the set? I don't think she in any way deserves an Oscar or even an Oscar nomination for this because it doesn't really show any sort of versatility. I would hate to try to see her play Ellen Ripley in Aliens or something. That would just be too excruciating to watch. I give this movie a 5 of 10....some of Lars Von Trier's other movies are so much better and this just doesn't stack up to a lot of the other movies done in the same style, for example, John Cassavette's films, Ingmar Bergman films, and other Von Trier films like "Breaking the Waves."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And this was good because? (SPOILER ALERT!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, admittedly, Bjork's acting was very impressive. But there were so many things wrong with this movie! The bad Czech accents would not have been quite as bad if they had matched one another, but instead, Bjork stuck to her Icelandic accent (with a touch of British thrown in for some reason), making Catherine Deneuve's slightly better accent sound even worse. I thought the music would be one of the high points of the film, but the idea of the musical fantasy was wasted. There were 2 good songs, but when the other characters started attempting Bjork's distinctive vocal style they just sounded ridiculous because they couldn't pull it off. And the plot! Yikes! When Selma decided she would keep her secret from everyone and lied on the stand, I lost all sympathy for her, because she didn't even attempt to defend herself when she could have escaped the death penalty so easily by simply telling the truth. Also, helpful hint, never pick a famous person's name to use as an alias, even if they are only famous in Czechoslovakia. The courtroom scene was very unrealistic, as only the prosecuting attorney was allowed to speak. And when was the penal system that efficient with executions? In reality Selma would have been on death row for years, but in this movie her son is still a little boy when she is executed, and she has not aged at all. That doesn't even happen in Texas. Overall, this got 2 stars. It was only saved from "awful" by Bjork's acting, which couldn't make up for much in such a poorly written movie no matter how good it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, bjork is a very disturbed little girl. All anyone has to do is look her videos up on youtube to find that out (one involves licorice coming out of her nipples and wrapping her in a cocoon). But that's not the important right now. What IS important is that this movie is so amazingly sordid, it inspired me to create a mental list of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why is it bad, you ask? Well, like my fellow commenters, I think that the characters in this film have development and complexity rivaled only by puppets in children's' television programs. To call them two-dimensional is being generous. The entire film looks as if it's been shot with a camera phone. The intro to the film, containing what looks like stills of mentally handicapped children's' finger paintings (no offense to them) and the resulting mess of an exploded septic tank, is so amazingly tedious, it can only be interpreted as a warning sign of the film to come. The acting is so bad, it's not even laughable, the actors all have different accents that they're not even TRYING to hide, or maybe that's the characters, who knows? In a film like this, a place where everyone has a different accent isn't so strange. Furthermore, the loosely (and I mean LOOSELY) stitched-together plot is so scattered, you feel like you're flipping through channels rather than watching one cohesive thought. My friends and I decided to all watch it one night with the pure intent to make fun of it (in the style of Mystery Science Theatre 3000) but before we were 15 mins in, we drifted into conversation, leaving the movie playing in the background completely unwatched. That's how bad this film is, folks, you can't even stand to watch it TO MAKE FUN OF IT! I, like my fellow commenters, also relished the moment she was hung, in fact we fast-forwarded to that part and all burst into laughter when she died. I leave on this final note, this film won several independent film awards, and if I was an indie film maker, I'd be totally disgusted to win one of these awards if THIS is the caliber of film they commemorate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that every once in a while, there are films that come out of the screen to become experiences by their own. These are the kind of films that give us a breathe of hope: there's still people who think of movies as art and not dollars.Since the very beginning you feel next to Selma and her beautiful intentions, you live the innocence of a heavenly woman surrounded by a world that seems to be destined for her as a strike of pain. It's heartbreaking without being effectist, it touches a part of us that needs to be shaken sometimes.In the technical aspects, it's "dogma" enough to make you feel part of the story and understand the spectacular musical sequences as the dream we can all escape to. A beautiful achievement. And I won't forget Björk's flawless performance, I had never seen an actor actually becoming the character the way she pulled it off, making her singing the strongest weapon to feel and make us feel.I have heard some hateful comments about it. It's like life: you must be willing to live it and love it for what it is, or you can turn your eyes away and escape from tears. When I left the theater I knew I hadn't only seen a brilliant piece of art, but also I had lived emotionally...that's everything I hope to get from a movie and much, much more.

OK, the lame plot hurts too.For a while in the middle of the movie the camera steadies down, and only the painful plot is bothersome. But then the shakiness comes back. Perhaps the cameraman was drunk at the start of the movie, then he passed out during the blessedly stable middle of the movie, and then he regained consciousness and had the shakes in the latter portions of the movie. Or perhaps this was "art." The only thing that stops me from hacking into the IMDb system and giving this movie a negative number of stars is occasionally pleasant choreography.

		<shortDescription>The success is largely Björk's, the failure von Trier's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truth rarely lies in the middle. Everyone who doesn't consider "Dancer in the Dark" a masterpiece considers it an abomination, so we can safely bet that it's one or the other. And it's obvious enough which, if you ask me. Put your money on "abomination".Given it's so bad, why do some people love it so much? Rarely has that question been so easy to answer: Björk has created an interesting character we truly care about, and the story is so beautifully tragic, so heartbreaking, it's hard not to fall in love. The story, mind you, not the script. Von Trier is not a master of construction, and his dialogue is mostly terrible. It's still a fine story.Also, "I've Seen It All" is enchanting, as is the final song.There: that's EVERYTHING that's good. You might think it would be enough. In the ordinary course of events you would be right; but von Trier contrives to ruin it all with his childish, theoretically-motivated clumsiness: the eye-watering textures of his digital images, his jiggling camera, his mindless editing - they all induce a headache. True, after a while you stopped noticing. So what? Even when you aren't aware that you have a headache, you still have one, it's still pain, and it's still bad. How could von Trier not be embarrassed to attach his name to such amateurish images? The mere fact that this is an all-digital production - not a frame of film exposed - makes "Dancer in the Dark" something civilised people should shun, a bold gambit which, if it succeeds, will kill cinema altogether and leave us with just more television. Not that the digital technology is even so much as half the problem, given the idiotic use von Trier puts it to. One would have thought he'd have grown up by now.In general the songs - even the best of them - don't quite work. Everything else in the film works against them. Von Trier needs to edit less, to adopt a more flexible and visually meaningful form of presentation, to be less stingy with his music and insert more songs in the first half. As it is the schlock-tv presentation of the rest of the film, the sheer musical silence, acts as a dissonance during the song and dance. If this is deliberate it's a mistake. If not it's still a mistake. -Also, I have serious qualms about the lyrics of the "you did what you had to do" song. I know the utilitarian baldness of the words was part of the point, but that kind of thing needs a kind of careful handling von Trier is reluctant to give anything.P.S.: I've read that the film is set in the 1950s, or at any rate some time decades ago. Well, maybe that's where von Trier INTENDED to set it, but if so he failed. So far as I can tell the action takes place around now. The setting certainly doesn't deserve to be called timeless, yet there's nothing to suggest the past: it's best thought of as contemporary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not prepared to see the ending. I knew right from the beginning that something bad was going to happen.Selma (Bjork) works at a factory somewhere in America, but often she goes off in a little world where everything is a Hollywood musical. She imagines herself being the star and that everyone is happy and nothing is wrong and just loves to dance (tap especially from what I've gathered from the movie). She has a condition that is genetically transferred, and this condition is blindness. Knowing that soon her sight will be gone, and she knew that her son Jean was going to get the same condition, which is the reason why she moved to America in the first place because she knew there were doctors there that would give her son surgery so that Jean wouldn't have the same fate. But things go downhill once Selma manages to get the right amount of money, which involves the money being stolen, which she gets back but in return she had to kill off the man who stole it which leads to a police investigation and of course Selma's arrest, which then leads to Selma's hanging.And even with only 20 minutes left of the film, which I thought was enough time for me to brace myself for when the execution finally happens, I was still not prepared. Bjorks acting was spot on, along with others around her. No one, except for Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream, has made me cry so much for a character. I have never felt so depressed and so silent after a film, it was impossible for me to speak for 20 minutes (mainly because I was a blubbering mess).All in all, Dancer in the Dark is a brilliantly made film. The music numbers, the acting, the scenery, the camera styles and just literally everything was spot on and without a flaw. However this movie really isn't for the faint hearted, but at the same time I wish that everyone could see this.10/10</fullReview>

With critics completely split about it and audiences praising it, I was intrigued by such an overwhelmingly positive reaction from movie goers regarding a film by Lars Von Trier, a director usually proving to polarize audiences and (for the most part) dazzle critics.And now, after watching it, I can't say I'll ever understand why critics weren't digging it.Dancer in the Dark is Lars Von Trier's magnum opus. Filled to the brim with Von Triers trademark nihilistic themes, never shying away from the cynical and bleak perspective, this film is devastatingly dark and overwhelmingly depressing...But, somehow, I couldn't turn away.Complimented by Bjork's magnificent performance, Von Trier's stylish approach to an increasingly engaging story, and a stunning and attractive soundtrack, the film is one of the most emotionally effective films I've seen in a long time.Dancer in the Dark's excellence meets no boundaries, it's a landmark in cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some, "Dancer in the Dark" is viewed as one of the greatest films of all time, but for others, it's viewed as a melodramatic, pretentious mess. The film stars Björk as Selma-a Czech immigrant who suffers from a (unnamed) disease which is gradually causing her to go blind. She saves her money for an operation to prevent her son from going blind. The plot has been criticised for being overtly melodramatic and formulaic. The plot of "Dancer in the Dark" isn't anything exciting or original, but it works. "Dancer in the Dark" is a musical, though it hardly feels like one. "Dancer in the Dark" is a gut-wrenching, but not overtly sentimental tearjerker in which Björk completely immerses herself in her role as the natural and innocent Selma. Also, worth mentioning are the performances of Catherine Deneuve as Selma's best friend Kathy and Peter Stormare as her shy neighbor Jeff. I admired the simplicity of this film adherring the some of the rules of Dogme 95, a film movement created by von Trier (Dancer in the Dark's director) which aimed to create filmmaking based on the traditional values of story, acting, and theme, and excluding the use of elaborate special effects or technology in the hope that the industry would give the power back to the artist as opposed to the studio. "Dancer in the Dark" works as both a homage to the musical genre and as a tearjerker, if not a little melodramatic. 8/10</fullReview>

Dancer int he Dark somehow does the opposite; it immerses the audience in the tragedy of the characters, until it finally punches you in the gut and leaves you crying on the ground.This is a long film, but it is pretty briskly-cut so that no scene outstays its welcome. There are just a few musical numbers, but they aren't necessarily the same kind of flamboyancy you see in The Sound of Music or anything. If anything, the sequences in this film are downbeat and perhaps a little awkward. I don't think this film stands out as a great musical, but it does stand out as a great drama, because the film's sole focus is on story and character.The musical aspect of the film provides a stark contrast between the main character's daydreaming and the harsh reality she has to face. Ultimately, it is the drama of Selma Je?ková that takes the spotlight and makes the film so invoking; the film builds her up in a way that we don't want to see anything bad happen to her. Inevitably, the story gradually unfolds until desperation and hard times forces neighbors to betray one another, and the last half of the film leads to a hard-hitting finale. The last scene is among one of the most depressing endings I've seen. One could complain about the story - it does have some contrivances and manipulation - and chances are that some folks won't care for how things play out. I believe that it is an interesting plot that's laden with strong themes concerning dreams (both personal and the American dream), and the film's play on real-looking drama and musical fantasy makes it feel even more punchy.Inspired by the Dogme 95' style, this film is crafted with a lot of hand-held camera work, blunt editing, and dull color schemes, giving it a pseudo-documentary look and feel. Musical sequences contrast greatly, using still camera work and a music-video style of editing, and more color. Acting isn't bad; the singer Björk is surprisingly a perfect fit for Selma's character, giving her a life and personality we can't help but to sympathize with. Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, and Peter Stormare are earnest in their roles. Writing isn't too subtle or sophisticated, but it matches up well with the performances and the film's style. Björk's music ranges from snazzy to hauntingly ambient, and the same extends to the music she made for this film; it is especially interesting how the background beats are made to match up with the sound effects of a given scene. The final song used in the overture, end credits, and last scene might be the most beautiful one I've heard her sing.Dancer in the Dark is a bit like Breaking The Waves; both are gut-wrenching stories of women with golden hearts who become victims of unfortunate circumstances. I give Dancer in the Dark the edge for using entwining the genre of musicals with the drama to give it contrast and weight. I believe it is a storytelling experience that everybody should try out at least once.4.5/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the first art-house (not sure if it is classified as one by critics or not) films I've seen. I've watched it 12 years ago and now after being more mature, watching more than +100 films... still find it one of the best drama-musicals ever made. It still has the same effect on me, compelling, powerful and just captivating. One of the films you watch without being (or not wanting to be) disrupted by phone calls, reading or talking to someone else. Arguably, predominantly women have resembling feelings towards Björk's Selma than men, hence all the negative comments from more "rational" counterparts. However, I might be wrong. Just read a few lines written by men, that are reasonable at times, yet quite relentless...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shock, Catherine Deneuve outperformed by popstar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a follower of von Trier but this is one film I felt no great urge to see for two reasons:- 1/ I hate musicals - nothing spoils my involvement in a story more than all the characters suddenly breaking character to go into a song &amp; dance routine. 2/ Placing a pop singer in the lead role strikes me as farming off the celebrity value, only necessary when the script is poor enough to need a helping hand. Surely, a trained and experienced actor would do a better job. So I haven't bothered with 'Dancer in the Dark' until now. What an idiot I was.Bjorks acting did seem a bit amateurish for the initial twenty minutes or so, but I urge you to bear with this. This may have been a directorial device to hook you into the simplicity of her character because as the plot develops she renders a character as strong as any. If you are not totally with Selma as the film build to its climax the you must be an unempathic &amp; heartless person not to be touched by Bjorks powerful rendition of this character. A proper actor could have done as well but not by much. However, a proper actor however could not have done the songs, yep, you read right - this musical hater is about to praise the song &amp; dance routines.For the first two songs I was thinking 'Oh no, get on with it' while waiting painfully for them to end. But during the third something had changed, I began to realise these song &amp; dance routines weren't a break in the plot sequence but were a significant part of it. They were Selmas trips into 'Wonderland', how she managed to cope with a very tough life. I might say that Bjorks songs were more in the line of being arias than musical numbers except this is no opera. The 'musical numbers' definitely added to the films impact.Also, von Trier seems to have a penchant to throw shock 'gimmick's in his films, such as the hard core scene in 'The Idiots or the emasculation in 'Antichrist'. Thankfully, in this film he just lets the script, direction &amp; Bjorks rendering of the lead character do all the work. The result of these three factors working together left me totally knocked out. After the last scene there was absolutely nothing I could do except sit through the credits in a state of gobsmacked-ness while Bjork sang me back to the real world.Other actors also put in very creditable performances. Catherine Deneuve did well and Siobhan Fallon came through very strongly while highlighting Bjorks character.So now I realise - my bigotry has had me missing what is possibly von Triers greatest film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Salute to the director for having given the audience such a great drama. The camera wobbles every other scene (Dogma camera) which adds reality to the screenplay and makes the movie itself dance to the musical. Bjork was great with her songs and acting skills.Happiness is the state of mind, I believe.In this movie Bjork day dreams it with her music and dancing.The way she takes beat from the factory machines and the moving train are way too good. In a musical movie,nothing dreadful happens, but it isn't true in this movie. A tear jerking drama. The climax leaves the viewers emotionally draining thinking about the poor kid with no one possibly to look after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the saddest thing I've ever seen, I'm heartbroken and I can hardly type those words.Lars von Trier's extremely powerful, emotionally charged "musical" about a girl from Czech whose extremely fond of American musicals, moves to the US with her son, expecting it to be like a Hollywood film, but things turn ugly, and she faces it by daydreaming about her life being a musical.This movie survives solely on the story, the script and the acting, I couldn't believe that Bjork could deliver such an amazing performance, but there were still 2 main negative aspects about the film for me..The badly directed musical sequences, they should have been the highlight of the movie, but they were just terribly executed with very awkward framing of shots, it was like editing together the footage from various surveillance cameras.The other being that the movie was shot on generic video cameras of the time on a DVCAM format, which means that the footage is video, I have no idea how that looked on the big screen, especially the one at the Palais des Festivals at Cannes, that combined with a sickening shaky camera-work.Even though the movie had no visual beauty whatsoever, the story and the acting make it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Future of Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier, the antithesis of the Wachowski's and Emmerich. He takes it all away, all you are left with is the bare truth and that is where the best drama lies. The 'fly on the wall' style is nothing new but Dancer in the Dark is still unique in its approach to my favourite style of movie making, you could be watching a nature program studying human subjects. The switch in style during the musical sections aside for a moment, the reality presented in this masterpiece is truly without doubt the most harrowing I ever seen, yet so warm in its portrayal of what REAL selfless unconditional love is. I cannot describe with enough passion the depth of my empathy for Bjork's character, she is astounding in her role. I love the switch in style that takes you into her imagination, every time a beautiful musical piece fuelled by the rhythm of the noises she hears around her. Bjorks voice and composition is as haunting as ever. As with Dogville, Von Trier explores the most base of human instincts, the lowest one will stoop, but here is where we find the deepest emotion and the strongest empathy. Ironically a return to something which is closer to theatre than it is to any Hollywood blockbuster. With more and more films substituting a mediocre script with dazzling special effects, this the only way left to go if we are to continue to be inspired by movies, this is the future of film and I embrace it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW! WHAT A PERFORMANCE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that should not be overlooked by anyone that wants to see great acting. The main role is performed by Iceland's Bjork. Her performance is as excellent as will ever be seen. There are many excellent actors and actresses that aren't recognized because they aren't cast into demanding roles. This role of a girl, that is going blind, is very demanding,and Bjork fills the need to over flowing. The movie is done with great sensitivity and should evoke all the emotions that a viewer should want. Great acting throughout and obviously great directing.The movie is very disturbing, and should not be watched just before trying to go to sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good directing, screenplay, and acting (except bjork, where she over-acted/mis-acted in several shots) but very poor and shallow plot.Basically you see this woman named Selma suffering in the whole movie and some of her friends tried to help her. Some parts are just basically stupid and childish for example why would that guard suddenly love selma so much it almost make it seem like a movie for children. And Selma is just selfish and stupid, she thinks some $2000 is more important than 2 human lives. If she really cared for her son then she should work something out with her friends. I doubt that her son would trade his mother for some surgeries.Besides did she really need that money in such a rush? Well she looks like 40 something when she completely lost her sight and her son is only like 6.Not only that, some of the "musicals" that are forced into the film are just overlong and hard to stand, not that i dont like bjork's music but i just dont think it fits in like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one movie to see... with sickening story, director to hate, characters a bunch of losers, strange music, weird cast - and outcome a film that stays in your mind forever and ever... The story has been repeated so many times that I don't waste anybody's time with it. So: into the acting...Björk/Selma: Björk was simply astonishing! So sensitive, frail and strong. A natural actor. I don't wonder she left the scene in the middle of the filming, I only wonder she came back!David Morse/Bill: As I had seen him the last time in "The Rock", it took a while before I really recognized whom I was watching. In uniform again - and I bet this role required much more courage to take through! I salute him for the courage - I've wept for Bill and cried "Don't do that!" even though I'm a grown-up and know it's only a film...Catherine Deneuve/Kathy: The chic femme as a factory worker? Oh yes - and convincing. I think I have to see her other films also!Peter Stormare/Jeff: "Grab that woman into your arms and TAKE HER HOME!" I could not believe I was watching the man who did Gaear Grimsrud or even Julius in "Circus". Jeff is so sweet and shy, a regular teddybear - needing a good "encouraging" kick on the butt. I'm glad this role did not go to a 'young man' eager to gain name - the outcome could have been so different! For Jeff belong a couple of phrases that might well be added to "Memorable quotes": "Women and rust are the same" and Bill's reply to that, and later Jeff's comment on musicals: "I really don't understand musicals, you know, I don't suddenly start singing or dancing" - something like that! And Jeff &amp; Selma on the train... simply so beautiful!I hate the director, I hate the story, I despise the characters, I can't understand the music - and I love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I pride myself on enjoying the offbeat but this film was the reason the general public can't stand European movies. The hand-held camera work was annoying. Instead of letting me escape into the film it kept yanking me out of it. The plot was melodramatic and the music was terrible. Did anybody believe for a moment that Bjork and Denueve worked in a factory?I did feel for the Bjork character, but mainly I just felt jerked around by the plot. From the beginning you knew someone was going to hurt her and it was just a matter of who was going to do it. The gunfire and music number was way to weird. The resulting tragic spiral was laughable and tragic in the extreme. Are the rest of you aware of Soap Operas? Oh the tragedy and the horror!!! Boo Hoo!!! Look at what they are doing to that poor blind girl!!! She is so poor and blind and tragic. Whatever.I really wanted to enjoy this film and I tried too... Really I did. But instead it infuriated me in a way that no other film has done before.I was interested in seeing Breaking the Waves but I will now avoid it.0 out of 10 to bring the rest of you down to Earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Selma Vs Erin Brokovitch (European art-house Vs USA mass products)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I´ve been reading reviews below and wonder why old fashioned and narrow minded people out there ever watched this movie: someone did compare Björk music with seventies band Yes (this guy obviously never kept track with todays music trends), a poor american girl bursted into tears and won´t see any Lars' movies anymore cause she doesn´t want to feel like a crap (you´d better watch Disney stuff my darling), some other viewers enjoyed Selma´s death by american death penalty methods (facist american sort of people again, aren´t you?), there were even classical musical fans hating it (this is an anti-classical musical musical in many ways though there´s a subtle homage as Selma is basically obsessed with that sort of old musicals and then she assimilitates it all in her particular way so that it flourishes differently in her mind, "innovation", get it?).Of course it is not a perfect body of work, but it´s sheer blissful innovative cinematography all the way through which is more than enough given the mediocrity delivered by most directors these days.First of all the soundtrack is absolutely amazing stuff, many tracks co-produced by Mark Bell (LFO), one of the UK electronica geniuses of the nineties. Björk acting and singing is superb, her very eerie dreamlike essence is all around, she´s a dropped out person in the movie and also in the music scene cause she´s unique and challenging. Nevertheless this sort of people are achieving recognition little by little. Then again, I am sure all these unsensitive guys hating Selma (Björk) and Dancer in the dark would enjoy Erin Brokovitch instead and run into tears while Julia Roberts becomes a heroine through a better crafted flawless script which turns to be just tedious, you can see demos of this drama everyday on TV afternoon eighties movies. It´s practical instead of emotional, current in a capitalist sense instead of innovative at all, it´s a "from rags to riches" fairytale, etc.. etc... To be frank I admit scripting Erin takes more effort to make it entertaining cause it´s intended basically to make money and let Julia show off, I can imagine a whole bunch of scripters contriving the plot.. then if you´re not the average person to be entertained that is not for you. It´s probably easier for nowadays people to identify with practical and sexy Julia Roberts (You wanna be her, ha?) than identifying with pitiful dropped out powerful dreamer Selma. The so much criticized drama element of her blindness is not only that but probably a bridge to make us feel she´s somewhere in between detaching from the real world and her private innermost aspirations in life. If you´re tired of watching the same film and characters over and over then try this one, it´s different, it´s original, it´s powerful, it´s art-house but accessible if you´re open minded???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit misogynistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**Lars von Trier has a misogynistic streak that he generously indulges in his films. DITD features, as "Breaking the Waves" did before it, a naive, innocent, and heroic female protagonist whom the plot conspires to destroy. But BTW had a lot more going for it than does this pallid retread. The plot mechanics of DITD creak along so transparently that they get in the way of one's ability to enjoy it. In addition, this movie positively revels in debasing and torturing the main character, played affectingly by Bjork --- in a manner excruciating to watch --- and because the plot is such a cheat, it becomes difficult to identify with the main character. It made me angry and ruined the integrity of the story, which wastes several excellent performances (by Bjork and Catherine Deneuve, especially)which would really get you under the skin of their characters, otherwise. To me, the key to the director's real intentions lies with his invention of a mysterious, unnamed eye ailment, whose characteristics von Trier obviously seems to have made up to suit his needs. Therefore (spoiler ahead): Bjork's character cannot save herself, because doing so would require her to reveal to her son that he has inherited a progressive congenital vision defect. "Bjork" refuses to reveal this to her son to avoid "making him worry, which could make the disease progress faster." Huh? Such transparent plot devices wrench all the tragedy from the drama, revealing it for the shameless exercise in sadism it really is. That the boy could be equally stressed by having his mother jailed and executed, never seems to pop into anybody's mind. That's because it's all a device for having "fate' conspire to kill a woman, and in a brutal manner --- a woman who is powerless to do anything to stop the (not so inevitable) wheels of fate from rolling over her. This is not to say that I was unaffected by the movie, and there was a lot i did like about it. The domestic scenes of Bjork with her son ring true, as does her budding romance with a sweet local man whose attentions she enjoys but tries not to encourage. But the musical segments were not very well integrated into the plot, and they were a little obvious as well. It's one thing to have the main character retreat into old musicals to forget her life of drudgery (think "The Purple Rose of Cairo" or "Brazil"), but why must she take on a far-away look and a goofy smile, and make a big deal about swinging into a Busby-Berkeley routine, clumsily-staged at that? The conceit does not emerge as a function of character, but merely as an idea sprung fully from the head of von Trier. The musical elements work best in the film when they seem to arise from plot, as in the "You Just Did What you Had to Do" post-murder sequence, where the unreality of the fantasy seems to serve the purpose of story and make one ache for all that has been lost --- or when Bjork sings "My Favorite Things" while in solitary confinement (though von Trier is really skirting sadism here as well). What could have been unforgettable becomes only arresting and interesting, beautiful in places --- a curiosity, more than anything else, and an indulgence on the part of the director. I would like his next movie to be about a man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the films released in the year 2000, "Dancer in the Dark" was clearly and without a doubt one of the best. Bjork's performance was one of the greatest accomplishments of the year 2000. For a non-actress her performance was surprising in its quality. Her singing was excellent as usual and her scenes with David Morse were the best non-Musical of the film. The musical numbers were extraordinary especially the one in the courtroom with Joel Grey ( who also gave a great performance). The way they were shot was also very interesting with the colors being much brighter than in the other parts. Catherine Deneuve gave an Oscar-worthy performance as Kathy, Bjork's best friend. The scenes at the very end in the prison should have gotten her a nomination. Above all though this is director Lars Von Trier's accomplishment. His direction of the actors was brilliant as was the musical numbers. "Dancer In the Dark" is just as good as his "Breaking the Waves" and maybe even be better than that great work. </fullReview>

Bjork is brilliant, definitely the best performance ever by a musician in a film (previous winner: Mick Jagger playing himself more or less in the superb Performance). Lars Von Trier does not hold back on the drama and the result is something that will leave you stunned and shaken after it has finished. The dream sequences are wonderful, joyous and exhilarating moments, but the film's final image is truly upsetting and saddening.

		<fullReview>Even though I notice that this film is incredibly well rated by practically everybody in this section, I for one felt that it was a totally amateurish, snobbish film aimed more at causing impact than in really telling the story that it set out to depict. Following most of the guidelines of the "Dogma 95" commandments, which are a complete negation of everything I learned at film school and which I have been practicing successfully for more than forty years as a film director-editor, the film has some of the most horrible camerawork, lighting (or absense of) and is a homage to the jump-cut school of film editing. It is a shame that this film, which is a spear-head of the digital revolution, should represent digital cinema in such a shoddy manner. Just seeing it should make a lot of uncertain filmmakers embrace their film stock with heartfelt thanks. The whole ambient of the film, which is supposed to happen in the United States, is so totally faked and badly represented by the actors that it loses the empathy that it is trying to achieve. Lars Von Trier criticises Björk because "she was living the role instead of acting". Isn't this exactly what all directors expect of their actors or is that another one of the commandments of the Dogma crowd? Anyhow, her acting is practically the only saving grace of the whole film together with the beautiful symphonic opening (which leads one to expect something really exceptional) and some parts of the musical numbers, which leave you with the feeling that the best parts were left in the cutting room floor. Björk gets a 9 out of 10 from me and the film as a whole 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

To me that is very brave and with the powerful music from Björk it is a successful step he has taken.Besides that he has made Björk act in a way you would never believe. She has been down some deep alleys of her body and mind to get this performance out. What a Debut!!Anyway, it is very difficult to capture this film in a thousand words.

		<fullReview>We get it. A lot of Europeans don't like the death penalty and also believe that America has faults. But really...This movies says that if you come to America you will live in a trailer, be exploited at work, your son will become truant and only the town idiot will take a fancy to you. Well okay. That *could* happen.It's what comes next: The American police have members who will enter your home, (while telling their wives that you seduced them), steal you blind, tell their wives that YOU have actually stolen from *them* and also proclaim that you are currently robbing them at gun point. After you are arrested, you will be given an attorney who HAS YOU TAKE THE STAND (?!) and who provides no defense witnesses, nor does any investigation into the matter, all while any friends that you thought you had, do nothing during your trial to support your cause. You will be found guilty of premeditated murder and SHORTLY THEREAFTER be put to death.(I just had to look up the statistics related to women and capital punishment, and according to deathpenaltyinfo.org only one woman in the U.S. was executed in the 60's (Elizabeth Duncan, in 1962). Then not again until 1984 (Velma Barfield) and then Karla Tucker in in 1998. So in that time period - just 3 women in 36 years. Also NO women have ever been executed in the state Washington, the state where this film takes place.)The only thing as unbelievable as the story, was the character of Selma. She is a woman who works hard to raise money for her son, and yet doesn't let him know what she is saving for, and why she spends so little time with him. Worse, she is willing to have him grow up as an orphan. The things she does throughout the movie are unbelievably stupid. I would list the idiotic things she does, but doing so would use the allotment of words we're allowed here.I'm not a fan of Bjork, but some of the dance numbers were interesting. I actually liked (and was touched) by the first part of the movie. But as it became more and more unbelievable, I lost my connection to it.Note: For grammar purists - I attempted to use brackets inside parentheses, but IMDb doesn't allow brackets!

		<fullReview>This is a film of two halves. At first, you feel there's the makings of something amazing and absorbing. The camera-work instantly draws you into the story as though it was a documentary. There was the makings here of something special. But as time goes on it becomes obvious.Characters begin to act inexplicably, and in stupid ways, in order to get to the most dramatic ending... leaving you with lots of plot holes and wondering 'why did she do THAT?'. Sadly, being this implausible makes you turn away from what could otherwise be a very accomplished film.Its not without merit though. The acting is magnificent across the board, with special reference to Bjork and Catherine Deneuve. The musical element is brilliantly handled... characters don't just burst into song, they hear rhythms in everyday sounds like a train passing, and the music builds from there.But at the end of the day, this starts brilliantly then continually lets you down as it goes along. Shame, really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing Mish Mash of Movie Genres and Acting Styles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dancer in the Dark" is for fans of "Cop Rock," of which I'm one. It's "Dead Man Walking" meets "Pajama Game" and Dennis Potter's "Pennies from Heaven." I'm quite biased against Bjork; even after watching a documentary on her on cable and listening to her interviewed on public radio, I find her weird, with annoying mannerisms, pretentious and her music sounds all the same to me (and I just wanted to put a hairbrush to her hair!) But she is the whole movie. The audience burst out in applause when her name came up in the closing credits. She is incredible. But why make her Czech? Why not make her from, say way Eastern Russia, and give her a "son" who looks something like her.While the American actors are uniformly terrific, the rest of the casting is of the head-scratching variety. The movie comes across like those T-shirts Japanese tourists wear stringing English words that make no sense together. Why is it set in the state of Washington? It seems like a Socialist Realist anti-American movie (particularly anti-capital punishment and our expensive justice system, where Washington State is full of European immigrants with varying accents. Catherine Deneuve as a factory worker??!!! She's a terrific actress but just woefully miscast. It is interesting to see Dogma 95 filmmakers realist principles tackle the musical as a genre, as the choreography is for non-dancers with virtually no special effects or editing tricks, and I thought the musical fantasies worked quite well. It is a bit long and draggy in parts. While it's in English with some American actors, it's definitely a very European movie -- I'm not sure an American would think that "Sound of Music" was a tap dancing movie. But the odd soundtrack, lyrics by the director, music by Bjork, is haunting.(originally written 10/8/2000)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a completely compelling film with far too many fundamental flaws.First, the compelling part. From the first moment, it's impossible not to be drawn into and absorbed by the film; the story is so powerful, and moves with such pace, that its two hours pass in an instant. The cast are all outstanding, and despite some of them struggling with the English language, hold the viewer's attention throughout. I had not expected to like Bjork, about whom I knew next to nothing, but she is bewitching, not to mention sexy in an innocent kind of way. Catherine Deneuve is as you would expect, and the good/bad cop and his wife, and the people at the factory, especially Geoff, are all excellent.But the flaws! First, the plot has so many holes that it would be laughable if it weren't such a horrible subject. Then the music: while the idea of a musical is good, and the dancing and direction of the musical numbers are also very good (I like the "less is more" approach when it comes to that sort of dancing), the songs themselves are appalling. I could not distinguish anything approaching a melody in any of them as I listened, and I defy anyone to hum from memory a single snatch of any of the tunes. Bjork's voice is memorable only for its ordinariness; she's very much from the "I'm not really a singer; my act is to have emotional breakdowns with instrumental accompaniment" school of singing. And then there's the hand-held camera. I could shoot the person who invented it. OK, in certain scenes there's a use for it, but when it's used constantly, as von Trier uses it, its sole effect is to unsettle the viewer's digestion. Most of the time it has no artistic justification whatsoever; insistence on it is just pretentiousness.So because it's so gripping, the film has to score well; but because it's so flawed, it's well off the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A musical tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how such a horrible story is about such nice people after all. If people are so good why is society so wicked as to allow these things to happen? As a matter of fact there are no bad guys or girls in this movie. Even the policeman who steals the money from the poor woman worker who was saving it for a surgical operation that her son needed to avoid becoming blind, is not structurally a bad man. He does it compelled by the urgency of paying the arrears of the price of the house he had bought to avoid being deprived of it. The movie begins softly with the enactment of a stage musical (the famous Sound of Music) in which the woman above referred takes part. She works in a factory where everybody is friendly with her and with each other in a good atmosphere. But things begin to deteriorate in a quick way after the theft above mentioned and will change her life dramatically. We live in a society where we can be deviated from good sentiments under the stress of circumstances related with money. The atmosphere of the movie becomes more and more dramatic as far as the story develops itself till the end. Björk plays extremely well the part of the young female worker who comes from Communist Czechoslovakia to USA with her son and dreams with a hollywoodesque society in which she could take part in a musical despite suffering of an illness which will make her blind very soon like her son if he is not operated in a short time. She finds something very different of Hollywood instead as her ordeal will show. Her childish and sweet face and look are unforgettable. But they hide a strong will and personality which is mainly shown in the final hard choice she has to make but where she puts her motherly love above all. The weakest part of the movie is perhaps the musical and dance numbers which have not the quality we should expect to fit in this musical tragedy. One last note: after seeing this movie I can't see how anyone can still be in favour of the death penalty unless -- like we say in Portugal -- they have hair grown on their hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend told me to go and see this movie about a thousand times before I actually saw it. She told me it was an extremely sad movie. While I was watching I kept on thinking that it wasn't too sad at all, it actually told me that you always had to look on the bright side of life. But then it started to get really sad. I think I've never cried this long over one movie. Even when the end credits came I couldn't stop. But it is not a bad thing. This movie is beautiful and extremely real, despite the musical element. Björk has done some great work here you can see that she almost isn't acting anymore, she seems to be experiencing it herself. So, if you haven't seen this one, go and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie exhibits what every screenwriter has always known: make your hero suffer and your audience suffers with them. Bjork is so convincing in the role of Selma that I had to keep reminding myself, through fists-full of Kleenex, that she's only acting; this is just a movie. The cinematography is great, as is the music and the overall ESSENCE of the film transports you from your threadbare couch to some ruralish town in the northern US - so lush that you can almost feel the coolness of the vegetation along the train tracks. Amazing movie. I'm not a big "cryer" but I've never. ever. cried so much during a movie as I did in this one. I recommend it highly, whether or not you're a Bjork fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding cast saves this otherwise difficult film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I'm much a fan of Von Trier's films, they really are all done in classic love-it-or-hate-it style, and I would have to count myself in the latter category. But whether you like him or not, it's definitely worth seeing and appreciating his films, and Dancer in the Dark is no exception. It was my first taste of this eccentric Danish director.Von Trier's direction can best be described as innovative; it's provocative, to a large extent experimental and very very unique. In this film, his hand-held digital camera work, some would argue, is designed to give the whole film a naturalistic look; if the camera moves in the same way that a person would in the situations created, it makes us more involved, captivates us more. I disagree. All it seems to do is make one frequently conscious of what is going on, and for that reason it has, in fact, the opposite effect, makes everything seem artificial. And as such I have a lot of difficulty getting emotionally involved in this film.Another point worth noting about Dancer in the Dark is that it is a very unconventional musical, as several times the emotions of the characters are illustrated by way of a song. This is because the lead character, played by Bjork, grew up and lived on musicals, because 'nothing terrible ever happens in them'. So therefore despite her disabling disease which rapidly destroys her eyesight, she remains positive by following the time-honoured advice of Julie Andrews et al. by singing to forget one's troubles. The film shows that this doesn't always work. It really does pile on the sorrow and darkness; It is absolutely stocked to the gills with injustice, depression, hopelessness. Obviously this is another reason why it's hard to truly like this film.Although, despite this difficulty I have relating and enjoying this film, I have to admit it's very good. It really does challenge the viewer, and challenge the film-making world in general. It's obvious to me that Von Trier's major intention in this was to experiment with and bend the rules of genre. In this case, he takes the frankly quite sappy musical genre and laces it with darkness. One clear example is when Bjork is imprisoned for murder and she cheers herself up by singing "My Favourite Things" in a slightly minor key. It gives an almost Joycean quality to Von Trier's harsh appropriation. And the fact is that, given that film is a visual art, if the audience can see what you were trying to do, then you've succeeded. So regardless of whether I like this film or Von Trier himself, he has managed to create a real work of art here.Finally, one thing you have to say for Lars is that he has an uncanny knack for assembling excellent casts, and doing brilliant things with them. The experimentation and challenging quality of this film would be enough to really rise hatred in me, if it weren't for the cast. Bjork absolutely shines in the lead role. It's the sort of leading performance that nobody could have played better. And not only that but she's almost upstaged by a similarly awesome performance by David Morse. One of the most under-appreciated actors around today, I personally think he gives the performance of his career in this film. He is, to put it simply, perfect in a slightly cruel, embittered but ultimately very sympathetic role. And meanwhile, there is also some further amazing support work from Catherine Deneuve, Peter Stormare and a bunch of Von Trier mainstays Jean-Marc Barr, Siobhan Fallon, Zeljko Ivanek and of course, Udo Kier in a brief but memorable cameo.Essentially the film is difficult to get into, difficult to enjoy and so easy to detest, but overall an amazing achievement in the world of film-making, and the wonderful cast more than makes up for the otherwise quite alienating direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking my habit of generally writing about good films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any who may have read some of my comments on 95 films will have noticed that they are generally favourable. For me criticism is largely a matter of imparting enthusiasms. What point is there is wasting time on castigating indifferent or downright bad movies when one could be encouraging someone to make discoveries that have brought me great joy and excitement. Just occasionally I have made an example of something that could have been better handled in more skilled hands ("Arlington Road", "Tea with Mussolini" and the Italian version of Chekhov's "Three Sisters"), but generally I have stuck to ones that I playfully categorise as "FOOQs" (Films of Outstanding Quality) - the really great ones - or "FOQs" (Films of Quality) - not really great, but having qualities that make them well worth seeing. Just for once however I am going against this by writing about something I find really dreadful, not one that deserves to pass unnoticed as the type of mindless cretin fodder that runs the circuits every week, but one made by an art-house director, not without talent, who should have known better. Lars von Trier's work is never less that controversial. Even his finest, "Breaking the Waves", had me ultimately questioning the value of a film whose considerable grip bordered on the morbidly sensational. Nevertheless its powerful impact was such as to stifle criticism and place it among the "top ten" of its particular year. I can offer no such accolade to the truly appalling "Dancer in the Dark" although I somehow managed to watch it to the end. Why? Because as with its predecessor it has a certain compulsive quality, shared by some other bad movies such as "Titanic", which makes it impossible to put down. Most bad movies however are harmless time wasters. Von Trier's "Dancer" is something different and rather dangerous as it trivialises very serious themes such as blindness and capital punishment by dressing them up pretentiously in the escapist popular genre of the Musical. The film is never less than skillful, but at what price! Every ounce of Chaplinesgue mawkishness is poured into the character of the factory worker who hopes to make enough money to pay for an operation to save her son's sight in a race against time as blindness rapidly overtakes her. And what of the conclusion on Death Row where a song and dance routine prefaces the final drop! Hard to believe that we are actually witnessing an event as horrendous as the inevitable outcome of Kieslowski's "A Short Film About Killing". To cheapen it as Von Trier does here is nothing short of obscene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been pretty callous when it comes to tearjerkers and it is very rare that I'll cry during a movie. Unfortunately, too many musicians try to become actors nowadays, and they fail miserabally. Bjork acknowledged that she is not an actress, and that this film was so disturbing that she'd never do another one. Her performance was worthy of all the acclaim that she received for it. Dancer in the Dark was so profoundly disturbing and it left me feeling emotionally bereft. Despite this, it is a must-see because it makes you rethink your path and place in life as a human being. It replaced Hotaru no Haka as the saddest movie of all time on my list, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Surreal, deep, beautiful and painful, this movie cannot be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to watching this film as I love Bjork as a singer and song writter, I had been recommended the film by a friend who said it was "brilliant". I was lent the video and began to play it the picture started and I immediately rewound the tape as I had believed the tape was at the end of the main feature and had gone on to behind the scenes footage and goofs made within the film. After rewinding I was greeted with the same opening, slightly confused I continued watching, the realisation set in that this was the actual production, the acting was of a school play standard and Bjork's accent annoyed me throughout the entire film, a great deal of the dialogue caused me to cringe due to the terrible standard of scriptwritting. The whole film is absolutely ridiculous in every aspect. The direction and filming looks like some sort of home video making the quality of the Blair Witch Project seem fantastic. The content of the film is deeply disturbing and in many ways completely inappropriate as the events that happen are completely unbelieveable and included within the film simply to attempt to cause the audience to feel depressed or sadden, however due to the dreadful direction and awful acting the scenes do not evoke the desired feelings. It seems although the director has attempted to deliberately shock the audience and in doing do makes no real point. The characters within the film are completely hipocritical and in a number of scenes act stupidly to the point of annoyance. The film made me want to scream at my TV set. The dancing scenes were completely lame and extremely cliched. This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen in every respect and has no redeeming features what so ever in my opinion. I wasted 2 hours of my life in no other case would I say I have wasted my time watching a film or any other production. I obtained more enjoyment and was more impressed with the acting ability at my girlfriend's little sister's school play than by watching Dancer in the Dark. At all costs avoid this film, don't make the same mistake I did. 0/10 Sorry if this seems so harsh I just feel so angry to have wasted my time on this rubbish, I feel deeply disappointed and sick to the stomach not only because of the horrid content of the film but because it makes me sick to think a film this bad has been distributed at such a high level and been so critically accailmed when other more worthy films dismissed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a 3-minute story stretched out to more than 2 hours?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like all kinds of films, including musicals, low budget, art-house and experimental films. I own copies of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (how un-hip is that?!), Clerks, Topsy-Turvy, El Mariachi, Brazil and Sherman's March. I found Breaking the Waves powerful and memorable (except the awful ending, but that is another story). `Riget' is on my must-see list.But I am very disappointed by Dancer in the Dark. The tale is so slight it could be adequately told in a 3-minute MTV video. To add to its slenderness, the story is also hugely contrived and unconvincing, particularly the legal process in the second half. The plot holes are big enough to drive a freight train through (complete with 20 dancing lumberjacks). Von Trier's signature use of the hand-held camera, whose shakiness is unsettling, gives the film the unwanted air of an actor's improvisation session or a fly-on-the-wall documentary of a late rehearsal, especially in the first half. I found the pace of the drama to be far too slow (the DVD version is a yawning 141 minutes) and the characters too wooden, especially that of David Morse. Bjork, however, is perfect and perfectly cast; her presence on the screen is the sole redeeming feature. I am no particular fan of her previously released music, although I do like her more commercial songs, but I thought her soundtrack just does not work with the film.I found the choreography sloppy. This feeling of looseness in the dance routines was perhaps desired by Von Trier in his attempt to create a `live event', so he tells us in the DVD Special Feature documentary. His team created the `100 camera technique' whereby the dance numbers were filmed simultaneously by 100 fixed position, digital video cameras and then edited in post-production. This way the film crew could capture a huge amount of material from only one take with 100% guaranteed continuity. It also means that all mistakes are recorded with the increased possibility of them ending up in the final cut, which they inevitably do.I really did not like this film no matter how much I wanted to. It is with regret that, I cannot bring myself to give more than 2/10 and am quite at a loss to understand how it scores so highly here on the IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, what a good movie this could have been. If it had ended earlier, I might have had some shred of respect for it. Unfortunately, it long overstays its welcome and then, at the very worst, drags the viewer through the ridiculously long trial, prison scenes, and horribly contrived ending. The first two musical numbers are pretty interesting, but Lars von Trier apparently gives up after that and decides that the rest don't need to be interesting, just strange. Dear God Lars, at least recognize your gimmick for what it is and make it sing and dance. Instead, by the time we get the absurd dance of the dead cop and the courtroom musical number, the gimmick has been sapped of all artistic value it might have had. And get yourself a Steadicam while you're at it. Film shot by hand is not more artistic, not more real. It is pretentious and often extremely annoying. What is worst about this movie is the incredible potential it had. A nearly blind woman escapes into her fantasies due to her inability to deal with life: sounds like a great premise for a tragic, yet darkly funny plot. Instead we get overused plot twists and scenes that wring themselves dry jerking tears from the kind of viewer who cries at greeting card quotes. Ugh. Sitting through the last half hour is a painful experience for the more stable viewer who doesn't find any great tragedy behind Bjork's puppy dog eyes, only melodrama as bad as any given daytime soap opera. This is not the exquisite, masterful pain elicited by, say, the last third of Hitchcock's "Vertigo", it is the pain of witnessing a poor film play itself out to its silly and contrived end.</fullReview>

Then to make things worse, instead of confronting Bill in front of his wife, she decides to take the money back from him. Why? Because she promised she'd keep his secret of being broke. WAH WAH. Then when she's on trial she says the same thing: She promised she wouldn't tell. WAH WAH WAH. By the time she pulled the trigger, I was thinking, "Give her the chair"! Well it turns out she gets the rope. Too bad it too that long for the movie to come to an end. Those musical numbers got to be too much! 2/10.

Well, first of all, the adorable Bjork makes a moving performance, and she sure as hell should have won an Oscar! I'm sorry, but just because Julia Roberts is America's sweetheart doesn't mean that she should win every award. Everything in this movie is so symbolic. the song the bjork sings at the end gets cut off by her death is because she never watched the end of musicals, because she hated how there was an end put to it, and she liked to think of musicals as never ending. and after she does get hanged, a curtain closes. That's because she was performing in a musical (her life) and the world was her stage. This movie is disturbing, but in a good way. I love this movie, and its one of my favorites, with my others, American Beauty and Being John Malkavich. I can't stop thinking about Dancer in the dark, and I saw it yesterday.

		<fullReview>Dancer in the dark is essentially two movies, the momentary dreamlike musical trances, and the soul-crunching hell of the plot building scenes. The plot is essentially simple- Yeskova is a perfect christ-figure who has everything imaginable happen to her, to the point of death, of course. About halfway through this movie you start being able to predict all the bad things that are going to happen, just imagine what could be the next worse to happen, and what would also prove how good and victimized the main character is. The sad part is that there is no point to all the tear-pulling. The movie has no political or social theme, its just a 2 and a half hour long trip through hell, with momentary stops at musicality. The music scenes are really the only thing worthy in this movie, and are basically the entire point of the movie, the rest is just dressing to justify the pathetic hell we have to watch our main characters endure.Have some time to spare and feel like sitting through hours of depressing pointless s***e? rent this movie</fullReview>

Although I have to admit, the last 10 minutes were gripping and well made, the rest of the film was a mess. The edits were too abrupt, with no transitional scenes at all. Almost all the storylines headed to a dead-end except the one we were suppose to follow, which makes me ask: Why were they in the film at all? Even some of the characters were nothing more than props. Where did the boy disappear too halfway through the movie?This movie was emotionally gripping, but the director did not have enough respect for the audience not to make it subtle and could not developed the character without making her into a martyr.I feel that this film falls too much into the category of "not-a-typical-Hollywood movie" which will bring many people to its defense, but all in all it ends up being just as the films we are suppose to juxtapose it to.It is an interesting experiment worth seeing, but not one for the textbook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed by this film. I read so many enthusiastic reviews in this site that I was expecting a masterpiece. Instead, I found a stagy, crafted product which failed to take me inside the story. The (many) people who were impressed must have been either Bjorg fans (who would have liked the film anyway) or newcomers to cinema. The handheld camera was used by Kubrik ages ago (in A Clockwork Orange, in the scene of the killing of the joga lady). A Belgian film - Rosette - is all built around an handheld camera, but tells a story at the same time more credible and more moving than this one. The sepia colors were first seen (by me at least) in Tarkosky's Stalker, and that must have been twenty years ago (and with a very different artistic sense). Has anybody seen Kieslowsky's A Short Film about Killing (Dekalog 5)? If the answer is yes, than Von Trier's work must look much less original. This film confirms to me that Von Tryer is a turgid, heavy director with a strong technical talent, but who makes up for lack of deep human sensibility with an extremely intellectual language - one which he has often borrowed from others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why discuss the plot of a movie, which is not a movie anyway. Dancer in the Dark is sheer emotion, and the movie can be described in one word: Björk.If you can stand seeing a person being tormented for more than two hours, you might not shed a tear. I was surprised to find that it was true, what Deneuvre had said, that Björk doesn't play Selma. She is Selma.Both Björk and her tormenter von Trier deserves all the credit they can get for showing, there is still new ground to break in cinema.If you want to see a movie, choose something else. If you want art, this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director In The Dark. A wannabe "monumental tragedy" becomes an unintentional comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me make one thing clear - for those of you who missed it: Lars von Trier is the movie world's equivalent of Uli Geller. He is a charlatan who seeks out weak-minded, unstable, gullible minds and exploits them for all they're worth (in dollar value). All of his movies (without exception) are like a con-trick, but such a poorly conceived and unconvincing trick that I cannot for the life of me understand how an adult person with an average intelligence can possible fall for it.If you take this movie seriously you might just be even dumber than Bjork/Selma. And she is a legend in this category.Watching this train-wreck of a movie made me realize how easily mental illness and directorial incompetence gets mistaken for genius these days, especially in Continental Europe, and particularly among film students (who weren't bright enough to study finance, physics, or anything else that requires functioning thought processes).I can certainly see why a director would want to cast someone with so many face-lifts and such obviously fake lips, Catherine Deneuve, for the part of a FACTORY WORKER. Besides, she is the worst French actress of all time, with a range of emotions going all the way from stone-faced to very stone-faced to apathetic to I'm-so-damn-beautiful-so-why-should-I-even-try. As for Bjork, her miscasting overshadows even Deneuve's. Bad actress or not, Deveuve at least does that for a living, Bjork, however, must have thought she was in a cicrcus; all that her clownish acting needed was a couple of trained seals to catch volleyballs with their noses. Watching this hysterical, infantile pop star play this nonsensical character evoked many hysterically funny moments from "Plan 9" and "Battlefield Earth".God only knows why Trier has such a fascination with "pointless martyrdom", because he utilised the same theme in "Breaking The Waves". Selma behaves and reacts like a cross between a dyslexic child, Jesus Christ, a manic-depressive and a psychopath. In other words, the sort of absurd individual that has only ever existed in Trier's rather confused mind. I naively thought that dramas were supposed to have at least a faint connection with the real world...Naturally, in order to justify Bjork's "pointless martyrdom", Trier was forced to come up with mindless/insane characters. He also had to use a plethora of schmaltzy and over-the-top plot-devices that make this movie almost as idiotic as the one I just mentioned - the one in which Emily Watson eked out so many laughs from me. The result is that we end up not with a "monumental tragedy" but an unintentional comedy. And as if all the preposterous characters and illogical decisions they make weren't enough, Trier felt compelled to add an ingredient that seals this movie's fate as one of the most idiotic ever made: musical numbers. They suit this story and setting like a Nobel Peace Price award suits Hitler. Like a baby's socks fit the head of an elephantitis-suffering elephant.The only worthwhile aspects of this mega-t*rd are the soundtrack and Bjork making a total fool of herself. The fact that Cannes's smug, semi-literate jet-set jury gave her an acting award should be a warning to anyone familiar with how all European festivals function: "Wobbly camera, idiotic characters, moronic plot, America-bashing, forced tragedy, bizarre casting, boring dialogue and just all-out stupid in every other way: this must be art".Trier had admitted that he'd never even visited the States, so obviously he's the ideal man to share his expert opinions on that vast and complex land and its people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devastation for the Senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love films like this that are shot in a way that makes the characters the main focus, and not the camera itself. The camera is hidden away, almost voyeuristically looking in on what's going on. I know some will hate this style and the 'hand held' look which for me adds a depth of reality to films like this.First of all, the brass overture at the beginning was simply stunning and sent shivers down my spine, and after the ending I simply had to listen again. Being without sight wouldn't have been a disability at this point, although the art and paintings that accompanied it makes one realise how much we take our senses for granted. We are constantly reminded of this throughout.The film itself is an absolute tragedy, only briefly broken with the colourful and dramatic 'dream' sequences, but then every time we're bumped back to reality with the faded, drably lit setting that the film takes place in. I almost don't think of this film as a musical, as the musical turns aren't in fact 'real', they aren't part of the story and simply Selma's way of escaping her misfortunes.Selma is the very definition of a dreamer, but you always get the feeling that this is due to circumstance rather than a natural trait as all her dreams take place during difficult times. Her main hate of musicals is that they eventually have to end, and because you know the end is coming when the camera lifts out of the roof, which is what is so sad about the ending of the film.After seeing the reactions to 'Dogville', I'm fairly sure that those who aren't fans of Von Trier's work will once again tell me about his 'anti-US' stance of a woman coming to America to heal her son, yet is cruelly and unjustly treated by the American justice system. Yes, it is cruel and unjust, but this is all circumstance. I would ask you to take a look at how he generally portrays the working class people of America in a positive light. The factory boss, the musical director, the prison guard and her landlords all become good friends and are most kind and helpful to her. It is only the actions of one coward that start the downfall her timid personality is incapable of halting.In the end we are faced with an incredibly brave woman facing a dilemma that no-one should have to face, and the ending stunned me just as much as "A short film about killing". The film overall had me mesmerised and it's certainly the best film I've seen so far this year.I want to watch it again but I think it'll be a while before I do</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out as a fantastically compelling portrait into a life, then falls apart into ridiculous actions and reactions. The overly close camera work makes it hard to take in the scenes. The conflicting accents of "America" in this film are confusing.And while some say Bjork is brilliant, I think her character seems borderline retarded. Not in a juvenile way, but like she's playing a 70 IQ character. Which is not the case, from what I gather. But it comes across that way. And her musical numbers don't help here, because the way she sings in English makes her sound "slow."The movie has style, but there is a whole lot of manipulation and little truth. If the director is trying to indict America, as some claim, he does a poor job because he manufacturers his indictments. His conclusions are then drawn from this fiction. It's typical of people who hate but don't know why they hate, so they lash out and make things up and try to get everyone to buy their story. Intellectually empty, and pitched to the intellectual crowd. The court scene (I'm watching it now) is ludicrous. And in my experience, the intellectual crowd eats up this false intellectualism. Which is why this film got such high praise from certain circles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating, sadistic film that nevertheless has an undeniable impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it hard to say how exactly I feel about 'Dancer in the Dark'. I absolutely loved Bjork's performance; she pours her heart and soul into her character and makes you feel involved emotionally with Selma. Being a big fan of her music, I loved her singing in the film, too, although I found the staging and choreography of the musical numbers themselves rather shoddy. The supporting cast are all great as well, the sympathetic prison guard a standout for me.Much has been made of von Trier's camerawork, which is supposed to bring grit and "realness" to the film. I was never impressed with it personally: in my view, all films are ultimately fake and unreal, artificially constructed, so the hand-held camera or insistence on using natural light are ultimately just another techniques and gimmicks. They do end up making the film look very drab and washed-out, which I guess suits the overall depressing feel of it.And what a depressing story it is. Which in itself is not bad; I can think of many powerful works of film or literature with an extremely grim and nihilistic view of life. What disturbed me about "Dancer in the Dark" though is the impression that von Trier seems to savour the drawn-out suffering and destruction of Selma with some sick sadistic relish. The film doesn't even make an attempt to make Selma's tragic story plausible - she suffers purely because the director decided that she should. The courtroom scene in particular has got to be one of the phoniest and most ridiculous I've ever scene in film, with characters behaving in the way that makes no sense whatsoever. In fact the whole story is so melodramatic and in parts implausible that, had it been a mainstream Hollywood film without any "arty" veneer, it would have been sniggered and laughed at.That said, for all that I hated in the film, I can't deny that it definitely got under my skin. Which I guess von Trier wanted in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is a 100% tragedy, and the music doesn't make it merrier. Not only it is too sad, but also lacks basic realism. I mean, who wouldn't pay 2000 bucks for a friend's life? How stupid can a lawyer be, and how stupid the jury can be when they see that bjork, having no motive for the murder, is so confused and lies about everything?If the tragedy was more real, maybe after watching the film we could have atleast come to conclusions about the crueleness of the world, and perhaps even had ideas about changing it. But since the probability of this story becoming a true story is so small, and its a pure luck to meet so many cruel people at once, the film granted me no new insight, exactly what a serious tragedy like this must grant as a payment for the sorrow of watching such a depressing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that I really didnt know what to think of immediately. Usually, that's a good sign, but not in this case.Its certainly different from anything else I've ever seen, and I can appreciate that. Bjork and cast give good performances. The singing and dancing sequences were enjoyable. There are some really powerful scenes that leave the viewer with impressionable emotions that they wont soon forget. However, its those powerful scenes (particularly the ending sequence) that almost make you forget the mediocrity of this film. Almost! I dont know what the budget for this film was, and it was probably the intention of the director and DP to shoot the film in this style. Yet, it really didnt work for me. All too often, I found myself wishing the camera crew would use a tripod, dolly, crane, anything. All the hand held shots are poorly framed. The only sequences that I thought were shot well were the "musical" bits. What I found infinitely worse was the editing. First of all, there are a lot of non continuous jump cuts, similar to some Woody Allen films, which I always feel are more of a cop-out short cut, as opposed to a preferred editing style selection. Second of all, the movie doesnt "flow" well, which is the ultimate goal of editing. Finally, I feel Dancer in the Dark could have been much better. I often ask myself that question when gauging the quality of a film. Despite the aforementioned technical flaws, its a story and concept that could have been transformed into a fine work of art if done a little differently. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't claim to understand this movie. It's plot is simple. The music, while intriguing, is not particularly lyrical. The camera work was choppy, rough at times, and almost annoying at places. The script is unspectacular.So why did it affect me as deeply as it did? I have no idea, but I found myself in tears at the end, sitting stunned as the credits rolled, and the DVD menu came back up. Probably 10 minutes later, I finally stood up. I guess that's the mark of a true work of art. If you give it the chance, let your guard down, and suspend disbelief just a little bit, it owns you and takes control. You sit spellbound as you experience those things that other people just talk about -- real courage and strength, dedication, and love. There is nothing in this movie that reaches out and grabs the viewer, like the mass-produced bullets and bombs action movie. You're forced to meet this film halfway. The script, plot, and characters are painfully simple, and there are character and storyline holes everywhere. I found that there's a little bit of me in every one of the characters. The complexity of the film comes in the way I had to fill in the holes with my personal experience, attitudes, and feelings. At that point, I was a character in the movie. I was experiencing all these things. I had a horrible decision to make, and I paid the price for that decision. (I might note that people who don't like or understand this movie probably fail to make this connection with it.)Bjork's major film is a work to be proud of. I'm disappointed that she did not enjoy the experience (although I could understand how making something of this nature could be a downer.) I think the movie world is missing a great talent without her. Deneuve was given a somewhat shallow role, but she makes the character complex and pure -- definately a difficult feat. The real jewel in this film was Peter Stormare, who follows his career as a seriously under-rated actor with a role and performance that is equally under-rated. Even more than the other characters, his love and pain is pure because he has no vested interest beyond love and devotion. Unspoken conflict is the hardest to portray on film, and he does it to perfection. Watch him closely -- it'll break your heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A drama is usually full of incredible things, but the director has the obligation of convincing me that the story does in fact function. This was not the fact with this film. Why doesn't Björk save her money in a bank? Why doesn't Bill demand a credit (as I have, for example)? Why must Björk hide the fact that the money was for her child's operation? Was the lawyer unable to speak? The fact that Bill had actually no money, would be simple to prove. The film has an aroma of intellectual profundity, but the stressing parts of the film are not better than in Robocop: pure explicit violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devil's Advocate (minor spoilers ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bjork plays one singleminded single mom: She's going to get that operation for her son, no matter what the consequences. And the consequences turn out to be the stuff of which melodrama is made. The director, Lars von Trier, is afflicted with a similar tunnelvision: He's going to make his audiences cry, dammit, and plausibility be damned.This postmodern musical melodrama wants to push your buttons in the manner of such past genre classics as, say, the Garland "A Star Is Born" (and it shares some of that movie's characteristics: wide screen, long running time, intense close-ups of the heroine's humiliation). For me, it fails. Clearly, it succeeds for many: Audience members were loudly weeping throughout. But I have several specific arguments to pick:1) Plausibility. What's Catherine Deneuve doing in 1960s rural America, running a factory machine? What kind of disease is this that must be addressed on a specific birthday? Why is the David Morse character too cowardly to pull the trigger but brave enough to plead with someone else to? Why would the boyfriend, believing he's abetting a murderer, let Selma wander off for an indeterminate time and not question her activities? Why would there be no fund-raising effort for Selma in prison? Any one of these points I could accept. But taken together, they're just implausible. Obviously von Trier is aiming at allegory, and we're not meant to take this story literally, but his contrivances are so large that it's hard to accept the movie even on those terms.2) Technique. The hand-held camera seems unrelated to the material. The director isn't being verite, and he isn't trying to approximate the protagonist's visual problems. So it comes off as a stunt, and a nausea-inducing one at that.3) Bjork. I know many people, including those at Cannes, were bowled over by her performance. It's a great, emotional part, and she hits many right notes, but she also falls back on repeated mannerisms -- enigmatic grins, meaningless fidgets.4) The score. The overture/closing song aside, the music is unmelodic and the lyrics borderline doggerel. The text problems extend to the screenplay, which is unrelentingly prosaic.5) Cheap shots. "The Sound of Music" is such obvious shorthand for audiences indulging in sugarcoated fantasies. I thought von Trier was crossing the line.OK -- eventually, the film gets to you. The last 30 minutes or so are incredibly intense and ultimately moving. But I don't think the director is playing fair.</fullReview>

Bjork was phenomenal and Catherine Deneuve is better than ever. I guess what really bugged me was the cinematography. I understand that Lars von Triers wanted you to feel as if you were in the movie, but it was so jumpy and the close-ups were annoying and overdone. To add that much to an already highly emotional movie is just a bit over the top. Not being too much of a Bjork fan (what got into her head as she picked out her dress for the Oscars?Her swan laid an egg in my opinion), i was truly impressed, by both her acting and music. "I've Seen It All" is a truly beautiful and haunting song: it should have won for best song (as much as I liked Bob Dylan's "Things Have Changed).The ending was quite disturbing, I have to say and I actually had tears in my eyes. You care about the characters throughout the movie. They seem like real people, not charicatures from a Hollywood movie. In saying this, Lars von Triers impressed me. He had the guts to make an ambitious movie like this and, although he didn't make it work all the time, it was a great movie. But i did loathe parts of this movie. I also wouldn't watch it if you are prone to motion sickness: it will make you nauseate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The directing, musical numbers and Bjork are all astounding. The screenplay is what is so abysmal. Lars Von Trier makes the world work the way he wants it to work in order to make his audience cry. Nothing about this film is remotely believable. I can't go into detail about the absurdities of this film without spoiling it. I can only say that I'm sure that if Lars Von Trier were hired to make a documentary on global warming any way he wanted, it would star some saintly, innocent woman who works in a CO2 producing factory owned by some desperate man who has the innocent factory worker arrested because her volunteer work with Greenpeace might threaten the factory owner's income and therefore ruin his ability to buy his wife a Range Rover. We would all cry of course, but we would learn nothing about either human nature or global warming.Mr. Van Houten's criticism below is the best comment I've seen yet here on this film. I agree with him on nearly every point he makes. My advice is go see this movie for its awesome visuals, acting and very good musical numbers and then leave the theater during the courtroom scene. After that scene the film becomes so ridiculous I started laughing while sitting in the theater.Go rent Breaking the Waves instead (and Von Trier's other great films like Zentropa and The Kingdom). Those are truly great films. Judging from Dancer in the Dark, I would guess that Lars Von Trier is becoming about as desperate as a cop with a high mortgage payment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A DISHONEST AND MANIPULATORY MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Dancer in the Dark" Lars von Trier confirms his tendency to cheat the audience by involving it in a cruel game. In this case the game consists in doing everything to make the viewer identify him/herself in Selma's character; so He shows her as the most harmless, excessively generous and implausibly na?ve person in the world: a sort of a child-woman who hides her money in a cookies-box, someone which is impossible not to have sympathy for. Then He subjects Selma to a contrived series of physical and psychological tortures which, because of the identification process between character and viewer, is inflicted to the audience too. This way the director achieves his only aim: have the viewers crying after taking them on the verge of a nervous breakdown. One of the negative notes of this movie is the balance of characters: after "Breaking the Waves" Lars von Trier has been accused of misogyny and knowing that also The Dancer could be liable of the same remark, because of the very similar childish, tormented female main character, He surrounded Selma with a series of male characters who are almost all nasty and negative and He interspersed the script, especially toward the finale, with a lot of references to sorority and female bonding. For these reasons I invite IMDb commentators who claimed this film as a masterpiece to reconsider their judgment and think about it with more detachment: in fact the director's seemingly succeeded attempt was to talk only to viewer's heart cutting out the brain. Finally two requests: don't take The Dancer as film against death penalty and the American way of life because those issues here are merely functional to the heroine's martyrdom; but above all don't ever compare Lars von Trier to C.T. Dreyer: They don't have anything in common but the fact that They're both Danes and The Dancer resembles more to Arthur Hiller's "Love Story" than to "The Passion of Joan of Arc". I give it 6/10 just for its technical merits and the indubitable effectiveness.</fullReview>

She saves every penny she gets in her job, to pay an eye surgery for her son, Gene. Both Selma and Gene suffers from the same disease, and Selma is becoming more blind everyday; that's why she wants Gene to have the surgery so bad: He must not have the same fate she had.I think that is very beautiful to see Selma making so many sacrifices for the love she has for her son. She thinks is better to die in a not fair way, then let her son without the operation. Bjork's screams when she is going to be hanged are very real too.Ps: The character Bill, who pretends to be Selma's friend is a monster, as well as his wife.Ps2: Do people still hang someone who has death sentence?

		<fullReview>This film was the first I saw from Lars von Trier. I think anyone can agree that he's a unique director- there's none other like him.This film has serious flaws, though; plenty of the songs, as I could remember, were unmemorable. As someone who has been raised on musicals, I found this somewhat disappointing. The shaky camera-work is enough to make one seasick. (I understand Lars von Trier likes hand-held, but this is ridiculous! (fortunately, that NEVER happens in his next film, "Dogville", which is nearly flawless and VERY well-done))However, the last 20 minutes, there's one thing I realized- nothing I considered negative in the previous two hours mattered. Just these golden last 20 minutes alone, everything changes. Bjork put her heart out into this performance, and it shows... perhaps a little too well. For only the second time, I cried during a movie. (the other one was "Grave of the Fireflies") Truly powerful stuff.Perhaps I should have watched my other rental ("The Truman Show") afterward, instead of before.I haven't tried watching "The Sound of Music" (what I have considered to be possibly the happiest film of all time) after I had seen this; for some reason, I think I'd be bawling during "My Favorite Things".My rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic mismatch of style and content</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It hurts to give this movie such a low rating (5 out of 10) in some ways because it does have some things going for it--the performances of Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, Joel Grey, Peter Stormare, and some lovely songs, as well. Most of all, Bjork is enchanting. She has an undeniably powerful screen presence and her participation in the proceedings tempts one to overlook the movies manifold problems... ...but not so fast. I must say that writer/director Lars von Trier's choice to shoot a musical in his grainy, home-video-like style (which worked well in "Breaking The Waves", it actually deepened that viewing experience) simply doesn't work. It's a cinematic contradiction: a documentary feel for something that is staged and choreographed. Watching it, both sides of your brain never come together for a viewing experience that lets you suspend disbelief for very long.Furthermore, why aren't women a little outraged at this filmmaker? I'm a guy, and watching this and "Breaking The Waves", I want to say to everyone who proclaims his brilliance, "Wake up! He's hiding chauvinism behind art." Case in point: the main characters of both those films are innocents who are helpless and childlike. Both Bjork and Emily Watson redeem his decision somewhat, but his intentions seem too fuzzy. It isn't that every female character has to be like Queen Elizabeth I or Oprah Winfrey, but must you keep on focusing on ones who are so weak and zero in on them with such strange fascination?I might not even gripe so much, but in addition to its other sins, this movie's way too long. It drags. And drags. And drags. I could feel my impatience with its arty pretentiousness compounding with every unnecessary minute (they number way into double digits). Call it a classic or a brilliant work of art if you must, I just call it a movie that tries too hard and lands smack on its face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes a decent movie is shrouded with a terrible stigma...that of being incredibly boring...this is one of those movies. You have to LOVE Bjork to enjoy the song and dance numbers, but the whiny voice got to me. Ultimately, the movie moves slow and is fairly predictable...very little to warrant appreciation...despite any critical acclaim...what do critics know anyway...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most overrated film on IMDb - Terrible in all regards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, it's a musical. I don't like musicals for the most part. There are some exceptions . I figured that given I don't mind Bjork, it could be good. But even putting that aside, there was nothing about this film I enjoyed, and almost every aspect of it I hated.Pretty much everything about it is terrible. The musicals are random and garbage, the music and singing are painful. The acting is poor. The plot was just ridiculous. If the protagonist wasn't continually making the worst decision possible at every opportunity she wouldn't have ended up in with her life threatened. Even when it has all gone horribly wrong, she only has to say one single sentence "i'm going blind" and the situation will become undone. But she's stubborn, or stupid and we're supposed to feel bad for her. All I could think through most of the film was that it'd be a very good thing if they hurried up and put her and me out of our misery and killed her already.So basically it was the opposite of entertainment. It was a dry poorly constructed artistic waste of film. I think the high rating is a result of people who watched it and felt that it was great because it steered clear of the usual things like having a plot, characters one can relate to or at least empathise with, or those films that choose to employ people who can act. Ignoring such these things and trying poorly to sadden the audience must make it a groundbreaking film (I honestly don't know).The worst film I have ever seen that people have advised me is quality. Avoid if at all possible. One of few films I've experienced where many people got up part way through and chose not to return.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A manipulative, totally false film..contrived in the worst way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am shocked that this film has been so highly praised. Over and above the filmmaking style (which seems to be deliberately `in your face' and begging to draw attention to itself), this film asks the audience to accept, over and over again, situations and actions that are just not believable. It is a great tribute to the actors (including non-actor Bjork) who deliver wonderful performances, that they can act in situations that are so totally false on every level. Without going into the many, many falsehoods on which this film builds its narrative, I will mention just one. The core of the plot is a medical condition which is inherited and can be treated by an operation(?) that needs to be performed within a particular 2-week period of a person's life. Is there anything even remotely like this in medicine? But worse are the numerous actions of the characters that just defy any honest human behavior. It is a greater tragedy that this film so manipulates the audience with such fine performances. Filmmaking like this should be a crime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly let me say, I have a very open taste in films. I love, small, arty, independent films, which is why I was expecting to like this. But no, this is the only film I have ever been tempted to walk out of. I tried to like it, I really did. But no matter what angle I thought of, it still seemed terrible. It's not the acting that put me off, because this was quite good. Bjork was natural and believable. As too were the supporting cast. It's more the whole concept that I had trouble with. Grainy, bleak music free cinematography, mixed with a harrowing, emotion tugging story line, interspersed with jolly 1950's musical skits? The pain of seeing good actors sing badly was more than I could take. The first hour or so (it seemed like 5) dragged like a lead boot. I kept thinking "any second now, a song will kick in", but it didn't. When the songs did eventually arrive, they seemed so far out of place, as to destroy any empathy you'd built up for the charaters. Even though Bjorks character was mousey and quiet and did nothing in particular for the whole film, she still managed to gain the total trust of people she'd only just met. It just seemed all to contrived, as though it was trying to be thoughtful and arty. There are a thousand small independent films that are a thousand times better than this piece of tripe, that will never get the recognition of this film. That has to be the biggest tragedy of all. Avoid at all costs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember the last time I saw a more inept movie. I am amazed I sat through it. It was absolutely preposterous. It looked like it was set at some time in the 50s. The protagonist, a borderline retarded immigrant who is going blind from an unnamed hereditary disease, has been cast as the lead in a community theatre production of The Sound of Music even though she is absolutely talentless as an actress, singer or dancer. She also works a full time job, does freelance work and cares for a son who has the same disease she has. She has fantasies in which her life becomes a series of anachronistic MTV videos. She ends up committing a brutal murder and being hanged by the state while her old friends watch in a kind of little theatre in which they get to witness the snapping of her spinal cord. (To paraphrase one character: "Well, she said Communism was good, so she probably deserved it.") Comic book dialogue combined with graphic violence, some inane song lyrics, some lively MTV dancing make for an uneasy mix. I found Bjork a very unattractive performer. I was sorry to see Catherine Deneuve and the great Swedish actor Peter Stormare in stupid roles in this stupid film. (This is the second worst film I've seen this year. I did at least sit through it. I fled Love's Labour's Lost after 45 minutes.) By the way, The Sound of Music opened on Broadway in November of 1959. Amateur rights were not released until several years later. It did not become an icon of mainstream culture until after the release of the 1965 film version.</fullReview>

This movie somehow defies the laws of time and space, because despite a running time of 140 minutes, it felt like it lasted about 5 hours.SPOILER ALERT***************** When Bjork's character was finally hung at the end, our audience actually cheered and applauded, because they knew it was finally over.

		<fullReview>A rose is a rose and fertilizer is fertilizer.If someone threw fertilizer on a canvas and swiped it around masterfully with a 6" house painters brush it might be called art but it would still stink. Artistic style is not style unless it endures the test of time. This film will fade along with all the forgotten efforts that are merely fashionable for their time. Deviation for deviations sake does not constitute style and that is where I place Von Trier's work on Dancer in the Dark. Contrary to many opinions, there is absolutely nothing honest or realistic about this film. The so-called stylistic camera work is simply amateurish at best. The acclaimed voyeur sound and lighting is actually muddy and cliche. The acting is particularly bad considering the wealth of talent that was employed. I must attribute this to poor scripting and a blatant lack of direction. I've seen better acting and direction in a B grade 1950's science fiction movie. The surrealism invoked by the musical daydreams is so ridiculous and misplaced that I'm sure if any of the forefathers of surrealism were alive, they would sue. The story line is completely without merit. There is no redeeming quality in the main character as many are led to believe. The sacrifice that is alluded to is no sacrifice at all. It is merely a blatant act of stupidity followed by a complete abandonment of friends and legal prowess. Unbelievable in every sense of any investigation or legal defense for a murder case. How could any truly loving parent get talked into such a path of destruction and perform such an idiotic act is beyond me. Viewers that are blinded by the directors manipulation of the emotions should step back and consider the child. Ok, he can see now; does that replace the need for a caring and nurturing parent. I hardly think so.The end sequence is paralyzingly rank. The only compassion I could muster was for the institutions employees because they had to live with themselves after it was all over. That is truly pathetic.Basically, the only redeeming footage in the whole film is the 2 minutes of fabulous dancing by Joel Grey, too bad it didn't last the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes; I would have felt far more satisfied.John H.

		<fullReview>Dancer In The Dark is easily one of the worst films I have ever sat through in my entire life. I almost turned off the DVD player at least 4 or 5 times during the film, and in retrospect, I wish I would have. The story was so implausible, that it was impossible for me to have any feelings towards it's central character, played by Bjork, who I found to be somewhat capable at times, and at others totally ridiculous. I found the improvisational acting throughout the film to be very painful to watch most of the time and although I am a fan of Catherine Deneuve, her performance here is mediocre at best. I have to presume that the director intended the story to be as unbelievable as it was for a reason, but I fail to see what that reason is. I guess it is because traditionally, musicals have always been a bit lacking in the plot department, but I don't think this is a justifiable reason for this film. I applaud the director for his adventurousness in making this film, but ultimately, I think it is a dismal failure.</fullReview>

I hate being manipulated, especially concerning my feelings, and that was what Lars Von Triers intended to do. No one in the world is so unlucky as Selma. She's slightly dumb, naive, poor, and almost blind. She raises her child alone. She works in a dangerous factory. She's betrayed. I think Lars Von Triers should have made her crippled too! Anyway, the worst comes in the end. A one hour long agony. Great.

		<fullReview>Well, I'm not an especially big fan of the work of Lars Von Trier, and i had actually never listened to Bjork's music at all before this movie. Lars von Trier has just never impressed me as a filmmaker. I've always admired the visuals in his movie, like the opening of Melancholia and Antichrist, but none of the movies I had seen from him seemed to be anything special. Until I saw this movie. Now, I'm still not a Von Trier fanboy, but, goodness, I love this movie. It definitely is not for everyone. The style of the movie may be hard for some people to look past, and, admittedly, it was hard for me to digest for the first half-hour or so. But, after the first song "Cvalda", I was completely sold on this movie. I didn't even notice the grainy style of the old digital camera. It's a movie that is definitely more subtle than other Von Trier films. Now, it's not incredibly subtle, but there are some things I noticed the second time around that I didn't catch the first time. For example, during the song sequences, the colors are actually brighter and more vibrant, but it's almost invisible in a first viewing. At least, it was to me. I was raised on musicals, and this one does hold up in its own quirky way. The music is Bjork, and if you are familiar with her, then you will know what to expect. I didn't, and to hear music like this kind of took me aback. However, most of the singing is very good, and this movie completely sold me on Bjork's singing abilities, and I'm glad I was introduced to her through this movie. And, it is a very emotional movie. When it was over, me and my uncle (with whom I watched it with) just sat there in complete silence. Needless to say, the story and music and ending added up to make a fantastic movie. It was so impressive to me, that the very next day, I watched it again. The style is still somewhat odd to me, but it's grown on me. Not for everyone, but if want something that's experimental or emotional or both, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A devastating film of innocence in the face of tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many films from Lars von Trier have a tendency to be harrowing to watch, women who go through various kinds of pain and suffering until they find themselves reaching blissful martyrdom and "Dancer in the Dark" is a film which acts according to such an archetype except with music and a theme which appears to be a social commentary on America. Bjork delivers a tour de force as Selma, a factory worker saving money for her son's operation as she's going blind and she knows the same will happen with her child unless he's treated. She sings, dances and breaks your heart as a woman whose stubbornness and unwavering innocence in the face of tragedy never stumbles. Catherine Deneuve offers solid support as her friend, Cathy. An exquisite cinematography from Robby Muller switching from a yellow- tinted, grainy footage to a more colorful one whenever it suits the mood (like in the unforgettable sequence where Selma performs "I've Seen in All"). Overall, a film worth seeing where one sings as the tears threatens to break. Lars von Trier doesn't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film fades from black and opens like eyesight coming into focus for the first time. As fine art continues to fade in and out, a motif evocative of bursted capillaries takes over. This is Dancer in the Dark, a film by Lars Von Trier about Selma, a foreign immigrant woman in 1960s Washington State who loves movie musicals but is slowly going blind. The film is a musical itself, but a very unconventional one. It's not the glamorous romp that Selma sees on the big screen. Instead, it's a rough around the edges look at escapism and perceived Americana that showcases the contrast of how we use sight, sound and imagination to get through our everyday lives.Most of the movie looks more like a documentary, very much like real life. It's so unpolished that it seems like improv, like everything is being made up on the fly or that the camera is just capturing these real, personal events. Of course as the story continues you know that everything is indeed planned and once you get to the first musical number, which doesn't happen until nearly 40 minutes in, everything is actually specifically choreographed. While these real life moments were filmed with what seems to be a single hand-held camera, the musical moments become dreamlike and are shot with over 100 digital cameras placed around the location to catch every move from every angle. This footage was then edited to give a sense of stability within Selma's mind, standing out from her otherwise rocky life. It's quite ingenious.The cast is filled with actors' actors that each bring truth to their characters no matter how big or small the role is. Veteran actress Catherine Denueve is abrasive but supportive as Selma's friend and coworker, Peter Stormare is sympathetic as a man after Selma's affection and David Morse really pushes the film to new points as Selma's neighbor and landlord. Cara Seymour, Siobhan Fallon, Udo Kier, Stellan Skarsg?rd, Vladica Kostic and Joel Grey are all also in smaller roles, though still as equally important to the film. Icelandic singer Björk, who has a limited experience with acting, stars as Selma herself and brings veracity, sincerity and an incredibly raw experience to the character.Selma struggles between being a woman of her word, holding her ground and simultaneously feeling helpless. She's dealing with her own personal burdens, being a single mother trying to give her son a future he can see, and the burdens given to her by others, being a friend in a position where she doesn't have much of a choice to make. Many might question why Selma doesn't take the easy road through her situation, but that's just the point. She is so innocent and her moral convictions are so strong that she never even feels the need to. It might seem like an unrealistic decision to make, but it's only as unrealistic as any other movie musical, just in the opposite direction.Dancer in the Dark completes Von Trier's Golden Hearts Trilogy of films in which the heroine remains naive despite her experiences. It should also be noted that the Danish director's view of vintage America is a view from afar as the director has very rarely if ever even been to America and the film was shot in Denmark. The portrayal here of small town American living and the American justice system are skewed and exaggerated, a bit simple but still unsurprising. It's a heartbreaking and unsettling film that you will assuredly not clap for at the end, as you might a usual musical, despite whether you appreciate it or not.</fullReview>

You have to be in the right mood to enjoy this film. A mood where you don't mind having your gut twisted by scenes of incredible sadness.This is yet another "Dogma '95" film from Danish director Lars von Trier ("Breaking the Waves" &amp; "The Idiots"). He seems to be the only proponent of this minimalist creed of filmmaking that is able to make it work. The story, set in a small town in the '60s, concerns an immigrant woman who is going blind. She will do anything to earn enough money for the operation that will save her son from the same fate. Her only joy in life is a love of musicals. With a local acting group she is practicing to star in "The Sound of Music", but it is her vivid imagination that gives her the most pleasure ... and gets her into the most trouble. As this painful tale progresses from one seemingly inevitable step to the next, both the main character and the audience are sucked into an emotional whirlpool from which there is no escape. Don't see this film unless you are secure enough in your own emotions to withstand the shock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but could be better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier's "Dancer In The Dark" is set in an isolated working class milieu, where we follow Selma (Björk), a Czech immigrant who's eye sight gradually deteriorates throughout the film. In the first 20 minutes, we instantly understand our protagonist's primary interests and ambitions: Gene (her son) and music. These two things carry her forthwith throughout the film, music especially, even when the odds gradually go against her. Dancer In The Dark is a story of betrayal and injustice, themes that were explored in Trier's previous film "Breaking The Waves". Selma's viscera manifests in her determination to sacrifice for what she loves, namely her son, so much show that she was willing to sacrifice her own life to ensure that the congenital eye disease that will inevitably effect her son will be cured with the money she saved. Despite the atrocities our protagonist witnesses, she maintains a sense of elation through her affinity with music. Riddled throughout the film are elaborate dance scenes which play out like musical dance numbers. Unfortunately, the songs aren't great and are tedious. They abruptly get in the way of the scenes that are taking place. The dance numbers and songs end up being the film's weakest point, excluding the song before 107 steps (which unfortunately is not on the official soundtrack for the film), in which our protagonists finds peace in singing to the sound of hymns coming from a church. This scene, aside from the last scene, is possibly the most powerful scene in the entire film. The jerky camera that is experienced for a great deal of the film is kept extremely still, and the audience is allowed to see our protagonist's emotional ascent from sorrow to euphoria. I can't say this for all the songs unfortunately. Like my aforesaid remarks, they are tedious and feel like left overs from Björk's debut record. Despite my gripes with the song, they do serve another purpose other than just killing time. As the atrocities of the film only worsen, the audience, like Selma, are just longing for the next musical dance number to appear to escape from the trauma, and thus these songs are effectively used as a comforting tool to distract the audience from remembering that even more atrocities await. This applies to Björk's character as well--a mere distraction. While acknowledging this, these songs last way too long and aren't enjoyable enough to justify their length. Speaking of the camera, the cinematography is consistently good despite the camera that jerks around on more than one occasion. It's not as bad as a Michael Bay film, however the awkward editing (which is most likely an artistic decision on Von Trier's part) becomes distracting at points. All the performances are generally well done, namely Björk's and Catherine Deneuve's. However, these actors don't shine until the latter half of the film. In the first 20 minutes, the jagged editing are especially present and Björk scolding Gene was especially laughable, however this is redeemed by her fantastic performance for the last 40-50 minutes or so. The final scene is a grotesque and agonizing scene, as the audience suffers as much as our protagonist. We see our beloved protagonist struggle for survival, find peace, and then meet their inevitable doom. This film may not live up to Von Trier's other masterpieces (Riget/Kingdom, Breaking The Waves, and Europa come to mind.) However, this film remains as a powerful naturalistic drama. This film isn't hard to like, alas it is hard to love.Rating: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Musical Like No Other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My heart broke into three hundred different pieces while my mind was watching in awe. This is exactly how I felt after I finished Dancer in the Dark (2000).I can most definitely assure you that the twisted mind of Mr. Lars von Trier has no boundaries when it comes to cinematic genius. Written and Directed by von Trier himself, the film creates a genre of its own playing with both musical and drama along the way. I remember once reading an article somewhere on von Trier and how he expressed his desire to experiment with all the cinematic genres that ever existed... and, oh boy, he is doing it, and he is doing it in his own way. Breaking the Waves (1996) is an unconventional romance that taps on theology. Antichrist (2009) is horror manifested in psychological gore. Melancholia (2011) is a very narcissistic end-of-the-world sci-fi. Nymphomaniac (2013) is porn! There is no wonder then when he tries his hand at musicals.What I am getting at is that watching a von Trier film is similar to eating pickles dipped in ice cream, the only difference is that von Trier's dish actually tastes sublime. He knows how to convince you that pickles are not that salty and ice cream is not that sweet. You realize the discrepancy and the cruel irony only after you have eaten and enjoyed the meal. Proof? Try watching Dancer in The Dark a second time and compare it to any mainstream musical. What you will find is the most basic musical instruments, the dancing that does not even sync with the music, the abrupt shifts, the crude editing, the self-referential camera angles, and exaggerated sentimentality. Funny thing is that despite everything, you still enjoy the story and empathize with the characters wholeheartedly. The canny Dane not only experiments with the genre, he actually destroys it.. mocks it, and in the process, he mocks us as well.Although the film cannot be called a Dogme film, it certainly owes a lot of its stylistic choices to the Dogme rules, which does not strike me as a surprise since the late 1990s was high time for Dogme productions. Personally speaking, there are a lot of things I admire about Dogme films, one of them is the almost always brilliant casting. The cast of Dancer in the Dark seems to be from everywhere around the globe... Icelandic, Danish, French, American, English, German... etc. However, they fit in together harmoniously and not a single actor seems out of place. Despite the hostile tension between her and von Trier during filming, Bjork's performance turns to be a real knockout. I don't know whether she was perfect for the role or vice versa, all I can imagine is von Trier thinking of Bjork and then tailor-writing the role for her. No one, I really mean NO ONE, could have played the helpless blind Selma Jezkova as Bjork did.You might have noticed that I did not give a synopsis of the story. With von Trier's I would rather not to. Just be prepared to watch a musical like no other.. a musical where crimes are committed, innocence is murdered and dreams are crushed.Enjoy it. Break your heart. Then laugh at yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bjork in the Dark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark (2000): Dir: Lars Von Triers / Cast: Bjork, David Morse, Catherine Deneuve, Peter Stormare, Joel Grey: Disturbing yet brilliant film about endurance through tragedy or one's venture into uncertainty. Ultimately it deals with a woman threatened with blindness but her love for Hollywood musicals keeps her going. Pop diva Bjork stars as a single mother who works at a press factory and she has been stashing money away for an operation to prevent her from losing his sight. Her landlord is a cop who is having financial difficulties and steals her money. She confronts him but he forces her to kill him thus leading to a disturbing battle in court. Hardly pleasant but director Lars Von Triers brilliantly uses musicals to express emotion. Bjork delivers a powerful performance full of emotion as she goes through unfortunate lengths for the good of her son. David Morse is excellent as her landlord whose financial greed leads to his only real regard. Catherine Deneuve plays Bjork's friend from the factory who races to ensure that Bjork receives positive news with regards to her son's operation. Peter Stormare is another friend who supports her in this dire state. Joel Grey also appears, which is a staple for musicals, and seems to support what Bjork represents in her passion for musicals. Theme regards injustice and freedom as her mind takes flight in the joyous presence of song. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Björk is not a popular actress unlike her Singing career. This is something that she proves she is way better than many experienced mainstream movie celebrities.This is one of the best movie of its kind. Björk's distinctive personality adds value to this movie. The ultimate sacrifice, prejudice and struggle for happiness have been successfully composed throughout the story. For most of us there are many ways to find similar connections in today's society. Definitely recommended for all. I have when it was premiering. Since then its one of the top movie recommendation to my family and friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saddest movie i've ever seen. I almost never cry in films, but this one made me feel so.. empty. I connected with Björk's character and i empathized as never before. Their songs are so wonderful and perfect to the film, comparing her na?ve and romantic personality, to the sad, cruel and sorrowful reality. The contrast is so intense... The last scene is so damn sad. There wasn't necessary to sacrifice the most heartbreaking and beautiful character i've ever seen, this shows there's no limit to the love of a mother. I seriously don't have enough words to describe how this film made me feel, it's not easy found a masterpiece like this, instead of a lot of FX, explosions and butts who their only objective is selling, this movie is... pure emotions.

		<shortDescription>The Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dancer in the Dark" is one of those movies that everyone talks good about, and you can understand why from the get go. This happens due to the humanist situations that characters get into, like having to pay the rent with all the salary that one receives. The film as a whole is extremely moving, mainly because of the main character; Selma is beautiful, innocent, honest, poor and generous, so the spectator may feel VERY sorry for her. Also, even thought she faces a thousand of problems, she always sees life with optimism, singing and dancing. It's admirable how much she enjoys her rehearsals and art aspects. The only thing that slightly bothered me was the occasional strange directing/editing, which delivered some visible changes of takes. Other than that, "Dancer in the Dark" is a marvelous work that deserves every recognition is has, and I feel mad for not seeing it before. Extremely recommended, and here's my big congratulations to everyone involved in this project!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a musical, nothing dreadful ever happens?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In a musical, nothing dreadful ever happens". These are words spoken in Dancer in the Dark which have ironic significance as this is a musical filled with dreadfulness in its unfolding tragedy and subverts musical traditions for sinister meanings.Set in 1960s America, Selma is an Czech immigrant who came to America to benefit her son Gene. Working tirelessly in the local factory and hiding knowledge of an hereditary degenerative disease of blindness, Selma saves her money hoping to get Gene an operation to prevent him suffering the same fate. However Bill, Selma's landlord in desperate need for money to repay his bank taking advantage of Selma's vulnerability by stealing her money leading to an inevitable decline. This synopsis makes Dancer in the Dark sound like a standard drama. However this is a Lars Von Trier film, anyone aware of his filmmaking will know his unconventional style. Instead of standard drama Dancer in the Dark contains an awkwardness which at first is hard to distinguish if it's deliberate. Selma is represented as a childish character whose mannerisms (waving at a train as it goes by) and her obsession with Hollywood musicals made it hard to believe she is a responsible Mother. This also applies to performances, there is a constant sense of otherness as if you're witnessing an amateur production. Not to say the performances were inadequate but the direction involved along with hand-held cinematography's intense movements and frequent cuts orchestrated the narrative into a series of awkward scenes contributing to an unsettling environment. At least at first.Once Dancer in the Dark's turning point is reached its awkwardness reaches potential and the unsettling environment begins to make sense. Selma's childishness intensifies into her musical daydreams. Dancer in the Dark used musicals numbers not to show expressions of joyous optimism but Selma's denial of grim reality. The musical numbers thus contain an unconventionality, they were not vibrant and glamorous but unskilful and bizarre. Each musical numbers' composition lacked structure, for example on a slow moving train Selma dances with workers on an open carriage followed by a couple dancing outside a near-by house. This unstructured style reveals Selma's wild imagination briefly rejecting her dreadful reality. It was Selma's childish fantasy to be a musical star yet Dancer in the Dark conveys this as simply an unrealistic obsession. It gives Dancer in the Dark's musical numbers a subversive context which is creatively intelligent as the musical numbers' abnormality showed Selma's delusional mental state. Dancer in the Dark though at first will take time to become accustomed to, it transforms into an exceptionally creative film which is brilliant in its unconventionality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bjork in Dancer in the Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Bjork song that made me cry was "Mutual Core" from her 2011 album Biophilia. I wasn't familiar with her until a few years ago. The oddities I found in her music swept me into a strange state while the sudden power of her voice in the high range shattered all barriers that could have made the oddities relevant. She is unlike anything I've heard before.Bjork's character, Selma Jezkova, works in a factory and lives with her young son. She is slowly going blind and she tries very hard to hide it until the inevitable blindness takes hold. She is obsessed with musicals and loves to sing and dance.Someone very close to me always talks about how they live from event to event; looking forward to the next big thing helps them get through the boring nothingness of the day-to-day. These "events" can be things as simple as going out to dinner with friends, or a birthday party, or a vacation. If the event is a month or two, or even several months away, they still seem to be able to use that as a tool for escaping and speeding through the days in between. This strikes me as a little tragic. This method of speeding through life, and the more you build up the excitement for this upcoming event, the more crushing it feels when the night draws to a close and you must go back to work the next day. Selma Jezkova would reject this mindset in a heart beat, I think. Despite Selma's being deprived of the colloquial "windows to the soul," the viewer can still see the aura of positivity, energy, and strength throughout the character's fight. Without her eyesight, she is hyper-sensitive to sound, but what's evocative to me is that she is even more sensitive to the lack of sound, to silence. In these moments, she takes advantage of the creative light inside her to transform her own reality, turning her increasingly challenging factory work into a stage for a big song and dance number. This happens at work, at the moment when the single potential love interest in her life Jeff, (Peter Stormare), discovers her blindness, and in a few more, much darker occurrences later on.To be conscious of life's rhythms, to learn to make music where there seems to be only darkness, these are just a few of the themes I personally took away from this film. One of the most poignant lines in the movie include when Selma talks about how she used to "cheat" the ending of a musical by leaving right after the second to last number. This way the musical never ends. I thought about being in a crowded lot for a show and my husband urging us to leave right before the last song to miss the crowds. I was really against the idea. In my mind we'd paid money to see the whole show, why would we skip what could potentially be the best part? To me, it was a way of cutting through the natural progression of an ending in order to try and escape from the pain of an ending that comes without your permission, or despite anything you would do to stop it from happening. Even through the course of her tragic crime towards the end of the film, Selma gets through by transforming her world into that of a musical, where loose ends tie up neatly and everything makes sense, where all is forgiven and forgotten. But this method of trying desperately to maintain her strength eventually comes crashing down, as though all of those endings she'd cheated in her life have come back to get her all at once. Bjork's performance throughout the ending of the film had me balling my eyes out. Her character was created and portrayed so solidly that every ounce of my being as a viewer struggled through those last scenes, waiting for a miracle.But then something happened that is just as incredible as if she'd been rescued by an angel in a chariot from heaven. In her last moments, Selma begins singing, fleeing the scene of her execution in a sense, her death interrupting her mid-song. The text at the end of the film exposes the words that were cut off: "They say it's the last song. They don't know us, you see. It's only the last song if we let it be." The morbid image of a curtain falling across the point where Selma left this world, like the ending of a musical, provokes the very silence which Selma had been so frightened of just a few minutes before, while a silent, motionless few in the audience stare, as if rapt in the memory of what they'd just been witness to. I wonder, where is the line that separates "mind over matter" and escapism? At what point does thinking positively towards a goal slip into disconnect between thought and action? I think that Selma's character demonstrates the strength of a spirit so passionate that it can't lie down and die quietly, even when every possibility of escape is closed off. I think that at the point where all hope is lost for her body, Selma is pushed to free her mind, elevating it above the body in that instant to escape the fear of death. Her body has failed her, first in losing her eyesight, and then in the panicked moments that push her into murder. She ultimately rejects the body and preserves to the very end the joy in her heart and mind, like an ember that slowly succumbs to the darkness. http://funkyforestfirstcontact.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this kind of movie. I cried when i watched this, don't know why, just because of the plot of the film. It feels awkward to attempt put Dancer in the dark into words. Von Trier is this film's director who change the way to show. This film is around Selma, a factory worker, who loves her 10 years old son. And she is a happy, innocent creature who enjoys musicals. but she is rapidly losing her eye sight,then she dances in the dark.The sadness is that this story can't have a happy ending. In this the biggest star still the director himself. He useS the simple story to let us feel the feeling when you heart break,and examining the ever-persistent ills of the life of the lower class of the American society. But he lets us understand the very essence of the whole genre- hope that will live in our soul for ever if we'll only follow our heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark is a great piece of cinema. However. the story itself it's not that smart and is very heavy handed, with a perhaps harsh critic upon the musicals and to the 'americanism' sold in them, in a always happy way to see the life. You can see in the spoof and purposely bad choreographed musical sequences.It's stylized cinematography it is filmed on low-end, hand-held digital cameras to create a documentary-style appearance. It is not a true Dogme 95 film, however, because the Dogme rules stipulate that violence, non-diegetic music, and period pieces are not permitted. Trier differentiates the musical sequences from the rest of the film by using static cameras and by brightening the colors. A fantastic technique which contrasts the dark and 'dread' normal life of the vivid and colorful musical.The acting by Björk is one of the best i've seen so far, she really brings emotion to the role of Selma. Really impressive performance by the Icelandish singer. She also composes almost all the songs in the film, one of them(I've seen it all) being nominated to both Golden Globe and a Oscar awards.So, i highly recommend it. 8.2/10</fullReview>

Good casting and, of course, the final scene is very powerful.However, I think that it's easy to be so affected by the positives to overlook the negatives. For me, everything about her trial and prosecution were totally unrealistic, especially her sentence. In fact, that whole portion of the film overlooks everything that preceded it. It was written so carelessly and simplistically, I felt cheated and insulted as an audience member.(I won't get into specifics b/c I don't think people read long reviews here; however, if anyone cares to ask, send me a message.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Lars Von Trier a humanist?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was truly shocked when I heard that some people criticized this movie, the director for being a woman hater or being a man who enjoys watching women suffer. Simply, I don't believe that, I didn't buy that criticism. Lars Von Trier might be a crazy filmmaker or a genius or both, but I am interested in what he's done than who he is including his turbulent personal life. Recently, after his new movie was released, I heard the same criticism, being a woman hater, women in Lars Von Trier movies always deeply suffer from something, with lots of pain etc. However, as said I don't believe that he makes sadistic movies or he is a sadist director himself. Dancer in the Dark is art, it is cinema, it is emotion, it is heart and soul and in the end it is a humanist movie like A Short Film About Killing by Kieslowski. Dancer in the Dark is not a melodrama or it is not an emotional exploitation film, it is just about humans, life, death, dark and light, fear... Björk gives one of the best performances of all time! I don't exaggerate it. The master Catherine Deneuve is flawless, but her screen time is short and also since Björk is a scene stealer, she is overshadowed by her. I think that David Morse was a smart choice, I don't know, he just fits the role and the film also. Peter Stormare was also pretty remarkable. The musical scenes, well, despite some people find those parts irrelevant, I liked it too, because it was reflecting the "tale" side of the film. I mean escapism. I was breatless while watching this film and till the end credits, I didn't even pause as I remember. The interesting thing about the film was the film seemed cold, it was cold, but also it was full of heart and soul and emotions. It wasn't a tearjerker, but may be sadder than most of those. Trier did a perfect job as the director, the script is very powerful, visually it was a little bit crude may be, but not flawed, may be suitable for the film's tone. This is a very dark film, but not visually, literally! As for the twist in the middle of the movie or near the end of it, I found it just a little bit far fetched, but no more. I didn't blame the director for it, it was just too grim as the breaking point of the film. Dancer in the Dark, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies of all time, I didn't find any flaw in the film particularly, but for some, it could be a real boring movie, intolerably boring!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of art house, Lars Von Trier (ever since "Dogville") and an even bigger fan of the impish Björk there is a chance, you might say I'm biased; however I watched this film (12 years late) with an open mind...There were times when the anguish became almost too much, however, Bjork's performance was flawless, emotionally naked but perversely charming and innocent; she makes you want to reach into the screen; hug her tight and protect her from the big bad wolf. Not surprisingly she won the CFF 'best actress' award. Casting Catherine Deneuve as her friend was inspirational.This film is not in 'good taste' and the plot is not remotely plausible; I don't think it's meant to be, but it is a great break from the usual, trite, trillion dollar 'churn-out'!This is not a 'family musical' my advice like many other reviewers, is to watch it alone; then at least any opinions formed will be your own!Some people will admire Lars Von Trier's effort and others will hate it...I, for one believe that Björk's decision to never make another movie is a great loss to us all...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absolutely most terribly sad movie of all times. Perfection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer in the dark is one of those movies. I absolutely love it, but I never recommend it to anyone. When I do speak of it is never without first warning: Go Prepared. It is an awfully tearing experience, it left me breathless and literally speechless for hours and hours, And even today, years after I first saw it, I cannot think of it without feeling a big rough hand start squeezing my heart slowly. Let's brake it in pieces: The story. It was made to shock and sadden, and let's just say it does it very well. Its the most universal theme of all: motherly love, there is no mistake with it, the way it is told makes you anticipate what is going to happen and even so be genuinely surprised and intrigued when it happens. The Acting. Bjork is the second worst Oscar mistake in the leading ladies category of modern times (In a close second after Fernanda Montenegro for City of God). It was a truly difficult path the one she walked to build the character (one that led to big fights with the director, Lars Von Trier, to the point when they no longer spoke with each other on the filming set), and it wasn't in vain. The naiveté of her Selma and her determination and her desperation and fall are the most raw and truthful piece of soul I ever saw exposed on a fictional story. It is truly disturbing, but in a wonderful way. The worst it gets the more vivid, the more beautiful. It is acting at its best. The music. Well, I guess I don't have to preach Bjork as a sensational singer. She is all that and- because you can see her and her pain- much more. Another wrong Oscar here. The directing. Dogville what? This, right here, is Lars Von Trier's masterpiece. You can see his signature in the way the story is told, in the few comic nods, in the angles, in the most wonderful and weird acting direction possible. They ask him to do a musical, he did the utterly non-musical movie with lots of musics on it. He is a bloody genius. The overall experience is not for the weak of heart. Don't watch if you cry on silly Rom-coms. Don't watch if you just want to be entertained. Don't watch - for god sake - if you are a musical fan. Don't watch if you are only there because you're a Bjork fan. Just. Don't. Watch. Its too sad. It will almost certainly break you. Be warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that makes you feel you should watch and shouldn't have watched..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dancer in the dark' is a kind of movie you wish you had not watched and also wished you had not missed at any cost. It stands up to its fame as truly one of the most depressing movies ever made, let alone a musical..!The movie revolves around a woman by the name Selma who works in a tool factory and does everything she could to stop her only son from going blind gradually, an inherent disease. How hard she tries to cope up with life and how she soothes her heart by imagining music in the most common of sounds is just amazing. Actress Bjork has given a performance that was made just for her. No one else in this world could do the role as fabulously as she had. Her innocent smile, an almost child-like voice and a highly believable performance make her character go down as one of the most beautiful characters ever portrayed in film history. All the other characters in the film portrayed their role very well too.The music numbers are just awesome. Specially the song 'I've seen it all' was simply wonderful. The usage of hand-held camera by Lars Trier was indeed very efficient and deserves a praise. His direction remains the hero of the film and was very powerful. he has taken a very simple story and had developed the characters as if he had all the time in the world. Once you get to relate to the character of Selma, you start seeing things in her perspective and the incidents happening get more and more painful to watch.Its very tough to see something so beautiful, so innocent and so fragile as the nature around us slowly getting destroyed. That is the main reason why this movie is so depressing. By depressing, I mean very Depressing. A lot of my friends watched this movie and everyone of them cried. That appeared very silly to me until I watched the movie myself. I tried incredibly hard to refrain from crying but it got harder and harder by the minute. Eventually, I cried so hard and the movie was so emotionally draining that I am trying not to cry even right now, as I am typing this review. And I don't feel the least bit silly about it.If this movie does not hit you in the heart, believe me when I say this, something is very very wrong with you. Once the movie is over and your head is still reeling with the emotion you had to deal with all the movie, suddenly you see the credits roll up with the innocent face of Selma smiling and sadness comes down on you like an avalanche, you start crying all over again. Putting this movie in words is an almost impossible task. Its best only if you see for yourself.An obvious 10 for 10. A spectacular achievement in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably unlike any movie you have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers) I have seen several of von Trier's movies and have come to respect them, but I cannot say that I enjoy them. They surprise, frustrate, intrigue, irritate, and mystify me. None has been a mood enhancer. "Dancer in the Dark" is a case in point. I have seen several movies that make a case against the death penalty, but this one has been the most intense. The prolonged final scenes are painful to watch. The most depressing scene shows the audience slowly leaving after the execution.Bjork plays Selma, a rather simpleminded young woman who is going blind and has a son who has inherited the condition. Through a sequence of unfortunate events, often implausible and exaggerated, Selma winds up on death row in Washington State in the United States. The movie could be set in almost any western country, except it had to be set in a place where the death penalty was legal, so the state of Washington in the United States was an appropriate choice. The fact that death by hanging was the preferred method of execution in Washington State at the time this movie was set (1964) I am sure excited von Trier's imagination in how he could make the execution as horrific as possible. I suspect that the decision to make Selma blind was to be able to accentuate the barbarity of the execution scene.I came into this movie pretty much blind, so to speak, and was taken totally by surprise when the drama in Selma's factory was interrupted by a song and dance number. At odd moments the movie takes off into song and dance fantasy land; there are several musical numbers scattered throughout the movie. The scene that has Selma bursting into song on her way to the gallows has to be the most bizarre. The musical numbers are filmed in vibrant colors that contrast with the drab colors in the rest of the movie. The singing and dancing scenes are inventively choreographed.I knew almost nothing about Bjork before seeing this movie, except that she is a singer. I was impressed by her performance, especially since this was her first. She was required to play some intense scenes that must have been emotionally draining for her--at least they were for me.The use of hand-held cameras that von Trier so favors is ever-present, combined with rapid pans and zooming in and out. I understand the goals of these techniques--dynamism, more natural performances, attention focusing--but the effect on me is to make me dizzy. I tend to want to discount von Trier, but I cannot deny his artistry. For example, the overture to "Dancer in the Dark" that has a slowly changing image accompanied by music, captured my imagination. Not sure that the overture has much to do with the rest of the movie, except maybe establish a mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Naiveness in a gritty shell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a gritty world with people thriving hard for their responsibilities.It's a world of Selma,the world which she builds upon with her amazing steps of subtleness.The movie provides a upheaval of human spirits amidst the social norms,the cruel truths and the immense tries to build up a dream.Bjork stands out firm with a memorable performance,which leaves me with tears as the movie ends.It's one of the movies which glues me to my seat and questions me,"Is that how Selma wanted?"Music is the greatest gift from this journey with my eyes and ears swinging and dancing to the visuals of divinity.Yeah,divinity,that's how I term the way when Selma kills Bill and yet spins around wonderful strings along her way,that brings solace in coldness.This world provides a weird chemistry of people with their everyday works and emotions clinging together with frictions.But dreams are that which ushers upon the faith and urge to love and live with respect.This movie provides that dream.When everything seems to be going out of the way,music and dreams come with all their mights to bind everything together with pensive,naive and mystic vibrations of humanity.A movie that will be treasured for eons!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective but sometimes comes off as being forced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am not a real big fan of artistic movies or the director Lars von Trier. But this is a pretty effective artistic movie that is vigorous when it comes to feeling for the characters. The cinematography is like a cheap recording from a cheap camera, so when it comes to the cinematography it's worse than some B-movies. But it goes in this direction with the cinematography for a reason, in order to bring out more of the realism and emotion. Now this doesn't work with every movie but it works with this one. In fact the characters seem so real in this and doesn't seem like actors or actresses on screen, although you may have seen some in other movies or on TV. And it's actually effective since it also brings out more realistic emotions from the characters. However I will say, despite the effectiveness when it comes to bringing out the emotions. It just seemed a bit forced sometimes, like it was unnaturally depressing. The movie is a about Selma(Bjork) trying to raise a son while going through difficult financial times while working in a factory and also going blind. So she escapes to her fantasy world which is basically a musical because she loves music, dancing and musicals. But despite the premise, it just seemed Von Trier was trying a bit too hard in a unnatural way. Von Trier also shouldn't direct musicals cause the musical numbers in this is not that good. And seemed the movie is a bit longer than it should be and drag, even for a artistic movie. This isn't for everyone and I can see why some audiences may get bored with this, but if you enjoy artistic dramas, this is a movie that should not be missed. This is not one of those movies I would see again, but for the first watch it was worth it...Somewhat. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Kelly's musicals may never have tempted a tear, but this film sure did. This is the most creative and powerful film I've seen this year. I just got back so it will take a while to absorb where it fits in the hierarchy of great movies, but it is one of the few 10's I have ever given on IMDb. I went in knowing nothing other then that Bjork was the lead and that it was a Cannes favorite, I and was rewarded greatly. I am not closed minded, but I thought I would never again find a musical that so wrapped you up in the emotional core of the piece, such as the musicals that I enjoyed in my youth. Its style is experimental enough that I would be surprised if it got a Best Film Oscar nod, but never would I be surprised for any honors bestowed on Bjork, who torturingly WAS Selma for those two painful hours. She is a goddess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saddest film ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before i start id like to say i found the film to be better knowing the ending( if that Makes sense which it doesn't).If you want to cry watch this film. I will admit the only reason I watched this film was cause it stars Björk and I have a crush on her, but I'll try and not be biased. She isn't the greatest actress, some hit and misses HOWEVER importantly she got the important parts spot on. Because she's so natural the emotion really was a winner. The only real leaks were some of the 'every day' scenes were she looked a bit camera shy however this really wasn't a problem. David Morse was a great actor in this too top marks. However even though this is quite literally my favourite film of all time (yes even better than shaw shank IMO) I can't see how I'm going to ever watch this again (unless I watch it with my girlfriend who just so happens wants to watch a sad movie) but alone, I don't think so. It's just too depressing some scenes in particular (SPOILER ALERT) especially the last scene were she's killed. It's so heart.Don't be put off if you hate musicals, I hate them but it's not really a problem cause in a way it kinda works in this movie. (SPOILER ALERTISH) The only reason I gave this 9/10 was because it really makes me feel grim(SPOILER ALERTISH). Final advice if your gonna watch it watch it with your girlfriend and not by yourself or anybody else. I mean you can but I think you need the comfort when the films over from a girl you can get laid with after ha ha;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>strange wonder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most harrowing and believable murder scene in the history of cinema, found in a strange movie that crosses the 50s musical with a very European art house sensibility in a mid-western America populated with Catherine Denueuve and the enigma that is Bjork.Von Trier is on record saying that Bjork was not an actress in this film - but instead completely lived the part of Selma. Bjork and Von Trier had a fractious, problematic creative relationship by all accounts, including their own, but what they produced from that tension together is nothing short of astounding.Watching Bjork in the aforementioned scene is almost too intimate - as if we were watching a person undergoing a genuine trauma.The movie has its 'faults,' sometimes its strangeness strains credibility or explanation, but for all of that, it is still a thing of wonder and for that reason deserves a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it was between 7 and 8.Von trier most innovative, original director. he cannot do masterpieces all the time, specially since he is an experimental director, but still all the films are between above average to masterpieces. Von trier deserves a lot of recognition. Great variety in the kind of movies he does. He is interesting, original, sincere, and says whatever the hell he wants to say.Camera, lights and technical knowledge implemented in the film is top notch, and highly inventive; as usual with LVT.Movie starts slow (but with reason), eventually it becomes tense and interesting. Again usual LVT.Musicals not my style, but interesting twist in the genre.Bjork's voice (and acting) great and moving(sentimental) 40% of time, annoying 60%. Still nice performance.Jeff is a lovable guy. i was rooting for him.The movie was made to feel compassion and root for Bjork (and I did,) but I stop rooting for her due to the stupidity of the character (still, this had to be done to carry out the movie the way LVT intended... doesn't make me not hate her character nevertheless.)Songs are not great, but the musical parts are decent. Tap dancing and "music out of nothing" make it interesting; and obviously the shots selected by LVT are always a gem.Not my top LVT movie, but if you follow him, you do need to see this one. Personally, I will always stick with Antichrist, melancholia, the idiots, breaking the waves, and maybe the idiots.I would pay top money to see LVT at work (and work for him.) *Currently studying Film directing.My English is perfectly fine, but I wrote in short (maybe incomprehensible) sentences, to make it quick and easy to read. If you want any movie suggestions, or discuss any topic (including Dancer in the Dark, LVT, or any of his movies,) do send a message. I would gladly review any other movie in a similar manner I did this one.Cheers. And Respect to LVT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a good film but failed miserably on most key points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was loaned this DVD by a friend who said it was one of the best films he had seen, but unfortunately could not share this view. First of all I found the film too long and the musical scenes were little better than pathetic. The acting was abysmal. I thought I was watching a film by an amateur dramatics company with the lead role being hopelessly miscast. I learned later that the lady who was the lead is, in fact, a famous pop singer. This, while not excusing her appalling acting, does explain it. I understand that she also wrote the rather lame musical sequences. In parts of the film, especially the beginning, the camera work was dreadful and very off putting. I accept the film did improve towards the end, but the whole concept was, in my view, rather silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Von Trier's Master Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing first..after a very long time any movie which puts a huge impact on me so that i have to write a review of it.This movie is not a movie but a brilliance of sheer passion for acting, directing, music &amp; wonderful choreography. Its is very unfortunate that i have seen this movie after so long of its release...but somehow i am feeling lucky today after watching this film...bcz i believe movies are almost dying these days....people has no love for cinema or art they just want candy-floss movies...its very sad.As far as movie is concern i love to watch Lars Von Trier's movies not because they are so different from any-other Hollywood movies but its also shows a great promise of something very natural &amp; refreshing....same-thing is with this movie also.....this movie is so high on content of acting, music,choreography,emotion that it will completely absorbs you to the core &amp; leave you all juicy...a taste which you will hard to forgot. As an leading lady of this movie Bjork has done something so unique that you wonder she already won a Oscar for this role.She portrayed her role of mill worker &amp; daydreamer who love to act in musicals so well that you just want to see her performance more after each frame....its make me amaze that how good can be someone in acting,music &amp; songs and she did it all beautifully.Even at the end of the movie when she started to sing again (first time as Selma) its so drenching that you have to hold your emotions to the last.Rest of the actors also committed a very good job in whatever space they have &amp; lifts this movie very well. As far as direction is concern i am 100% sure there are not many directors in the present world today who can bring out such rich quality of human dilemma &amp; emotions so beautifully as Von Trier did in this one.He engages you from the very start of the movie to the very last and leaves an impression of his work so impact-fully that it will be with you for a very long period of time. I am sure this movie as a whole puts a long lasting impression on me....Everything about this movie is so wonderful &amp; so human (with all rights &amp; wrongs). I really don't care if jury of academy didn't recognize this film &amp; bjork's caliber because great movies are themselves nothing less than an award. Both the director &amp; actor work so hard to win the race of top-class directing and acting....&amp; if somebody works so hard to win the race than even you also wants them to win it.......&amp; they did it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was absolutely loving it, till things turned weird.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I like weird, I like unusual, I like quirky but this movie doing some insane stuff I didn't even liked.I am not even slightly exaggerating when I'm saying that I was absolutely loving this movie for its first 30 minutes or so. I really liked the raw approach of the movie and its drama and the way it got shot. It had a great visual and also original style to it, which reminded me of some true guerrilla-style of film-making, with quick cuts and an always moving- and hand-held camera. The movie made the impression as if most of it was thought up at the spot. I'm not just talking about the way the camera swirls around but also about most of its dialog and of the way the story was progressing. And it's a Lars von Trier movie, so lots of it was probably indeed improvised on the spot but this only really seems to be the case for the first 30/45 minutes of the movie.After that the story and the movie its style and tone changes. Suddenly some musical elements start to kick in, which is something that still could had worked for me, if the songs had been any good. But man, were they annoying. There is no clear melody in any of them and nothing memorable is being sung.But also the story itself is suddenly taking a far more straightforward, dramatic approach, instead of coming across as a realistic, random slice of life. The developments that start to happen in this movie just weren't any ones I was really pleased with. I know Lars von Trier is a type of director that likes to tell stories in which when something starts to go wrong for a person, everything goes wrong and no person can ever be trusted. I however felt in this case that it just wasn't all that convincing and at a certain point I even simply stopped caring for its main character because she isn't really always doing the smartest things.The main character is basically a very naive person, who probably trust people far too easily. On the one hand this makes her very likable and sympathetic, since she comes across as a happy-go-lucky type of girl, who is always focusing on the positive things on life but on the other it's what also makes her a bit annoying at times, also because of some of the, all too obvious, stupid choices she makes.I don't really think you could fault Björk for any of this. It was just the way her character was being written and for most of the time Björk is playing it very well, especially when considering she wasn't really an actress to being with. Björk, the popular Icelandic singer, did not made her debut in this movie but it was the first time she was playing with some already established names in the business. In that regard, she did really well, though she is also still dropping the ball a bit at times. It seems that she was great and feeling comfortable improvising but when she had to remember lines and say them in the movie, she was having some more difficulties. Her unusual accent also really makes it sound as if she had no idea what she was saying, most of the time. But obviously I could still really appreciate this movie and have lots of respect for it. It's mostly because "Dancer in the Dark" is a movie like no other. It's being original with its style and approach, I just didn't ended up liking EVERYTHING this movie was doing but that of course doesn't mean that other people will do so as well. There are still plenty of people out there who like the movie in every aspect, so it seems I'm actually in a minority here, for not loving the movie.I still really liked it but I wish I could love it as much as most other people seem to do. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best feel-good musical since Mamma Mia!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should let you know that I'm not one to cry in movies. That's not to say that I'm a hard-nosed bastard with no feelings, because of course I well up in many films including the opening of Up and the final third of Requiem for a Dream. However, no film had actually made me release tears until I saw Dancer in the Dark for the second time. Even on my first viewing I did not cry, I just felt very overwhelmed. I suppose once you know the tragic conclusion, it makes it all the more unbearable to watch. Last night I watched Dancer in the Dark for a third time and I cried again.I didn't cry quite as much, but tears were still there and it still had that awful emotional wallop to the gut. Dancer in the Dark is one of those rare films which possess such a raw and intense emotional power. It could possibly be the most powerful film I have ever seen. I don't know anyone who could just zap through the credits, pull the disc out of their DVD player and get on with their lives. Every time I see it, I stare into the credits and I'm haunted by the final shot for hours and hours. In fact, when I went to bed last night, I cried again just thinking about it.Lars Von Trier is the definition of a love-it or hate-it director. The only film I haven't liked of his is The Idiots, which is coincidentally part of his Golden Hearts Trilogy which includes this and Breaking the Waves, his other masterpiece. I've also loved Dogville and immensely admired his latest Depression Trilogy which features: Antichrist, Melancholia and Nymphomaniac. He's been accused of creating films to shock for the sake of it, and whilst I do agree with that to some extent (did we really need that brief porn in Antichrist?) you can't deny that his films are unlike any other.Dancer in the Dark is Lars' masterpiece. Yes, Breaking the Waves come close, but you just have to give the prize to Dancer for pure innovation. It opens with a sensational overture (written by Bjork) which is enough to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. The story behind this overture is that Lars wanted the music to play whilst the curtains were shut over the screen, however he later realised that most movie theaters don't have curtains anymore and so put images of paintings over the music instead.We then open to a brilliant piece of comedy where our hero Selma and her friend Cathy are in some rather dull rehearsals for an amateur production of The Sound of Music. This hilarious opening completely juxtaposes the devastating finale. In fact, most viewers forget just how funny the first twenty minutes are, as the ending just completely eclipses that. Lars uses the same Dogme style as he did for The Idiots and Breaking the Waves. It almost feels like a documentary, with the images looking far too natural and the performances feeling far too real. It allows us to truly immerse ourselves into Selma's world, which of course makes the film all the more hard-hitting.Talking of performances, Bjork's is truly sensational. Who would've thought that a little Icelandic pop-goddess would be able to give Meryl Streep a run for her money! In fact, Bjork's performance is more comparable to Emily Watson's legendary debut in Breaking the Waves. It's so raw, emotional and intense to watch. Bjork even said that she didn't feel as if she was acting, she would go onto the set and become Selma. Surely that's the mark of an incredibly talented actress? It's a shame that Lars gave her such an awful experience that she never acted again. Bjork didn't even want to do Dancer in the Dark, she agreed to write the music, but Lars blackmailed her into acting by saying that he wouldn't use her music unless she played Selma.Of course, you mustn't forget that Dancer in the Dark is in fact a musical! Selma is a musical enthusiast because 'nothing dreadful ever happens.' Obviously she isn't a fan of Sweeney Todd, Les Mis or indeed the very musical she is starring in. The songs in the film are all fantastic; I even began liking Scatterheart on my third viewing, understanding that the lack of melody and structure perfectly mirrors the situation which Selma finds herself in. The musical numbers offer a fantastical escape from the dreary reality. The washed-out colours are now bright and vibrant. Extras awkwardly dance around and have unnaturally wide smiles. The musical numbers don't fit with the tone of the film, and that is exactly the point!It's the ending which catapults Dancer in the Dark into masterpiece status though. It has images which will sear into your brain and will touch you in parts which you didn't know could be touched! I've seen many depressing films, but this one takes the prize for the most depressing ending of all time. However, it's also a genius way to end the film. I especially love the quote which superimposes the screen. It mirrors Selma's early monologue where she describes cheating films by leaving after the second-to-last song so that the film will play on forever.It's easy to see why most people wouldn't want to watch Dancer in the Dark a second time, let alone a third time like I did! However, I love films which take you on a journey. Films which have the power to physically move you are so rare, and experiencing emotion like this is really quite extraordinary. Dancer in the Dark is a magical masterpiece which must be experienced by everyone at least once.Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie when it came out and remember saying that after it had finished that it was probably the best film I had ever seen. Very dramatic, moving and with powerful performances. I have just been reading a few of the reviews as I have the DVD and intend to watch it later on tonight and was amazed by some of the bad reviews that have been written about it. This prompted me to look for a film that I thought was very poor and yet had the same rating as Dancer in the Dark. I found The Hangover 2009 with a rating of 7.9. Now, I love comedy but in my opinion this film was far from funny.. maybe with the exception of Mike Tyson... but of course it's all down to each individual's taste to some extent and so I wouldn't feel it right to give something a bad review in case someone reads it and doesn't watch the film because of me giving it a bad rating and review. That would be very sad to deny someone the pleasure of watching a film that they might really enjoy. Quality and enjoyment is made between 2 things.... a movie and the watcher or a song and the listener. A movie or song is not good or bad.. this only happens when someone watches or listens. Had to say my bit as I felt that this movie was just great but that's only because of my strengths, weaknesses Knowledge and limitations as a person and me and this movie just created something good between us. I suppose what I'm saying is that it's better write positive things rather than negative.. like our teachers used to say.. if you haven't got anything good to say then don't say it. I haven't got much good to say about The Hangover but had to choose something to compare with Dancer in the Dark. As you can tell, I don't usually write reviews! I joined up with IMDb just to write this because I felt so strongly about peoples opinions and felt the need to share mine!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a drama good but here music is not a good ingredient</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wondering if this is a real story or just an invention of the director and others in the team of this film realization. As a drama it is shocking to see how a person responsible for justice on the streets and everywhere is so spoiled to get something ($$$)in a very dirty manner from another person with some physical impediments. It is clear that the director Von Trier wanted to show the modesty of the Czech lady compared with the ambitions and spending of the other lady, American married to the police agent, i.e. two environments give two diverse products. The film also emphasizes the efforts of the immigrant working and saving for the health of her son and his future. The judicial process shown is arbitrary, too many times insisting that she is Czech woman, so what? Music in this tragic story seems to be out of the context, the film could be valued as 10, but music takes two points easily from it. Björk played well but sometimes she looked as someone with mental disorders. Catherine Deneuve had a modest role, insignificant for her stature as a famous actress. The rest did it well, particularly David Morse as the depraved agent. If this story is not real, an indication should be given at the very beginning of the film it is all fiction. However it is doubtful, why did the director/writer used Washigton state, USA as the place of this tragedy and not his mother land, Denmark, if this story is fictitious?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird, But It Has Bjork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is set in the U.S. state of Washington in 1964 and focuses on Selma Je?ková (Björk), a Czech immigrant who has moved to the United States with her son, Gene Je?ek (Kostic). They live a life of poverty as Selma works at a factory with her good friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve). She rents a trailer home on the property of town policeman Bill Houston (Morse) and his wife Linda Houston (Seymour). She is also pursued by the shy but persistent Jeff (Peter Stormare) who also works at the factory.Lars von Trier has said that each morning before filming, Björk would say "Mr. von Trier, I despise you," and spit at him. Their relationship during and after filming is seen as quite hostile. Deneuve's account makes it clear both Von Trier and Björk were difficult to work with, so it is hard to blame one or the other.I think blame generally falls on Bjork because von Trier has established himself as a great director, while Bjork is not thought of as a great actress. She was criticized for "feeling" rather than "acting" in many scenes. Yet, in the latter parts of the film she does cause the audience to get sympathetic with her, and I can think of no one else who could so beautifully appear in the eccentric musical numbers. (The factory scene is great, but the murder scene was all Bjork.) Roger Ebert said, "It smashes down the walls of habit that surround so many movies. It returns to the wellsprings. It is a bold, reckless gesture." Wow, you made Ebert poetic. I am so used to him being dry or dismissive. If this kind of response can happen from one critic, perhaps more people should see the film?Unfortunately, although the New Line Platinum DVD is loaded with extras, the commentary is more of a mix of interviews cut in some various sources. It would be better to have von Trier or Bjork commenting in real time. Maybe that is just picky of me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bjork: the ultimate triple-threat entertainer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, I have discovered a penchant for "oddball" movies. Movies where what's real is subjective, and incongruous genres of film are side by side, and movies that are, if not seamless, then at least evocative. This film is one of those. Selma's color-saturated dream life is jarring, often amplifying the tragedy of real life, but comforting to a viewer bogged down by the dreary, "camcorder" look of the rest of the film. Most striking about this film, to me at least, is not the talent of the director, but of the star. Already an amazing musician, Bjork's contributions to this film as an actress were a revelation. Her talent is completely raw, in every sense of the word, and it is that unfiltered, emotional quality of her unique voice and unrestrained acting that enables such intense feelings of joy and despair. That is to say nothing of the score, which she also penned. "I've Seen It All" and "Scatterheart" are chillingly lovely at their height.In terms of characterization, however, the film suffers. This is one of those films for which critics will often use the Eight Deadly Words: "I don't care what happens to these people". Further, Lars VonTrier's visualization of the hopelessly naive, fanciful Selma as a character who operates on exclusively "female" instinct comes off as a misogynistic arrogance. It is this and the unrelenting grayness of the better part of the movie that lowers my rating. Where the film truly shines is in the heart that it has: the direction, the music, and the gut- wrenching, tour de force performance given by Bjork as Selma, succeed at reaching the viewer on an emotional level, however broadly, in a simple but sad story that shows an imaginative, loving spirit's struggle to follow her heart, and the consequences that come of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is hardcore. Lars von Trier made this movie a very, very hard one to watch. Still, that's what is so remarkable about Dancer In The Dark.First, it's a musical with alternative-music genius Björk. Her voice was stolen from an angel and in her only shot at professional acting, she was so natural that you actually find yourself in love with her character. The plot is really evil and the end... well, I won't spoil it for you. But if you're going to watch Dancer In The Dark, be ready to experience humanity at its worst form of emotional violence.The musical parts are a bit too boring - except for the exceptional 'I've Seen It All', featuring Thom Yorke (Radiohead).In summary, Dancer In The Dark is a movie that I will not see again so soon. It is heartbreaking. I have never cried because of a movie, but if I did, it would've been because of this one. Oh, and it's a great way to get to know that freaky woman Björk. Buy her albums. She's great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was one word I would give Dancer in the Dark, it would be heartbreaking. I do think it is Von Trier's saddest film.Bjork gives a compelling and devoted performance here. It's difficult to judge because so much of it is given by her passion for music, but nonetheless Von Trier does know how to get the best out of his actresses. I will say that as far as his films go this was probably the easiest to get into from the beginning. It's probably in a way the most accessible film that I have seen from him, since the plot is simple and easy to digest. It also continues Von trier's messages that are similar in the way his female leads happen to fall into destruction. In a way this is is most entertaining film, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't hit deep, because it does. In fact, I would say it is his saddest film, and also his most infuriating just because of the decisions that the lead female makes, including a court scene that really got me angry in the way Von Trier denies any actual satisfaction for us to have (the way she doesn't say the complete truth).I do think that this is probably his most 'calculated' film in that it feels much more 'manipulative' in it's plot. That of course is a setback, but at the same time I can't think of why it shouldn't feel that way at this point of plot and character. Still, this is a heartbreaking film, and will definitely get your heart, but it doesn't feel as accomplished or satisfactory as Von trier's Dogville and Breaking the Waves. BUT then again, it's still a Von Trier film, and his direction, style, tone, and points still make for a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad, but good....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I had to watch this a few times, the music is intriguing and ethereal, but the story seems on a parallel universe of strange, then scary, then a form of horror. But also a story of hope, which is to say, its confusing.Basically Selma is a Czech immigrant who wants to find a life for herself, she has a secret in that her disease causes her to become at first near-sighted and myopic, she then is nearly blind.She does not live a pretty life, works in a factory but finds that the machines are rhythmic, and as she also enjoys old musicals from the 40's and 50's this is her form of escape. This is the better part of the story, her spirit and how she endeavors to survive.I am not a major fan of Bjork but I do like her voice and she is very affecting here, I think I had seen a very odd documentary about her made early in her career.Am wondering what she is doing lately, as this film is well-acted and she portrays the sad and eventually discarded Selma, in a very convincing yet not trite manner. Good performances also with David Morse, Cara Seymour, Peter Stormare and the always beautiful Catherine Deneuve. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think I could ever recover adequately enough from my hatred of "Breaking the Waves" to give another Lars von Trier movie even the slightest of chances, but I have to grudgingly admit that I found much to like in "Dancer in the Dark." It's in many ways just as nihilistic and depressing as the other film, and it's certainly weirder. It also annoys me that von Trier with this film and later ones has decided that he knows all about what's wrong with America and is going to tell us what's what.But the film boasts a quite affecting performance from that odd little thing named Bjork, and the musical numbers, rather than feeling incongruous, work well precisely because they're so oddly juxtaposed to von Trier's style.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinarily tender and offbeat film...though with a tendency toward self-pity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eclectic singer Björk gives a stunning, delicately nuanced dramatic performance in "Dancer in the Dark" playing Selma, a Czech immigrant to the States in 1964, working in a factory and trying to care for herself and her young son--both with quickly fading eyesight. Selma is nearly an impossible concoction; even more frail than Elizabeth Hartman's blind girl from "A Patch of Blue", she is prone to shy little smiles that do little to disguise her hurt feelings. But Selma's love for movie musicals transforms her in her fantasies, which writer-director Lars von Trier stages exuberantly, like scenes from "Pennies From Heaven". This ambitious film is indeed too long, yet is helped by the skittering narrative style which shuffles us right along with the complicated plotting. It is both hypnotic, gripping, and weird--but not off-putting. Catherine Deneuve (in a very natural performance as Björk's friend and co-worker) heads a strong supporting cast, while the frequently nimble editing and expressive cinematography make the most of the soaring musical sequences. Still, the dramatic story is what draws the viewer in and keeps one watching intently, and the star is just as amazing in these forceful instances as she is dancing on the railroad cars. Not for every taste, certainly, but discerning audiences will get a well-realized, tender character portrait laced with song. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie which redefines the way a we have to watch movies or why a movie is not just mere entertainment but a life changing experience.. Though this movie being a very emotional movie creates a sense of bliss which not many movies provides. The masterful direction by Lars von Trier is nothing less than a genius who can handle such sensitivities of life and emotions with such ease but also not overemphasizing unnecessarily. Acting by all characters are so amazing it dissolves (not involve) the viewer in the story as if it is such a reality. Acting played by Björk is just exceptional. So realistic and so perfection. She belong to group of elite group of helen mirren, Judi dench, Meryl Streep, Penélope Cruz etc. She blends to character so well that never ever in the entire movie you feel she is acting a character. Never overplayed nor underplayed, just just too perfect to be an actor. The movie is so direct and in one level but inherits such a emphatic human philosophy and truth of life is a very subtle way which not all viewers can understand. It is not a movie for those who don't want to let a drop of tear and if you don't after watching it then surely you haven't understood the movie.</fullReview>

It doesn't take long to realize that this is a dark trip that will not have a happy ending.Björk was incredible as a mother losing her sight and doing everything to get an operation for her son. The darkness that was creeping in was only broken by her fantasies that included several musical and dancing numbers.Reality intruded on her plans in the form of David Morse ("John Adams" "House"), a cop whose personal problems caused her to make the ultimate sacrifice to save her son.Catherine Deneuve as her BFF, and Peter Stormare (Fargo, Chocolat) added to the thrill, as did a brief appearance by Joel Grey.An outstanding drama/fantasy that was an excellent surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>okay so yer its Lars Von Trier, its Bjork, but thats about it, its new look on musicals is OK but some of the acting draws away from that and ruins the film for me. Bjork needs to pick an accent and stick to it. the new interpretations of a musical is clever the diagetic sound is used well and the dogme'95 look helps you to relate to it being a Von Trier film. this film was clever the ending was spectacular although slow through the middle. the ideology was well thought about and the way Von Trier portrays Americans is also very controversial provoking a reaction. all in all this film deserves acclaim for the use of the musical genre in such away but i feel some of the elements used could have been put to better use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful and Touching Portrayal of a Mother's Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I encourage you to read some of the critics' viewpoints, especially if you've seen this movie and enjoyed the period accuracy and acting of Bjork, Deneuve, and Stormare--the criticisms are quite amusing. One person complains that the movie appears to be set in the 50s (actually it was 1964). Another complains that there are no McDonald's restaurants, TV antennae's, and that the factory looked like it came from the communist era. Well, yeah, that would all be pretty much true in 1964 rural America.To be clear, if you don't have an understanding of this 1964 rural America period and you don't understand that most mothers love their children more than their own husband or even their own life and you can't overlook Bjork using her native Icelandic accent as opposed to faking a Czech accent and if you bore in movies like "The Piano", this movie probably isn't for you. However, if you consider Gwyneth Paltrow's face to be plain and Bjork's beautiful and expressive (no knock on Gwyneth ... she is quite beautiful, but part of her beauty is that her face is plain and inexpressive) and you can appreciate and really get into movies like "The Piano", and if you were born before 1985, you might actually have found yourself a winner here.Many critics complained (whined is more like it) that the camera moved too much in the film. Okay, so it did move a lot, but it wasn't excessively obtrusive as they make it out to be. I get vertigo sometimes when my eyes move too quickly from one object to another, but I never got it once during this movie. I think the camera focus on each character made me feel closer to the scene and situation.Unlike the critics, I didn't find the story implausible. I found it well in-line with human behavior and particularly, within the behavior of a very poor Czech-born mother who is going blind. In our relationships, we may see a hundred alternatives, but for someone else, there are no alternatives. This is human.Bjork's acting was completely stunning. The emotion she emitted was a powerful force and she deserves applause. Those of us who have listened to her interviews know that she actually has something to say. Those of us that have seen her perform know she wears her emotion very close to her performance. I saw the same in her acting performance and I was amazed and so glad I saw it there too.It's hard to imagine someone playing the main role other than Bjork. She performed it so well and so compellingly. That said, if a different actress could have been found to deliver a performance of that caliber, the movie would stand on its own without her. It was that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muse and musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All von Trier-movies basically tell the same story in a different way, as they are about an individual with idealistic intentions destroyed by a community or society. And in the Golden Heart-trilogy, comprising Breaking the Waves, Idioterne / The Idiots and this, that individual happens to be a naive girl. This naivety is why we are so attracted to these movies, as they are persons we all love and want to care for.Dancer in the Dark frequently refers to musicals and is itself one. Because most musicals do distract from the story and storyline, it is more a handicap here than an addition. It is therefore to von Trier's credit that the movie still has such impact. The musical elements are however well performed, especially the way they start with a few musical notes that somewhat flow from the drama. Also nice to see a movie having an overture again, although some theaters will probably skip it.Björk acts by dreaming she's in one of her musicals. Her performance was correctly rewarded at Cannes. There is a parallel of her part with her eyes: As her condition deteriorates, so do her eyes and vice versa. Eyes of the camera, eyes to see the truth (or a version of it).Much is said about the US-bashing: Although the part up to the trial could have played out in any country and is therefore not specifically targeted at the US, the rest from that point onwards is. Von Trier wonders how a civilized society can make such ethical errors in trials, sentencing and its prison system. But von Trier creates his own problems here because his research is poor and a number of facts in the movie are wrong (and that from someone who is an avid admirer of Kubrick). And a second point: He only attacks the (federal) state and its institutions, so he is somehow on a line here with the rather extreme movements in the US that have a deep distrust of the state.This is a movie where manipulation is used to draw you in. All movies do that, but Von Trier is an expert in just that. It may not be everyone's taste and some will walk out, but it is still an intriguing and unique movie.</fullReview>

I was not particularly a fan of Bjork until watching this film, but afterwards I had to get the album 'Selma's Songs'. I am actually listening to it now while writing this! I watched the film with a friend and we were both quite moved by the film and there are parts when if I was on my own, I would have cried a bit :) If you are a fan of moving, emotionally involving films with an ending which brings out a mixture of emotions, then you'll get a lot out of this film.

		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier's "Dancer in the Dark" is one of the most beautiful films I've seen in recent years. Though it divided a lot of the critics and public, which called the film "manipulative" and "over-dramatic", I believe this is a film that makes perfect sense in the oeuvre that Von Trier has been creating over the years (and as far as I am concerned is one of his best films, with "Europa", "Breaking the Waves" and "Dogville"). The acting, particularly by Bjork is painfully real and simultaneously magical - she manages to express the fear that her character feels but also the magic (which she imbues in the music numbers). The film manages to balance two different components extremely well: on one side the realistic side of the daily life of the characters, inside the factory (which is also highlighted by the cinematography - digital video at it's best) and the wonderful musical numbers choreographed by Vincent Patterson. The music is simply beautiful and you can truly see the artistry of Bjork and her co-producer Mark Bell at work here - the music starts from sounds that are present in the environment where she is (the factory, the railway). This is a film that I highly recommend, for it's sheer beauty and artistry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She followed her heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have wanted to see this film ever since I read that it was one of the most disturbing films ever made. One that will rip out your heart and leave you sobbing. It IS a very sad story. A simple (minded?) Czech immigrant comes to the US so that she can bring her son to a doctor who can prevent him from going blind like she is. It even seems to me that the doctor she gives the money to near the end is Czech as well. Which would explain why she ended up in such an out of the way place instead of a larger, perhaps more metropolitan city.Some reviewers have asked why she was so timid and why she kept the secrets that cause her to be put to death. I think it is quite simple. She has one fixation that drives her. That her son not become blind. She feels that out of selfishness she brought this child into the world and the one thing she can do is give him the operation that will save his sight. Nothing else matters. Her greatest fear is that Gene will find out about this genetic time bomb and worry himself into a state that will worsen his condition. This becomes even more powerful for her when the one person she trusts with her secret totally betrays her and causes this tender simple person to commit terrible violence.Some people have said that this movie is not believable and that the acting is terrible. I think this movie is completely believable. I have experienced the awkwardness of amateur theater, the humiliation of being fired from a job, the intense love for a child.Bjork's performance was amazing. The musical and dance segments are really nicely done but also kept in a real framework using the existing environment. The 100 camera technique is more impressive when you find out about it later. In the first viewing I didn't quite get it. I just thought they shot the scene a bunch of times and did a huge editing job.A word now about the DVD. The commentary stinks. I was hoping for some description of the movie and why they did things and what things mean and there was very little. It was good to know that the director shot most of the hand held shots himself which gave him the ability to direct the actors very closely, but most of the discussion was technical and did not delve into performances. At one point the director says that he should have been more supportive to Bjork and that their communication deteriorated over the course of the filming. The 100 camera scenes are very well done, however.So what is this movie? Is it art or craft? I think the art is created by Bjork and the movie itself is crafted. Ultimately the emotions are coaxed or even manipulated out of the audience. Von Trier has created a film of craftsmanship. It is like a impressive piece of furniture that the actors perform their art on. And it left me with this message. If you follow your heart you may have to pay the ultimate price for your dedication to it.One more comment on other critics of this movie. Creating movies or music or literature is extremely hard. And it takes a lot of things coming together for it to work well. Before you dismiss a movie or call it lame, try to do one yourself. Let's see your movie. If you are like most people you don't have the dedication it takes to follow your dream. Not everyone is willing to join the circus, give up your comfortable life, and dedicate your life to an art form.</fullReview>

After all, it is a musical and she sings in all the songs. If you are not listening to the music, you'll miss most of the film and will definitely get bored with it. For me it took a while to get drawn into the film, but the more I watched the film, the more I became emotionally attached to the character of Selma and the seemingly hopeless fight to survive in a hostile land that she could neither see, nor understand. I was very impressed with the acting of Bjork.I tend to love any film that is different, and does not conform to the emotional bleakness of Hollywood........and this film is very different.</fullReview>

Some Spoilers might follow, if you haven't seen it, stop reading in this line.Indeed it is an amazing film, Björk stands out and gives a performance that very few actors can deliver in such a way, since it has all kinds of colors when it comes to the kind of performance. One of the wonderful things about this movie, is that surprises are only there as human aspects of life, people can betray you in such a way that it borders in inhumanity, and the saddest part is that it is too human to act like this.You see her trying to take it strongly, and you actually see her cave in, you see the hope of someone who knows things are hopeless now and the most impressive contrast in the fact of becoming in some moments simply insane, the escape from reality works in a way so powerful that it simply takes you away... The way we cling to hope is overwhelming and this movie shows it in a disturbing way. The surprises on the "bright side" are just realistic, there are close to none. This plays out in such a powerful way. Really amazing and can leave you with mixed tastes of the power of hope, and the impotence of hopelessness...</fullReview>

I'm reasonably bright. i understood it. i just thought the acting was shoddy, the characters (outside of bjorks) were underwritten, the camera work was annoying, and the script was half baked.... why then is this film held in such high esteem. I'm not looking to start a fight, here, so don't start throwing knives. just tell me why you liked it so....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing film pushes all the right buttons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic film.Apon hearing that bjork would be playing a role in a film/musical. I was skeptical at best. But, being a huge fan of bjorks music I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt.It certainly payed off.She delivers an outstanding performance in an amazingly powerful film. After seeing this I was quite dazed and genuinely disturbed for days afterwards. Film is art, and art is supposed to draw a reaction from whoever experiences it. I lot of people have been critical of this film for being overly depressing, maybe I'm a depressing guy but I loved it!!! The music is great, the actors are great. The directors and writers are great.this is quite possibly the best film i've ever seen.....and I've seen my fair share of films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about a movie that really moves you. This movie is it. I guess it more than moves, it shook, disturbed, played with my emotion like crazy. At times, while I was watching this movie, I was actually hating the main character (and also the director) why she could NOT defend herself, it was just nerve-wrecking to watch this woman being accused of doing something that she hasn't done and all she could do is just play silent... AAaaaaa... But then again, in the end, I realized that it was just because the movie was just so powerful that it moved me so much. I wouldn't watch this movie again though, but I highly recommend that everybody should watch this movie once. The opening and end credit soundtrack is also wonderfully depressing. Gosh I couldn't stand the last 10 minutes of the movie....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made an enormous impression on me. I cannot explain what it did to me, but it brings tears to my eyes when I think of it.I bought this movie on DVD. I had never seen in theaters. I was glad I could watch in the safety of my own livingroom, because it is simply too sad.The whole project is really unique. Absolute great music. But what else could we expect from Björk. She gives a stunning performance as Selma. Not being an actress, she still manages to impress the viewers.I was not bothered by Von Trier's laws of Dogma. I've seen some of the Dogma films before, and I think it's ok. You get used to it.Dancer In The Dark is too sad to watch without being prepared for the worst.

		<shortDescription>An intense and disturbing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason why audiences at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival either walked out halfway in anger or stayed till the end and wept uncontrollably - it is almost impossible to not have extreme emotions while viewing this movie. Every expectation you might have about a musical is shattered here: the first musical number doesn't arrive till 40 minutes into the movie (and since the musical numbers are a form of escape for both Selma and the audience, the first 40 minutes is a hellish non-stop examination of her bleak existence); there is absolutely no glamor or lavishness (unlike in the MGM musicals that Bjork's Selma character escapes into); the fantasy musical-number sequences are shot atypically using a mixture of shaky hand-held camera-work and 100 stationary digital cameras placed everywhere so as to capture random, accidental pieces of the actors' (and particularly Bjork's) performance.There is much to praise here in terms of originality; then there are the contrivances in the storyline: closer examination would uncover that von Trier's entire intention in doing this movie is to reach that plot climax where Selma is forced to sacrifice her life for the sight of her son. Taken in this context, the 129 minutes that happen before this pivotal turning point suddenly seem both pointless and unnecessarily harrowing. But then again, maybe his entire point is that life can be pointless and unnecessarily harrowing, and so his movie should be as well: a notion that might either drive an audience member mad with frustration, or leave a viewer awe-struck at the audacity and moved by the immediate realism of the film, or (for some people like me anyway) both at the very same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an incredibly powerful film that shows what Lars Von Trier is made of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film I have ever seen by Lars Von Trier. Why was I interested in the first place? Bjork, that's what. Also, I'm interested in the movie Dogville, and when I heard that movie's director worked with Bjork on a msuical IN WHICH ALL THE MUSIC IS COMPOSED BY BJORK HERSELF, I knew that i absolutely had to see it.As I said, this movie is incredibly powerful. I'm the type of person that it is very, very hard to make me cry. I have never cried watching a mivoe except when I teared PARTIALLY while watching the Passion of Christ (and I'm a Christian as well!).First, the movie's strong points: the music. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. I am not surprised, after all, Bjork DID compose the music.The only thing wrong with it was the cinemtography. It looks kind of like a home-made movie, with the exception of the musical sequences.Anyways, if you're a Bjork fan, or interested in musicals with substance, or looking hard for a powerful movie, or have any interest in dramatic-angst musical films with Lars Von Trier as the director, this is THE movie you must check out.10/10...at least that's what I think.</fullReview>

The musical scenes were fantastic, Bjork did a great job using sounds of the scene and integrating it to make music. Her unusual voice makes you listen and really get involved with the character to empathise and begin to love her. It truely tells of how we live in a sad world where each person is out for their own, only a few people out there such as Bjork's character that do things for other people, and get trodden on in the process. Its such a shame that films as fantastic as this dont get a mainstream release. Wow...I wanna see it again. I cried like a baby lol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DANCER IN THE DARK (DIDIER BECU)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Praised by some, hated by others and the reason for this schizophrenic masterpiece is that we are dealing with two egos who only believe in themselves. First there is Bjork. She swore she never would set foot on any filmstage ever again and how talented she might be, I am sure that she must be the kind of persons who is indeed impossible to work with. But the performance from Bjork who plays a Tsjech immigrant (Selma) is breathtaking. She came to the US for only one reason, she and her son are suffering from some illness that makes you blind in the end and she loves her boy so much that all the money she earns in a lousy factory is saved for later. Despite a poor life, everything goes well till her landlord (a policeman who can't pay his debts) is stole her money. Secondly there is the very individual directing of Lars Von Trier. Every Von Trier-movie has its typical documentarystyle with so many shaking shoots that there are times you wish it would have been directed by someone else. But then again it would have ended in some Hollywoodtearjerker and that's exactly why "Dancer in the dark" is so very different from other movies. Of course there are the musical bits too and for some reason they were only okay as they were performed by Bjork. Best movie ever? Not at all but anyone who has a heart will be shocked by "Dancer in the dark" anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, engrossing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've finally seen a movie by rebel danish director Lars von Trier, whose movies famously you either love or hate - and i don't know whether i love or hate it! One thing i'm certain of: this is a powerful, engrossing viewing experience. I couldn't turn the movie off from sheer curiosity at what was about to happen. In the first fifteen minutes i was transfixed, but baffled as to the purpose of this movie, but as soon as Selma (Bjork) tells us that she is going blind, and that she adores nothing more in the world than musicals, i was completely drawn in by Dancer in the Dark.I think the seemingly rough way von Trier tells this story is what makes it so fascinating. Nicole Kidman, speaking about Dogville, said that you always feel von Trier right there with you because he is always operating the camera. By so doing, he is able to hand-craft a particular character for the camera, who becomes like an extra character looking on to the events in the movie, whose eyes the audience look through. The "reality" world in Dancer in the Dark feels just like reality, the hardness of which Selma loves to escape from by imagining she is in a musical. To give you an idea of the kind of profundity to be found in Dancer, here is my favourite speech in the movie:Selma: "Isn't that annoying when they do the last song in the films though... Because you just know when it goes really big, and the camera goes out of the roof, you just know its gonna end? I used to cheat on that when i was a little girl back in Czeckeslovakia. I would leave the cinema just after the next to last song was over - and the film would go on forever."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to watch but Bjork brings out the pathos..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree that Bjork and Morse were great in this tear-jerker (it made me cry) but viewing this film is a real strain on the eyes because of the constant jerkiness of the camera. I bought the DVD in part because I wanted to hear Bjork sing and she *does* sound great especially when her voice soars. Unfortunately, however, the loud instrumental accompaniments (strings, percussions) tend to drown out her remarkable voice---a real pity. The choreography in the dance numbers is mediocre---and it pales when compared to what you see in better Bollywood productions nowadays.Appearance-wise, Bjork is no Jane March and watching her for 3 hours is not exactly fun. Still, she manages to project a waif-like sense of helplessness which is right on the mark for this character portrayal. You feel so sorry for her and the terrible situation she finds herself in..The factory setting was great---it shows accurately what work on an assembly line can be like.And, yes, I also watched the movie with sub-titles (in English).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A darkly manipulative film which succeeds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Again, a non-Hollywood director shows us there is more than one way to skin the proverbial cat. Mixing these intricate, stunning musical sequences in with the "film proper" is necessarily a new device in the movies, but one rarely explored anymore and provides fascinating, penetrating insight into the central character that might not come through any other way. The stilted, almost painful "Sound of Music" sequences segue show into the rest of the filmMr. Van Houten's statement about the film being manipulative is not entirely off-base, but what is wrong with occasionally being manipulated by a filmmaker ? especially when it is done masterfully? Obviously this is not a movie for all, but to call it "dishonest" I think is an error. Further, I'm not certain I understand the tale's sense of "sorority and female bonding" being dismissable or damning. I don't need to "reconsider" the film with "detachment." I liked it the first time . . . it did what I expected it to do, and in no way bypassed my brain while going for the heart. This is nearly impossible as even in this film I found myself thinking constantly. Having established himself as a director who can safely integrate (well, perhaps safely is not the word) a simple plot with eye-popping visuals, Von Trier once again succeeds brilliantly. When the story takes its inevitable and penultimate turn, Von Trier unflinchingly marches it toward its conclusion and shatters those of us who've taken this journey. Yet another amazing accomplishment from one of our age's finest directors. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with all the other "raves," but the film did seem a bit long. Some things could have been tightened up a bit, it seemed. However, Bjork's performance is astonishing. And this film, isn't self-centered, self-gratuitous, or cute-sie as "Tuvalu" (now there's a real bomb!). "Dancer" is put together skillfully. It reminded me a bit of "Pennies from Heaven," another one of my favorite "musicals noires." The last 10 minutes of "Dancer" are stunning, echoing the rehearsal scenes for "The Sound of Music." Beautiful framing!! Color shifting from drab to spectacular is not at all intrusive, but apropos of what the director is trying to mirror in Selma's life.I would recommend, however, that anyone renting/buying the DVD turn on the English subtitles. Even though this film is in English, it was quite difficult to understand at times.</fullReview>

Lars Von Trier keeps grinding out these films. A collaboration of amazingly superb acting, fantastic songs on Von Trier direction, Dancer in the Dark is a masterpiece.

		<fullReview>Dancer In the Dark is an amazing up to date musical about the life of Selma, who is from the Chezh. Republic, and moves to the USA with her son, to get him eye surgery so he won't go blind like her. There are many great conflicts, Selma with herself, you see she has a family disease that makes her go blind at a certain age, and there is a surgery to prevent it but she is too old to have it, and too poor. The conflicted with money problems she works at a factory for little money so she can save up to get her child an operation to save his sight. She can't hardly work cause she is going blind she can't walk home, she is too poor to have a car, and she is in a terrible bind. Her land owner and cop, Bill (David Morse in a very good performance) developes a little crush on her (although he is married) and then he finds out where she hides her money, and steals it to aid his greedy wife. The music was all made by Björk, it is really odd, but her singing style and the natural sounds that are used for beats work amazingly for this film. Selma loves musicals and that is her favorite thing about America, she lands the lead in what seems to be a community theatre musical but still its the world to her, but she has to give it up because of her failing sight. She finds out Bill stole her money and goes to get it back and then he tells Selma to shoot him. She is blind and can't see what she is doing and shoots him in places that... won't kill you too fast. She unloads the gun on him, but she hits no major area so she beats him in the head with a metal box. It is deffinatly brutal, but what is worse is the dance and song number after it. Bill rises from the dead to sing a song with Selma. Selma is put in prison and gets the money to her son to have the surgery. She is put to death by hanging. In a very very disturbing final sceen she is hung til death. This movie has the most amazing female performance I have ever seen in a movie. It's a true shame Björk won't do any more films, but really it would be so hard to follow this one up. This is an amazing movie, I rated it 9/10 stars.</fullReview>

This movie forced me to think about what I really honestly thought about it. One part of me loved it, and another one hated it.One side of me loved Bjork's dramatic performance, the other side thought that the musical interludes (which must have been written specifically for her) took away from the flow and made the movie too long, even though I loved some of the music. At the same time it put us in the main character's (Selma's) frame of mind.One side of me understood and admired Selma for doing everything to make sure that her son had a future. The other side made me angry at her and everyone involved in making this film for not doing anything about her predicament. It didn't have to end the way it did. She could have said something, and I'm sure there would be lawyers lining up to work for free. But she chose the simplest way out to get what she wanted. But I guess in the end it would make this a hollowood/disney ending, and I'm sure that's exactly what the makers of this film didn't want.</fullReview>

She plays a poor immigrant who is trying to save money to pay for her son's eye operation. Things get worse as she loses her own vision totally and falls victim to a cruel gambler.Lars von Trier directs this graunchy film in the typical camera-swinging style of dogme films. Most of the filming is done in very cool tones which takes a little getting used to, but it does an excellent job of creating an enormous contrast between real life and Selma's day-dream world of song and dance.Catherine Deneuve is convincing in her portrayal of Selma's best friend. She gives this film a real touch of class (as usual).This film will take you on an emotional roller-coaster ride - be warned!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard-Edged Musical Will Polarize Viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing about "Dancer in the Dark" that makes me not want to flat out sing its praises is that it is essentially Von Trier remaking his own already controversial masterpiece "Breaking the Waves" as an even more polarizing, grimmer, operatic musical starring of all people, Icelandic pop princess Bjork (who has vowed never to act again because of how much Von Trier put her through). Bjork is almost so "GOOD" (both in her naive character, and her naive performance) to the point of annoyance. She is an immigrant factory worker who is going blind and dreams about being the star of her own Hollywood style musical while striving to save up money so her son can have eye surgery and not have to suffer her same fate. One of the most annoying things about the film is that the disease is never fully explained (my thinking was Von Trier simply made it up for his artistic purposes) and seems sloppy and contrived (she has to be blind so she can dance in the dark, see?). Apart from that, he is retreading the same ideas and themes of goodness and sacrifice he did more astutely in "Breaking the Waves" with many of the same filming techniques (apart from the hauntingly beautiful musical numbers). It all makes for a very strange film you will either love or loathe, unless you are like me, a die-hard Von Trier fan who longs for him to return to his "Zentropa" style of film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dont want to spoil this movie, but think of the saddest, most tragic things that can possibly happen to a working class woman who is going blind and put them in a movie with touching muscial scenes that are in stark contrast to the reality of the woman's life. It's absolutley awful, but makes for a serious movie. The claustrophobic filming adds to the frustrating-ness of the plot, which by the way is extremely frustrating. It's downright cruel. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** my husband and i both like bjork's music. he loves the film, i don't.i enjoyed the movie up to a point.my big problem is how unrealistic the courtroom scene is. yes, court appointed attorneys are notorious for not doing anything for the defendant. however, the judge should have known better, as well as the jury. this for me really is what kills the movie for me.spoiler----i can't remember the character's name that joel grey plays, but he has the same name supposidly as selma's father. (or maybe she just used it because he was a famous czec actor). but still, any thinking person would have asked the question....maybe her father has the same name? (but that is really beside the point because she didn't send the money to her father)the fact that she holds her secret so tight and won't let anyone help her, even in court on the stand. how ignorant can the eye dr. be? he was fooled by selma into thinking she could see. just all these holes that set it up so selma would die in the end. blech.my husband on the other hand loves the acting, loves the story. we agree that the music is good. i enjoyed most of the music/dance scenes except for the last one in prison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No other movies could make me depressed as this movie did. After I finished it, I had to catch a deep breath and shook my head to make myself get out of the shadow of Selma. Do not want to talk about the logics in the movie though there were some plots to question. Just follow the director's will and feel the music and dance with Selma. The movie were well shot with bright color and good music. I had thought Selma could face the death peacefully. However, it was turned out that " better live than to die ". Struggling to be alive is the instinct of any creature. We are born to be alive and we should be grateful for being alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching, "Breaking the Waves" I was not sure any other movie could make me feel as strongly about a film as that one did. It took months before I could get Emily Watson's character out of my mind. "Dancer in the Dark" certainly has left an equal if not greater scar in my memory. It may be foolish of me to try and pinpoint exactly what Lars von Trier does that evokes so much emotion from me, but both of these films have left me unable to escape those worlds, more so than most films I have seen. People may criticize his style, his subject matter and ultimately his filmmaking, but I do not support any of those opinions. He is comparable to no other director. His characters are true and real and their emotions are brutally honest. During both films, I was literally left wrenching on the floor in pain, but unable to turn away. This fact alone is reason enough for me to pledge my undying support for this man and his work.Now then, every character in this film deserves praise, but Bjork's performance is something special. I am once again left bewildered by the pompous and ignorant attitude of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences. It was already completely laughable that Julia Roberts' turn as Erin Brockovich was better any ANY REGARD than Ellen Burstyn's Sara Goldfarb. But, that the Academy did not even nominate Bjork??? This performance was not even worth mentioning on this side of the ocean, yet played a HUGE part in this film winning the Palm d'Or at Cannes? I don't necessarily give awards, particularly OscarsT, much merit. I am sure Ms. Burstyn and Bjork did not accept these roles or put what they did into them for the accolades. But it would be nice to believe that certain performances, especially those that require something of the person portraying them, would receive at least a congratulatory show of appreciation from the film community. Bjork deserves praise for what she gave us. She didn't even want to be in this film and what she offers the audience is something, for lack of a better adjective, amazing. I feel for Selma. I want, like Catherine Deneuve's character, to save her. And the conclusion is only that much more powerful after the audience has invested over two hours to her life.As for the filming itself, I applaud the use of 100 cameras. I applaud Lars von Trier's undying pursuit of some unique way for the audience to experience a film. People can criticize its effectiveness, but not its merit. Though it usually sounds pompous to offer such a word to describe someone's attempts, I think it was a brave choice. He is obviously not afraid to fail and for that reason alone will never have that problem in my eyes.I wish I could recommend this film to everyone, but I can fully understand that it is not meant for all to see. Those that are willing to succumb fully and totally to the moving pictures brought before you, please do so. It is an emotional trip that you may never experience again. You may love it or hate it, but I cannot imagine you being left indifferent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are no words to express the immense gratitude I have for Lars Von Trier for directing this film. It could be the most raw, emotionally spell binding piece of cinema ever put on film. Everything in this movie is so raw. The cinematography, the acting, the direction.Who knew that Bjork could be such a fantastic discovery. I truly never believed that she had that in her, being a fan of her music previous to the viewing of this movie. This movie doesn't make you sympathetic for Selma. You experience her heartache with her, and with that experience comes a tremendous amount of empathy. It could quite possibly be more empathy than you knew existed within you. This movie is emotionally engaging. The last 30 minutes of the film, your eyes become fixated on the screen. With the crescendo building, it leads you into the unforgettable climax of an ending. It is sobering and yet uplifting at the same time.You leave this film with an overwhelming sense of responsibility to mold yourself into a better person. You leave truly grateful to be alive with a newly restored faith in humanity and I thank Lars for that</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Away from reality...the best experience ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie! I hadn't seen any acting from Björk before, and I was so shocked after what I saw. She resembles imaginative and creative people so well...probably because she is like that in real life. Surrealist films are, in my opinion, the most complex, deep, artistic and of course mad, of all. It takes a genious mind to make something so crazy and beautiful like Dancer...It certainly isn't an all audiences movie, and that's the part I enjoy the most. To go and see a movie that nobody, except a few, likes, to hear the complains "that didn't make any sense" "I can't believe how ridiculous some movies can be", are the most wonderful experiences I can have in my weekends, why?, well, simply because it makes me feel special. A lot of people (critic people, good kind people) suffer when they have to be with "empty headed". My advice is they should start feeling privileged, because there aren't too many persons in the world like that. For empty headed people, life is just a reality show, yes, that: a REALITY show. When they are forced, in some way or other, to watch a deep (crazy) movie, they usually don't understand it and so they "criticise" it (or so they think). It would be my pleasure to make those persons disappear, but, where would the fun be in then?. In a way, it's good (convenient) to have them. The good tasted people aren't so few anyway, and we can manage to appreciate 10/10 films (Dancer..., The Hours, and so more) pretty well without them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film starts out with a very lighthearted and corny mood. By the time you get to the halfway point however, you have been sucked deeper and deeper into the utterly tragic story.This film is extremely emotional and sad. Definitely not for anyone who is not prepared for extreme emotional response this film creates. I couldn't talk after it ended for a while because it was so intense.And i have to say that Bjork did a great job. I think the film would have been a far different affair with somebody else cast in this role. She was perfect for this part, i don't think anybody else (at least VERY few) could have pulled off this particular brand of naivete and innocence.So my opinion is that this film is indeed great and one of a kind. I don't think i'll ever forget it but it was so emotional and disturbing that i don't know if i'd watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An impressive mélange, in which early Ingmar Bergman surfaces, we get a whiff of a "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" style all-singing-all dancing lumberjack number (on the train), and the overall feel is akin to that of Dennis Potter's "Pennies from Heaven" (no, NOT the crappy film version), right down to the courtroom travesty and the tragic misunderstandings and the lead's inability to cope with the real world but her aptness for a make-believe universe of Hollywood numbers and romantic songs. Excellent casting that defies the odds - who'd have thought Björk could have pulled it off? - and a sombre mesmerising quality that persuades one to keep watching (saw it on TV) even though the beginning is a bit shaky and you know it's only going to end in tears. Easy to see how it caused such diverging opinions in Cannes, and doubly easy to see why some people prefer the spectacle and glitz of "Moulin Rouge" - a film that doesn't come within a country mile of it for power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't really tell how much this movie touched me. It was perhaps the strange 50's universe created by it - and brilliantly deconstructed in those musical scenes, it was perhaps Björk's performance, it was perhaps the supporting cast, I really can't tell. But a film packing this lot of emotions is really rare. If you are easily impressionable, I suggest to have caution when seeing this. From start to finish, this is a journey through the life of a central character, and also through our strength as viewers. Lars von Trier created an unique movie, which doesn't allow comparison with no other, which makes this an even more impressive experience. Björk takes the screen and our hearts as Selma. The musical sequences are so out of order with the movie's reality that when they appear you won't be able to control the emotions of having yourself finding that the movie's tampering with our wishes and the dream worlds we create for ourselves. No words to describe it, really - you have to witness it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay film, but not as good as I had expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the film I encourage you to stop now, as I will talk about the ending. If you haven't seen "Breaking the waves" either I also advise you to stop reading. I can recommend that film to everyone in the world though! As most movies (at least among the better movies), this movie went up and down in excitement level and builded itself up. I had heard Lars Von Trier say that this was like writing a part two of "Breaking the waves" and that's the best movie I've ever seen, so I had to see "Dancer in the dark"! I also think that was the reason why I didn't find this movie that good. When I saw it I thought to myself "it's gotta be sad, it's gotta be sad" and let's face it; When a movie is sad it's usually because someone dies in the end. Therefor I could more or less figure out that Selma (Bjork) would die in the end. Okay, there was a movie (or maybe two) where I didn't find the ending really surprising, but still sad, but I won't reveal the titles, in case you haven't seen them. From the moment that Selma gets trialed and sentenced to be hanged I could kind of figure out that she was gonna die and that it would be the climax of the film. When she was standing with the loop around her neck and that guy says he will telephone someone I didn't really get the feeling that she might be saved or something. As far as I could understand, the only thing he phoned for was to hear if she could get hung without the hood on her face and so it didn't come as a surprise really that she died, as it had been evident for a while. Maybe the reason why "Breaking the waves" was so much better to me, was because I had no idea of what film it was when I turned on the TV and I already knew "Dancer in the dark" was going to be sad. I didn't find "Moulin rouge" to be better than okay either (if you haven't seen that one either, stop reading now", as a guy I know said to me "Go see "Moulin rouge", it's the best movie ever made! You have to be a pig if you don't wanna cry in the end", so I knew Nicole Kidman would die. Plus they said so in the middle of movie (the guy who said she had pneumonia). I gave "Dancer in the dark" 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I deliberately avoided this film ever since its release as I was expecting to hate the Dogme 95 style and despise the rather odd Bjork in the title role.Two years is too long to go without seeing this incredible film. The jerky, home move style approach taken by von Trier is an excellent way to capture the realism and humanity of Selma's situation and the audience is on her side right from the start. Her shy, unobtrusive character and her obsession with gay old Hollywood musicals make her an extremely likeable character.Working every hour god sends to save enough money for her son's eye operation despite the deterioration of her own sight is a totally selfless act and it's difficult to imagine anyone other than the impish, pixie-like Bjork playing the role.It's surprising to see Catherine Deneuve in there too but her performance as Kathy is also very strong and the friendship between her and Selma is very charming. Unfortunately, Bjork gets f**ked over like no one else in cinema history so be prepared to weep buckets in the last half hour. A truly original picture made all the more special by the spellbinding performance of the lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had wanted to see Dancer in the Dark when its first came out, however like most people out their, their local cinema complex does not show independent films or non mainstream films, whatever you would like to call them. That they only show big budget films.So when i got the chance to see the film i jumped at the chance. The other reasons why i wanted to see this film was that it was a musical and being a musical lover i wanted to see how good it was. Also their was a lot of praise surrounding the film as well as the leading lady, Bjork winning awards for her role.Well, in my opinion Bjork comes across as eccentric and if i have offended any Bjork fans i apologize. Because of this i wondered if she could act, and boy was i surprised.This film is incredible, it still manages to achieve what it set out to do, even though it is shot on DV. As a documentary student hoping one day to make a film, it is these films that inspire you.And of course Bjork, fantastic, i can understand why she won so many film awards for her acting. She moved me to tears, and any actor or actress that can do that is worthy of an award.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's nothing like tragedy for sobering you up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cruel machinery of Capital and Macarthyism savages Selma, handicapped single mother and refugee from Communist Czechoslovakia, until her naive American dream is cruelly and comprehensively destroyed. Yet, out of the total ruin of her impossibly romantic vision there arises - through the miracle of her (literally) blind faith in her dream - the hope of a new generation, when she succeeds in bequeathing to her son a Promised Land that must forever be hidden from her own darkening prospect. [PARAGRAPH]The hyper-reality of the musical escapes, which Selma's mind is forced through the harshness and disappointment of her impoverished life in America to indulge, deploy an impressive range of cinematic tricks. Von Trier is thoughtfully demonstrating the unhealthy nature of the culture that Hollywood services. This is a machine-culture, just as the Soviet model which Selma sought to escape is a Robot culture, and her tragic fantasies of transforming such crude machinery into the stuff of dreams - a la the American musical - are no better than escapist delusion. There comes to mind the famous reflection of Marx, regretting another cultural 'opium', that was such a need of the People in a hostile capitalist culture. [PARAGRAPH]Ultimately, the film deliberately follows Selma's saving intuition that fantasy-closure is a false closure: Both the character Selma and the director insist that the 'last' musical escape from unbearable reality is nothing of the kind. Just as, in childhood, Selma loved to leave the cinema before the last number, so as to allow the film to play on into her everyday experience, so von Trier refuses the musical's traditionally crafted formulae of neat closure. As in the theatre of Euripides, we are given only the appearance of intervention by some reliable mechanical agency external to the ineluctable logic of the action, and are left with a chilly realisation of the irrelevance of all human artifice and contrivance.  [PARAGRAPH]It is with this understanding that it is only the striving for absolute integrity that can hope to redeem humanity that von Trier vindicates his own oft-quoted Dogme manifesto with a moral dimension. In that much misunderstood document, a responsible film-maker just seeks to remind himself and anyone who cares to listen that creative falsity should be avoided: He declares himself to be an enemy of the facile and the formulaic, which are the stock-in-trade of the industrial manufacturers of mere entertainment.  [PARAGRAPH]Thus, the musical 'escapes' are the cruellest parts of the film, and the audience's manufactured pleasures are predicated on Selma's pain. It is deliberately contrived that the execution suite reminds us of the tiny amateur rehearsal stage for Selma's beloved 'Sound of Music': The ultimate escape, for us as for Selma, is from man's vicious contrivances. The spectacle of dancing in the dark finally seems like an access of shame and guiltiness on the director's part for his complicity in this relentless tragedy of a blameless, if perhaps mistaken, life: A complete aversion of the agent of sight, in a kind of upward-rolling cinematic faint, obliterates the uniquely visual nature of the medium. No shallow theme-park shudder can shake off this existential horror. And yet ... this juddering fearful monster is the breathing human heart: Terrible, but irreduceably it is Life, it is what makes us human. [PARAGRAPH]It strikes one that there are themes here that could be pursued also, with some benefit, in a study of Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange', recently re-released. From a Dogme point of view, it has recently struck me that Kubrick sees his own film as just another clockwork orange - just another disappointing toy, drained of all substance. Where Kubrick employed an increasingly abused Beethoven (and his misguided 'disciple' Alex) as an epic measure of modernity's meaninglessness, so von Trier gives us Bjork's child-like musical grace as a comparable measure of the terrible Fall of Man. It is neither the abominably misguided Alex, nor the naively confused Selma ('Silly Selma' as she calls herself) who are to blame for the state of this world. Of course, they are its necessary victims. They are both subject to cultural formulae of near-diabolical power, that influence them in ways they do not understand. The crude commercial materialism of Kubrick's Dystopia is as much the villain of his piece as is the 'happy-ever-after' Panglossianism that has so nearly seduced Selma, in von Trier's. [PARAGRAPH]In both films, we are appalled by the reductive effect which modern culture, and even the very medium of communication, has upon the individual. This is the surest demonstration of the necessity of such unblinking creative honesty. Such individuals purify human experience, by their lonely willingness to confront the dark places of human experience. We are not far from the Aristotelian notion of 'catharsis', or purgation, in thinking so. Ours is a society sickened by a surfeit of addictive trash. Well, there's nothing like tragedy for sobering you up. It is a paradox often observed since the days of the earliest Greek dramas, that the spectacle of horror - conveyed not crudely, but with humane empathy, be it understood - is morally purifying. In this context, it is the censors who are the immoralists. Kubrick, of course, spared his film from the fate of being regarded as smut only fit for suppression, by withdrawing it himself. It had become a clockwork orange in the hands of the cultural arbiters. And its disappearance was another act in the tragedy of Alex - as the refusal by von Trier to conform to the commercial demands of the entertainment industry finds its dramatic counterpart in the musical delusions of Selma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly beautiful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director is a brilliant young talent.But it is Bjorks performance as "Selma" that is the heart and soul and beauty of this film. Selma is beaten down by life; a disease means her eyesight is slowly degenerating to blindness, she never knew her father, her son will get the disease too unless he has an operation. So Selma saves money, gets it stolen by her neighbour and ends up in Prison.This film is about how despite all life and the external world may try to to crush you and hurt you, if you believe in yourself and love your family and friends, our human spirit can soar above this petty world and be victorious.Its also about the greatest, purest form of love known in human existence:the love a mother has for her children.And the fact that a mother is willing to sacrifice her own life (here, literally) for her children.Bjork's fragility , her unconformity in a conventional world, her sense of humour and joy are ultimately what make this film so moving.I have an instinct that the people who dislike this film have become too cynical and jaded by our society of greed and violence.And the people who love it (like me), give me hope because they still believe in innocence, in honesty and trust, and havent forgotten the joy of truly being alive, and what true love and courage really means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't attempt to explain what this movie is about, because its simply so well done its beyond my capability to explain it to you. I'm not what you would call a musical lover. In fact, I'm the exact opposite. I'm a guy, who enjoys techno and video games. I am what you would call a geek. But when I happened to find this movie, completely by chance, I found myself drawn to it the instant I began watching it.At first I felt I was betraying my morals, I would never watch a movie that was technically a musical. But as it progressed, so did I. The movie you could say is dark, you could say its enlightening, but I hate to label something that passes beyond typical labels. Most movies have some background or history in another, but this movie holds no bases, its a pure story of truth. This is not a movie you've seen before, not a type of movie you'll probably ever see again, and not a type of movie that you'll watch ever again. Yes I said it, you'll watch it once, and that'll be it. The movie is so much like life that it comes and goes through yours, and once its gone, you realize that you've got one in front of you.I cannot relate this movie to anyone I could know, because honestly it stumps me who would like it and who wouldn't. I know musical fans, david lynch fans, drama fans who all would probably want to see it, but the fact that it passed my book amazes me. I throw stones at movies I don't like and my standards don't buckle easily, but to take a movie that has a musical basis and a dramatic tone usually for me drops my interest flat.If I'm correct, and somehow this isn't a bizarre fluke, than this movie passes the genre barrier in its absolutely intense dramatical tone. The type of people I know and the type of people I watched with this are the last audience, the grand frontier of that all movies hope to get but never do, the exact opposite of that target audience which they aim for. The group I know, would have never buckled and should have hated this movie, but they didn't. I've never seen a movie turn us around more than its done. I myself, If I had not known what I do know, would have bet myself a thousand dollars I would not have like this movie. But somehow this movie beat me like I've never been beat before.I cannot persuade you simply by telling you its a great movie. All I can say is that if you say "this isn't my thing", or "I'm not into this type of movie", then your DEAD WRONG. This isn't a movie you could ever label, its not a movie you could ever judge by its cover. Beneath that rough exterior is a movie that reaches out to you, and shows you what is true and shows you what is real.The movie is more real than you could ever know, and this movie is in a genre that we may not ever find again. This genre is that of our lives, our lives are what we cannot choose to like or dislike, because we are born that way. A movie about life also has this... We cannot choose to like it or not, we can only simply watch and understand. Then move on with our lives, although we will take theirs with us. This is the essence of all film.But that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Björk's triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached 'Dancer in the Dark' with a great deal of ignorance. I was familiar with Lars von Trier from his earlier film 'Zentropa' (aka Europa Europa), a film I found intellectually stimulating, emotionally satisfying and generally a finely crafted tale of fascism that was more cohesive than Bertolucci's attempt at same in his 'The Damned', a film that is over-the-top in many wonderful ways and remains a favorite of mine. This, then, must mean that 'Dancer in the Dark' rates pretty highly in my film library, and it does. But I had no familiarity with the leading actress beyond having seen her in various bizarre garbs on album covers and magazine blurbs that tended to point out only the more sensational aspects of her life. But I always felt a warmth towards her, having been a flutist myself, as is she, and her having performed in 'The Sound of Music' so often in Iceland as she does in the film at hand. She revealed a wry sense of humor and acute intellect in her interviews so I was inclined to like her but had to admit that what songs of hers I'd heard on the radio were decidedly not for me. Björk's songs in the film are not chart-toppers but they make for a superb film-score. There are two particularly memorable song and dance numbers, the most briliant of which is set on the flatbeds of a freight train, clacking slowly through the woods. Unforgettable! The choreography and camera-work is magnificent. The other memorably adhesive song and dance takes place near the end of the film in the prison. Björk does most of the singing and dancing, except for a cameo turn for Joel Grey in a courtroom scene. And she is a brilliant actress in a very natural manner. All self-regarding "method" actors could learn 5 years' worth of acting classes from the Strasberg Academy by studying her performance here, which is not "studied" at all. Neither is she just playing Björk playing someone named Selma. The character has infested the very cells of her body with its essence and Selma lives, vibrantly and painfully before us on the screen. And Björk has nothing to fear from the great and powerful Catherine Deneuve who plays her friend, Cathy. Together they eclipse all others around them and those others are quite something. This film sports one of the finest ensemble casts I've seen since 'Citizen Kane'. The women are especially good, notably Cara Seymour as the wife of the murdered cop and most especially Siobhan Fallon as the prison wardeness. With her big institutional shoes and her hair scraped back into a tight little bun she manages to embody a depth of compassion rarely experienced in a film performance. She is an Angel of Mercy forced into the role of Gate Keeper to one of the more horrible circles of hell we've created in our world and her performance next to Björk's innocence and goodness is deeply moving. 'Dancer in the Dark' is probably a brilliant "one-off". Musicals may or may not come back into vogue but they won't be made on such themes as this film has been based. The moneyed flick-makers in Hollywoodland would say "It's too dark! Get outta my office and write me a comedy for Ben Affleck and Jennifer Anniston! And put plenty a' sex innit too!" (Door slams in screenwriter's face).It is for that reason, but not that reason alone, that 'Dancer in the Dark' will become a classic, though probably not a mainstream classic, but of the cult fringes of the self-annointed "cognoscenti" which is too bad in a way because it should be required viewing for all, especially high school students who aren't being taught ethics, morality or kindness either at home or in school. And with the morally bankrupt garbage pouring out of Hollywood besieging their impressionable minds they need all the help they can get. 'Dancer in the Dark' is an extreme cautionary tale teetering on the edge of the apocalypse. It tells us that if you dare express your goodness, preserve your innocence and wonder at life and stand up for your principals in the face of the corruption that surrounds you, you may well end up dead before your time. A must-see film. A great film. And I must do everything I can to get tickets for the Bayreuth Festival in 2006 when Mr von Trier will be the producer of The Ring of the Nibelungen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who said that the history is unreal, I would like to ask a question: `in which world are you living in????', because if you think that no one can have that kind of bad luck and misfortune, you better think again because actually life is worst.I found the piece just outstanding, beautiful, dark, painful and depressive; I mean I've never cried that much in any other movie. I hate musicals but this movie is so far to being one, I mean is the perfect antithesis of all of them, is the proof that not all the musicals have to be dull and for the people who think that the dance and music parts are not necessary, let me explain to you that the girl was daydreaming.Bjork was just amazing, and don't get me wrong I used to hate her but I've found it so talented and gifted that I'm thinking about reviewing her material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all the music. When I first heard of "Industrial Music", the clatter, clash, bang, of factory machinery was exactly what came to mind. I love the sounds that introduced the songs. The story was an okay idea, but needed better writers because I've been more intrigued observing what happens when a tooth sits in a glass of cola for a month. Well, outside of the musical numbers.The ending was great for two reasons: A) the suddenness of it. B) the movie was finally over and I could go on to doing more exciting things, like picking out my belly lint for starters.If it wasn't for Bjork, I don't think anybody except for a few friends of the cast and crew would have seen this film. She is a true artist.Lastly, get a new camera crew! I've been steadier after drinking 120 ounces of malt liquor. I was wide-awake and completely sober watching this, but after a while I felt like I had just spent a couple hours going for a ride in the clothes dryer. Or maybe it was supposed to be dizzying to descend your mind into the "madness"?That's a wrap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I will admit there is a small part of my own self that "hates" this movie, but it is the same part of myself that got teary eyed at the end of Titanic. It is the conventionality in me that wants to boo at the film, and it is the same conventionality that wants to see Independence Day again just for those damn cool effects. Yes, our society is a product of itself, but this movie certainly is not. The larger part of myself that "loves" this movie is what brought me to this page. It's originality, creativity, bravery, courage, strength, to be what it is, leads me to call this movie my absolute favorite gosh darn piece of art i have ever encountered. It made me love the part of me that hated it, and hate the part of me that loved it. It left me jaw dropped, yet lips zipped. I have never encountered any feeling like this before from a piece of art. I have never felt so cut up, and then put back together like this before.  The fact that this movie is both passionately loved and hated, gives it a certain power over many other movies that are just "really liked." I felt the very sides of both ends within myself. And it left me speechless. I cannot question those who hate the movie, for then i must question those who love it. I can only look into my own self and thank Von Trier, Bjork, and those involved for finally giving me a film that has stayed with me ever since the day I saw it, not just a temporarily hour and a half distraction that leaves me the second its over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The controversy that surrounds this film is easy to recognise, however this plays no part into how unique and moving this film actually is. Bjork, may be not the strongest actor, but she makes a smashing debut on screen combining her acting and musical skills into a rollercoaster of amazing visuals and breathtaking dance and singing scenes.With a strong storyline that is both realistic yet a slight hint of surreal essence makes this story one that will stay with the you forever. From the first moment the audience meet Selma (Bjork) they are instantly attached to her character, making the ending the most shocking yet gratifying I have ever seen.If the chance ever arises to see this film it is more than worth watching. Guaranteed the most moving film that has been made in years, and its documentary style cinematography may come across as uncomforatble at first however this just adds to the realism and fantastic plot. Dancer in the Dark, what can I say?.....The best film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made my heart wrench by its honesty, I sat transfixed throughout all of it, mainly by the extraordinary talent of Bjork, she is just utterly AMAZING and I never considered myself a real fan of hers before this, but I'm sold on her now.Peoples' gripes about the hand-held camera and such made me want to scream, but all that aside, Lars Von Trier's style is admirable, the dance musical scenes were astounding and were fabricated believably to show us Selma's refuge from the harshness of reality. Von Trier seems to revel in his heroines (see also Bess in the knockout film Breaking the Waves) whose goodness and selflessness cannot be understood by society, but I hope that it won't become a standard with him. But he does employ an astonishing array of actors and actresses in all his films. Catherine Deneuve fans will be treated here, David Morse fans will feel no doubt feel frustrated at the lack of screen time and character development that he's given, but it's nice to see this fine actor in any film, my wife certainly loves to see him, especially the shot where he's painting the wall and we get a glimpse of a well-muscled arm that sent her into a frenzy, sheesh!But if you can approach this film in the right frame of mind, congratulate yourself for it and be prepared to marvel in the vast talent that is Bjork's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story is great, Björk is great, but a bad combination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Lars von Trier states in the interview on the DVD, he had a story and he wanted music in it, but he had no idea what kind of music until Björk came along. That shows.The story is a great tragedy and makes the viewer painfully aware of the personal side of some important social issues. Björk is a great singer and interesting person and she really gets into the roll, especially near the end of the movie.But Björk obviously has some difficulty in adapting her style to the story the movie is about, which seems to results in two separate things going on at the same time: Björk doing her thing at one hand and a sad story about a struggling immigrant at the other. For me Björks powerful performance in her own unique style draws a lot of attention away from a story that is definitely worth being told.I would give the story a 9 and Björk an 8, but the combination a 6 at most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I didn't know what to think about this movie. But after watching it, I knew why the film won awards and why so many loved it. Bjork did a really good job. I personally is not a fan of her music, but even so, I have to admit that she is really good in this film. Many people complained about the camera bouncing up and down. I personally didn't find it a problem; instead, the hand held camera technique gave the movie alittle more of a 'personal' touch. This technique was also used in a french film "rosetta" and I liked that film.The movie was carefully thought out as we can see that in her illusional 'musicals', the colors are alot brighter compared to 'reality'. At first, I thought those 'musicals' are not really necessary and they movie would be better without them. But the more I understand about the film, the more I think they play a really important role for the film.Another problem was that it was very tragic and depressing. Maybe it is just me, but I would perfer this rather than those classic hollywood endings where everyone lives happily ever after. I thought the ending was really well done, see when Bjork sang on the rythme of her heartbeat and suddenly, there was silence; and I mean utter silence.But I have to admit this film is not everyone's cup of tea. If you hate watching films like 'naked', 'fight club' or 'requiem for a dream" you may find this movie alittle too depressing. Personally, I give this movie 8.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie showcases Bjork's talents perfectly. You wouldn't think of Bjork as a bright cheery little flower, and she's certainly not portrayed that way in this movie. She does, however, display an amazing array of emotions in this film, producing a fully bloomed character. I enjoyed seeing her both vulnerable and as a woman strong enough to sacrifice herself for someone else. Don't expect fluff here--Bjork drops the anchor.The mesmerizing aspect of this movie is the music. The musical segments are blended in with the scenes so subtly at times that the effect is like being caught in a dream. The factory scenes are also done well as the use of the rhythmic machine sounds merge naturally into the beginnings of Bjork's songs. I wouldn't say that there aren't times when the singing and dancing seem silly, but there's a real effort here to make these sequences come off like daydreams. Bjork's indomitable spirit is able to soar as a result of her imagination's ability to make contact and interact with her environment, regardless of how dire the circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most wonderful and beautiful musical since Moulin Rouge. Actually, it's better then Moulin Rouge!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a HUGE fan of Bjork, and at first, I didn't really want to see this movie, because I heard it was a very dark, and grim movie, which it is. Also, a lot of people that saw it at my mom's work, said that they couldn't finish the movie, because it was so sad and dark, that they left crying half way through them movie. I have seen this movie twice, and enjoyed it just as much each time! This such a great movie and Bjork plays her part very well, as a poor immigrant worker who is loosing her eye sight, but she is working very hard to get enough money so her son won't face the same problem. From what I have seen from the other reviews here, people say that story is hollow, and most scenes are confusing and don't fit in, as if they were dream sequences. Well, that is because everytime there is a song, Selma is actually DAY DREAMING PEOPLE! I am so sick of people saying that it is confusing, and stupid because of they don't seem to realize what happens after each song! Also, everyone is complaining about the wobbly camera work. Seriously, everyone is overexaggerating about it. The camera does not move around "as if the director doesn't even know that the camera is on", commented one reviewer. THAT IS NOT TRUE AT ALL! Sure, it does move around, but because it was filmed mainly with a hand held camera, it gives a very big feeling of realism, because this way you see the real colors of the environments, you see how dark it really is. A movie camera doesn't capture exactly how everything looks, and to use a movie camera to film this movie, it would just ruin the experience, because movie cameras tend to make things have more color and light then they really do. The ending will also make you cry your eyes out. This is a very sad story, and I caught myself crying 5 times during the movie, not only because it is so sad, but also because of how beautiful and captivating it is. The songs are also awesome! Just like what Bjork would do, but they also fit in very well into the movie. "I've Seen It All", or the railroad scene, is definently the best songs, but "107 Steps" is my favorite, because it is so sad, and I cry everytime I listen to it! GREAT MOVIE! 10/10!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodram at its ultimate worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was both horrible and horribly tragic. Besides the gut-wrenching conclusion, the impossibly tragic situations in which the heroin finds herself are only slightly less believable that the fact that she refuses to do anything in her favor to save herself. This contrived ultra-tragedy tosses itself unabashedly over-the-top, far beyond the borders of even the most ridiculous of melodramas. I do, feel that Bjork, though I'm admittedly NOT one of her fans, turns in quite a fine acting performance. More so, I think, than a musical one. She plays Selma, a Czechoslovakian immigrant factory worker who is quickly going blind, but must press on to make sure her sun gets the much needed operation so he does not do the same. I found myself comparing her character to many a Tennessee Williams tragic damsel. Most pointedly, "The Glass Menagerie"'s Amanda. Only Selma's escape from harsh reality is the movie musicals of the early 20th century. In fact, she often imagines herself in nostalgic musical numbers throughout the film. It is the bizarre little musical numbers that are...well...unbearable. Bjork wrote the numbers herself, and they truly are repugnant. The concept behind them may be clever, but the end result seems only half hearted and musically disheveled. Catherine Deneuve's portrayal of the best friend is well done, and "Cabaret"'s Joel grey does a nice job as a Czechoslovakian actor/film-maker. If you are a fan of Bjork, or take some sadistic pleasure in watching helpless puppies get hit by trains, then by all means, check this out. But, if you are looking for a light hearted homage to the big screen musicals of the 20's and 30's, STEER CLEAR!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shaky cameras are annoying elsewhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film. The 100 fixed, synchronised digital cameras were a technical marvel that rivalled the artistry of that other new-millenium neo-musical, Moulin Rouge. HOWEVER, so many people are cheesed off by the handheld cameras used in this picture, and I have to agree. It is not only Mr Von Trier who is guilty of this.I don't know about you, but in my everyday life I don't watch theatre or sport or anything by constantly jerking my head around and twisting my neck and torso for a fragmented, shaky viewing experience. For starters, fellow viewers would probably think I was intoxicated or had epilepsy, and for seconds they would be annoyed that I kept moving and swinging in and out of their own line of sight. When watching something, our own cognitive processing smoothes the less jarring, normal movements as we tilt and turn our heads to follow activity.So, it is not a natural or traditional way to take in a performance. Why do filmmakers and cinematographers adopt this? I deeply regret the time I attended the midnight screening of Blair Witch Project on a full stomach and following several beers... uurggh ... there were only front row seats left as well.I enjoy police and crime dramas on the small and big screen, but lordy why can't they hire a camera crew that DOES NOT exhibit the symptoms of cold-turkey dry tremors? I'm talking about you, NYPD Blue and Law &amp; Order SVU. Why can David Fincher (Fight Club, Seven, Panic Room) make his pictures seem gritty and edgy without inducing nausea? Lars and friends, take note.I hope this technique will be dismissed a brief trend of the late 1990's and NEVER be revived as a fad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant and raw vision by the Knight of Dogme 95, Lars von Trier. This documentary style masterpiece leads us into the life of a fictional character named Selma. It might has well have been a biography, because everything was so honest and unpolished. The reality elevates itself beyond belief when Selma enters herself, her mind, and is transported from a world of suffering and handicap to freedom. Through her dreams, she lives. And through them, she...well you'll have to find out for yourself... Amazing dual soundtrack, and the DVD is very beautifully done, providing audio commentaries and behind-the-dance-scenes. There is also a feature by which viewers can select certain musical sequences to watch. The color and cinematography is picturesque. A high of human emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an Icelander I've known Björk for many years, and never been very interested in her music. As I watched Björk and Lars von Trier on the red carpet in Cannes I wasn't very interested in seeing this movie either. So I didn't go to the cinema to see it and I didn't rent it on video either. But in the easter, it was on the national TV station here in Iceland. I didn't have much to do, so I sat down and decided to at least try to watch it.In the beginning I thougt maybe it could be a three star film. So I watched and watched....and in the end I was so stunned that I didn't have words to describe my feelings. It's absolutely a four star film and I gave it 10 out of 10.Björk's acting is enormous, the screenplay is almost perfect...and the whole film is so dramatic that you could almost cry!The Academy should be ashamed. The film only got one Academy Award nomination, for best original song for 'I've Seen It All'. This movie is much better than Erin Brockovich and Gladiator!So...next time you go to the video rental store, rent 'Dancer in the Dark' instead of some teen comedy trash!</fullReview>

Not everyone can, which is strictly a matter or personal taste (not good taste or bad taste or no taste).Lars von Trier is one of the most visionary and innovative directors working today BECAUSE he takes big creative chances. This also means that not just anyone can appreciate (or even make it through) many of his films. That's perfectly alright. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas and Robert Zemeckis or directors like them, who take less chances, but know how to craft competent movies, will be around to entertain the masses. There's a place, an audience and a purpose for all these filmmakers and you're either on base with von Trier's thinking or not.Personally, I can enthusiastically say that this is my kind of film. It's seems fresh, exciting and original. It intentionally goes out of it's way to challenge the limitations and themes established by the movie/stage musical a long, long time ago; something the more critically acclaimed (and of course, much bigger budgeted) MOULIN ROUGE didn't exactly succeed with. Still present here from the Golden Age musicals are song/dance numbers and a rather pedestrian plot. New here are two elements of tragedy, so out of context in the film musical I'm accustomed to("where nothing dreadful ever happens") and brutal, that they pack a real wallop. New here is reasoning behind all the jovial singing and dancing (it's in the lead character's head...need I remind you that people in the street don't just sing and dance for no reason). New here is gritty, realistic photography and camerawork (Dogma95 at work, I'm sure), not garish costumes, sets and colors hogging the spotlight.And new here is Bjork as Selma...whose simpleton character, as written, is often frustrating, irritating and unbelievable. What overcomes the limitations within Selma and the script is Bjork herself, who more than fills in the gaps with an excellent performance. She just has this incredible, sort-of angelic presence that is (maybe effortlessly) full of kindness, honesty, believability and humanity. She's really impressive and this may not have worked at all without her. Too bad she's declared she'll never act again -- I appreciate her presence much more than the pack of phony, glossy, "pretty" Hollywood stars with very limited talent we all get shoved in our faces.And, oh yeah, long live the great Catherine Deneuve (there's a beauty that actually deserves some acclaim)!Score: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

New here is gritty, realistic photography and camerawork (Dogma95 at work, I'm sure), not garish costumes, sets and colors hogging the spotlight.And new here is Bjork as Selma...whose simpleton character, as written, is often frustrating, irritating and unbelievable. What overcomes the limitations within Selma and the script is Bjork herself, who more than fills in the gaps with an excellent performance. She just has this incredible, sort-of angelic presence that is (maybe effortlessly) full of kindness, honesty, believability and humanity. She's really impressive and this may not have worked at all without her. Too bad she's declared she'll never act again -- I appreciate her presence much more than the pack of phony, glossy, "pretty" Hollywood stars with very limited talent we all get shoved in our faces.And, oh yeah, long live the great Catherine Deneuve (there's a beauty that actually deserves some acclaim)!Score: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DANCER IN THE DARK (2000) Dir. Lars Von TrierVon Trier seems to court controversy with whatever film he chooses to make. 'Breaking the Waves' his debut film stirred up people for his frank depiction of polygamous sex. His award-winning Dogme movie 'The Idiots' horrified people for its subject matter and brief shots of real sexual activity between some of its stars some four or so years before the so-called 'groundbreaking' 'Intimacy'. 'Dancer in the Dark' contains no such pornography or indeed any sexual activity whatsoever. Instead Von Trier has chosen to make a musical about the death penalty. Which is nice.'Dancer in the Dark' tells the tale of Czech-immigrant Selma (Björk) brought up in her country on American musicals. Entranced by the depiction of America in these movies she emigrates hoping for a better life. Selma, however, harbours a dark secret. She is afflicted with a hereditary blinding disease that eats away at her sight as she grows older. She works horrendous hours of every day and night to save up to pay for an operation that will give her son the chance of a life free of blindness. To keep herself from slipping into a deep depression, every time she hears or feels a beat she imagines herself breaking into a spontaneous song and dance routine like she had seen so many times in her childhood. As the movie progresses we get to witness her life crumbling and falling apart around her.The film, as you would have guessed from the synopsis, is relentlessly downbeat but what makes this a film worth seeing, however, is its almost technical perfection. The songs created by Björk are beautiful and entrancing; the acting is incredibly realistic, great, believable dialogue with shaky documentary-esque camera work, which just heightens the deception that these people are actually real. The only flaw in Von Trier's otherwise perfect film is the choreography during the song and dance routines. Whereas in the golden age of musicals, in which Selma was brought up in, magic was given out by the bucket-load in here there is much less magic, it seems to be subtler. Perhaps this was what Von Trier intended and most people would probably be able to give him the benefit of the doubt. If you like watching movies just to be entertained then give this movie a wide berth, if however, you enjoy watching great movies then this one is absolutely unmissable.(9)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thousand Eyes of Lars Von Trier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is a controversial figure to say the least, and he revels in it, using it as his main marketing too. After a first run of very visually stylized films, culminating in Europa, Von Trier went back to basics. In fact, he chose to redefine what basics meant altogether, and spearheaded the Dogma 95 movement. Genius or gimmick? There's always a fair mix of both with Von Trier, and if the Mad Dane has proved anything, it's that rules are meant to be broken.Dancer in the Dark is the story of Selma, a Czeck immigrant working in miserable conditions to save money for her son's operation, hoping to save him from one day slowly turning blind like her. Selma is a naive woman in love with old Hollywood musicals, and her favorite refuge from everyday life is her fantasy musical parallel reality, scored to the rhythmic beatings of factory machines.Von Trier's main gimmicks end up saving him: first, the casting of Bjork, whose performance and music for the film are spellbinding and, surprisingly, in his handling of the visuals: the whole film, shot in anamorphic miniDV, has a rather murky look (much like the decaying vision of it's heroine). The musical scenes, however, benefit form a unique technique: filmed in saturated tones, the musical numbers were filmed live from thousands of static cameras. This gives everything a life and sense of chaos far removed from the Golden Age of musicals.The story, classic melodrama of the highest and most contrived order, can only feel subdued and real in such delirious format, and it is a miracle that what on paper might read as a recipe for a very pretentious disaster works to such effect.For better or worse, this is one of the most extreme, challenging and memorable film experiences you are likely to come across.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this film. Bjork delivers a heartbreaking performance, and her supporting cast (led by Catherine Denuve) was excellent. This is a type of film I have never seen before - a Musical Film Noir. The juxtaposition of Bjork's singularly unique electronic music with von Trier's dark and tragic story has produced something very special. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New found respect for Bjork...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the negative comments here regarding DITD, I've come to a few conclusions...1. The freedom to express ones opinion is an extraordinary one and not to be taken lightly. 2. The Internet gives voice to far too many people of dubious intelligence. 3. To pan DITD for anything related to its emotional nature is to reveal, potentially, how completely and irredeemably shallow one is.Okay, so much for my humble opinion. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let me say that, at one point during my first viewing of DITD--it might be my last viewing, too--I said to my companion that Bjork's performance reminded me of Falconetti's in Dreyer's PASSION OF JOAN ARC. After viewing the film, I read that, indeed, von Trier counts among his heros Carl Dreyer. I'm not a fan of von Trier nor have I seen his other films, so finding this out began to give me something of a place to start in dealing with the way it touched me. Not being a Bjork fan and not having any of her recordings, I have to say, too, that I have a new found respect for this artist. She's extraordinary in this film, and I will give her music a thorough listening very soon.The only fault that I can find with the film is that Deneuve doesn't have a larger role. Kathy's, Deneuve's character, interactions with Bjork's Selma, for me, highlighted the film; additionally, Kathy's last interaction with Selma is, in my opinion, is among the greats of cinema.As for viewing the film, again, and as much as I would like to watch it with my mother, I don't know if I can. Its insight into human nature might just be too much for me.</fullReview>

I think that the way the music is incorporated into the dream sequences works very well, and is an important addition to the story line. **POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW**In the last part of the movie, it reminds me of a terminally ill patient with a DNR (do not resuscitate) request form on record. In Selma's situation, just prior to her final situation, along comes someone to prolong her suffering. I think that you will enjoy this movie. I rate it 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Well despite the European penchant for intellectualising themselves out of their so-called imagined existance I watch films to be stimulated and moved and occasionally gain real insights into the world. This film is for anyone who has had to fight to preserve their dreams. Björk is truly spellbinding as is the extraordinary original music score. At first the somewhat amateurish photography is a distraction, but that doesn`t last. This is a genuine original.

		<fullReview>I usually judge movies by how they make me feel, if a scary movie can make me scared, it's a good movie. If a love story can make me all warm and fuzzy, it's a good movie. When I first saw this movie, I wasn't really sure what kind of movie it was going to be. The camera movements set me off guard at first, but after a while I got used to it. And then, GOOD GOD! Someone being slowly shot to death is the last thing I wanted to see! And somehow, in it's magnificent way, it hurts so much to watch! I actually walked out for a few minutes during that part. What I think is really remarkable about this is when people are dying left and right in the typical Hollywood film, we don't give it a second thought. But in this movie, we can actually feel empathy for the characters involved. I don't like watching tragedies. But it takes a lot to make a movie with such powerful scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deserved winner of Palme D'or at Cannes 2000, This movie is a work of magic. An ordinary story told in a somewhat strange style(Of course not to Von Trier fans)and boosted by a knockout, bravura performance by the Bizarre-singing Icelander Bjork(I really wonder how he talks the actresses into this but I can never forget Emily Watson's Performance in "Breaking The Waves" either)and the rest of the cast of multinational talents. Von Trier's cinematic style may sound jarring and incomprehensible for some viewers(Again I'm talking about casual movie-watchers)but the brilliance is way down inside the facade and it genuinely captivates. She sees her life as a Hollywood musical and all her dreams are brought to life in a musical fashion that's absolutely unique and intriguing. she stays honest until the heartbreaking finale and carries her secret to her grave.Maybe HONESTY ISN'T THE BEST POLICY.

		<shortDescription>Musical turned on its ear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Lars von Trier mocking Hollywood musicals and their shallow, absurd plots, or is he instead paying homage? One can't ignore that "Dancer in the Dark" contains a pathetically simplistic (even manipulative) plot much like the typical Hollywood musical. What's interesting is that even though the plot's shortcomings are obvious, the film is still moving, particularly the performances of Bjork and Peter Stormare. They brought wonderful purity to their roles, no pretense. They exuded an air of bewilderment, as if they were in survival mode here in America, and this falls in line with their circumstances as immigrants, not to mention Bjork's blindness. Bjork's performance is one of the more truthful performances one will ever see.I think von Trier neither mocks nor pays homage with "Dancer in the Dark". Instead, he takes the typical simplistic plot of a musical and follows it to a conclusion that's just as reasonable and logical as the usual "happy ending". In that sense, perhaps von Trier mocks America as a whole, an America he seems to view as one out of touch with reality. If Hollywood musicals choose to ignore real life in America, then von Trier has sought to reveal it as he sees it.</fullReview>

But she is almost blind and she knows that her son Gene will have the same problem. When he is operated round his 13th birthday he will have his sight for the rest of his life. Selma has almost all the money, but her neighbor , Bill (David Morse) steals it. Selma discovers this and she goes to him to get the money. She kills him and she is accused of murder. At the end she will die.Lars von Trier makes a very moving film with a lot of good performances. Only the music wasn't that good.Rating: ***1/2 out of **** or 8,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I completely agree with everything reviewer Donny Hathaway said. This movie affected me so much that it had me crying non stop at the end. No other film has done this to me before. I couldn't stop. I was embarrassed! I was really surprised with how this film affected me. I was first put off by that shaking camera action(ala "NYPD Blues") but it turned into more like a documentary of Selma's life. Those fantasy musical sequences were fantastic. Strange but they seemed to fit into Selma's child-like reality.Catherine Deneuve was great as Selma's close pal. It fun watching her dance around and sing. She had this look of disbelief on her face. I have to say that I was very surprised by the performance of Bjork. I like her music and her quirky style ever since she was with the group The Sugarcubes back in the 80's. One of her 90's solo videos was picked for MTV's top 100 videos of all time. In that video she is simply walking down an average street and suddenly burst into song and dance, just like "Dancer". Maybe this gave the director the idea to cast her. She was perfect for the role and deserved an Oscar nomination for this. Like reviewer Donny Hathaway said, she WAS Selma!! I could only recommend you to watch this film once. Once was enough for me. I couldn't take it again. Too powerful. A MUST SEE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bjork's impressive drama and Von Trier's parody of musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Czech Selma works in a factory in the US during the 60s. She is going blind, but what obsesses her is the fact that her son has the same disease. She is saving money for his medical surgery, though she will have to pay a high price for her obstinacy to heal the boy. Notwithstanding this simple, soap opera like plot, `Dancer in the Dark' is a great movie. Why? Because it is both effective as drama and original as a reflection on cinema itself. Despite its implausibility and melodramatic quality, the story moves us intensely because pop singer Bjork is impressive as Selma, with her dreamy, naive, fragile, next to retarded expression, captured by a digital camera that intensifies intimacy and gives a documentary aspect to the movie. But director Lars Von Trier does not seem to make drama for the sake of drama; he makes a parody of musicals, by inserting musical-like scenes as arising from Selma's dreamy mind. The effect is intriguing: Trier stretches to the limit the artificiality of musical numbers, their "deus ex machina" unreality, ironically combining and contrasting them with the tragic aspects of the story, as in the torturing final scene. A good provocative movie (8/10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this movie on DVD without knowing much about the movie apart from hearing about Bjork's amazing performance, and her performance IS pretty amazing. The story is touching, however the movie annoyed me when it went into several dance sequences which for me spoiled the emotion that was being evoked. I think I would have enjoyed this film much more if the dance had been taken away. I actually gave the DVD away to a friend who really enjoyed this film after watching it only once. I am not saying this is a bad movie, just not to my taste. If done without the dance it I would have cared more about this move. So, definitely see this if you are looking for something out of the ordinary and a very natural and powerful performance by Bjork (although her final performance according to Bjork; the Director apparently manipulated Bjork in an unforgiving way to 'help' her achieve her performance and she vowed never to act again - which is a shame...)</fullReview>

My friend told me about Dancer in The Dark, and I wasn't that much interested in it. He told me that it was the best movie he's ever seen, but I should NEVER see it! He didn't think I could handle it!Well, I was renting movies and saw it and thought, "What the hell!" I got home and put in the my dvd player, and started the movie. I was at first annoyed with the camera work, it was very shaky. The movie started out slow, and I wasn't totally interested. I couldn't understand why my friend told me not to watch it.When the music scenes started I was happy, for I had heard the soundtrack and liked it a lot. Meaningless to say now, when I listen to the soundtrack, the songs mean much more to me!Bjork, wow. Her acting, (if you could call it that) was just superb. I don't think we can call it acting, she WAS SELMA JEZKOVA! I was so inthralled in the movie, but still didn't really understand what the fuss was about.When Selma was arrested, it all started coming to me. The acting in this movie was just amazing. I have never seen anything like it, and probobly won't! The movie made me so mad! All these bad things were happening to her, but EVERYONE loved Selma. How couldn't they? Why didn't anyone stand up for her in court? Everyone cared for her, from Cvalda! to the prison guard. When Selma was walking to the gallows, and went into her head for another musical, I NEVER wanted her to stop it. It was so beautiful. When she received her sons glasses, I had a big smile. I was thinking, Okay, there's going to be some kind of miracle now, she's NOT going to be hung. I was lost in her song, and.....and I am still lost in it.I don't think Bjork would be very good in other movies, she's not a good actress! I don't think she can act, she can only become and 99% of movies wouldn't work for her talent. In the movie, Selma talks about how she HATES THE LAST SONG IN A MUSICAL BECAUSE IT"S GOING TO END, I should have realized what she was telling me. DON'T WATCH THE END!This was by far the best movie I've ever seen, however, I won't ever watch it again, and just like my friend, I will tell other people not to watch it! I don't think I'll ever be compleately healed. This movie rips out your heart, and shows it to you. WOW.</fullReview>

Leaving the film was a positive relief because I found I didn't really like or care about any of the characters, and it was fairly obvious that they were all going to have a horrible time, which is what I later heard that they did. I had a much nicer time looking around the art gallery and listening to traditional Indian music!

I have never seen anyone act blind so perfectly. This story is a gripping tale of fate and (American) justice gone wrong and it has certainly the redeeming cast and 60s personal videocam style cinematography (akin to the JFK assassination footage) to deliver the stark reality of the narrative.[As a reference for comparison, you might want to see The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, a musical in its entirety where Catherine Deneuve (Kathy in this film) performs brilliantly in that 1964 film.]If you have *seen* this film, good for your soul.

Consider a scene on death row where a prisoner was being lead to the gallows only to burst out into song. What were they thinking? The feeling generated by the beginning of the scene was negated. I really enjoyed many parts of the movie and if they had left out all of the singing and dancing it would have been a powerful drama. The hand held camera work was also annoying. Some scenes called for a quiet steady hand that would let the actor's skill carry the scene but the camera bobbed and weaved like a overactive child with the hiccups. Bjork was very effective outside of the singing and dancing. She also would have been effective singing but in a different movie.</fullReview>

This is one of those movies that sucks you in and then spits you out. I was crying so hard at the end; I've never before felt such anguish for a fictional character. It was the deepest pain to see the sacrifice that Selma made for her son.I'm not usually a fan of melodramatic movies, but that's only because other melodramas couldn't get me to relate to them the way that "Dancer in the Dark" did. Once in a blue moon is a movie made that is both stark and fanciful, that tells its story straight into your heart without you even realizing that you've made yourself vulnerable to it. And at the end you find yourself in such emotional disarray that all you can do is walk away from it. This was one of those movies that was so good and so moving that I don't even care to watch it again. The first time watching it left a big enough impression, thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally draining but a good experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is emotionally draining but well worth the time and effort expended. While it isn't as great as von Trier's masterpiece Breaking the Waves (what really is?), this movie is similar in the themes and emotions that are prevalent, most notably in the lead character. *Spoiler Alert* Rather than rehashing the plot, I would like to make a couple points. First, it is so touching at the end when Sylvia gets Gene's glasses and starts to sing -- this time for real -- as she has finally found happiness in life and doesn't have to escape in her mind to do it. Second, despite her not having any sight, her vision was realized at the end. If you can suffer through some truly painful moments, this movie is well worth experiencing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Listen to you're Heart"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier proves himself once again that he is without a doubt the most daring and talented director at work at the moment. With Dancer in the Dark he takes on the genre of the musical and gleefully crosses it with the same kind of heart breaking melodrama that made Breaking the Waves (1996) such a success. The story concerns Selma, stunningly portrayed by Bjork in her first (and last) major film role. Selma is slowly going blind due to a hereditary eye condition, a condition that will also affect her twelve-year-old son if he doesn't get an important operation.Any one familiar with Von Trier will know that nothing ever comes easily to his characters, from Jean-Marc Barr in Europa (1991) to Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves, the characters in his world must prove themselves through personal sacrifice. Selma is a pathetic and innocent character who deals with her problem by imagining that the loud industrial sounds of her surroundings are the bass line to an extravagant musical fantasy world, this not only allows her to break away from the horrors of the situations she finds herself in, but also allows Von Trier to briefly break away from the confines of his Dogme.The musical scenes are some of the most beautiful in terms of composition and editing that I have ever had the pleasure to watch, with standout's being "I've seen it all" and "Scatter Heart" Von Trier shows us the beauty of the world as Selma sees it, even if they do take away the sting of some of the more shocking and upsetting scenes in the film. All of the actors are in fine form, David Morse and Siobhan Fallon give tremendously raw performances, whilst Bjork and Peter Stormare are truly heartbreaking, and as Jeff confesses the simple line "I love you" through the glass my heart sank.Dancer in the Dark has many parallels to Breaking the Waves in terms of story and style, (Von Trier continues his semi-documentary approach to filming) but for me is a much better film, and that's saying something. This film is essential, if at times uncomfortable viewing. And be warned, the ending will leave you stunned, and that final shot will remain with you for a very long time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers below) One of the most unusual and compelling movies I've ever seen over 50 years of movie watching. Never knew much about Bjork but after this movie I want to know more and hope she acts in many more movies. I had wondered about the song she sang at this year's Oscars and really thought her an ugly duckling and not the swan she was/is. Now I know and can appreciate the song...and her. An incredible performance in this movie which enlightened my spirit but was tough going as I watched the meek and continually smiling and trusting Bjork character slowly be destroyed by a promise she made to a "friend", that "friend," her unfailing love for her child, and the system. The movie is a great argument against capital punishment. The last scene was hard to survive as a viewer.</fullReview>

Not surprisingly, bjork role in themusical score, a strong vivid sound of industrial machine, orderlysounds and cries of sorrow.

		<shortDescription>A work of genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I held back from writing a review after I saw Dancer in the Dark the first time as I wanted to see it again to confirm what I had just seen. Never in my entire existence have I seen anything quite as breathtakingly awesome in scope and emotion. The Idiots was my first breach of modern cinema rules and I enjoyed every minute of it as it was the most human film I have seen. I was shocked that such subject matter could have me howling with laughter at one point and then turning me on my head and making me feel guilty. Now DITD did something else. Bjork's got something about her that makes you want to watch, I wasn't the biggest fan of her music but I thought her voice was amazing and distinct, so let's see if she can pull this off. The synopsis on the back of the video gave nothing away which was possibly why I felt like I'd been kicked in back of the head and had my stomach ripped out at the turning point of the film when it goes eerily wrong for the child like Selma. The idea of having the musical scenes interspersing the tradgedy and mundanity of Selma's life were executed in such a way that I, like Selma, never wanted them to end. I didn't want to go back to her normal life, I wanted to be in the musical with her. I found myself shouting at the screen, fearful of the next moment. There is one part in the film where I felt myself feeling helpless. Bjork walks off down the railway track and Von Triers camera glances back at Deneuve and she clasps her mouth as if her whole body is about to cry and it hits you right in eyes and you can't help but be taken in by the story. Dancer In The Dark is one of those unsung masterpieces of cinema that you have to view with an open mind. The concept sounds stupifying but it is pulled of in such a way that the final scene is filled with such raw power and emotion that it will leave you numb, cold and completely and utterly useless. This film uses the viewer like nothing you have ever seen. It spits you out used and helpless. All of the performances are underplayed and understated, Bjork's voice is the most intriguing and beautiful I have ever heard and you feel compelled to listen. She wraps herself up so much in the role it is a pleasure to be in her company and Von Treirs camerawork, whilst not everyones thing, is what blurs the line between fantasy and reality. All of the cynics and their steadicams should take heed of Von Triers style and committment to pursuing human truth. If you want something different then you must see this film as it will challenge you to hold back your emotions and maybe even use them. It is a work of genius. Nothing short of a masterpiece. A DEFINATE 10 OUT OF 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I have been a fan of Bjork for some time now, and seeing "Dancer" has made me appreciate her even more. The movie gets off to a slow start, and the close-ups of the characters' faces and shaky filming gets a little nauseating. This was quickly overlooked as the movie progressed and I got more into the storyline. The storyline was rather weak and a bit ridiculous in some parts, but you can't help sympathizing with Selma and her troubles.The tough part of watching this movie was relating with Bjork's character. I don't think she and Selma are that different in personality, and I thought Selma was very much a pushover. This irritated me in some parts because she simply did not stand up for herself.The songs were undoubtedly the best part of this movie. I loved Bjork's voice the first time I heard it years ago, and I also loved how the songs helped to explain and add to the parts of the movie.*** Other users please do not read further comments here as I'm adding something about the end of the movie. ***There are some movies that can only be watched once or twice, and this is one of them. This one is brilliant (although very artsy and weird), but the tragic ending was more than I could bear. I think Bjork is such an awesome talent, and to see her "executed" literally took my breath away. The camera cuts away from her face as she's singing and at just a split second before she is finally hanged. The music stops and the whole atmosphere of the movie is so heart-wrenching.This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen, and it will be a shame if Bjork doesn't do any more acting. Excellent job!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the first 15 minutes of this film, I seriously doubted that I'd be able to watch it through to the end. The camerawork was appalling, the actors spoke their lines over each other, there seemed to be no direction that the film was heading and, did I mention how bad the camerawork was?I decided to soldier on, having heard too many good things about this film to give up yet. I'm glad that I did. I won't go into the plot (which, no doubt, has been covered extensively by other reviewers), but simply say that this is a story of discovering what is really important to oneself, and knowing what path one must take to reach that goal.Bjork puts in an amazing effort, along with several of the key cast members. Her unique vocal styles are used to good effect in the songs through the film and blend very well with what is happening in the film.I would still like to write off much of the camerawork (I just DONT LIKE the jerky hand-held out-of-focus attempt at being arty), but even this fades into the background as the story of Selma Yeskova takes over.My vote of 8 includes points off for the camerawork (did I mention how bad it is?) and the very shaky start. Its a shame that some people will turn the film off before it really gets started.Have patience with the beginning, it really does improve!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this film expecting something arty and no big fan of Bjork. I was not disappointed in the 'arty' label, and I was impressed with Bjork. Czech immigrant she isn't (accent is way off - at a guess I'd say she learned to speak English in England, not the US) but, although I don't think she was ideal for the part she brought something remarkable to it. The filming gave my wife a headache, but she ended up in tears anyway. This is never going to be a big popular film - it will scare most away by its pace (slow), its style (arthouse), its filming (raw), its music (very Bjork) and its storyline (bleak) - but it is something not to be easily forgotten. Difficult to rate I had to give it an 8/10 (but it could easily have been a 9)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this on recommendation from a friend, and was quite intrigued after seeing various references and comparisons to it in the Moulin Rouge reviews.Definitely not a film for everyone and I'm not a real big arthouse buff, hardly. Dancer In The Dark didn't bore me to tears, nor did it excite me like your usual cheap-commerical-everyone's-film. But it was very poignant (always wanted to use that word!). Bjork really pulls off a powerful performance, as do the rest of the actors. The camera work also adds to the sincerity of the acting, if that makes sense. I felt the story started off a little slow, before settling into a pleasant trot. The musical scenes are fun to watch and the music is pure Bjork stuff, some of it very catchy. Like I said it's a very moving film and it did in fact have me in tears at the end. And this was a waterfall of tears! Never have I cried that much at a movie! That's how powerful Bjork's portrayal was. I doubt I will watch this again on whim, but it will remain with me forever. It certainly stands out. I appreciate it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DANCER IN THE DARK (2000) Rating: 9/10Dancer in the Dark is everything you want out of a movie ? it is brutal, brave, compelling, passionate, focused, real and interesting. Yep, Lars von Trier has done it again. Lars' 1996 movie Breaking the Waves must of come somewhere high in my Top 50, it was an astonishing film. Can this movie match up to the same high standards? Indeed! This film too made my Top 50 Best, it earned one of the highest 9/10 ratings I have ever given. This movie is groundbreaking in all areas ? story, song, direction and acting. Oh how Bjork can act. Wow! She deserved an Oscar nomination at least for an incredible performance as the dreamer Selma. Catherine Deneuve supports her excellently as a friend who doesn't know which side to take. Lars' direction is once again ignored, but watch this movie and you'll see how immaculate he made it and just how much praise he deserved. Fulfilling the best areas of filmmaking with absolute brilliance, Dancer in the Dark is one of the top 5 of 2000, and is not to be missed.</fullReview>

Before watching DITD I was afraid of losing the impression of Bjork, but, now I like her more than before. Her performance is brilliant, very emotional, and I guess that's something should be expected from Bjork. The soundtrack for the movie is excellent. I've Seen It All, the duet with Radiohead's Thom Yorke, is one of the best songs ever, lyrically and musically. I guess, in a way, you can compare this film with The Wall directed by Alan Parker, if you consider the raw emotions - sending chills down the spine.</fullReview>

If you like to let films take hold of you -not there for a few laughs or merely as something to do with your friends- then you will be severely impacted by Dancer in the Dark. It's a tale about woman losing her eye sight and caught in a Musical playing in her mind, that is so emotionally devestating that all the noise from people bawling and leaving the theater, to wipe their eyes or go home, became destracting. I cried more than I ever thought any movie could. I hadn't cried during a movie since I was 7 and saw Black Beauty. I remember that by the end I was destroyed. I felt it in my chest.

		<shortDescription>Willing Suspension of Disbelief-"spoiler!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the basic tenets of theatre is that the audience must be willing to suspend their disbelief. Why isn't it the same for films?In order to be truly artistic(yes, this includes pretension), a film director must be willing to take a risk. That doesn't happen much these days. Lars Von Trier rightly takes risks in creating his films; how else could he express his complicated views? They are deep, and open for interpretation.Some say that the plot of Dancer in the Dark is unbelievable. But is it really? How believable is life, and the myriad of situations that can happen in it? I knew a wonderful, gentle man who killed his wife, set his house on fire and killed himself. Seemingly unbelievable, but it happened. It is amazing what people will do when their ego is challenged.Lars Von Trier turns his female characters into sacrificial lambs. Could it have more to do with some primitive, nurturing role that women are saddled with rather than a misogynistic view?This movie made me cry more than I have while watching any movie, ever. It was devastating, but also a release at the same time. All movies aim to manipulate in some way. They must get your attention. Why is it acceptable for movies to manipulate their viewers into joy but not into sadness? Are not sentimental crap, popular comedies manipulative in the same way? It is only the other side of the coin. Why is being made sad so frowned upon? Take your Prozac please?The musical segments serve to not only highlight Selma's inner world but also to comment on it--how unrealistic it is. They provide an ironic backdrop to the weight of the situation of the film, and also serve as an antithesis to most musicals--the corny, happiness of them.Despair is heavy, happiness is light. Which is more relevant? Which will you remember? Selma's motivation is obviously questioned. I say, SUBTEXT! She is emotionally withdrawn, unable to get close. The period setting of 1964 has been criticized. Selma is from Czechoslovakia; the Russians invaded Prague around this time. Her life there may have been tumultuous, though we get no clues through the dialogue. Audience imagination is the key.This is a beautifully depressing movie. I reveled in the despair I felt because it felt good to feel bad in my incredibly sanitized, antidepressant-fueled life. It is rare to be moved so by a movie; I'd much rather be moved to tears than to sighs of joy.</fullReview>

Bjork is excellent in her role as the mother, and the rest of the cast is very adequate. My one problem with the movie is that the hand-held approach to cinematography in the segments that weren't song and dances gave me a big headache...the camera was just moving around way too much. This is not the Blair Witch Project...buy a tripod.Other than that, this movie was a very interesting and at times surreal look into the mind of a woman who is doing everything she can to make life better for her son...even making the ultimate sacrifice.</fullReview>

At first I loved the fact that a film could make me cry, which doesn't happen very often. But after awhile I realized that crying is exactly what Von Trier is hoping the audience will do. He creates a lovable, innocent girl and has the most ridiculously, unbelievably horrible things happen to her. Apparently people don't have enough emotion in their lives, and watching movies like this serves as a substitute. I believe Von Trier is a genius to be able to do this, but at the same time he makes me sick. But hey, if he likes doing it, and the people love feeding off of it, more power to him.

		<fullReview>I look at the comments here and wonder how superficial people can be.When commenting on a movie, how important is it that you approve of the performers' off-camera careers or activities? That Björk wore some swan-dress to the Oscars (which have always been, of course, just shameless self-promotion at its most glamourous) has no bearing on how enjoyable, emotional, and real this movie was.I'm not going to give a synopsis, since it's already been given several times. But what seems to be missing is a genuine interpretation of the musical scenes. The comment "intentionally puerile lyrics" seems to ring true for me. The songs are indeed SelmaSongs. They're not tacked-on scenes, created to make a drama into a musical. They're Selma's escape into the only thing she has left. While they are silly, they are at the same time quite sad. While enjoying the song and dance, you know that Selma is at her worst, needing to escape into the musical world.I also found the musicals to be more like theatrical musicals, where the songs tell or re-tell elements of the plot, not just to punctuate a single scene. A film musical would more typically have a song about Gene receiving a bike, and less about Selma's escape from Bill's house.I think the element of this film that saddens me the most is that it's soured Björk to acting. She did have a cameo role in some other film (the name escapes me at the moment), but has said that the experience is something she couldn't put herself through again. It's a shame, since her performance was inspired and heart-wrenching.This stands as one of my favourite movies. All the elements come together wonderfully and it's even more of a treat to know how they made it - the DVD is fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denying Reality, Defying Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selma, a Czech woman, who now lives in the USA, once mentions that she always leaves a musical film while the penultimate song is being performed. That way the film would go on forever in her imagination, whereas it would inevitably stop if she waited until the very end.It is mainly in apparently hopeless conflict situations that she displays her unshakeable capability of converting an undesirable reality into something more positive. Then she imagines her life to be a musical, in which she has taken the leading role. But there is a flaw: Her escape from reality has the length of a song only, and instead of definitely solving her problems she achieves nothing but a short-term delay. In the end she has to accept the tragic turns of her life without resistance: the dismissal from her job in the factory, the death of her landlord, which actually is a suicide, but which is presented as a murder committed by her, and, finally, her execution by hanging.The contrast between the imaginary musical scenes and reality is shown by the use of different film material: The hopelessness of Selma's existence, which is marked by the sheer impossibility of the fulfillment of her life ambition (to save the eyesight of her son Gene by means of an operation financed by her), is reflected by dim, subdued colors, whereas the dream passages are depicted in clear and bright colors. The very choice shows which of the two levels is to be emphasized as the more attractive and more desirable one.Selma succeeds in defying reality almost to the point of denying the finality of death. Even in the moment when she feels the noose tying around her neck she is capable of converting the whole scenery into a single musical song of liberating force, thanks to her strength of mind. And this gigantic release of life-saving energy should just be enough to prevent her from dying: "It's only the last song if we let it be."But ironically it is us, the spectators, who, simply by not observing the aforementioned rule, condemn Selma to death. Precisely because we sympathize with the protagonist and are interested in her destiny, we are not capable of leaving the projection room before she has completed her "next-to-last-song". Therefore we are not spared the final moment in which the music stops playing and the tools of death start working noiselessly. The moment in which a brave heart stops beating, and the silent screen is invaded by complete darkness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"...absolutely unmissable."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Von Trier seems to court controversy with whatever film he chooses to make. 'Breaking the Waves' his debut film stirred up people for his frank depiction of polygamous sex. His award-winning Dogme movie The Idiots horrified people for it's subject matter and brief shots of real sexual activity between some of it's stars some four or so years before the so-called ?groundbreaking' 'Intimacy'. 'Dancer in the Dark' contains no such pornography or indeed any sexual activity whatsoever. Instead Von Trier has chose to make a musical about the death penalty. Which is nice.'Dancer in the Dark' tells the tale of Czech-immigrant Selma (Björk) brought up in her country on American musicals. Entranced by the depiction of America in these movies she emigrates hoping for a better life. Selma, however, harbours a dark secret. She is afflicted with a hereditary blinding disease that eats away at her sight as she grows older. She works horrendous hours of every day and night to save up to pay for an operation that will give her son the chance of a life free of blindness. To keep herself from slipping into a deep depression, every time she hears or feels a beat she imagines herself breaking into a spontaneous song and dance routine like she had seen so many times in her childhood. As the movie progresses we get to witness her life crumbling and falling apart around her.If the synopsis was just given to you as it was and you were asked whether or not you would want to see the film the answer would very probably be `No' and nobody would blame you. Normally when you go and see a movie you would want to be entertained, not depressed to a point where you would want to end your own life. What makes this a film worth seeing, however, is it's almost technical perfection. The songs created by Björk are beautiful and entrancing, the acting is incredibly realistic, great, believable dialogue with shaky documentary-esque camera work, which just heightens the deception that these people are actually real. The only flaw in Von Trier's otherwise perfect film is the choreography during the song and dance routines. Whereas in the golden age of musicals, in which Selma was brought up in, magic was given out by the bucket-load in here there is much less magic, it seems to be subtler. Perhaps this was what Von Trier intended and most people would probably be able to give him the benefit of the doubt. If you like watching movies just to be entertained then give this movie a wide berth, if however, you enjoy watching great movies then this one is absolutely unmissable.(9)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Von Trier unmasked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't hate this film, I hate Von Trier. I already had my doubts after seeing Braking the Waves about the Danish director being a tearjerker, intentionally stepping on our emotions. Now I know he is one. Let me explain why. The only reason this film is playing in the USA in the late fifties / early sixties (?), is that the director can go as deep as to have the main character being charged with the death penalty, brutally hanged to be more precise, innocently more over, so we all have to feel sorry and weep. This is a coward trick; if this story was shot in Europe (why not - after all, director and main actors are European), the woman would most likely have gotten away with imprisonment. But who would care about her then (not "really" dramatic, huh?). I didn't read many professional critics about this movie; I'm curious to know if anyone focused on the part of the death penalty. What is good about this film, is that it shows that the death penalty is stupid and inhuman. Moreover, it shows the ridiculous American court system.Bjork is doing fine, although I don't think her part is that difficult to play (look stupid, act naive). A major flaw is Von Trier's choice to let her sing her songs in the "Bjork-way": was this movie set up to boost Bjork's singing career? Whatever the reason, I don't think it fits the period in history this movie is situated. Deneuve's part is a matter of bad casting: you keep looking at Deneuve, not the character she is playing. If you're in for the - in generally overestimated - Dogma way of making movies, watch Festen: less pretentious and far more convincing in all aspects. Final remark: David More is the true star in this movie. Excellent acting, what a gifted actor this man is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ups and and one particular down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**"Dancer in the Dark" is the kind of film that can reach into your chest, rip out your heart, twist it in 100 different directions, and unceremoniously stick it back in - leaving you wondering what in the world just happened. Icelandic alternative singer Björk plays Selma, a shy, single, working class, (eventually) blind woman struggling to raise a young son by working in a factory and making cards. The singer demonstrates a spectacular amount a depth and empathy with her character. Her very real performance along with the unstable, camcorderesque camerawork made me forget several times that I was actually watching a work of fiction. However, I have seen blind characters played much more convincingly than this.The film is a musical. It's like no other musical you've ever seen. One of the storylines focuses on a local simpleton's crush on Selma (who spends her free time singing, dancing, and acting in local musical productions). In one scene, they are discussing musicals and how they are always so cheerful and fun. The obvious irony of this was that this macabre musical was nothing but. "Dancer in the Dark" is to the musical genre what films like "Fargo" and "Misery" are to the comedy genre. Imagine the most depressing and gloomy episode of "Cop Rock" and you'll have a good idea.Selma is as single-minded a character as has ever graced the silver screen. Everything she does is seemingly done only to fulfill a single covenant: to ensure that her young son Glen will not suffer from the same blinding disease that is taking her eyesight. A native of Czechoslovakia, she emigrated to the United States only because a surgery was available to cure this hereditary ailment. Selma's solitary devotion to Glen is very touching and inspiring. Her world is crumbling around her and, still, her only concern is the lifelong welfare of her son.However, I had only a single problem with the film and that problem is all that kept me from a perfect 10 rating. Selma is a daydreamer who constantly makes mistakes at work and in her plays because her mind is lost in music - music we hear and see performed along with her daydream. The music - often presented in the most trying and depressing scenes - is, ironically, very cheerful and happy. The people surrounding her at the time of her daydream - be they in a courtroom or in the factory - join in her song and dance number as co-stars. It's a very unique, but odd, presentation of music.When I was told of this particular aspect of the film before seeing it, I felt it might really make for interesting cinema. It certainly accomplishes that. It also accomplishes making the viewer sympathetic with - even a party to - Selma's daydreaming and innocent-as-a-bird nature. However, eventually the musical interludes became a tad overbearing and got in the way of what otherwise was a monumental little film. I have talked with others who strenuously disagree with me on this. So, if nothing else, the strange insertions of 'shiny, happy people' music during, for instance, Selma's final steps to the gallows make for interesting post-viewing conversation. The music does succeed in taking the edge off our sympathy for Selma - since she's so happy singing and dancing during life's most trying times, shouldn't we be happy too? I've never experience a divergence of emotion as much as I did towards the end of this film."Dancer" qualifies as one of the most unique pieces of filmmaking art I've ever seen. This film is definitely not something a serious filmgoer should miss. I'll warn you that the story is disturbing almost to a nauseous degree. And the camera style and musical interludes will surely turn off many viewers. However, its unique spirit and atmosphere made for a rewarding and, oddly, uplifting experience for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can maybe understand why some people dislike the movie. It can make you feel quite uneasy (the ending is just horrible, almost unbearable). Some critic said that the movie is "emotional pornography" and I must say that this description is not completely off. No movie has *ever* stirred up so strong emotions in me as "Dancing in the Dark". I was crying after I had seen it. I was even in the mood of the film when I woke up the morning after, almost crying. Still I went to see it three times. The second time I went to see it I was afraid, because I knew that I was in for another emotional roller coaster. It's a shame that Bjork doesn't act more often (though I am sure she will act again). Her acting performance was one of the best I have ever seen. I also love the music. I really connected so strongly with Selma, and this is probably the reason the movie killed me. I treasure this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is perfect for singer Bjork's debut as an actress. Completely convincing as an immigrant factory worker obsessed with musicals, she has proven she does not need to rely on her music-based fame to break into the film industry. Although the film is tragic, it is highly worth your time. One thing that makes it unique is the occasional outburst of singing and dancing (Joel Gray of Cabaret fame has a cameo); a few of these could have been shorter, but they are not boring. So, though it may not be a blockbuster, this is quality film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blind Woman Walking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers all the Way)I tell you I wanted to pull that handle myself. Then I wanted them to grab Lars Von Trier and give him a go on that gallows too. He deserves it for foisting this tricked screenplay on us.Maybe it would have worked on me if Lars had cast Emily Watson again. Instead, he cast Bjork, a pop singer from Sweden. Bjork is the awful songstrees who turned up at the Oscars in that stupid fairy dress. I didn't really know anything about the film then, but I did want to get even anyway. Noone has the right to look that terrible at the Oscars.Von Trier put on a wonderful mockery of hospitals, actually a TV miniseries, called The Castle. There was also a The Castle Two. The satires made Paddy Chayefsky's Hospital look like a soft shoe act. An old woman repeatedly has unnecessary operations in the hospital by creating false symptoms. When discovered, she finds still another way to be around the hospital all the time. For instance, her son works there. She holds late night rituals in which she enlists doctors and nurses to help her exorcize demons from the institution. In the daytime, a malpractitioner is under fire from the same doctor who participates in the exorcisms at night. This Von Trier is a loopy screenwriter, but the films are often very funny.Von Trier, the director-author of Dancer in the Dark, is also the originator of the European Dogma approach to filmmaking. Von Trier has vowed to use no special effects or camera tricks to make films. Others have followed his lead.Von Trier has made other films. Breaking The Waves caused a sensation a few years ago and launched actress Emily Watson, who has since appeared in a variety of great roles. Also, Von Trier did Europa, a fairly conventional film, and Zentropa, a send up of the Orient Express and all the other Mystery Train films that have haunted Europe and occasionally America since the thirties. Zentropa is really very funny.Thats the trouble with Von Trier and Dancer in the Dark. He's a little too much of a joker for drama. A European pop singer named Bjork has replaced Emily Watson in this one. Selma has come to the states convinced she will inhabit one Gene Kelly scenario after another. She is entranced with dance and musicals.Von Trier is leading us into a dramatic trap. This blind woman, Selma, has no hope of carrying out a plan to save her son's sight with an expensive operation. Von Trier intends to bend this screenplay to save the boy's sight. Selma and her son live in a trailer rented to her by a small town cop, who has convinced his wife that he is independently wealthy when in fact he is near broke and suicidal.Selma is from Czechoslovakia so we're supposed to forgive her for being so thick and slow. She is legally blind but with help from friends and associates she manages to pretend to work successfully in a manufacturing plant. Kathy (Catherine Deneuve)works with her and has to do Selma's job for her in order that the blind woman continue to work. When Selma moves to another shift, Kathy says she won't help her this time and refuses, at first, to follow and help her on second shift. Follow Kathy does, and this time she is not being paid herself for helping Selma.Von Trier is creating all the torpor and drama in the Audience. We don't like the problem that Selma is. Von Trier has us getting in bed emotionally with Selma's plight. But I think he is joking again. These facts make no sense.The cop steals Selma's $2,056.20 bankroll after Selma has finally been fired from her job at the factory. Discovering the money missing, Selma encounters the cop's wife who asks her to move out in the wake of her husband's "confession" that Selma came on to him. Selma insists on seeing the cop, then gets into a ridiculous struggle over the money that leads to the cop's murder/suicide with 43 wounds. It is here that Von Trier begins to toy with us in a major way. By turns, the hapless cop is begging Selma to shoot him with his service weapon on the one hand, and struggling desperately to hold on to the money on the other. Its a ridiculous scene. Von Trier has been staging little musical ephiphanies (fantasies) in which Selma and others sing and dance to a story idea as in broadway and movie musicals. The most funny and effective of the dance vignettes is the one about the struggle between the cop and Selma over the money.Its all downhill from here, though. Von Trier takes us through an absurd trial in which the District Attorney makes such absurd and overwrought statements about Selma's guilt you would think his case would fall on its face. I'm laughing at the travesty that is this trial. But Von Trier won't let the audience have its way. Selma figures if she is found innocent, her son will not get his operation and will be condemned to a life of blindness like herself. Catherine Deneuve is trying to save her by getting her a retrial. The French actress is fed up with Selma and ready to go back to playing glamourous french women with none of these problems. Kathy (Deneuve) is tired of being a frump in a film about a dopey Czech lady.Now we move into the death row phase. I am cheering and want to pull the lever on Selma myself. In addition, would it be possible to get her the Guillotine, Gas Chamber, Electric Chair and a drawn-out and painful lethal injection all at the same time? Selma has managed to lure a sympathetic lesbian jail matron into the emotional trap the audience has been caught in since the film began. The Warden and witnesses want to get this over with the least emotional damage- to themselves- that can be managed.But no, Selma insists on not wearing the traditional hood. The hang-up compels the warden to make a phone call. Selma won't stand up. They put her in a rack to hold her straight. All is chaos but finally Selma falls through the slot in the floor and the Audience is relieved.There is a Dance Leit Motif in the film. Miss Selma Sympathy has managed to get the lead role of Maria Von Trapp in a local production of the Sound of Music. Selma never comes close to hitting her mark in the local production but the sympathetic director is, well.., sympathetic. The Dance Metaphor is obvious throughout the film, but the only dance sequence that satisfies the emotionally-tried audience is the one at the end of a rope for Selma. The only way for the audience to get through this mess is to treat the film as an unintentional comedy and begin cheering everytime something goes wrong for Selma. Believe me, its the only way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very depressing - kinda manipulative - but with bright spots (that still may be depressing)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are great scenes in this film, most of them thanks to Bjork's brilliant performance. But they - and Bjork herself - are trapped in a flawed film.It's an agony flick. The depressing aspect is not just an element of the film's drama but rather the very make-up of it's story - like a formula. It feels like a tug at the viewer's emotions that refuses to stop until the credits roll. It can feel manipulative. So can the deliberately alternative way the filmmaker chose to present the majority of the movie (the non-musical portions, to be exact). Most of the film is shot in a blurry, hand-held fashion, but the musical numbers kick it into full color and steady camera shots. Cinematography is important but should never command the scene, just capture it in an effective way. Neither the musical scenes or the dramatic portions are captured in a fitting fashion, just a painfully calculated one.But there are some damn good scenes, and an element of the story to be respected. But I can't get into many of the positives because it would ruin them for potential viewers. Perhaps that itself is insight to the way the movie works, and how it succeeds...It's a mixed bag. A must for Bjork fans, though.</fullReview>

But my dad was just sitting there going "If I saw that at the cinema I'd demand my money back" so... bah to him. The story is this. Selma (Bjork) is going blind, and so will her son if he doesn't have an operating once he's 13. Selam has been working in a factory and making hair clips to save up money. No one, not even Gene, her son, knows about her problems until her and her landlord (David Morse) share their secrets with each other. The only way she escapes her dull life is by daydreaming she is part of an old Hollywood black and white musical. All singing all dancing. But the desperate act of a man eventually leads to Selma's downfall. The acting was great. Bjork was even better than i thought she'd be. It was as if she *was* Selma. And Catherine Denueve (sp?) David Morse etc... it's all good.And the songs! I still say "I've See It All" should've won the oscar. But we can't have everything. I also really liked the first song she sung. In the factory at night. "Boom clatter crash clang..." i loved Bjork when she sang that. I love Bjork, period. She's a funky little Icelandic pixie.Anyway.A+"I can't breath! GENE!

		<fullReview>I think this movie affected me more than any other I've ever seen. When it was over, I just sat through the credits wishing it had stopped after the `Next to Last Song.' Unfortunately, the `Next to Last Song' had been interrupted--not quite as Selma had planned it. It was 1 AM when it was over, but I couldn't go to sleep because I knew that I would just spend hours laying there thinking about it and then after falling asleep eventually, I feared it would give me nightmares. So I had to find something else to divert my thoughts and then went to sleep eventually at 4 AM.I don't really know what this movie is about. It is not a musical. It is not an epic story. It's just something to be experienced--an emotional journey. Perhaps I like it because I like contrasts. Selma's real life and her musical fantasies were so different. They were obviously different on the surface, but there is more to it than that. There is a meta story here. In reality Selma is helpless--a victim with no control of her destiny. In the musicals she is god like. In the beginning of the very first song she waves her arms an points as an orchestra conductor to cue sounds and actions in the world surrounding her. She is in control. In the same song, she gives instruction to her friend, Kathy; in real life it is the reverse. In a later song, she touches Bill on the forehead and wakes him from the dead. In another song she calls people forth to catch her whenever she falls. She is god like in the songs.The amazing thing about the songs is how they got me, the viewer, completely involved in the film. In the final scenes, when the prison guard coaxed Selma into the `107 Steps' song, I was thinking, `Yes, yes! Excellent idea! We need a song, now!' And then again before the `Next to Last Song' I was coaxing Selma in my thoughts, `Please, I need a song now!' That is exactly how my thoughts or rather feelings progressed through the movie--from you need, to we need, to I need. I was completely involved. I'm guessing that was the purpose of the film--to get the viewer completely and personally involved. It did that.The movie made me cry, but not because I was happy or sad as is the case for other movies. It cried because it frightened me. And it didn't frighten me as horror movies do. Such movies are only fantasy so the fright doesn't really run very deep. This movie shows how frightening the injustice of reality can be and that fright goes into your very soul.Some say that Selma isn't very bright. I would disagree. It's her optimism in the face of the impossible that makes her seem naive. But near the end of the film when the reality of prison has eroded her optimism, her reprimands and instructions given to Kathy, Jeff, and the lawyer, are clear evidence that she is rationale and still working to her careful plan.Some might think I should qualify this review by stating that I'm a big fan of Bjork's music. But I don't think that makes me biased. The reason I like her music is the same reason that I was amazed by her acting. I like her music because she is so very expressive with her voice. The movie demonstrates that she is every bit as expressive in her acting as she is in her singing which shouldn't be surprising after all.It is said that Bjork cannot act. But American movies viewers have come to believe that it is those characters that keep their cool during catastrophe that are good actors--those characters who remain stoic in the face of death. This in only a wish or a fantasy that Hollywood movie makers feed to viewers and the viewers come to expect. Would real people act that way? Bjork's intensely emotional portrayal of Selma was so realistic that it frightened me--right down to her nervous finger tapping in the final scene. That is probably how I would have behaved. It's not pretty. It's not how real movie heroes behave, but I think it is how many people would behave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unqualified masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See this film! Lars Von Trier has made his third masterpiece. Bjork's "acting" ranks as one of the great film performance's of all time, and she is ably supported by a superb supporting cast, including the wonderful Catherine Deneuve (who should have got an Oscar nomination). Having Joel Grey appear as the pre-war Czech film hoofer that Bjork's character has claimed as her father is nothing short of brilliant. The best film of 2000.</fullReview>

The whole part where she was singing "My Favorite Things" in the jail cell, the musical number at the factory, the quote at the terrifying end--just amazing.

		<fullReview>"Dancer In The Dark" seems like a lesser, fancier, bigger - budget reproduction of Lars von Trier's earlier "Breaking The Waves". The musical scenes are a nice idea but badly executed, Björk acts surprisingly well considering that she is not really an actress, but BTW's Emily Watson still beats her hands - down. I didn't regret watching DITD, as movies go it still is a cut above the rest and moved me like only very few others did, but it clearly isn't Trier's best work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and inhumanly sad all at once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw *Dancer in the Dark*. I will first let loose the things I didn't like so much about the movie.The movie doesn't get good for 40 minutes. I was really tired, and the exposition is just so interminably *boring*. I was seriously wondering what all the hoopla was about. I was nodding off, fighting to stay awake. Also, some people may have a problem with Lars von Trier's way of editing the movie like a documentary, even though it's not really filmed like a documentary. By this I mean there are a lot of abrupt, unnatural cuts, and he make no attempt to smooth them out. After a while, you get used to it, though.Approximately 40 minutes in, the movie takes off. The basic premise is that Selma, played by Bjork, is going blind, and she is saving up money so her son can have an operation and not suffer the same fate. She works in a factory, and she absolutely loves musicals. What happens, then, is that she has these fantasies where she puts herself in a musical, because in a musical, "nothing dreadful ever happens." About 40 minutes in, I started hearing the factory noises and noticing how they sounded like music. At that moment, to my delight, Selma noticed it too, and bam, the first of many surreal musical sequences commenced. These musical sequences are the highlight of the film. Some people may not be fans of Bjork's voice or her style of singing, but I like it. It's very ethereal, and Selma sings her thoughts, making these musical sequences not so extraneous. I was just fascinated and delighted that someone else had noticed the music all around us. The tapping of my fingers on the keyboard: that's music. There would probably be a scene where keyboard-tapping led into a song, but the movie's set in 1964.One thing I'd like to mention is that the "I've Seen It All" in the movie is much better than the version Bjork sang at the Oscars. It's a very clever, amusing song. The factory song is also one of my favorites. The way the ordinary people make a dance out of ordinary movements...it's just so very cool. Sitting down, standing up, cutting wood, pulling levers...in Selma's mind, it becomes part of the musical. There's also a tap dancing scene. And all through you have Bjork's unique voice, which can make a beautiful song when all she's singing is numbers.Bjork won the Best Actress award at Cannes in her film debut, and deservedly so. I tried to find the actress behind the character, and I couldn't. She's just so perfect for the character; her performance is incredibly genuine. It's a shame she's vowed never to act again.I came into the movie knowing the small plot synopsis I told you, and I will not tell you any more than that. I like knowing as little as possible, because then everything's a surprise. Let's just say since I had no real idea what the movie was about, I was surprised to see the turn it took. I will tell you this: if you cry easily, you will cry. The best the final scene could muster out of me was a biting of my lip. But yes, be prepared for tears.I really, really wish the first 40 minutes had been more interesting. I could love this movie. It's so beautiful in its outlook on life...Selma is truly an example for us all. She hears the music of life; she sings her heart. She...well, I think watching the movie will explain what I'm trying to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lars Von Trier, Allegory, Non-diegetic Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selma in Dancer in the Dark (DITD hereafter) is very much similar to Bess in Breaking the Waves (BTW hereafter). Both die for their loved ones. In DITD, it is Selma's son while in BTW, Bess' husband. In my view, DITD deals with very much the same issue in BTW, although not as obvious as BTW; that is the notion of human sacrifice as embodied by Jesus. Bess dies, Selma dies, and so does Jesus. But they don't die for the sake of dying; rather, they die for the interest of others, for something much greater. Perhaps the only difference between Selma and Bess is their relationships to God: Selma's religious faith is almost non-evident whereas Bess' belief in the power of God is undeniable. Now consider how Selma in DITD and Bess in BTW seem to suggest allegorical relationship with Jesus:(i) Bess sacrifices her life for her husband. Selma sacrifices her life for her son. Jesus sacrifices His life for human kinds. (ii) The resulting effect: In Bess' part, Bess' husband recovers (miraculously) from the paralysis. In Selma's part, Selma's son would (off-screen) be undergoing an eye-operation to prevent the blindness. In Jesus' part, human kinds are saved.Hence, seeing BTW in the light of DITD and the possibility of allegorical meaning in DITD reveals that LVT's concern in both films is not so much about Bess and Selma, but of Jesus and His sacrifice. People close to Bess and Selma don't understand the actions taken by both the protagonists. It's not about the logic of their actions but rather, the consequence of their actions. DITD seems to suggest that it's never unreasonable for Jesus to die on the cross for His action is not about His dying on the cross per se, but rather His dying is for something greater. It's a spiritual sacrifice embodied by Jesus. In short, my point is this: If we are to take Selma's motivation of her self-sacrifice as an allegorical extension of Jesus' death on the cross, then there are strong reasons why Selma does what she does: why Selma is willing to die. Or why Bess wants to die for her husband. LVT exploits the female protagonist (Bess and Selma) as allegorical Jesus! There is one scene that seems to reveal the possibility of divine presence in DITD--the scene where God may be testing Selma's faith in self-sacrifice. This happens before she would be transferred to a waiting room for the execution. When she complains to the prison security how quiet it is in the cell but sometimes she hears music from the ventilation shaft, the prison security tells Selma that the sound that she hears could be originating from the sermon. After the prison warden leaves, Selma stands up in the bed and seems to listen through the ventilation shaft to almost godlike music. This is the key scene in DITD. She later fantasizes a musical, singing out her grief and joy. I don't know if Selma's talking to God (via doing musical) or she's just happy that God is listening to her. But the effect of this "divine" encounter comes in form of a "good" news: The prison security, herself happy with the news, tells Selma that she gets the stay. But Selma later rejects the possibility of new trial as she founds out that the money paid to the lawyer is actually from the money for her son's operation.Suppose one accepts the explanation that this scene could be interpreted as God's intervention of Selma's fate or God listening to Selma's (musical) prayers, a line of questions may be provoked: What is the relationship between the "divine" scene in the Selma's cell and Selma's rejection of a retrial? If God wants to help Selma from injustice, why does Selma reject God's help? There could be one way to answer this. If Selma opts for a new trial, she would most probably escape the death penalty. But given the fact that Selma's only concern is to save her son and her son must undergo the eye operation under certain period of time, it is plausible for Selma not to go for a retrial. While there is a strong possibility that Selma's religious conviction may be questionable, God's act of intervening of her possible fate is actually a test of Selma's faith in the sacrifice that she's going to make. The religious revelation is the test of her faith, not to be seen as the divine intervention in changing her fate. In the controversial The Last Temptation of Christ (1988, Scorsese), Jesus is portrayed as human, having desires and doubts. When Jesus is on the verge of completing His mission, there is a fantasy scene (a dream scene as said by some critics) in which Satan manages to tempt Him or is tempting Him to live a life just like other normal men (e.g. having married and raising children of his own). The Satan, coming in the form of an angel which herself in the form of a female child, tells Jesus that He must now forget that He is crucified and His mission is already completed. At first, Jesus is doubtful but the angel tells Jesus that His Father is no longer mad at Him. So, we are being shown that the possible life He could have in return of His living on earth. Later, Jonas comes to tell Jesus that His place is on the cross and His mission is not yet completed. Jesus, dying and old, then realises that He is being cheated by Satan. The angel reveals itself in the form of fire. Then the scene cuts to the crucifixion scene where at last Jesus utters in joy "mission completed!" Perhaps Selma is very much like Scorsese's Jesus. Her mission is to die, not to live. Thus, the dark-side temptations are ready to deviate her mission (e.g. retrial, the possibility of seeing her son again, etc).To put Von Trier in comparison, BTW and DITD recall, in retrospective, to the works of Carl Dreyer (1889 - 1968). Like the Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), Day of Wrath (1943), and Ordet (1955--in which the female protagonists die, or rather made to die, for the belief they hol--Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark seem fascinated with similar ideas of female heroinism and religious martyrdom.I find LVT's appropriation of nondiegetic music very interesting. First off, let's get our terminology right. There are two kinds of film sound: diegetic and nondiegetic. The former refers to any sound that has a source in the movie; e.g. the girl listening to a song on the radio or the music coming out from the pub, while the latter denotes any additional sound which source is outside the film, e.g. the soundtrack and film music. LVT seems to employ the latter category in terms of nondiegetic film music as primary narrative devices in BTW and DITD but he manipulates nondiegetic film music not in the same way Hollywood movies do. Lots of Hollywood/American films depend so much on the nondiegetic film music to give the audience the emotional cue of the movie scenes whereas LVT adopts nondiegetic film music as important as the narrative and the content of the film. Recall BTW. There is a complete absence of nondiegetic music between the episodes (except for one scene where Bess's husband coming home). Only when LVT stops the episodes and projects panoramic scenes, instead, could we hear the non-dietegic film music (via 1970s soundtrack). Critic James Berardinelli points out that this style interrupts the flow of the narrative and the intensity of the emotions but I believe LVT has numerous options when cutting BTW. First, LVT could follow Berardinelli's comment. But he would most probably have to leave nondiegetic music out of the narrative space completely. The effect, then, could have been more brutally and emotionally powerful. Second, if LVT were a standard American filmmaker, he would have supplied the audience with the nondiegetic music corresponding to its scenes. But this, if done, would have interrupted more greatly the emotional intensity and the narrative tone for BTW seems to rely almost exclusively on the power of the story and nakedness of Bess's emotions. Third, LVT might reserve space for nondiegetic film music. So, instead of employing the standard use of nondiegetic film music, LVT opts for appropriating film music as between the episodes, producing different feelings during the break. The time-lapsed, but almost still panoramic images leave us a sense of space to digest the intensity of camera works and emotions during the episodes, yet, the technical brilliance of the images awes us while the music uplifts us emotionally.So, for DITD, I would imagine LVT thinking this: "How am I to make a film with lots of musical in it without going washy-washy a la Hollywood?" The musical part in DITD is just the extension of Selma's musical fantasy. In the "traditional" musicals, e.g. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), Singing in the Rain (1952), The Sound of the Music (1965), etc, we are supposed to suspend our belief in time and space when the people in those films doing musicals. I believe LVT avoids this "illogical" injection into the narrative scenes by opting for fantasy like the ones experienced by Selma's. With this, LVT appropriates nondiegetic musical not as in the "reality" but Selma's fantasy while at the same time exploiting film music into the film narrative without giving up his conceptual scheme of nondiegetic film music. Thus it's not surprising to see in DITD, all the musical parts are just in Selma's imaginations, not in the spatial and temporal primacy independently from our common sense of reality. When Selma is finished with her musical fantasy, we still retain, but not regain, our common sense. To further differentiate between the reality and the fantasy, LVT employs two distinct colour schemes. In Selma's real world, we see life as it is without any artistic filtering of the things and images in the sense that LVT tries to make the colour as true as to what we experience in the real world. But in Selma's fantasy world or imaginations, the "real-world" colour has gone, replaced by more unrealistic but happier, brighter tone. This seems make sense only in Selma's fantasy as the musicals for her always mean happiness and comfort. In one scene Selma's admirer tells Selma why in the musical, people suddenly start dancing and singing. He points out that he doesn't do that in real life. Selma nods. Although the Selma's admirer may be mentally child-like in one sense, perhaps we should take his "complain" seriously. Thus it is perfectly sensible to appropriate musicals into Selma fantasizing of things for it is only there could she find comfort even though it's not in the real world.I don't think DITD is anti-musical as espoused by some critics. If one's idea about anti-musical is the musical protagonist dies off in the end, maybe there's some truth in it. But DITD cannot be seen as anti-musical just because LVT allegedly violates or subverses or terrorises the genre. It is a musical in a traditional sense for as much as LVT wants to give up the standard interpretation of doing musical, he still operates very much under the scheme of the standard Hollywood genres (melodrama and musical). What he does in DITD is to fuse the genres with great cares about the conceptual coherence of both genres. Also, I doubt that LVT's movies are anti-Hollywood. In my view, LVT, ultimately, is very much part of European filmmakers' continuing (and nostalgic) tradition of admiration for Hollywood film genres going back to the French New Wavers in the late 1950s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best that you didn't see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DANCER IN THE DARK was one of those movies that I meant to see in the theatres and for some reason or another missed. I finally go to see it on video and it was worth every minute of it. In retrospect I'm glad I got to see it in private at home. It made me relish every minute of it more.What at first seems to be the touching story of an immigrant doing the best by her son becomes even more. Through Lars Von Triers beautiful filmwork and scorching performances DANCER IN THE DARK became more than just a excellent movie. It became a beautiful film. Through the eyes of Selma, a tour-de-force by songstress Bjork, you see an everyday, commonplace world become a glorious musical. Selma hears beats and rhythems and then daydreams herself away to sprawling musical numbers, Selma's only escape from her hellish life. What makes this ultimately heartbreaking is the selflessness of Selma. Everything she does is out of lover of her "family"; her son, her best friend, her neighbors. She denies love to better protect her son. Ever more heartbreaking is the revelation that she blames herself for her son. The musical number, written by Bjork and Trier are fantastical. They are on the scale of Ziegfeld Follies but retain there own etheral quality.By the end...I didn't just view Selma's life. I felt it. When Selma was in peril, I was in peril. At times the movie was uncomfortable. It is a film experience that not all viewers are suited for. But for the viewer who is looking for more than just a run-of-the-mill experience, they won't be let down. I refuse to give too much away. Not knowing where the movie is going is half of the experience. But as advice, go where the movie takes you. It is unlike anything you will see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film worth the brutality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though beautiful, engrossing, and moving, Dancer in the Dark is a difficult film to watch. The first 45 minutes is tediously hand-filmed footage outlining the life and struggles of a Czechoslovakian immigrant, Selma, her son, and her come-to-the-rescue, guiding-light-light friend Kathy, as well as a seemingly-kind hearted police man, and a bumbling, mild-mannered lovestruck. Living a hard, impoverished life of factory work and clipping bobbypins to cards, Selma is trying desperately to "save-up" enough money for an operation to save her son from the same devastating hereditary disease from which Selma herself suffers. Because of this disease, Selma slowly progresses into total blindness, wherein her only saviour from the misery of her deplorable and dark exisistence is American musicals. In fact, Selma often daydreams of participating in musical sequences set to the humdrum sounds and experiences of her everyday life. These musical scenes are the only ones that are steadily filmed throughout the entire film, and they are digitally colour-enhanced, in effect, to contrast Selma's dreams and the bleak reality of that which she is living. The music is mesmerizing, but in the first musical scene the viewer is a tad put-off by the sudden outbursts dancing and singing in such a sullen film. However, as the film progresses, these scenes are accepted and are a phenomenal enhancement to a film that could very well stand alone without them. As for Bjork, the film would be very little more than a very sad story without her. Because of the hand-held camera work, the film has the feel of a real-time effort, and the raw emotion of Bjork is portrayed accordingly. She absorbs herself in the character and literally becomes Selma with her somewhat awkward accent and humbling, heart-melting grin. And the viewer is enraptured as they become more and more intuned with this womans experiences. Her music, as well, is represented fantastically and her talents as a songstress are amply revealed. Through a course of violent events Selma is placed in situations beyond horrendous. This film is truly emotionally wrenching, and some might ask 'Is it worth the brutality to the viewer?' In my opinion it is. As a concept, post-modern musical it shines. As a film it is nearly astounding. Lars Von Trier has written and directed a beautiful managerie of reality and surrealism and merged them accordingly. He accomplishes his mission of involving the viewer and connecting with them emotionally, and whether the movie was enjoyed by the viewer or not it is definite in its affectiveness. And that can be denied by no one. All in all, this film has all makings of a piece of art that is definitive in its field. Even if it is not loved or accepted by the viewer, it would be hard to say that it was not appreciated- whether for the score, the acting, the concept... or simply for the raw display of soul-wrenching emotion it is sure to bring upon the veiwer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Props to Dennis Potter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caution: Some spoiler content:I watched this movie for two reasons: Bjork, and a desire to experience von Trier's 'dogma' filmmaking. When I started to describe this back-to-simplicity approach to my wisely-innocent girlfriend, she said, oh yeah, like those Canadian movies from the '60s. Indeed. As for the musical stagings - others here have made reference to Dennis Potter's work: Singing Detective, Lipstick on Your Collar, for two. Someone even called Dancer a remake of the Steve Martin vehicle Pennies from Heaven, which in fact, was a flat-out remake of Potter's TV movie. Yes, indeed props must be given to the late Dennis Potter. And someone here also mentioned Terry Gilliam's Brazil. Indeed. Oh, and All That Jazz, now that I'm thinking about it. As for the 'dogma' approach, I was reminded on many Euro-films and art-house conceits I've seen over the years - I'm old enough to have been around in the '60s and '70s. I liked the naturalness of the acting, the "verite" touches, though I did find the handheld work a little too self-conscious and gimmicky for its own sake at times, yet at other moments used very effectively as a narrative device. But not much new under the sun, really. Simply said, Von Trier can neither claim nor be credited with innovation in either respect. That said, I liked the movie, chiefly for Bjork, despite the maddeningly contrived plot points, but without them, you don't have any drama, after all. Hey, it's a tragedy, and in classical tragedy, you know that coming in the door - people are supposed to screw up and succumb to nemesis, in spite of knowledge and common sense. Bruce Willis is *not* going blast his way into the death house, toss off a quip, and rescue Julia Roberts (cf. The Player). By contrast, I watched What Women Want the night before, no less preposterous a plot, but an entertaining comedy nonetheless. Dancer makes you work, makes you think, does spark differences of opinion, and that is what makes it less like entertainment and more like art. So, as tragedy, DITD was very moving- but nonetheless a movie, and emotionally manipulative, because that's what movies/videos/TV shows/commercials do.(BTW, Someone here complained about "a piece about the penal system, without including blacks." In fact, during Selma's musical fantasy during her walk to the gallows, most of the death-row prisoners she meets and hugs are black. The setting is in a small the Pacific Northwest town, where I suspect the ratio of the black population in the early '60s is relatively small compared to the 12-or-so per cent, as I seem to recall it was the U.S. national *average.* And from someone else: "By the way, The Sound of Music opened on Broadway in November of 1959. Amateur rights were not released until several years later. It did not become an icon of mainstream culture until after the release of the 1965 film version." Thanks, I was wondering about that myself. If Von Trier intends the film to be a polemic against capital punishment and for public health care, fine. Point taken. And Selma could have emigrated to Canada instead, but you'd have no story. And hey, is Zjelko Ivanec ever going to stop playing prosecutors?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes a very special movie to leave one totally speechless when the credits roll. At the end of Dancer in the Dark, I didn't know what to think. Was that the best film I've seen in years? Or was that an experimental film that is only memorable for being unique? I am still not 100% sure, but movies that get you thinking cannot be over appreciated.Much of "Dancer" is uncomfortable to sit through. At times I wanted to fast forward, others I just wanted to turn my head. I wanted to jump in the movie and stop it, just stop everything from happening. It's tragic and beautiful all at once and it's like nothing I've seen.The one thing that was clear to me after the movie is Bjork. She gives the best performance I've seen on film period. It's not acting, it's not singing and dancing, it's just being and feeling. Bjork is the movie and the movie is her. Selma and Bjork are one in the same and all the while you feel as though you are actually with her throughout the movie. Just see it, you will take something away from her.It is an absolute shame that Bjork has openly said that this, her first film, will also be her last. Everyone has said that she cannot act, and I don't believe Bjork has disputed this fact either. Well for someone who can't act, she has more talent on film in her little pinky finger then Julia, Catherine Zeta, and J-Lo combined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier repeats his exact formula from his 1996 art house hit Breaking The Waves with one notable exception: this time the leading lady sings up a storm. Bjork is phenomenal in her film debut as a young woman going blind who works in a factory to save up money for her son who has a similar condition to hers and needs an operation. Along the way, her dreams of becoming a musical star are realized through dreamy sequences with music by the leading lady herself. Things go melodramatic Sirk-style really fast, often to the disadvantage of the film's power, but no matter; Bjork's music for the film is so incredible it's all I can rave about. Vincent Paterson also lends much to the production with his energetic choreography (he even has a small part in the film).</fullReview>

I've never seen any of von Trier's works before this film, and I was not a Bjork fan, so no one can accuse me of being biased.I guess the greatest point I admire about the film is that von Trier is brave enough to do this film according to his vision. This is not a movie for people who have a preconcieved notion of what a film should be. Everyone comes in a theatre with some notion of how a movie should be like, from reading reviews etc. The difference between people who love it and people who hate it is their ability to erase their notions and accept what the film presents.Of course, people can argue that soap operas can be considered as art in this case. I'm not refuting the fact that the story is unrealistic and simple, but it WAS inspired by a children's fairy tale after all. But the way it was shot and the acting makes the whole process of viewing so intense, it's painful. Von Trier just strips away all the unnecessary bits that we commonly see in most films. He doesn't explain what he wants to convey, he shows us. This leaves the film with a climax at the very beginning and holds us (or maybe just me) until the very end, and leaves me so broken. To me, Selma is real. To me, there are people like that in the world, and most mothers are like that. Maybe you laugh cynically, but that's because we are all Little Genes, who do not realise how noble our mothers are until the very end.Von Trier goes back to the "primitive" method of using handheld cameras for the "reality" scenes and I admire him for that. It is an art to handle a shaky camera and yet still capture the essence of each scene. How many of us get so frustrated with a handheld camera cos it doesn't listen to what our hands say? Although the switch in style, between the musicals and the reality, makes the direction very evident, I seriously can't think of a better way to do it.I congratulate von Trier for being brave enough to accept all that criticism and snide remarks and still hold dear his own visions. To me, that IS being a director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of Pennies From Heaven retains stink.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So similar to PENNIES FROM HEAVEN starring Steve Martin that I wonder how anyone could get away with not calling this a remake. I've seen other remakes that had much less in common with the original work. PENNIES also dealt with a person who fantasied musical numbers, was accused of a murder, and even had the exact...yes exact!!! ending as DANCER. What's all the talk about a rip-off movie that's even more boring than the original. Bjork was good but it depends if you already liked her or not. The rest of the film stunk. For the record, so did PENNIES FROM HEAVEN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About an hour into this very slow moving film, the main character, played by Bjork, does something that is so inconsistent with her character that I could no longer watch the film. It's bad enough that this character could easily solve her problems by applying a modicum of common sense. But the director further insults his viewers by having the character do something that, while explainable, is complete unprepared for.Bjork does give a riveting performance and at times this movie is nutty and enjoyable, but after about an hour, it becomes tiresome. The jittery camera work is intrusive and nearly unbearable.If you are a fan of a good story, you will be disappointed with this film. This film is a about a stupid, pathetic character who digs herself deeper into her problem for reasons that a both unexplained an incredible. I understand why it got the attention it did, because the presentation of the story is unique and the acting is good. But the story problems outweighed the novelty for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dancer In The Dark" is considered a love/hate movie, some may find it pretensious and just plain idiotic, and others may see it as a masterpiece, I am one of the latter. "DITD" centers around Selma, an immigrant working at a factory in the 1960's. She is losing her vision, and knows this curse is hereditary and will be passed on to her son. She saves up money so he will be able to get him an operation. The rest of the story, which gets much, MUCH darker, flows along with the beginning very well but is much different. I am not going to explain the rest, not because it will give away the plot, but because it must be experienced. NOTE: It is very emotional, and the ending could be VERY hard for some viewers to sit through.Bjork gives an AMAZING performance, always hits the right mark. She also did the music for the film. (I owned the soundtrack before I saw "DITD" and wasn't that impressed with it, but once I saw the film, I appreciate it so much more). The musical sequences are excellent, they come when Selma needs the most reassurance, they put you in a trance. Siobhan Fallon, definitely not in a role you'd expect to see her in, is great as the compassionate prison guard.I loved "Dancer In The Dark". It is a must-see movie for all film- lovers.</fullReview>

She works hard so she can afford an operation to save her son's eyes. Filmed with hand camera the pictures are very realistic. Just a few times Selma escapes to "her" world - the musicals. And those scenes form a beautiful contrast. A master piece by Lars von Trier with great songs by Björk who brilliantly plays Selma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bjork is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark was nothing like I expected. Hearing very little about the film before viewing it I was surprised by its serious nature. Bjork is Selma Yeskova a simple minded Czech woman afflicted with a disease that is slowly causing her to go blind. She has come to Washington state from Europe to save her son from the same fate by affording him an operation by his teen years. They live in a trailer on seemingly generous friends land and she works in a factory in which she cheats on her vision tests to secure. Her only merriment comes with her surreal daydreams of living in a musical. She turns repetitive noises into music and the audience is swept into the fantasy world where factory workers dance and sing and ordinary daily activities are turned into theatrical interludes. The directing gives the film a documentary feel with a shaky handheld camera used for the majority of the film. The pacing is slow and sometimes hard to pay attention to. Lar von Trier could have focused more on character development. Selma's relationship with her son Jean is oddly never accentuated, and an almost romance with Jeff seems out of place with its lack of importance to the story-line. Some of Selma's actions seem misguided and we are never left with an explanation. Her past is also a mystery she often lies about her heritage and we never learn anything about Jean's father. Despite some missing story elements Dancer in the Dark has moments of film marvel. Some of the scenes are pure emotion, fast to mind her relationship with her friend Catherine the only one relationship barely explored in the film. I was almost moved to tears when Catherine danced her fingers on a nearly completely blind Selma's hand to illustrate the dancing in a musical at a movie theater they often visit. And nobody can ignore the powerful ending or one of the hardest to watch murder sequences I've ever seen in a film. Dancer in the Dark deffinately has its insightful moments but entirely it's not the ardent spectacle it sets out to be. What held the film together is Bjork's uncanny performance as Selma. Selma becomes a real person despite the story holes. It's a shame Bjork has banished any future acting, her performance was absolute brilliance and was well deserving of the Oscar nomination. I give Dancer in the Dark an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremble, you Pollyannas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer looks at musical theatre and says, in the words of a "Let It Ride" character, "It's perky, if you like perky." Selma/Bjork is a fan of the "Sound of Music" in a world in which people who seem to care assure you that "It's okay. It's okay." as they lead you to sacrificial slaughter.Like "Fargo" and "Fight Club" and "Night of the Living Dead", Dancer rolls like a pig in nitty-gritty noir set in America. It smears you in the idea that the escapist element of mainstream film and theatre are an opiate of the people. It bathes luxuriously in all the joy and frivolity of capital punishment.This is not an implausible plot, this is a cartoon exaggeration of a plot so plausible that it happens every day. Most of us don't talk about, or think about, or even see the kind of pettiness that rules Selma's world, because we don't like that mirror. At all. If it's a threadbare plot, no moreso than many of the lives that fall prey to the "banality of evil".The trouble with Dancer is that it doesn't go any farther than that. It's just mere Kafka. If you "wanna take a ride", go ahead. But von Trier leads you into the cave and leaves you there. In the dark. In the belly of the state. But that's not the only option, is it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Towards the end of the movie, Selma (Bjork), says the reason she loves musicals is that nothing bad happens; that everything is wonderful. Well, she, along with director Lars von Trier, have managed to create a very black, morbid musical - but it is this part of the movie which let me down the most. For the most part, I don't like Bjork's music, though she can have a lovely voice. The only time I thought the music worked was when she was quietly singing "My Favorite Things" to cheer herself up, and that isn't even her song (the rest, I believe, were). However, music and dancing play an integral part in the movie, as they are Selma's true loves in life (along with her son, Gene). Her angst in the movie is that Gene is developing the same eye problems that have cursed her: as a result, all her money is going towards getting him an operation, before it is too late. What happens,as she obsessively goes about her life for his cause, becomes more-and-more tragic for her, as adverse situations begin to pile-up on this sweet, loveable, girl. What eventually happens, becomes one of the most lengthly gut-wrenching, emotionally-hyper situations I've ever witnessed on film. Bjork has a personna which brings out the pathos in people. So what is an over-the-top movie, broken-up with mostly irritating musical numbers, becomes an emotional tour-de-force. Good performances by Catherine Deneuve, and Peter Stormare, especially, add to the drama. Peter Stormare especially....what a complete reversal of character from his memorable role in "Fargo". This movie should have been remembered more at Oscar-time, but I suppose it is too much on the eccentric side to appeal to the Academy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep moving along if you seek light entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In which Lars von Trier pits the ideals of imagination and nobility (i.e., total giving of self) against the realities of capitalism (greed, scarcity) and human flaws (moral weakness and greed again). As was also the case in Huxley, Orwell, and others, the noble savage meets with an unseemly demise in service of the author's point.There is contrivance in the simplicity of the plot that allows von Trier to keep this axe-grinding close to the foreground; one is not diverted by complexities. A nice by-product of this simplicity is extra space in which subtleties like character emotion and setting can work their wiles. These bonuses add extra resonance to the finale.Von Trier, meanwhile, grinds his axe dangerously close to the point of bluntness. Although he never goes over to didacticism, you feel his presence and subtle manipulation often. His world view is bleak and his resolution to the conflict above will reflect that in spades. If you're an audience member, you get to along for the ride.Plot, action, characters. Things unfold slowly and naturally and then pick up speed. Selma Walter Mitty's herself into musicals while saving up to pay for an operation that will prevent her son's hereditary blindness. She's becoming blind herself but that's of little consequence to her - her son's the thing. Bjork's Selma is wonderfully conveyed; it's one of those parts where the director says, "Don't act, just be yourself" to the star and it works. Supporting actors Deneuve (sp?) and Morse turn in polished performances.There are song-and-dance sequences, imagined by Selma. If you dislike musicals like I do, this is the musical for you. Bjork's charm and naturalism prevent the dances from becoming cloying like musicals usually do. Song-wise, think Bjork's Homogenic with horns instead of strings. Other characters sing along badly, which adds to the charm. At one point in the spoken film, fellow noble savage Jeff even says something like, "I don't get musicals. I don't break out in song in real life." Nice touch.Von Trier contrives a murder to move things along. The noble savage code sees it as unfortunate but right, society sees it as unfortunate but wrong. Everyone is a victim of circumstance ("if only this evil capitalist system hadn't put me in this bind . . . ."). Things go badly and careen tragically toward a wrenching finale.In purely entertainment, "sittin' on my couch watchin' a movie for relaxation" terms, the finale renders the film a maximum bummer. It also turns the film into a very effective anti-capital punishment tract. Kudos to von Trier for not pulling the punch on the death scene where so many have before. This is what it's really like, folks - think twice before you ask for executions on pay-per-view. That said, it gave me bad dreams and I'm a fairly seasoned indy-film bummer watcher. Lars, if you wanted to make us sad, you've done a great job both on the set-up and follow through.Does he make his point? Yes, you know that he feels the noble savage is always unjustly squashed by a less-than-noble world. You sense that he feels that imagination is more enriching than the real world. It's good that the film is this thought provoking. It's bad that the film's resonance for each viewer will depend on how much that viewer will agree with von Trier's convictions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece Crafted With Primitive Implements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more is there to say about this film? Clearly, there have been few films of such intensity and awash with melancholia. Nevertheless, Bjork has done an outstanding job of acting in a poorly crafted film that appears to have been created with blunt instruments. Jerky camera shots and incessant oversize views of the actor's epidermal and dental revelations seem to erode much of the compelling story. The dialogue and action shots are just a cut above amateur. This film, if there had been decent camera work, direction and a good rewrite, would have been Oscar material without a doubt. The way it has been shot is of poorer quality than the old Super-8 films jittery fathers used to make of birthday parties and Bar-Mitvahs. It is not until halfway through this excruciatingly long and somber story that the camera work improves somewhat. The continual negative bombardment is reminiscent of an old film called "the Fixer" with Alan Bates where the suffering and misery roll non-stop throughout, although an extremely well acted and crafted piece of work. Essentially, I would give plaudits to the fine acting of Bjork as the saving grace for this tortuous and depressing tale. It would have been quite a simple matter to make this film into a magnificent achievement worthy of many awards, however, the director missed his chance, leaving us with a stunning acting performance and a grade C cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy-handed and inaccurate death-penalty story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have admired Lars von Trier's work in the past (notably Europa, released in the U.S. as Zentropa, and The Element of Crime), but this film angered me. There are events depicted in this film that just could not occur; that is, they misrepresent our justice system in the interest of its anti-death penalty sub-theme. The overall theme of the film is rather anti-American, I thought. Everyone who speaks with a foreign accent: good. Everyone who speaks with an American accent: bad. Although well-acted for the most part (I think people tend to overpraise Bjork, though), the film suffers from the heavy-handed treatment of its director. Too long, tedious at times, and relentlessly gloomy. The musical numbers feature songs that are weak, both melodically and lyrically. There is no subtle touch at work; von Trier hammers his points home, punctuated by the jerky, edgy handheld camera work some of us have grown tired of, its novelty having long ago worn off. Sure to be a hit with people who already hate America, and those looking for reasons to. By the way, I am myself against the death penalty, but this film goes about attacking it in such an unbelievable and misleading way. The truth of how people are executed in America is a strong enough indictment; why do we need to distort that truth? A poor film that fails with its dogma.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wait a minute, there are still people here", the usher quickly whispered into her walkie-talkie, urging her colleague to dim the lights again for just a few more moments. My date and I were still sitting in the dark, unable to move or speak. We just sat there. Staring at the screen while the projector already stopped minutes ago. During the first twenty minutes of this film, many people already left. The people who stayed were either completely silent or crying out loud. We left the theatre without saying a word and roamed the nightly streets for about an hour until we finally found ourselves capable of entering a bar and socialize and interact with other people. Eventually, the impact faded and we could smile and say "It was just a movie". I still didn't know whether to embrace or slap Lars von Trier for what we saw on the screen. First of all, I want to applaud Bjork for her incredible performance. It's a real tour-de-force. She deserved the Palm d'Or and should have been nominated for an academy award as well."Mum's the word" is her character Selma's motto. A stubborn lady who won't ask other people for help and who won't even discredit the dead to save her own life. Selma is going blind, her son has the same disease. He doesn't know any of this as stress will speed up the process. Selma cheated on her eye-test to get a job in a factory so she can make money to get her son the operation that will save him. Only when her friendly landlord, policeman Bob, confesses to her that he isn't the rich man his materialistic wife thinks he is, she decides to comfort him by telling him about her own problems. She even starts to work double shifts, to save both her son and Bob. Tired and daydreaming she accidentally breaks one of the machines she's working on and gets fired. And what do you know, officer Bob steals all the money. Selma tries to get it back, but Bob says she has to kill him for it. She does, eventually, in a prolonged and overly dramatic sequence. She is arrested and because she kept -and keeps- everything to herself, she seems a clear cut guilty person. Bad eyes? Not according to her doctor. HER money? No, she is a poor mother and Bob was a rich policeman. Selma the immigrant took advantage of her friends and deserves to be hung.Many people watch soap-opera's. In Holland, we have this thing called "Good Times, Bad Times". In its first season almost every main character was kidnapped and held hostage by a mental patient at least three or four times. They usually got -and get- out of these kind of ordeals without traumas or messing up their hair. The sets looked like cardboard and so were the characters which were -and are- portrayed by good-looking people with little or no charisma or talent. Worse, this series has actually won several Best Drama awards. These mind-numbing soap-opera's also desensitizes its viewers. It has no power of shock. It is repetitive. Unchallenging. Characters go through many of the same ordeals every season and come out of it undaunted. Sort of like a Tom and Jerry cartoon for adults who sit down in front of the tube and have their daily dose of gloating. Von Trier seems to protest against this apathy. In this film, he uses a story even a soap-writer would be ashamed of, and pushes things to the max. He prolongs and saturates dramatic situations. No twenty minutes of badly acted rubbish, but two and a half hours of relentless discomforting misery. Von Trier is saying with this film: "So you thought of other people's misery as entertainment, huh? So you think it's nice to see people in peril, huh? Well, let's redefine that definition, shall we?" There are some wonderful musical numbers, too, providing false hope. Von Trier constantly uses them to pull the rug from underneath our feet. A daydream sequence of a happily dancing Selma, in the courtroom, with swinging judges and lawyers is suddenly cut and we are back in reality. A close up of Selma's pale, ill face, as she is listening to her being sentenced to death.It worked. Obviously, many of the people in the theatre expected a popcorn-flick, with lots of drama and an obligatory happy end.These were the people who either became almost hysteric or fled from the theatre.This is very competent filmmaking, by the way. More than two and a half hours long, but brilliantly paced, a balanced piece of work. Never the slightest hint of a momentary collapse.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dancer in the Dark" is a splendid film with a balance between light and dark, fantasy and reality. Generally, I am less than impressed with singers who make the transition from singing to acting (Madonna and Courtney Love are two who come to mind) but Bjork will simply amaze you! She's supra natural as the Czechoslovakian Selma and utterly mesmerizing. Her enigmatic quality and unusual countenance allow her to flow effortlessly between the realms of fantasy and "reality".Some may find the musical interludes a little superfluous. But when one understands that this fantasy realm is integral to Selma's character and thus understanding her, you'll gain a better appreciation for all the "singing and dancing".The tight shots and hand-held camera techniques afford a sense of intimacy and verisimilitude to this movie. Yes, there are a flaws in the film: holes in the plot and a running time of 2hrs 21min, but it certainly won't take away from your enjoyment of "Dancer in the Dark".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A performance from the soul - very minor spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one thing that even the most jaded viewer must admit about Dancer in the Dark; Bjork's performance was outstanding. She puts her heart and soul into every moment of this film. She is a singer not a trained actor and she certainly doesn't have a movie stars looks but in a movie like this that is all for the best. What she lacks in technical craftmanship she more than makes up for in spirit.When the man who loves her discovers that she is nearly blind she sings "I Really Don't Care"; a powerful paen in which she tells us that she has seen everything she wants and has no regrets even though all around her the world is turning black-- she is content to simply dance in the dark, she has found joy. I watched the film today on video for the first time and I must have replayed that scene a dozen times it is a moment of sheer Platonic Beauty. Unfortunately, right after that the movie, for me at least, falls apart.The next sequence of scenes, while amazingly well acted and directed-- particularly the death scene-- are so illogical and absurd on so many levels that I lost my "suspension of disbelief", without which the magical meditation of cinema cannot produce transcendence. So close and yet.The film also would benefit from a judicious cut or two it seems at least 20 minutes too long.This could have been a great film a true masterpiece. Even so it is well worth watching particularly for old souls with an open mind and a taste for symbolic films that are off the beaten path.</fullReview>

I consider myself somewhat jaded by today's films, but I actually wept at the end of this one. That said, this film probably isn't for everybody...anyone who hates musicals probably will not care much for this. It's also a bit slow in parts.

		<fullReview>I first saw this film round about the same time that the 2001 oscar ceremony was broadcast. I was blown away completely. Infact, I even cried. Bjork's performance is mesmirizing, her child-like angelic persona wins us over within the first fifteen minutes and from then on Von Trier plays with our emotions like a puppeteer. Mixing documentary drama with musicals was always going to be a gamble, but luckily it paid off. The music is magical, probably Bjorks best work yet. I know that this film has been condemned by some as manipulative melodrama and not everyone liked it. But the haters are in the minority. This film will only appeal to an intelligent audience. If you don't like Bjork - don't watch. If you don't like heart-warming dramas - don't watch. If you don't appreciate gutsy European experimental movie-making - don't watch. Dancer in the Dark was criminally ignored at the oscars. Maybe it had something to do with George W Bush's ancient capital punishment principles. The injustice that Selma faced in the film is similar to the injustice that DITD received at the Oscars. Erin Brokavich? Erin Smokavich! I'm not saying that Julia Roberts isn't a talented actress, but lets face it, Bjork makes her look like Liz Hurley. It's a shame that she said she'd never act again, it would be interesting to see if she could play someone different. I'm sure that Bob Dylan won best song simply because of his life-time achievement rather than the actual song in question. DITD wasn't even nominated for best foreign film! Thank God for Cannes, that's all I can say. I highly recommend this film and I hope that Von Trier keeps up the good work. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I can say I liked this film but not as much as I hoped. Too much of it was pretentious - the jerky camera motion and the over acting of Bjork. I thought she was great and very intense in this film but I'm wondering if she has the range or talent to continue in films as different people. I couldn't help shake the feeling that she was very much a part of the character she played.Disturbing film without question but the story was very simple and almost elegant. I thought the film production overall was quite good and the film itself was more creative than most we get to see.I felt depressed afterwards and had to have a couple of beers to cheer me back up. This movie is for those who like art movies, don't mind some pretentiousness, and aren't disturbed easily by a very harsh cold reality and things not ending happily ever after - they don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW!!! This movie just makes you want to laugh and cry the whole time. The way Lars Von Trier makes you identify with the deteriorated mind of Selma is brilliant. It actually makes you want to start living in musicals. Bjork is remarkable in her role of a blind woman who's not quite all there. I was actually left stupified when I viewed this film and am now set forth as being as genius a filmmaker as Lars Von Trier. Trier's last hit Breaking The Waves is another classic of the depiction of a woman who's gone crazy with love. But in Dancer In The Dark it's not a love between lovers, but the love between a mother and her son. She is determined to do whatever she has to do for her son to get the eye-surgery to prevent him going blind too. She escapes the troubles she has to endure for doing this by letting her mind transpire into a musical where nothing bad ever happens. I commend Lars Von Trier as well as Bjork in creating this modern masterpiece that shall forever hold the title of being one of The Best Pictures Ever Made!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bjork is outstanding in this odd and unconventional drama about a soon-to-be blind woman who struggles through through obstacles that lead to a tragic resolve. The film is melodramatic and depressing but it also happens to be a brave, hypnotic and ultimately powerful experience. It's extremely well made, infusing musical numbers as a fantasy device for Bjork's character. The songs may not always be excellent but they are consistently interesting. If you want something with an edge that challenges the mind, Dancer In The Dark will do just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Love-it/Hate-it Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark is a film where your responses will be based on a series of conditional statements. *If* you like Icelandic chanteuse Bjork's music... *If* you like Bjork's voice and persona.. *If* you like director Lars Van Trier's shakey cam aesthetic... *If* you like Lars Van Trier's typically hyperemotional style.. *If* you like Hollywood musicals... *If* you like long depressing working class drama... *If* you like naturalistic performance styles...The problem is that there's a noticable domino effect at work in Dancer in the Dark. It's a safe bet that if you answer "No, I don't" to, say, two or more of the above statements, you may well HATE Dancer in the Dark. It won't be a state of ambivalence, rather a passionate distaste. On the other hand, if the pieces work for you, it's possible to get carried away with your praise of the film. And in all honestly, both opinions are valid. And strangely, I find myself on the fence on most of them.Dancer in the Dark is the not-so-warm-and-fuzzy story of Czech immigrant Selma (Bjork), a factory worker who's saving all of her money so that her son get get a eye operation which would prevent the early blindness that she's experiencing. Selma's only pleasure comes from the musicals she loves. She goes to see early Hollywood musicals with her friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) and she's also doing an amateur production of The Sound of Music. [As an aside, Bjork may make the freakiest Maria in Sound of Music History] The film's tragic complications are put into motion by Selma's landlord, a policeman (David Morse) who may be lying about his wealth.It has been much discussed that Dancer in the Dark's plot is always melodramatic and frequently inane. There's no point in saying anything about its plausability, about how Selma finds herself seemingly testifying against herself in a murder trial, or, well, anything in the film's final act. None of it makes much logical sense, but then again, neither does a magical nanny who flies into town on an unbrella, so we clearly cut musicals some slack.Oh yes, I seem to have left that out of my summary. As Selma becomes increasingly overwhelmed by the real world, she begins to fantasize that she's in a Technicolor musical. You know, the kind of musical where prison guards, jury members, and factory workers know all the words to the same songs and know all of the dance steps?Lars Van Trier is too amused by his own deconstruction of the musical and that's one of my major problems with the film. He seems to think he's being so cute with the various characters discoursing on musical conventions before he goes and tinkers with the same conventions. I'm not sure, though, if he's subverting the genre or embracing it. Or if he just doing a mixture, in which case it just isn't as interesting an idea as he thinks it is.Also, it's hard to tell which part of the genre the film is playing with. When Selma and Kathy go to the movies, they watch old black and white Busby Berkeley kinds of movies. But when Selma goes into her fantasies, she's in a bright technicolor musical which contrasts with the handheld digital video look of her normal life. It's unclear to me how compatible these two visions are.The film's songs, written by Bjork (with lyrics by the director), revolve around the idea of the found rhythm of life. Selma makes music out of the clattering of machines at the factory, the footsteps of prison guards, and the sounds of a train. The organic generation of her songs also plays against the grain of musical tradition, in which the sounds tend to be completely extra-diagetic. Again, I'm not sure how to deal this that.I also just dislike Bjork. That said, she's excellent in the film. Or at least perfect for it. I just didn't really enjoy the songs because I don't enjoy Bjork's music. However, one of the pleasures of watching the film on video is that you can go back and watch the musical numbers a second or third time to try to get into the songs. For the most part, this failed for me, but after two viewings I finally began to enjoy the train song, "I've Seen It All." Once again, I accept that people who like Bjork more than I will probably find much more to enjoy.On video the drab "real life" portions of the film perfectly retain their immediacy. And the performances of all of the leads stand out wonderfully. The musical sections, on the other hand, have been very poorly pan-and-scanned and Lars Van Trier's intended effect seems to be partially lost. Either way it's easy to respect cinematographer Robby Muller's superlative work.So in the end, I just don't know about Dancer in the Darker. It's interesting and original. It's also pretentious to an extreme degree and the melodrama is a bit more than my taste. Van Trier's ability to drive his female stars to the brink of insanity is a skill, but I'm not 100% convinced about its artistic greatness. The mixture of elements is frequently compelling, but never completely pulled me in.So I'm giving this one a 6/10. That's probably more moderate than most reviews this film will get. I'd expect lots of nines and tens and a few twos and ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visceral and unique film that holds your attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an unusual film. It combines the Dogme style of shooting the film, with hand-held shaky shots and the the look of it being shot with a camcorder at times, and also includes interludes of musical fantasy. The singer Björk plays Selma, a Czech-born woman who is now in America in the 60s. She is going blind with a rare eye complaint and so is her son. She is fascinated with musicals and dancing. She works in a basin factory and saves all her money away for an operation to cure her son's sight. Her landlord Bill (David Morse) has fallen on hard times and also needs an influx of cash. He then proceeds to steal Selma's money and threatens her with with a gun. In the struggle Selma shoots Bill. She is now in prison awaiting execution. The final scenes are emotional. The film holds your attention throughout. It runs for over two hours but it doesn't seem that. The musical interludes are different, the ones on the train and in the court room stand out. Björk is very good in the film. The only minor flaw is she doesn't look old enough to have a thirteen year-old son. She looks like a little kid herself. Another flaw is why didn't she get a loan of some sort to get the two thousand or so dollars to save her life? But these are minor nitpicks. The cast is good and includes Catherine Deneuve (Belle de Jour) as Selma's co-worker Kathy; Peter Stormare (Fargo) is Selma's aspiring boyfriend Jeff, and Cara Seymour (American Psycho) is Bill's wife Linda. Stellan Skarsg?rd shows up briefly. The film will put some folks off in the way it rapidly jumps to a musical interlude during a scene of emotional drama. While watching it with me, my girlfriend remarked just before a musical scene, "There she goes again". You sense that a musical segment is going to start. But is that a problem or not? Watch it and see. Lars von Trier is a master of his craft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of course it's blurry!!!! SPOILER ALERT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stop!Please don't say the cinematography is poor --blurry, jumpy, off color, etc. The film is about seeing in other ways besides sight. You have to struggle to see the film as Selma struggles to see, and understand, the world around her.Another frequent criticism is how the film is supposed to be set in the U.S. although it obviously is not. Again, this adds to the off balance nature of the film and, although I'm not sure this was the directors intention, makes us look at character, cinematography and struggle. Their town does not exist, nor could it, but the people, incredibly, could exist.In my opinion the film could have ended after she killed the cop. At the risk of missing what the final point was (still not sure) it would have been a provocative, tragic, if unsettling, end to an interesting film.Wouldn't (couldn't) see it again though.</fullReview>

I was simply amazed that a mere movie could affect me in a very emotional way, I was just not prepared for it. I guess it's the first time that I've seen a movie where a character has been developed so well that I've established some sort of a bonding or an understanding with her. Leading to a sense of bereavement when she's taken away in a most gut-wrenching way. The surprising thing is we know what's coming (in a way), but we're still not prepared for the impact.

		<shortDescription>Extreme, original, and ultimately boring and unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very extreme film. It has some strong positive aspects. For one, there is Bjork's voice, which is beautiful and odd as always. I would like to hear the music again, because I think the post-industrial sound is very interesting, especially in this context. Plus, I thought she did an unexpectedly great job at acting and capturing the camera lens with her dreamy, elvish look. She was appealing and very believable in an annoying and unbelievable role. Also, the film is highly original in examining and and reconstructing the musical. I've never seen another movie quite like it, and I really like that aspect of it. I didn't mind the camerawork, because it was as dingy and helter-skelter as the world it was portraying.There are also some strong negatives, however. For one, the movie is boring, especially towards the end. And if a film is implausible on a practical level, which I think is a great idea, it should also suspend the viewer's disbelief. This did not. The only person who completely suspended my disbelief was Bjork, and she wasn't working with great material, so more power to her. I also thought Catherine Deneuve did a good acting job making her character believable as possible, although she was miscast as factory worker/best friend. She had less to work with than Bjork, if possible. It was very incongruous to see this former Marianne of France with her perfectly coiffed blonde hair and natural model-like elegance plopped down in this grimy factory world--Bjork fit in much better.The film truly made me want to get up and walk out from time to time when nothing seemed to gel--the filming with the plot and the reactions of the characters. Nothing seemed to make any sense. It would take an awful lot of skill to make a (SPOILER coming up) murder trial/factory worker musical work. I was very interested to see if Von Trier could do it, but I ultimately don't think he did. I definitely won't see this one again. I have a hard time knowing how to rate this with one rating, so I don't think I will. I'd give it a 10 for originality of concept, filming and music; a 3/4 for keeping my interest; a 1 for gaping holes in artistic believability and a 10 for Bjork's performance. If you like Bjork and enjoy the concept of the musical, you'll get something out of seeing this, but be forewarned that it is stylistically incoherent and increasingly grim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got mad at this film. No, really - it hurt me.The performances are gripping; the musical interjections are wonderfully surreal. Dancer In The Dark explores human pain (notably: economics, disease, and naivete) by placing a selfless, generous, innocent at the mercy of a cruel existence. The Dogme95 folks are relentless in their ability to assault you with images and concepts.This film is a psychological masterpiece: the lead character must distance herself from existence through adolescent daydreams and a sincere love for music; and you must distance yourself while watching it because of the immense suffering on screen, en route, and in you.Any criticism of Bjork is misguided: her childlike joy and pretty smile (not to mention her pure, gutsy, haunting singing voice) make this film what it is. No other actress could have BEEN this.I think this is art. It expresses, it affects, it destroys. I don't know what else to say.

		<shortDescription>Very impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, anyone who says this film is "bad" or that Bjork is "terrible" doesn't know a thing about film. Even if you don't like the film, you have to realize that there are some great things about it, not the least of which is it's incredible originality.Is Dancer a musical? Well, yes and no. It's a musical in the sense that there are songs sung and danced by the cast in the middle of the movie. But that's where the definition ends. Lars von Trier (the director) and Bjork have opened the door, I think, for more expressive musicals to be made. Selma (Bjork) is a simple daydreamer, and uses music and dance throughout her life (and the film) as a way to deal with reality. She's not crazy, but very flighty. This "musical" uses songs the best way they can be used in a musical: to explain characters actions and feelings rather than just having the actors just breaking their pattern of real dialogue and bursting into song. This point is amusingly pointed out by Peter Stormare's character (Jeff). When Bjork breaks out into song and dance, we know it's not really happening, and that it's her way of dealing with certain situations.Between the unusual songs and the way that the scenes in which the songs are used are written, Dancer shows us a lot of things we have never seen in a film, and it must be commended for that. In particular, the pivitol scene (no spoilers) between Bill (David Morse) and Selma, and the final scene of the film.The characters are extremely well developed, in particular Selma, Bill and Jeff. Bjork, Stormare and Morse allow us to read volumes into their characters just by their expressions and actions. Stormare in particular, with very few actual spoken lines in the film, tells us all we need to know and more about his character. He and Bjork should be strongly considered for Oscar noms.There was very little "filler" in this film. Surprising for a 2 hour and 20 minute film that's relatively simple. Every scene is crucial to our understanding of the characters; there were no scenes that I thought were unnecessary. Bravo to the editors.A lot of reviews have called the film "blatantly manipulative". I don't agree, but I can see why someone would say that. But I actually think the manipulation is very sublte. Sure bad things happen to Selma . But they happen in the context of the mood of the film, and they're presented in a realistic fashion. It's not like the film Bounce or any other film where an unrealistic tragedy happens to a wildly happy and self confident individual. Dancer, I'm told, is shot with real lighting. It definitely takes on a realistic style. The mood of the film is somewhat down, so when bad things happen, they don't seem blatant or out of place. And so what if you think the movie is being manipulative? Are filmmakers not allowed to make sad, weepy stories? Bjork is perfect for this role. She doesn't overact at all, and her natural quirky look and behavior are perfect for Selma. Obviously, we all know she can sing and dance. But she should be able to make us forget that she's not an actor so we can lose ourselves in her character, and she does. You're not sitting there thinking "That's Bjork, the singer" when she's in character, like you do in a Madonna movie.I really have no complaints with this film. The main thing that keeps me from giving it an "A" is that it really didn't impact me emotionally at the end, and a film like this should. Like the film "You Can Count On Me", the characters are trying deliver an emotional wallup, but they just fall a little short, at least for me. And perhaps the film could have flowed a little better in terms of time. Many major events occur in the film, but you really have no frame of reference for time. A minor flaw, perhaps, among other minor flaws.Very original and very enjoyable: B+</fullReview>

I hope that I will be a better person as a result. It's a great film; highly recommended if it's not too late.I did not read all 196 comments, but of those I did, I feel that many have missed the point of the close-up film technique. Undeniably, it is discomforting and truly makes one nauseous, but I feel that it serves a purpose: we are seeing the action not through our own eyes, but through the myopic ones of Selma Yeskova. We are feeling her discomfort and nausea. Lars von Trier could have taken it even further; he draws the line at the black-screen introduction and ending. Excellent control of the technique.Furthermore, the musicals are pathetic...but they are not ours (aside from the relief they proffer our eyes). Instead, they give Selma her only release from the daily burden she carries. They provide her hope and strength.An excellent film. I'm only sorry I waited so long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic masterpiece which brilliantly conveys the depths of human tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a haunting evocation of human tragedy, Lars von Trier's neo-musical is the sort of singular piece, over-flowing with warmth and pathos, that re-affirms one's faith in the medium's ability to create beautiful, affecting pieces of art.At its heart and soul is Selma (brilliantly portrayed by Bjork), a passionate young mother steeped in the drudgeries of factory work. She toils night and day, secretly setting aside her wage to pay for treatment that will prevent her son from going blind (all the while suffering from failing sight herself). When her neighbour (David Morse), a police officer torn between humanity and desperation, steals her savings, a train of events is set into motion which does not cease until Selma's perdition is complete. Von Trier elevates this simple plot far beyond the realms of mere tear-jerker by unflinchingly conveying the harrowing reality of Selma's destruction without any palliatives. The lavish, colour-saturated musical set pieces of her fantasies distinguish between her rapidly darkening external life and her hopeful, loving imaginary world in such a way as to develop even deeper sympathy for her plight.A further aspect of the film that greatly enhances its power are the superb characterisations, not only of Selma, but also the supporting roles of her best friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve), admirer Jeff (Peter Stormare), and prison warden Brenda (Siobhan Fallon). The presentation of all three as kind, sincere people makes it more affecting to watch Selma's approaching doom, in the knowledge that she remains loved and cared for. Indeed, even the police officer who ultimately condemns Selma to destruction, is no mere villain; he is a character enduring his own torments, a man not without compassion but provoked to desperate acts through his own sufferings.The screening I attended of this film was at a mainstream cinema, one which usually shows such meaningless fair as Mission Impossible and its atrocious, damaging ilk. The audience, neither expected nor wanted to see a serious, emotionally charged piece. Indeed, other pieces I have seen in such theatres which likewise attempt to deal with solemn, grave issues have been marred by the audience, which laugh when there is no cause for laughter, and reject profundity and empathy by seeking amusement in shallow appearances. Thus they lighten the tone and debase works of seriousness. It is testament to Dancer in the Dark's power that, once it had ended, at least half of the audience were tearful, while one woman had to be physically helped out of the theatre, such was the extent of her weeping. There was no laughter, nothing in the feel even remotely possible of lightening its mood. Few films contain such potency.Dancer in the Dark is, in future years, destined to be considered a classic. To watch it is to enter into palpable anguish; the inexorable destruction of a good, ingenuous individual. It is a film that builds in intensity and power, becoming a despairing yet mesmeric depiction of the rain falling on the just and unjust alike, and an experience that is not easily forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one conceit here, unchallenged by any of the characters, is the heroine's belief that her son was doomed to inherit her sight impairment and that its rate of onset and window for a cure would be very specific . . . to a point where she feels responsible for not having had an abortion years ago. Apart from that, the film is compelling and witty. Since most of the musical numbers are tripod firm and formally shot, this film could be a nice bridge for Lars to move away from the Dogme style which rather limits and strains film language.Joel Grey has a great cameo, and the songs have a goofy charm which for some odd reason doesn't undermine the deadly and somewhat ugly reality around it. But if you have seen Steve Martin in Pennies From Heaven you have seen a similar soup of musical style and rather tragic subject matter, and I agree that the earlier film is better as a movie although Dancer in the Dark might just cause people to join Amnesty International. I saw the movie a few nights ago, and I'm still kind of rattled by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst this film had some amazing moments - the complete package was disappointing considering the pedigree (Cannes!).The use of the hand-held camera for home movie effect is over-utilised early on causing disorientation and illness.Bjork's signature sing-song voice produced a jarring London-like accent on her Check immigrant character.There is almost no registration of the underlying characters in this movie apart from to break into song/dance when required at bizarre moments, with even the son and David Morse's characters wife reduced to shadows (especially during the later part of the movie - where the son makes no appearance at all).What is essentially a quite tragic story was completely overwhelmed by "effects" and leaving me feeling dis-satisfied like a poorly prepared meal.That said, the friend I went with, cried and claims it as a triumphant work - go figure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>She's stunning in this one. She plays her part so well. I didn't realize she had such a flare for acting. I guess I should have realized from her music videos that she has a real screen presence."Dancer in the Dark" is a touching movie about a woman slowly going blind because of a genetic affliction that unfortunately has been passed along to her son. She is working to raise money so he can have an operation to save his sight. However, she loves movie musicals and sometimes loses herself in her own musical numbers."Dancer" rips the emotion right out of you. At the screening I saw in New York, during one time late in the movie when the movie was momentarily silent, I could hear plenty of others sniffing because they had been crying. "Dancer" is shot with a handheld camera and has grainy colors -- except for the musical numbers when the camera is stationary and the colors come alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Experience that will stay with you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this superb piece of genius, I was left with the decision of wheather to recommend it to others or not. No Movie has ever made me feel like this one has, I was physically sick and exhausted afterwards.Bjork plays Selma Yeskova, a struggling single Mother that has emigrated from Eastern Europe to America, she works day and night in a harsh factory saving all of her money to pay for an operation that will prevent her son from loosing his sight, tragically for her it is to late as her sight continues to deteriorate throughout the Movie. Selmas only real escape from her cruel disease and her inhuman working hours is her passion for musicals.Although this Movie starts off quite slow, it does manage to grip you from the begining and the musical pieces of the film although quite simple are passionately effective.Everybody loves Selma and Bjork played her extremely convincingly, Bjork is incredibly cute and quite possibly the nicest person in the world in this film, all you want is the best for her but unfortunately her life just keeps getting worse and worse, Fate keeps handing her very cruel situations that will undoubtedly leave you fumbling for your tissues and grasping at your chest as you literally feel your heart being ripped out of your chest in sympathy for what this poor woman has to go through.The final scene will leave you breathless/speechless and in a state of emotional agony, I can't help thinking how drained and tired Bjork must have been after filming wrapped on this movie.A fantastic cast made this Movie what it was and as usual Catherine Deneuve bought power and dignity to her role, what a beautiful actress she is.Peter Storemore who plays Selmas would-be boyfriend is absolutely wonderful as the shy, sensitive, somewhat reserved gentle giant. They make a beautiful couple because they are so cute.Speaking of cute, I do think this movie relies on the Bjork being as cute as she possibly can to gain as much pity and encite as much emotion as she can from her audience, there is nothing wrong with this and it was successful in this Movie but anymore and it would have ruined it.Her accent also needed some work and was very unconvincing but she can be forgiven, she is not an actress and was far better on the silver screen than most Hollywood actors we have today especially for her first film.In conclusion This film is full of good music, great acting and the kind of tragedy that you wouldn't believe possible (The scene where Bjork sings "These are my favorite things" will leave you experiencing empathy to the degree that wouldn't think possible for the human phyche to achieve, you may also find it quite confronting for that reason) This is an extremely important film and one of the most convincing that I have seen and I highly doubt that anyone would want to see it again, not because it is not brilliant just because I don't think anyone would want to ride such an extreme emotional rollercoaster by choice again.I guess I would recommend this film to everybody to watch as I feel it is important to see this Movie, but take your tissues and don't see it if you are in a fragile state of mind.Who was it that said Nothing bad ever happens in musicals?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about special people. I loved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start this review by saying that I love movies about people. And believe it or not there are not that many. Alot of films are full of characters and situations that would never happen, or if they did they wouldnt happen like they do in those movies. This film is about a person who is going blind and she daydreams away whenever things are becoming to harsh, and in her daydreams what is worst becomes best. Those who are attacking her are now supporting her. She is played by bjork who has a perfect movie face. She looks like a romantic heroine. I will not give away anything about the rest of the movie's plot. Also this film like not too many others makes an effort to show you whats important in each scene with the cameras. No shots look theatrical (Except in some of the musci sequences but that is [art of the effect) or contrived. They show you the faces and the conflicts. Dancer in the dark also has a director who is really trying to tell you a story and one which has good things to show. It also has the best formula for a movie. And that it to have a person who doesnt want to hurt anyone being taken through as many horrific events as possible, only to keep their own humanity. I cried so many times in it because you really wanted the best for her and she was just trying to do the best, but nothing ended up working out for her. Things ended up becoming worse and worse. The ending is so powerful and so strong its hard to believe how vapid and shallow most stories recently you are told are. *WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD* When Bjork sings "A few of my favourite things it breaks your heart.The acting is great all around. So many good actors are in this film. Catherine Denueve, Jean Mac Barr. Zejiko Ivanek (Great in the Sender) and Udo Kier. All the other actors do a brilliant job especially Bjork and the guy who played Jeff. The music and musical sequences are terrific (Although they would be no good in any other film) and the situations are all great.More movies like this. All hopes that Lars Von Trier (I've never seen any of his other movies) makes more films like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's refreshing to see a different type of movie generating so much publicity, especially as Hollywood Studios have decided to cookie-cutter our options down to bite-size morsels. However, innovation is not sufficient to make a great film (see, for example, "Time Code"). Mr. von Trier tries his best to evoke the most drastic emotions from his audience in this campy melodrama. Yet, he comes up short in his quest, especially in comparison with another movie centered on the examination of persons spiraling downward: "Requiem for a Dream."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not cry. I did not cry when I was a child, I did not cry when my great grandmother died early last year. And I certainly do not cry at movies. EXCEPTI did cry when I saw dancer in the dark. It is an emotionally draining plummet (not roller coaster, because that would denote high points) that left me exhausted physically and emotionally. Von Trier has brought out the feeling in me that I cannot bring out in myself. Bjork is unconditionally the best lead I have ever seen in any movie. The disappointing part of this movie is that I cannot bring myself to watch it again. It is incredibly heart wrenching. While I do acknowledge that the story is a not original or altogether complex or even realistic, I cannot ever deny how much this movie has touched me.It is also visually stunning. It uses the handheld technique "pioneered" by the Blair Witch Project to maximum and devastating effect.I would also be remiss in not saying how completely wonderful the supporting cast was. Gene will go on to wonderful things. Deneuve will be able to add this to her great list of movies. and Bjork, who will no longer make movies, will know that here debut and finale have touch many people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing dreadful happens in musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier's latest offering again focusses on the very difficult in interpersonal relationships. The issues in Von Trier's films seem to border on the fantastic set in the most natural of surroundings.In its theme and treatment, Dancer in the Dark toes that line.Selma (Bjork) is the pivot around which the characters and themes in the film revolve. We are told through conversational exposition that she is going blind rapidly and her sole aim is to save enough money to enable her son, who suffers from the same genetic disability, to undergo an eye operation. Her singlemindedness in this objective 'blinds' her to protestations of love from Jeff and to the consequences of what she is faced with once the gun is turned on to Bill (David Morse). Von Trier holds up the social construct of law against the social construct of honour as Selma, in a fascinating moment in court, refuses to disclose what Bill told her in confidence even as her refusal sinks her further in the appearance of guilt.In a rivetting performance, Bjork overshadows the other actors as she plumetts towards her self destruction. David Morse plays Bill perfectly but the other actors do not exude any magnetism on screen; even Catherine Deneuve fails.The treatment of the theme as a musical is probably a result of Von Trier's (or Bjork's) love for the genre and leaves a very uneven taste in the mouths of the audience which, although probably used to a resurgence of the musical at the hands of Woody Allen, is probably only willing to accept that nothing dreadful happens in musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first aspect of the film that struck me was the use of the camera...like a home movie, this I thought at first was going to get on my nerves, but as you watch you realise how much of a good idea this was, and how much it contributed to the feeling of the film. The word 'feeling' is most certainly an important word when it comes to this film. The film had taken me on an emotional journey, that just broke my heart. Bjork was wonderful, she just felt so natural and I quickly fell in love with her character Selma....a kinda desperate feeling of sorrow and respect for what she was doing, a person that someone could easly take advantage off, you felt like you just wanted to protect her from the harshness of the world.At first when I heard that this was in fact a musical, I had serious reservations...the memories of 'the hills are alive with the sound of music' came flooding back. Dancer in the Dark however used the musical style in a way that complemented the plot of the film and provided a bit of light relief when the film got heavy...and boy does it!All in all...the best film of the year, when you are still thinking about it 3 days later and its still just makes me want to just cry in desperation, you know that its a winner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring, mindblowing, BRILLIANT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark is one of my favourite movies ever. From the very beginning, a beautiful braveheart-type musical piece set on the still black screen waiting for the movie to start, to the heart-stopping, most tragic, moving ending. Bjork plays a foreign girl who comes to America to make a surgery for her sons eye-sight possible. She herself has this disease to, but only in a more advanced stage. She is already going blind faster and faster. And she doesn't want her son to be waiting the same fate. That's why she saves her money up by working at a plant and just scraping money together to finance the operation of her son. The story follows Selma (Bjork) in this road to accomplishing this. But she goes to such a deep amount of misery and bad-luck .. unbeleivable .. so moving. I believe the amount of inspiration that has gone into making this movie is incredible. Lars von Trier uses the hand-held camera principle (which we saw in The Blair Witch Project, only without the shaking) and it works out great. You feel present at every conversation held, every event that takes place and every tear that's shed.Brilliant.I can't say it enough. Dancer in the Dark pulls you in and won't let you go. I walked 30 minutes through the city after seeing this movie. Just thinking about what just happened. Alone in my thoughts, awake and dreaming. The only down-point I feel are the amount of musical scenes, sometimes they just come in at the wrong part of the storyline. But it's just a minor flaw. Bjork deserves so much credit for her part. It might just be the best performance I have seen delivered by an actress ever. Certainly this year. I haven't seen Quills or Traffic yet, but I doubt if the actors or actresses in those movies come anywhere close to what Bjork has showed us here. I certainly hope the movie wins quite a few oscars. At least the ones for Best Supporting Actress (Catherine Deneuve) and Best Actress (Bjork). If Bjork doesn't win this oscar i'll bang my head up to this brick wall 82 times or so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this acting or being?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an incredible experience.The plot oozed incredulity.Bjork's accent could best be called Scando-Cockney - they must find it amusing in Prague. Catherine Deneuve as a immigrant factory worker seems like a monumentally foolish casting decision. The small roomed, wood panelled interiors seemed European rather than American. The script was more melodramatic than a Bollywood epic.Not withstanding this, I was moved by this film more than just about any other - perhaps an impact comparable to The Piano, Schindler's List, and One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. I became totally entranced by Bjork's Selma. I've rarely seen a protagonist's torment transmitted so effectively on screen. The final scenes are harrowing and totally unforgettable.Bjork is an original. There's no-one (that I'm aware of) who could be said to be similar to her - in musical style, personality, or looks.At first I was distracted by persona of the Bjork we know from the music world. And there were times, especially early in the film, when she seemed to be just mouthing the words - like a musician who didn't know much about acting would. But as it rolled on and the intensity of the character builds, Bjork seems to utterly revel in the portrayal. I got the impression that Bjork the person has become totally the Selma character - fusing to generate an on screen force even greater than the on stage impact of Bjork the musician.If you haven't been taught to act - maybe you just be that person.The musical fantasy interludes seemed stylistically reminiscent of Indian "masala" movies (although the music was strictly Bjork). These interludes allowed us to escape with Selma from her current predicament. I definitely welcomed them as a brief respite from the intensity of the situation I was watching. Each three minutes of musical allowed me to catch breath, reflect and prepare for the further challenges our heroine will face.What I also liked about Dancer in the Dark was its politics. While set in the late 1950s (that's my guess), the issues raised should resonate even more clearly today in the US - the failure of the society to support adequate medical or legal services for the poor and the utter barbarity of the American solution to serious crime.The point is that the Dream that immigrants place their hopes in can so easily become the American Nightmare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By my view maybe the best movie for the year 2000. Director Lars Von Trier has given up some of his methods, and hence we can enjoy this musical telling a dramatic story taking place in 50's America. It will probably give you a fresh point of view to the world of blind peoples.Scenes filmed with hand-held cameras work well, and give the feeling you're inside the story, standing next to the characters and being almost a part of it. The songs are great, especially the main song "I've seen it all". The cast is good, no weak links at all. You don't wonder why Bjork has been nominated in every possible movie gala after you've seen the movie.One of those movies that stays in your mind for a long while.

		<fullReview>I shall begin by saying that I am a fan of Bjork, and I must be just about the only person who's opinion is split 50/50 about this film. Bjork's performance was great, and Selma was one of the cutest, most lovable characters ever made. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see her become a victim of her illness, her determination, and her hard work. However, the moment that she started to become exploited by others, it turned horrid. Bill's actions were so extreme that it was laughable, as they tried to make the absolute worst possible scenario. As her situation escalated, it just seemed more and more unrealistic, and I couldn't help but see her character turning into Edward Scissorhands (refusing to break her promise, despite how bad a situations she was in). Now don't get me wrong - I did think it was sad, but only when her downfall was because of HER weaknesses (such as the loss of her job) and not the weaknesses of others (Bill), and I quickly lost all emotional attachment when things turned really bad.Another problem that began there was the music. I absolutely love Bjork, and I've been singing (and longing to dance to) her first two songs from this movie for days. Her first song, CVALDA, appropriately fit in as we saw how she escaped the monotony and stress of the massive workload that she undertook, as well as being a damn fine song. Similarly, the train song, I'VE SEEN IT ALL, showed her longing to escape from her responsibility, and be swept into a romantic life which she can only dream about. I found that every song after these, however, didn't fit in, as she began to LIVE her life as a musical, instead of WISH for her life to BECOME a musical. I didn't see any reason for her to break out into song in the courtroom, or after her encounter with Bill. Maybe she was trying to console herself that everything was OK (after all, nothing terrible ever happens in musicals), but it still seemed inappropriate and the songs came on a bit too thick and fast.So what am I trying to say? The first half of this movie was absolutely amazing, but you can draw a line where it turns bad as she comes home to discover an empty lolly tin. But the songs were great, and the cinematography even better. If only it wasn't for the stupidity and unoriginality of the plot in the second half......</fullReview>

The main reason for this, is the acting performed by Bjork, and I must say that if the Academy doesn´t notice her unique performance, I will be very disappointed.The story itself is simple, but how von Trier so bravery tells this story in a way I have never seen before, is simple unforgettable. It was hard to stand up from my seat after the movie had ended, because of the shock you were in, (Seven doesn´t come close to this one). I don´t recommend this movie to every one, and if you would pick Armageddon or Scream 3 rather than for exampleBeing John Malcovich I would guess that this movie is not for you. But if you like to see movies filmed the way no one has had the guts to do before, go see the dancer.Dancer in the dark is the movie of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bjork's performance in this film marks her greatest accomplishment as an artist in her career. Although I was very moved by Lars von Trier's interpretation of the American judicial system, I feel like the only way I could recommend this film is if I included a warning. von Trier's swish panning of the camera made the movie almost impossible for me to watch. I found myself closing my eyes through most of the movie. Now, I can interpret this technique in two ways: 1. It was symbolic of Selma's vision, or 2. von Trier wanted to make you sick at the thought of the death penalty, literately. This is a film I left wanting to tell all of my friends and relatives to make sure they see, but because of the nauseating effects I feel they won't see it.I wish that Von Trier had made his film more accessible to the masses because it is a message that should not be "unseen."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to confess that I only went to this film as I was dragged by a friend. The first 45 minutes or so of the film I found to be quite slow and boring and at one time i even thought of leaving! Am I glad I stayed! Once Bjork loses her job the film begins to pick up dramatically and it really does grab your attenton. (I realised then that the slow start was necessary as it helped to buld the plot and the atmosphere.) The story from this point is fascinatingly played out in a unique style by the director and the tension builds up so much that near the end it was almost unbearable! I had to remind mysef that it was only a film! The films gritty realism is juxtaposed by moments of fantastic and beautiful cinematography during the song-and-dance sequences. I am not a big fan of Bjork but here her singing was fantastic. I also think that the songs were a necessary antidote to the powerful dramatic scenes of the movie which would otherwise be unbearable, such was their pathos and power to move. The acting by all was excellent (though Catherine Deneuve seemed too glamorous to be a factory worker!) and Bjork was a revelation! I dont know if this film can be nominated for Oscars as it is not a US movie but if it could she would walk away with the Best Actress prize. Simply awesome performance. which clutches at the strings of your heart as well. Without giving the ending away I would also say that this film is one of the best arguments i've seen against the death penalty (even though I believe in capital punishment.) My mind and emotions have not been jolted like this for a long time. I left the cinema emotionally drained. Brilliant film-making. Almost perfect. I don't think Hollywood can EVER make a film like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was apprehensive about seeing Dancer in the Dark, what withthe mixed reviews and claims that Lars Von Trier was again justpulling the wool over the audience's eyes by undermining thefilm's sincerity with the musical interludes. But after seeingthe movie, I have to believe that Von Trier was absolutelygenuine in making the film. This is due to Bjork's ultrarealistic emotional performance. There were the famousreports of problems on the set of Dancer in the Dark becauseBjork's method acting left her believing that she was living hercharacter's situation in real life. This comes through in everybit of the film. Bjork's performance is completely excruciatingand perfect to the smallest detail. It is she that moves theaudience to tears.

		<shortDescription>A very hard movie that should be also a musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third movie that I see of the work of Lars von Trier. I must say that I am bit disappointed. The movie was not able to reach me as "Breaking the waves" did. The musical scenes blocked any emotional interaction with the movie in my case. They seamed to me as though they have been made to show Björks musical capabilities (although I know that it was not the intention to do so). Presumably these scenes were made in order to show a happy contrast to the very sad main story which is emotionally very violent. Björk as well as many other actors played their roles very well. Only I felt that Catherine Deneuve was not really suitable in this role. Anyhow one should be prepared to leave the cinema in a very very low mood after watching this movie(this happened to my girlfriend). The music could be interesting for the people who like the music of Björk. Unfortunately I did not like it. The photography should be also mentioned. Even though the movie was meant to be made as simple as possible I do not agree with the unstable and the unsharp photography. It doesn't make feel that the movie is more realistic or more true. It gives me only a slight dizziness. Anyway I recommend watching this movie to the ones who like to see cultural or artistic movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, after having an extended lecture of all the comments done on this movie, I have to say that there is an obvious repetition in them: the dichotomy "just overwhelming" vs. "just unbelievable (exaggerated)". I belong to the strong admirers of "Dancer in the dark", and my opinion is that, beyond the content-related topics (for me, the clue is not the "saint's story" but the narration of a woman that doesn't have ANY CHANCE TO EXPRESS HERSELF during her entire life - 'cause all the music we hear is not real, but only a dream - a dance in the darkness...!) the astonishing thing is the 'formal' achievement: Von Trier is able to create through a very artistic medium (a "musical"!!) something that is almost undistinguishable from real life, that destroys the so-well erected wall between art and living. The reactions to the movie, therefore, show the attitudes one could have to A PIECE OF LIFE: to accept it, to deny it, to complain it, or just not to believe it - we don't have the harmless calm to "judge" about it distantly like we use to do about most movies. THAT's the incredible step that did von Trier. It has something cruel, of course. Anyway, it shows that even in the age of "post-post-humanism", humanism doesn't surrender.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie spoke to my soul as no other. Being a musical theatre actor I know the feelings that can come from seeking peace and beauty in the fantastic. This was a film of a simple woman that had two loves in her life, her son and music. The musical sequences criticized by many because they were "stupid" come from people that were not willing to enter the world of this simple person. The musical numbers were a unique way that a director showed an audience the "absolute core" of a character. Seeing her simplicity slapped up against her horrid situation is what created the intensity of the film. I believe this has never been done so brilliantly in a film . . . ever. This is my opinion, as simple as it is, is as easy as it will be for you to dismiss it and the film. I have never felt so deeply for a character in a film.

		<fullReview>For the first time in my 26 years, I walked out on a movie. And it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen (that dubious honor is still firmly held by Natural Born Killers, a film I would've walked out on if only I had driven). However Dancer in the Dark was literally making me ill. I suppose that I wasn't prepared for it, the way I had been prepared for Breaking the Waves, a movie I admired but had strong philosophical objections to its notions of faith, spirituality, and sacrifice. Now I'm the first person to respect trying to make a movie for a certain budget. But the next time Von Trier embarks on a film, I personally will buy him a tripod. They're not that expensive and they can do so much for little things like camera stability and focus, which in turn keeps your audience from, say, losing their lunch of recently ingested Vietnamese food. With Breaking the Waves, Robby Mueller's brilliant handheld work could be justified as organic to the central themes of the film. In Dancer in the Dark it just made me dizzy. And the other thing that I had not been prepared for is that it was shot on digital video, which truly looks like crap. In fact I would go so far as to say that all of the production values (scratchy sound included) were making me physically ill to the point that I hadto look at the ground and try to keep my bearings.The substance of the film seemed compelling enough to me: that apoor woman going blind works in a factory to earn money so thather son can have an operation to save him from a similar fate. To escape from this miserable situation she escapes in Hollywood movie musical fantasies. It is a truly moving presence that has possibilities. However, when the film felt that its subject matter was not enough and started adding ridiculous melodramatic situations that involve murder, I had to leave. I knew where Von Trier was going and had no interest in seeing the martyrdom of another poor suffering sainted woman. And the musical number s (the only reason I stuck around) did not work at all for me within the context of the film. It would be like if they broke into a musical number about incest, rape and sodomy in the middle of "The Celebration." Her musical visions are every bit as ugly and gloomy as her real life, which doesn't really serve as an because all of the numbers themselves were so damn depressing. The one good thing about the songs is that the camera stands still for the couple minutes each song lasts. Von Trier seems to truly enjoy exploring unnecessary pain for the sake of exploring pain. If that sort of thing is your bag then knock yourself out. I love seeing films that explore the darker side of the human character and do not end in a way that are morally satisfying. I do not however have any interest in seeing a person tortured for masochism sake. So I left. Sue me. I cannot say that I hated the movie, it just wasn't working for me on any level and nearly incited regurgitation. I will concede that it might be to some</fullReview>

And that was the first time I saw so many people crying after the movie..they were living on the screen with that small, fantastic, unbelievably talented Icelandic woman..She made all of us think again of the ones we love and would die for. The combination of two talents: Bjork and von Trier, was the moving force of this drama. The closest von Trier's movie is Breaking the Waves. But it lacked that intense feeling that Dancer in the Dark gives to audience. Presence of Bjork in the leading role makes this movie "you either fall in love with it or hate it". I fell in love, and I will wait for new visual experiences of Lars von Trier and I will wait for new music and new roles from Bjork. It would be a big loss for all of us if Bjork keeps her promise not to act any more..</fullReview>

I feel, however, that this is Lars von Trier's best film to date. His style has always been distracting to me, but in this film it makes sense. He is using his handheld, digital camera work to provide a stark contrast between Selma's real life and her fantasies, which take the form of big musical numbers that look as good as any in the old Hollywood musicals. The performances here are great. David Morse, Peter Stomare and Catherine Deneuve all supply wonderful support, but it's Bjork who stands out. Her powerful performance deserves Oscar attention. It's one of the best films of the year. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when I thought my movie tastes were being dulled by boring, repetitive American sitcom fare, along comes a film that packs a true emotional wallop [Winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes 2000, with Best Actress for Björk]. This film is set in an American small town but is not American in feel, and is given a plain realistic aspect by von Trier's self-consciously simple techniques of hand-held cameras and long takes. Björk is perfect as the soft-spoken Selma, a mousy little funny-faced immigrant woman who is going blind, working her heart out in a crummy factory and tiring her eyes by filling cardboard holders full of bobby-pins for extra cash, so her son has a chance to see. She is a poignant figure who never asks for much in life, and never gets it. When asked why she had a baby if she knew it risked going blind like her, she painfully says she just wanted something little she could hold. The fact that this sweet figure gets taken advantage of and faces incredible cruelty was such a stark contrast that the middle and ending of the film were truly revolting to me.The musical numbers revived the deliberately silly traditions of the musical, but the escapism they promise to a suddenly sunnier Selma, and to the viewers, is shattered by the other gruesome scenes. Some films offer escapism to the viewer, other films are meant to shock, but this film does both. However, Björk's accent is of course more reminiscent of a Scandinavian who has lived among some Cockneys for a while than of a Czech person, and Catherine Deneuve appears to have little to do, sleepwalking through her role, showing some heart only in the final, disgusting climax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting, Bold, Generous, Honest Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly the premise of this film kept me away up till now. Not much of a Bjork fan, I'm even less enamoured of musicals and abhor films that rely on physical infirmity to elicit audience sympathy. Regardless, I'm very glad I finally went to see it and heartily recommend that any other serious film-goer with similar reservations put them aside and do so as well.  Lars von Trier is the only major contemporary director I know of whose work hasn't turned to piddle with success--the only one--which is quite heartening, in that from the decay in integrity of every other working major director, I've become thoroughly convinced film-making is inherently corrupting, an innately compromised medium of big lies that only get bigger with big money. (Most prominent publishing critics have commented on the decline of current film.)  Which is not to the say that "Dancer in the Dark" is a complete success, or a success at all. It isn't. The film is a flawed continuation, elaboration, of "Breaking the Waves": the premises and heroines are nearly identical.  The heroine here sacrifices all for maternal love, whereas that of the latter film does the same for romantic love. Both are purists, absolutists, seeing the world strictly in all-or-nothing terms; both are simple, impossibly good souls, cut, say, of the same cloth as the Prince of Dostoevsky's "Idiot," or put in the reduced terms of pop culture, the simpleton of Peter Seller's "Being There." Von Trier is expert in pitting such unalloyed innocence against the equally drastic evil of the world of The Fall. The schema, the coordinates, are entirely Christian. His expertise lies in creating a genuine sense of peril: everything is at stake.  But where "Breaking the Waves" pulled me along over the edge in its wild exuberance-- like going over Niagara in a barrel--"Dancer in the Dark," however close it may have come, left me warm and dry, safe on shore. I watched it from a comfortable distance. Why? Because ... It's too long and uneconomic; it statically dwells and obsesses, rather sweeping one right along like "Breaking the Waves." It's stylizations, no matter how good, too often divert from the dramatic movement, are less essential than superfluous and self-indulgent. The plot becomes commonplace with the murder, forfeits originality by relying on this convention, on that old war-horse, crime-and-punishment--this removes the conflict from within the character and places it in external circumstances, thus overriding character development with plot (not another trial; TV's full of them!!). Everyone knew that the money was going to be stolen and by whom. Also, Von Trier's America is not quite American enough; it retains a queer touch of the European.  Above all, the central metaphor is a quack: the conflict between the inner dream of love vs. cruel outer world is less than convincing because the former is given form and expression in the make-believe show-biz glitz of musical film extravaganzas. Selma's love of life, her hearing its pulse and sensing its joy despite not being able to physically see it, is linked to the tacky manufactured unreality of Buzby Berkeley and Esther Williams. The metaphor just doesn't work, doesn't elevate, doesn't transcend--the film refers to film rather than to life. (No matter what, I'll forever resist what to me is the hystericism and fakery of musicals; I can never be a Judy Garland fan.) The music here doesn't approach Bach's "Passion According to St Matthew," or Rachmaninov's "Vespers," which is what it would have to be for the metaphor to work. "Breaking the Waves" relied on no such elaborate metaphor or theatricality; just the opposite, it was completely itself, unadorned, able to brutally suck the viewer into its here-and-now.  Despite these flaws, "Dancer" never fails to delight, surprise, or engross; it's never stupid, manipulative, exploitive, or pandering, which is quite something these days. The story is told in telling details. Von Trier has evolved his mastery of image to a higher plane: the jitters of the hand-held camera uncannily resonate in precise sync with the ineffable jitters of the on-screen drama; the camera sweeps and jerks in a kind of kinetic dance; close-ups magnify just the right detail; the technique of transfering video to film and/or digital manipulation, with its edge enhancement, its enlivening of light, lends images a perfect, stripped-down immediacy and truthfulness, creates the magic of being there.  Bjork is perfectly cast. She radiates an impish joy; her face is as readable as an open book. By contrast, Juliette Binoche, who also plays a young woman losing her sight in Leos Carax's Les "Amants Du Pont-Neuf," is positively wooden. (Contrast, too, that film's pretentious, chilly manipulation of image for the sake of image.) Catherine Deneuve, however, seems out of place among such blue-collar surroundings; she never sheds her patrician air. In sum, "Dancer" qualifies as an interesting failure, genuine in intent and worthy of respect for bold experimentation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wake up and see it, America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dancer in the Dark" is one of the most difficult, depressing films I have seen. IMDB users know the main plot line, so I won't repeat it. This is a worthy film that makes important points. Some reviewers have criticized the plot as soap-opera-ish and unrealistic. I didn't find it hard to fathom. Events like these happen to people all the time.What many reviewers have not discussed much is how 'Selma', played by Bjork, has so many obstacles in her life. Selma didn't ask for these, but has to deal with them nonetheless. She is handicapped, is in a male-dominated culture, and is an immigrant from a Communist (1964 Czech.) country. Selma is poor, a daydreamer, maddeningly principled just when she should not be, and has a dependent - a son. Yet I didn't find her situation removed from reality. The working poor of the world have a very tough life. Gary Oldman's "Nil By Mouth" is a valid comparison for lifestyles.In this film, we see how the American system treats a poor, defenseless woman - horribly, mercilessly, unthinkingly. Among its other messages, it spoke to me as an indictment of capitalism and American culture. It illuminates in a cold light some deadly characteristics of American society: the crushing poverty many live in, the narrow-mindedness of many people, the lack of concern of companies for their workers, the government's neglect of the handicapped, an ignorance and distrust of foreigners, sexism, materialism, religious fundamentalism, and a morbid obsession with violence. One could continue for a long time. Director von Trier shows how these societal flaws twist and wreck ordinary people.I liked the musical numbers, as they provided a welcome contrast to the relentlessly gloomy reality of Selma's situation. When Selma bursts out in song and people around her dance as well, we see the joy in her heart - which cannot be realized in real life. The dance sequences are also expertly choreographed, and I found them infinitely more expressive of the human condition that 'Matrix'-style martial arts tricks.von Trier's style and subject matter remind me of Stanley Kubrick's. Both directors have a completely personal style which stirs great passions and divisions among viewers. They are experimental, meticulous and intense to a fault. Both are concerned with human cruelty and dehumanization. Both directors also reportedly inspire great loyalty among their actors.I think this is a relevant film for America, and the world, today. We still have essentially all the same problems that I enumerated above in America in 2000 that we did in 1964, when this story takes place. I hope audiences can get past the abrasiveness of the hand-held camera technique. True compassion and bravery is needed to see this film, but we need that in life, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie a week ago, and I'm still upset. I'm trying to work with my computer, and all the time in front of my eyes appears this extraordinary, amazing girl from Iceland, dancing, crying, or singing that "she has seen it all, there's no more to see". Let me clear that I'm not a fan of Bjork. In fact, this was the first time I heard songs of her. But, I cannot see how some other actress can surpass this breathtaking acting, and win the Academy Award for herself. This film was also the first film of Lars Von Trier I saw. I've heard that all of his films are touching, some times even painful. Again, I can't imagine how a film can be more painful that this one. This is the tragic story of Selma, a Czech emigrant who is gradually getting blind, and works day and night in the factory trying to collect the money for an operation to his son, which has the same problem with her, before she completely loose her vision. Is it sounds a little bit melodramatic? It could be, but it is not because of Bjork. As the time passes, Bjork and Selma become one thing, there is no Bjork anymore on the screen, only an almost blind girl named Selma, and what you finally see is so real, and so painful... Lars Von Trier has no mercy against his audience; he pushes the knife through the bone.Except Bjork's acting, another good reason to see the film is the scene with the train and the beautiful duet of Selma and Jeff. As a final word, I would like to say that this was one of the best films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

First of all I was looking forward to finally seeing musical, since there are so few these days but on the other hand I was afraid that I would be annoyed by Björk's sqeecking voice and manners, especially after hearing all stories about the trouble she made on the set.But after 5 minutes I was already taken away by this gorgeous movie. This is one of the few movies that takes you high up in the clouds and drops you like a rock.The characters are amazing and so is the acting and I was amazed by Björk's performance. The songs are not annoying and in fact are very functional. Von Trier took the time to introduce the characters and tell their stories. The cinematography is shocking but very effective and realistic."Dancer in the Dark" is a story about a woman and her fate. About how far someone can go in order to keep her promises. Selma is one of the most sympathetic roles I have ever seen. She is the embodyment of goodness. The songs were amazing especially the last one...I have seen this movie yesterday but I am still in shock about it. The last time I had that was with Anderson's "Magnolia".</fullReview>

Everybody was nailed down to the seat.If you are a sensitive person it is impossible not to be shocked by this movie. I think it has to do with the mixture of sad events and musical dreams in the goodness of Selma's (the main character) mind. Maybe if the musical pieces did not exist, this film will not have been so moving. What makes you feel so is the innocence in Selma's dreams, besides the songs are so beautiful and Björk, although her character is not attractive, she is splendid.There is a statement in the film against the stupid society in which we live and about the little possibility we have to escape from it: music, innocent imagination.This film simply goes straight to the heart and fills it with what reality is and what it could be (in Selma's mind).You will never be the same after watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Peachment once called Melville's 'Leon Morin, Pretre' 'miraculous cinema'. 'Dancer in the Dark' is truly miraculous, the melodrama as sacred drama. Popular opinion has Von Trier down as a flashy, post-modern japester, when all along he was moving toward THIS. He is no less than a 21st century Dreyer, and this is his 'Passion of Joan of Arc'. Bjork's performance is as miraculous as Falconetti's, wilting under Von Trier's suitably sadistic Dreyeresque close-ups, somehow achieving an impossible synthesis of corporeal suffering and beatific spirit. The film's narrative trajectory is a classic religious ordeal, as Bjork goes from a social context, with work, family, friends, leisure, and one by one, as she prepares for her death, loses them, until she is solitary in her cell (both senses), hearing spiritual voices through the ventilator, the toilet, the walls, everywhere. Her 'saviour' lawyer is called Luke; her last non-diegetic musical moment is full of pictures of the Sacred Heart. When she is killed suddenly, shockingly, horribly, the film's drama ends, but not the film, as Von Trier's camera swoops upward, following Bjork's soul into a darkness we cannot comprehend, the darkness with which the film so painfully started.This spirituality, throughout the film, makes itself felt most obviously in the musical sequences. Some of the critically myopic have seen these as little more than schoolboy jokes, sneering and contemptuous, evincing little love or knowledge of the Hollywwod musical (it's funny how critics, week in, week out, bemoan the generic and formulaic, and yet cry foul when anyone tries to smash the rules). Nothing could be further from the truth. The sequences perform the same function as they would in a Hollywood musical, visualising the emotional reality of characters normally inarticulate in society - reality seen through the eyes of the marginal, confused, unhappy, blind; heightened, through colour, expressions of desire, fear, the repressed. And they perform them admirably - two sequences are particularly moving in their use of colour, editing, composition and camerawork, the train sequence, and the waltz after the murder. Far from being leaden-footed, these sequences beautifully reveal a struggling, jerky, disintegrating mindset, someone who wants order and happiness, and yet is denied it by being a foreigner in a frighteningly unstable country, by going blind, and full of uncertainty and terror for her child's future, not to mention the pressure put on her by her neighbour Bill, her desire to play Maria. A mindset like this is not going to be accurately visualised by elegant, coherent choreography; it demands alienation, incongruity, clashing, stumbling. But these numbers fulfil a greater function than simply expressionism. They embody the spirituality inherent in Selma. In all of them, Von Trier's style changes from a tight, mid/close-up, imprisoning of Selma, rooted by circumstances, personal blocks, destiny, to a much freer, looser shooting style, full of distortions of reality, spacious god's eye view shots. Those two numbers I mentioned particularly convey ideas central to the New Testament: in one, the increasingly blind Selma talks about all she can see; in the second, she raises a dead man to life. This last mentioned is full of a haunting, Lynchian beauty.I'm not saying there isn't anything suspect about Von Trier's ideas here: women, saints or not, are always better off dead. Von Trier's spirituality many seem curiously out of date in our materially saturated world, which is perhaps why we need it. In any case, you don't have to be a Catholic to be moved by Bresson, or a racist to appreciate Griffith. Ideas in cinema are irrelevant - it is, as Chabrol said, how they measure up to cinematic size. Von Trier's film is a manipulative melodrama, piling on the horror and misery in an attempt to force some sort of reaction, making Selma increasingly saintly - her tormenters intolerably callous. EAch ghastly plot twist is more horrendous than the last, and each scene is dragged out interminably. We could take Selma's advice and leave after the penultimate song, but, as she is still in prison chased by guards, refusing to let her comfort prisoners, this isn't terribly reassuring. We might ask who gave Von Trier the right, or accuse him of betraying economic realities for half-baked theology. The simple fact is my very body was seized by this film, it made me feel things I didn't know were in me, so that I was gasping, sweating, dazed, in tears by the end, and anything that can do that is precious. It might all be one big joke, but I'm getting tired of winking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderfully Odd Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I was pondering whether to see Billy Elliot or Dancer in the Dark. Since I got to the theater late my decision was made for me. I'd read reviews about Dancer in the Dark saying that it was about a Czechoslovakian immigrant who moved to America because she thought it was like in the movies and to save up for an eye operation for her son. However, after watching it I came to my own conclusion that she was a dreamer who lived for musicals and for her son. Her fascination for musicals turned the film into a wonderfully odd creation that made you wonder why she was how she was.It starts out very slow. In fact I'd suggest arriving 5 minutes into the movie because the first 5 minutes is a changing abstract painting set to opera music, very boring. Then once it begins there is an awful lot of talking and annoyingly shaky camera work. Surprisingly though, there are at least three recognizable stars in addition to Bjork (the lead). As the story develops we learn that she has a hereditary disorder that causes her to go blind. She has a son who also has this disorder. She is determined more than anything to save up the money to get him an operation by working in a factory and doing night jobs. All the while her own blindness is taking her over. There's a lot of singing and dancing which doesn't seem to mesh with the seriousness of the themes but lends a hand to showing the way her mind works, which ends up playing a critical part in the eventual outcome.Aside from the incredibly slow start and shaky cameras, this was a good movie. The directing and cinematography were questionable but the writing and most of the acting was top-notch. If you like "film" movies and are able to remain seated for 2 hours and 20 minutes then you should definitely like Dancer in the Dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bjork and von Trier present a transcendent vision, a triumph of spirit over suffering.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark, the new Lars von Trier Palm D'or winner from this year's Cannes Film Festival, is clearly one of the year's best films, and current sits number #1 on my personal list.It's a given that the plot is totally implausible. But as metaphor, it reaches well beyond the mechanics of its Dogma95 conceits into something transcendent and luminescent though the gifted portrayal of the Icelandic pop singer Bjork and a solid supporting cast. The film certainly follows in the footsteps of its immediate predecessor, Breaking the Waves, (with Emily Watson's memorable work), but instead seems to reach back in time to the very beginnings of the cinema. If there's a clear referrnt, it would be Rene Falconetti's harrowing performance in The Passion of Joan of Arc. Interestingly, both Falconetti and Bjork resolved never again to do another film, and given the enervating intensity of both performances, it is not hard to fathom the reason. And too, both characters participate in a type of tragic heroism that stands them in bold relief against the coarseness and indifference of times that could not sustain them.Selma works in a factory in Washington State (actually filmed in Sweden), where she finds a variety of ruses to hide her growing loss of sight. Her friend Cathy (played by none other than Catherine Deneuve) supports Selma in both work and music. Jeff (Peter Stormare, from the wood chips of Fargo), loves Selma from a distance, but cannot completely connect because Selma announces that she doesn't want a boyfriend.In addition to her mission of saving her meager earnings to save her son, who is losing his vision from the same hereditary affliction, she is also attempting to fulfil another dream, which is to star as Maria Van Trapp in a local production of The Sound of Music. When stressed, Selma reveries to Busby Berkeley and like musicals, as the film stops just like those old films to have the entire cast burst into a production number (complete at one point with a wonderful tap-on from Joel Grey). Selma hears rhythm in the clickity-clack of the machines, ecstasy in the noise, and plunges inward into the warming embrace of song, dance, and music.And how does this musical device work so effectively? Bjork's portrayal of Selma's mythic loss of self in song and dance is emblematic of humanity's grasping some form of spiritual meaning to survive, whether through religion, work, family, or some intangible reality that lifts them from existential despair and hopelessness. For Selma, these vehicles of redemption involve: 1) an unceasing belief in the goodness of people and the loyalty of her friends; 2) the love for her son and; 3) and the power of the musical to heal. As the plot unfolds, as her would-be friend betrays her first belief, she still maintains her bond with her son as the music continues to guide and sustain her. If we understand this relationship with The Sound of Music as one of faith and a basis for a transcendent meaning that undergirds her spirit during her Hellish descent, then Selma ceases to seem so alien, and becomes a powerful source of identification for the audience.At the same time, I found myself appreciating at a more profound level how important the 30s musicals were for its audience, at a time when fortunes vanished, people starved, and 25% unemployment decimated the fabric of American life. And one of the places where Americans could forget their fear and their suffering was by fading into the Hollywood reverie of Busby Berkeley, Dick Powell, Fred Astaire, and Ruby Keeler (shown in the film) "doing a tap by ear."And Bjork portrays this woman with a wrenching guilelessness that had me believing, as she held tight to her own dream visions. In watching this brilliant work, I was reminded of an old tee shirt that I had bought in Vermont many years ago. I still have it. It is riveted with holes, is largely unwearable, but one can still make out the black outlines of the renaissance figures of young lovers gently depicted against the bright red color (now faded) of the shirt, with the caption reading, "Dreams are merely pictures of a more endurable reality."And Selma provides that enduring dream with such power that we can't help but be moved with a power that shatters the current cinema's penchant for irony. This one aims for the seats, and succeeds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking the Waves as a musical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I too had high hopes for this movie after hearing nothing but good things about it, and in all honesty I will say that it was a good movie. But it was better several years ago when it was called "BREAKING THE WAVES".Lars von Trier seems to recycle the same ideas from his last movie and play them again here. I just couldn't stand all the effort that was gone into martyring Selma.The acting was exceptional, especially Bjork and Catherine Devenue, and the musical scenes were very enjoyable and there very presence was original and exciting, but I really couldn't wait for this movie to end. The camera work didn't bother me at all, but after seeing Selma go through so much c**p and not really do anything about it, I only began to roll my eyes and wait until it passed.SPOILER: Bjork is wonderful, but the character, Selma, was just another version of Bess from Breaking the Waves, who meets the same fate as Selma with the same results: all in the name of love.I seem to be the only person I know who didn't think this movie was fabulous, so maybe it was because I saw "Breaking the Waves", so I would still recommend it, but still say that save the music videos, "Waves" is much better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dancer In The Dark is the latest incarnation of the Hollywood weepy a la Douglas Sirk.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danish film-maker Lars Von Trier's Dancer In The Dark is the latest incarnation of the Hollywood weepy a la Douglas Sirk, the deceased Danish-born American film director.Douglas Sirk, described in A Personal Journey With Martin Scorcese Through American Movies as a smuggler and iconoclast, subverted cliche-ridden seven-hanky melodramas such as Magnificent Obsession (1954), All That Heaven Allows (1955) and Imitation Of Life (1959) to critique the materialism and hollowness of middle-class American life.Dancer In The Dark is a heart-wrenching melodrama of Sirkian proportion and Lars Von Trier handles feelings with an honesty that is always direct and always startling.Dancer In The Dark is a film about two desperate people doing what they have to do to solve their problems. Selma's innocence and single-mindedness become a higher form of wisdom against which the rest of us measure ourselves and fall miserably short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's nothing else like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen a film like 'Dancer in the Dark', and I can't imagine another one like it. It's a strange and powerful film, that makes little sense if analysed too closely. And I think that's the mistake that other commentators have made - this is not a film that should be analysed. It's not supposed to be a real story, the songs are not supposed to make sense or be clever, and the quality of the cinematography is undeniably deliberate throughout - personal taste has nothing to do with judging this film. If you understand Pirsig's notion of 'quality', you will understand that this film has quality like no other, at least that I've seen. I generally think that big-budget Hollywood films have more to say about people's lives than your typical European art film, but this film is an exception. Don't ever see it on a TV; like most really good films, a TV screen will kill the impact. My friends who have seen it divide into those who thought it was profound, and those who thought it was stupid and that the camerawork made them sick; there was no-one in between. It's the best film I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember " Breaking the Waves ", a wonderful film, but by mainly "regular". That is to say, a film without bumps in which the attention of the spectator and the enchantment stayed until the end. It has not happened the same with "Dancer in the Dark". The film seemed perfect until last the 30 minutes, in which it seems to have escaped of Von Trier's hands. The spectators who had been astonished by one hour and average, ended up requesting, again and again that the torture finished, because to the unnecessary director's protest against the pain of death and the administration of justice. It is incredible. Zelda's character (Björk) passed, in a second, of the love to the hatred. Of being loved to being unbearable. Six points, no more.</fullReview>

Coming into the movie as a fan of Bjork's music, I was not prepared for how much this film would affect me. The film makes no apologies for its low-budget methods of filming - except during the musical numbers, which are departures from reality that are well-placed and do support the movie. The songs in the film are longer than what you will find on Bjork's "Selmasongs" CD, the highlight being the song "In the Musicals", a bittersweet number. Be prepared to be speechless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, emotional and innovative cinema at its best !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest and most important films of the last ten years. Post-Musical-Tragedy with bible-like (old testament of course) power and truthness of human existence, but without giving the people their daily religion-opium pretending there could be a good god. Sometimes there is no way out and no right solution, and that's why Selma (Björk) is such an overwhelming character, like in an antique greek tragedy. Beside this abstract level and the absolut convincing consequences, there is a lot of great music, photography, playing and editing. The balance between Selmas day-dreaming in the world of musicals (there is no real harm!)and the hard reality is made with perfect sensibility and when the noise of the machines or the horrible quietness of the prison slowly comes to music in Selmas mind, everybody can see and feel what a great director Lars von Trier is. Some people says why Selma did not tell the judge how it was, she would not have been sentenced to death. These are naive questions, it is like demanding Jeanne d'Arc to say that there are no voices and no duty to do.If someone wants to know where Lars von Trier comes from see "The passion of Jeanne d'Arc" of C.D. Dreyer. "Dancer in the dark" is innovative cinema at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly stunning film. But it's flawed, and could've been perfect with some easy fixes. The wild camerawork in the "reality" mode was distractingand disturbing in the wrong sort of way when seen on the big screen -- muchlike Blair Witch was. And I couldn't work out why it took so long to get to the first "fantasy" scene. Bjork is wonderful, lovely, I adore her, but as a critic, I didn't find her acting in the early parts of the film to be as believable as it needed to be in order to be perfect (sorry, dearest!). The supporting castwere excellent though. At the end of the day, this was still shockingly,stunningly powerful. It's up there with Green Mile, Private Ryan, Shawshank,etc., but where they are polished Hollywood, this is independent quirky. It's your preference. Great piece of work guys. I still love you, Bjork. :-) But note to non-existing fans: remember she is completely bonkers. And this film isvery much a Bjork film! General warning: this is a *very* gut-wrenching film. Do not take your first date on it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good musical numbers, but terribly unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>warning-warning-warningSPOILERS FOLLOWwarning-warning-warningI appreciate what Bjork and Lars Von Trier were attempting to do with the way they incorporated the musical numbers in this movie, but there were too many detractors:1. I personally am tired of the current shakey-camera fad. It reminds of TV commercials trying to scare you into buying life insurance.2. There were too many cheap emotional shots. It's pretty easy to make your audience feel like c**p by having horrible things happen to a pretty, weepy, altruistic, misunderstood female.3. It was unbelievable in many key places. Do you really expect me to believe that a rather large man needed a gun to take that bundle of cash from a tiny, blind girl? What woman would believe that her son would be more traumatized by knowing that he might go blind someday than he would be by having his mother executed for murder? And why didn't her lawyer (who was willing to take her case for the exact sum that she had saved) refer her to a public defender when she refused to pay? In this country you cannot sign away your rights even if you want to, and there is no way they would refuse a retrial based on new evidence just because the defendant refused to pay. I could go on, but I'm beginning to feel sick, so I'll stop now.Take my advice: Just download the music videos and skip the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally draining experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** As a fan of Björk's music I went mainly because of her. Despite her best actress award at Cannes I still did not have high expectations for her acting. I thought her quirky style would define her performance and detract from story. Boy was I wrong! Björk really did become Selma as I had read prior to seeing 'Dancer in the Dark' and drew me into her world, shattering all of my misconceptions.What impressed me most about this film was Von Trier's ability to do something which I am yet to experience with any other film. Unlike other examples in cinema of martyrdom such as Samson crushing the Philistines and killing himself in 'Samson and Delilah' , and even Gene Hackman's character in the 'Poseidon Adventure' dying whilst attempting to save the others, the audience feels a great loss in the death of the character, rather than solace in the fact that 'they did what they had to do'. 'Dancer in the Dark' differs dramatically in that Selma's goal becomes the top priority to the audience as well as Selma. You want what Selma wants. By weaving the importance of restoring Gene's sight throughout the film and being careful to show Selma's determination to see this through, the audience too feels that this goal needs to be accomplished at any cost. So while the cost is very high, there is a great sense of relief that the goal is accomplished.The camera work could be likened to a documentary which only enhances the realism and hence the attack on ones emotions. The film had a presence which left me sobbing well outside of theater, not for recalling gut wrenching scenes, but just from a feeling of overwhelming sadness about nothing in particular.While this is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen, it may be a while before I can see it again. I had a headache from the intensity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dang, I haven't heard that many people crying at a movie since Scrooged! So, the basic description of Dancer in the Dark is:1. It's a musical 2. It's sadThe story follows Selma, a Czech immigrant to the US, as she tries to earn money for an operation to save her son's eyesight. It's set somewhat timelessly in a mid-20th century semi-rural landscape, featuring characters with the associated simpleness and slowness. The story itself sometimes slows down, but is always saved by a lively musical interlude.I might also add:3. It's filmed in digital shake-o-vision like Blair Witch ProjectThe downside is the obvious risk of motion sickness. But the upside is that each scene has dozens of shot angles, arranged in sort of a techno timing that matches the beat of the interspersed musical numbers. Ironically, the only time the camera holds rock steady is during those musical portions.Overall, Dancer in the Dark is enjoyable and moving as long as you watch with an open mind and endure through some uncomfortable scenes that would make any viewer squirm in his seat. I give it 4 out of 5 benzene rings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although very different from the Hollywood glamour of other movies, Dancer in the Dark still shines as one of the best films I have ever seen. The story was wonderful, the actors were giving their performance their all, and the cinematography was quite unique. Everyone who has seen this movie would agree that it is like nothing else one has ever seen.Lars Von Trier knew what he was doing when he cast Bjork as Selma, the main player. Her raw emotion and powerful features convey so much more than just her dialogue. She felt everything that was happening and got so into the part, allowing the audience to do the same. Sure, she's no Gwyneth, but what Bjork possesses is truly wonderful- I can't wait to see if she will pursue her acting career further.I also enjoyed the way this movie was put together. In the first half-hour, the shaky camera shots and eerie lighting made the viewer feel carefree and happy for Selma and her triumphs in the theater and her savings. However-when the movie took a turn for the worst, the camera stayed in stern focus and the lighting became dull. One could actually feel how each character felt by the way the backdrop looked, and that was something I found quite neat.In conclusion, if you enjoy movies that are offbeat and different from the mold, I would suggest seeing Dancer in the Dark. It will make you laugh, it will make you feel for the characters, and it will make you cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is The Best Movie Of The Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audiences and critics seem to have trouble with true emotion in the movies. Audiences eat up fake sentimentality (cloned romantic comedies, "chick flicks" and Robin Williams schmaltz) with a spoon, and the critics follow closely behind to castigate them for it. But confront them with something where feelings are born from the gut, from the soul, and they'll quickly, angrily dismiss it. This is bad enough among the audience, but it's even worse with so-called critics who should know better. Which brings me to Lars Von Trier's "Dancer in the Dark", the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes whose North American premiere sparked the same divisive debates it was greeted with at Cannes.As has been noted innumerable times, the story is the hokiest of melodramas, rife with coincidences and impossible bad luck. This fact has been used to attack the film, with critics berating Von Trier for concocting such a story, for unabashedly using such melodramatic conventions in this day and age, for expecting the audience to buy it (I even read a review criticizing the courtroom protocol). All of which is merely a means to avoid dealing with the naked, unself-conscious depth of emotion which is the true subject of the film. Whatever else he is, Von Trier is not a cynic; from the undeniably brilliant but arrogant technical wizard of "The Element of Crime" and "Zentropa" has emerged a true artist who infuses his movies with the full passion of his heart and soul. He once sought to reinvent cinema through technology; he now seeks to do it by throwing off any self-imposed distance with his subjects and presenting their personality and emotions fully upon the screen. "The carnal pleasure of that split second in the cinemas, when the projector and the loudspeakers, in unison, allow the illusion of sound and motion to burst forth" (as Von Trier wrote in one of his numerous manifestos) has been abandoned for the world of pain and hope encased within Bjork's heartrending screams at the conclusion of Dancer.Bjork's performance and music are the key to the film. As Von Trier and co-star Catherine Deneuve stated, Bjork cannot act, she can only be (which explains how she could have a breakdown while making the film). Using her vulnerability and inexperience, Von Trier does not simply coax a performance out of her; he uses her awkward naturalness as the emotional core of the film. Her pauses between words and lines and her stumbling repetitions, instead of breaking the illusion of character, enhance it, making Selma more real, more genuine, than any dialogue on a page could achieve. As Selma is another in Von Trier's line of childlike women ("Breaking the Waves", "The Idiots"), her bluntness and lack of artifice work perfectly with Bjork's inexperience. Watch the delightful and touching scene between Selma and Jeff (Peter Stormare), her lovelorn neighbour, when she tells him that she doesn't want a boyfriend (but if she did, it would be him).These qualities apply to the musical sequences as well, which Von Trier distinguishes from the "reality" scenes by using brighter colours (the film is shot completely with digital cameras). Rather than using familiar songs from American musicals to represent Selma's happy fantasy world (as is done in the Steve Martin version of "Pennies From Heaven", a clear inspiration for "Dancer"), the songs are original compositions by Bjork, and thus serve as extensions of Selma's character, her feelings and hopes given unlimited expression and lifted above reality, just as the film begins with an overture played over a series of changing abstract paintings. The contrast between Selma's fantasy and reality is not meant to be ironic, the "blissful happy endings of musicals commenting on the real brutality of life" and all that. Von Trier is not interested in irony; the songs ARE Selma, their hopeful exhortations (in defiance of her blindness, "I've Seen It All") and resigned acceptance of tragedy (after killing Bill, "You Just Did What You Had To Do") as clear and uncomplicated as Selma herself, with Bjork's voice moving from awkward, monotone phrasing to moments of piercing power. All this comes together in the unforgettable final scene, which I wouldn't dream of spoiling; a few members of the audience I was with found it so overwhelming they had to flee the theatre.A brief mention of other contributors. Catherine Deneuve lends her legendary presence and official Gallic seal of approval to Von Trier's daring, and manages to be quite convincing as a punch-press operator (she makes a mean sink). David Morse, one of the great unrecognized American character actors, is touching, frightening and pathetic as the sad Bill. Peter Stormare (best known as the hulking killer in "Fargo") perfectly expresses Jeff's dogged devotion, making him both comic and touching (his final scene with Bjork is heartbreaking). An unrecognizable Joel Grey (the Master of Ceremonies in "Cabaret") has a wonderful cameo as an aged Czechoslovakian musical star, and tapdances on the judge's desk in Selma's courtroom fantasy. Von Trier regulars Stellan Skarsgard and Udo Kier turn up in small roles.I will make this clear: this movie is not for everyone. It is challenging, frustrating, and uncompromising. It demands attention and patience, but the rewards are great. I have not talked much about plot, "style" or any other conventional review topic. They don't matter; this movie defies the cafeteria questionnaire-like evaluation from which most reviews are made. Like David Lynch's "The Straight Story" from last year, "Dancer in the Dark" is a work of art grounded in pure emotional simplicity, a simplicity so daunting that the immediate response is to throw it aside disdainfully and rent a Julia Roberts movie. Don't fall for it. This is the best movie of the year. Take a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw "Dancer in the Dark" I had forgotten how much I hate Von Trier's films. I have to rate this one 8, no matter how much I disliked it.Icelandic signer Bjork gives a beautiful and heart rending performance. Catherine de Neuve is as good and modest as you would ever expect her to be. Von Trier telegraphs his intention to put you through a very obnoxious wringer some ten minutes before the end of the film, where he doesn't pull a single punch. He even moderates the choreography of the prison guards so that you do not give up and start laughing. I don't know if my extreme visceral response to this film is aided by the shaky hand-held camera and the fuzzy picture, but it certainly isn't harmed. The movie is a heart breaker, but I have to ask myself to what end?I don't know if I'm sorry I saw it, but I surely wish this peculiar talent could be put to a less unpleasant use than Von Trier makes of it.Von Trier's incubus is to make you love a character (usually a woman, and then to destroy it before your eyes, and I mean before them. He rubs your nose right in what he considers to be life's feces. I admire his gifts, but am saddened that their possessor is so pessimistic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It´s one of these great European movies, you keep in mind for more than only few days. Dancer in the dark is of course an uneasy movie, and that´s naturally for Lars von Trier. The movie is unusual because of the Actors too. C. Deneuve in such a movie is a hint for its quality and the best one is: BJOERK. A singer, who didn´t want to play in a film, but for god sake, she changed her mind. I seldom saw an Actor playing so intense, like her. It makes me wonder, what other people learn at the schools for actors, if a singer does it so great ;). The movie makes you feelin´ right for this season, and it´s good to think about other things after a (more or less) hot summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Von Trier losing the plot (No, I didn't cry)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went inside the movie theatre thinking that I would probably see one of this year's best films (a girlfriend who saw the film a few days before declared it a "masterpiece"). I'm also very fond of Von Trier's moviemaking. Besides "The Idiots" which I really found repulsive and pointless, I really loved "Breaking the Waves", "Europa" (can't wait for a DVD release of this one) and "The Kingdom 1 &amp; 2". I find Von Trier's art to be very innovative. I'm also a big fan of Bjork's music and I really like the soundtrack to this film. So, what a disappointment!!!! First of all, whilst Von Trier is somewhat leaving his Dogma principles on the side, he's still using hand-held camera's and digital video. Considering the nature of the film, it's a totally useless technique. Musical scenes are very badly shot with an MTV feel to it. SPOILER ALERT As to the story, I didn't believe a single second in the story of this blind poor mother keeping her savings in a small tin box (what follows - theft of her money by her neighbour - was so predictable). This is probably why I didn't cry (not that I want to cry on purpose) as I have never been at any moment touched by what was happening. The only thing to remember out of this nauseously manipulative film is Bjork's performance. Truly amazing. I now understand why Bjork suffered so much during the shooting and actually didn't like working with Von Trier at all. I hope we'll see her again in other films that are not mistakenly taken for masterpieces when they only are cheap tearjerkers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie already having read many different comments and not knowing much about the director. I did know a fair amount about Bjork( I have all of her cds). However, I was still very sketchy about watching yet another musical artist move into the realm of film. Within the first thirty minutes of the film all my sketchiness was gone! This was one of the best films I have ever seen. I felt as though Bjork WAS Selma. She was the darling throughout this whole film. The supporting cast were like the icing on a very fine cake. I have always been one to ignore critics professional critics because I feel that once they get to a certain level they tend to ignore all the great points of a film and find the negative to over-analyze. If any respected critic does not approve of this film or are not even the slightest bit emotionally effected by it, I would seriously suggest they find a different career. While this film is not perfect, it has every ingrediant to a film masterpiece: spotless acting, innovative if not utterly intriguing camera work, affective plot, and one of the most extraordinary soundtracks of all time.</fullReview>

I'm talking here about lots of things - Björk's performance, which was mesmerizing in it's raw untrained power; a superb supporting cast including the still-gorgeous Catherine Deneuve; a great idea, that of re-inventing the musical as millenium escapism; a time-tested story (Selma IS Tess of the D'Urbervilles); and a director that I admire (Von Trier's "Europa" is a truly great film).Where, oh where, did it all go so terribly wrong?Well, let's start with the nausea-inducing camerawork. Hey, I'm a cinematographer too you know, so I can appreciate avant-garde styling as much as the next guy, but why make your audience sick? The only good film work was during the Fosse-like musical numbers, when the colours finally "popped" and there was some truly great images on the screen.The excellent supporting cast is mostly wasted, and it seems at times like Von Trier isn't sure how to get the performances he wants out of the talent he has (there are times near the beginning of the film when watching Björk flounder through the exposition scenes is like watching a bunch of kittens being dragged behind a car). Scenes go on much too long, with nothing happening in them - a little prudent editing would have shortened the movie considerably from it's current horrendous length.Still and all, it's worthwhile seeing. Once Björk gets to the meaty emotional stuff, she shines brightly (her "Best Actress" award at Cannes was well-deserved), and the moments of brilliance that make their way through the dimly-lit, grainy, seasick-inducing muck are worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first 20-30 minutes of this film, I wasn't sure why it had gotten the kinds of passionate reviews it has. But then I realised that I was gradually being gripped harder and harder by this movie: by Bjork's extraordinary performance, by the simple, inexorable story, by the cinematography in all its outrageous von Trier eccentricity. This film is definitely one of the best I have ever seen.It certainly deserves a Best Film nomination, though I doubt whether it will appeal to enough people for it to do so, but if Bjork doesn't get Best Actress for this performance there is no justice! I felt as if she *was* Selam (and that is NOT to say that Bjork was just 'being herself'; if you have ever seen Bjork perform, her persona as singer is quite, quite different from even the musical segments in this film).The 'realism' of the story shouldn't be your main criterion when watching this film. There are lots of points at which you could say, oh look, in reality that wouldn't happen. I don't think that's the point: I think the film is like a *fable*, a simple tale, with a predictable ending. The point is not whether it's realistic or suspenseful, but what we learn from its telling. And the character of Selam has to be one of the most moving and inspirational characters you can find on screen.The cinematography: I get a bit of a headache from the swoopy hand-held camera work, and could do with less of it, but I didn't think it was as pronounced as in Breaking The Waves, or the Michael Winterbottom film, Wonderland. What I loved was the contrast between the grey-yellow-beige tones of 'real life' and the glowing colours of the musical numbers. And the way that the images would slowly start to glow into bright colours as a prelude to the singing and dancing... Von Trier uses amazing camera angles to give dozens of different shots within the same scene, a device that's usually distancing, but here intensifies your response to every scene.And the musical numbers? I loved the unconventional music, the dippy lyrics, the eccentric choreography. No, it doesn't look like a normal musical, but that style of song and dance dervues from several decades ago now: I think it's great that Von Trier bothered to think up *something different*. As for the filming of the musical segments, watch out especially for the first one, where everyone starts singing and dancing in the factory. There were 100 video cameras placed around the set, all simultaneously filming, and then the scene is constructed from editing those different shots. Brilliant stuff.When you go see this film, just be aware that it is pretty intense. You might hate it (some people walked out when I saw it), but you are more likely to be completely wrapped up in it, and thus find the ending harrowing. People were audibly sobbing in the cinema.It's the film of the year for me, at least. It'll stay with you a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lars von trier taking a break from Dogma 95</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selma, a Czech immigrant trying to carve out a living as a punch press operator in the 1960s Pacific Northwest, is going blind. Keeping Selma going as her condition rapidly deteriorates is the love of and for her 12-year-old son Gene (Vladica Kostic) and her love for the lavish Hollywood screen musicals. The latter initially manifests itself in Selma's life in her ability to imagine music out of everyday sounds. While the strains of the overture don't derive from such a recognizable source noise, this opening gets the general idea across: the audience sees darkness yet can hear music, much like how Selma experiences her reality.If, as the comment goes, Björk can't act but only feel, von Trier could not have made a better choice for his lead. Selma's story is all about emotion, and in order for Dancer to succeed, her portrayer must make an instant connection with the audience. And that Björk instantly achieves; Selma may be rather na?ve (another point of criticism for the hate-its), but she is endearingly, honestly so, and one is easily willing to accompany her on her flights of fancy and stand by her during her many trials and tribulations. While von Trier's radical storytelling and directorial hand are a large factor, the astonishing, unadorned force of the film's finale would not have been achieved with an "actress" playing Selma. Björk simply is Selma--and the film itself.</fullReview>

I know! - Let's give her the best actress nod so we can round her out as the woman of my dreams."-The sentiments of sixteen year old boys and Film Critics the world over and god forbid, the Academy "Bjorking off"...What's wrong with this picture? Is it just me or are cute perky chicks given too much credit these days? Seems every time I turn around there's some new darling media girl getting too much recognition for too little work, be it Binoche, Diaz, or in this case Bjork.Before you dismiss me as a rampant chauvinist, set only on dissing actresses, let us remember men are not guilt free here either. Witness Hollywood's unrelenting efforts to hand generally subpar actor Robin Williams parts more talented actors would give their eyeteeth for.David Bowie once said about the first major film he did, "Just a Gigolo", "It was my 32 Elvis movies rolled into one."Perhaps that's the sentiment we should take here.Unlike many popstars before her though, Bjork's acting debut is competent and moving. I'd even go so far as to call it art, for the emotional roller coaster ride it took myself and the rest of the audience through last night.Ask yourselves though, how much of this performance was due to an artist who has mastered the craft of acting versus someone well versed at being themselves. I suggest it is the latter.Don't get me wrong, Bjork plays her part well, but the best actress suggestions I've seen on this board really get my goat.If you want to see a great actress, see someone with whom you are likely not enchanted with before you enter the theater and see where they take you. If you'd like to do some homework, might I suggest: Linda Hunt in "The Year of Living Dangerously", Anne Bancroft in "The Graduate" or Helen Mirren in "The Cook the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover."But why even bother looking that far when you could enjoy Deneuve's performance beside Bjork in the same film.That said, Bjork does bring a lot of great qualities to this film such as the aforementioned audience involvement, steady acting and some wonderfully creative music.That said, why do I still feel angry and queasy after seeing this movie 24 hours ago?It ain't just the lack of steadicam.I came into the movie a Von Trier virgin. I came out feeling date raped. From what I've read this is pretty standard fare for one of Lar's movies.Perhaps it is his ability to negotiate illogical plot points with his audience so well. For example, why didn't Selma open a bank account? It would have saved a lot of trouble. But then we wouldn't have a movie would we.No matter, it was too late, with every successive act of the story, they sucked us further into the tragedy and we went along willingly.That said, see this movie for a variety of compelling reasons:1.) You will actually enjoy a modern musical even if it lacks what my friends like to call that "Steve Miller Hummability"Steve Miller - you may not like him but at least you can whistle his tunes on the way home. Try that with half of the Disney features these days. 'Nuff said.2.) You will be seduced by a director's melodramatic albeit pretentious storytelling technique. You will no longer think it hokey that people might have cried at operas two hundred years ago.3.) Unrelenting as it is, it is a modern fable and damnit we need more of those.4.) While I don't think she should nab the best acting trophy Bjork's sure to be in line for the best soundtrack and rightfully so.That said, I have enjoyed their latest effort and look forward to what these two great artists will bring us in the future.-The Nebbish</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't think of a single interpretation of this movie in which it succeeds. If it was to be taken at face value, it fails because it's impossible to feel any sympathy for a character who is created to be miserable, in a story that is set up to play out one way without fail until its end.If it was intended to be a reinvention of the classical musical with a more "realistic" method of storytelling, it fails on both counts. The "realistic" moments are so full of self-indulgent (on the director's part) artifice that that seem even more phony than a traditional Hollywood film. The musical numbers are ineptly handled, differing from the rest of the movie only in that they're choreographed and the colors are a little more saturated -- why not use film instead of video, or more traditional camera angles to make them more fantastic? I'd heard about the movie's main "gimmick" and had listened to the soundtrack, and the musical numbers I imagined were so much more spectacular than the final product, which ends up looking like an over-exposed home video of a Stomp performance.If this had been made 10 or even 5 years ago, I could see its being called "innovative." Now it just seems pretentious and inept, a dangerous combination. The only thing it does effectively is show what an impassioned, innovative performer Bjork is. But any one of her videos (not to mention the amazing soundtrack) is a much better showcase for her talent; they're much more creative, innovative, and successful. The final scene actually made me angry, but not for the intended reasons. I was angered that her performance and her stunning voice had been wasted on such a sham of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark is without doubt the most downbeat movie I`ve seen (and if anyone thought that Breaking The Waves was depressing, well, think again).It starts on a depressing note and it`s all downhill from there. When you think Selma`s fate is as cruel as it could get, it soon gets even worse.The raw power of Bjork`s performance is simply incredible (so is her accent -- her Icelandic standing in for Czech?!) and the supporting players are on par with the undoubted star whose songs manage to improve on a film already among the best lately.The only thing that prevented me from having the film experience of the year was von Trier`s obsession with jerking the camera around in the misguided belief that motion-sickness- inducing and underlit photography equalled authenticity. When the drama is so gripping and the acting is so magnificent, I see no reason why making the viewers sick would be desirable.No matter how you feel when you walk in the cinema, yet it will all be worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark is without doubt the most downbeat movie I`ve seen (and if anyone thought that Breaking The Waves was depressing, well, think again).It starts on a depressing note and it`s all downhill from there. When you think Selma`s fate is as cruel as it could get, it soon gets even worse.The raw power of Bjork`s performance is simply incredible (so is her accent -- her Icelandic standing in for Czech?!) and the supporting players are on par with the undoubted star whose songs manage to improve on a film already among the best lately.The only thing that prevented me from having the film experience of the year was von Trier`s obsession with jerking the camera around in the misguided belief that motion-sickness- inducing and underlit photography equalled authenticity. When the drama is so gripping and the acting is so magnificent, I see no reason why making the viewers sick would be desirable.No matter how you feel when you walk in the cinema, yet it will all be worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a mind blower. I was not expecting the movie to turn out the way that it did. Bjork's performance as Selma was nothing less than spectaculor. This is a must see for those who like movies where the characters have depth and show powerful emotions, mixed with the lighthearted musical numbers. See this movie... You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are things one can carp about in "Dancer in the Dark," a modern musical about a poor Czechoslovak immigrant eking out a meager living in Washington state in 1964. Selma works in a metal stamping plant, even though she's losing her eyesight to some congenital condition. Her 12-year-old son, Gene, will also go blind unless she can scrape together enough money to pay for an operation. Selma has one passion that enables her to temporarily escape the struggle of her day-to-day existence -- movie musicals, both of the Prague and Hollywood variety. Selma spends some of her spare time rehearsing the role of Maria in a local production of "The Sound of Music." And when her imagination really soars, she's able to picture herself in her own musical numbers, starring herself.Like an attorney in a courtroom drama, the amateur movie reviewer in me kept jumping up to object. I objected to the daydream musical numbers; with their Europop melodies and mechanized choreography, they're a lot closer to MTV than MGM. I objected to the handheld, video-to-film look -- I'd gotten enough of that (and the vaguely nauseous headache that came with it) from "The Blair Witch Project," thank you very much. Another disappointment -- when Selma goes to see movies with her best friend Kathy (played by the still-beautiful Catherine Deneuve), the few clips we get are from creaky black and white musicals of the early 1930s. I guess they couldn't afford to license excerpts from "Singin' in the Rain" or "The Band Wagon" or -- since this is supposed to be 1964 -- "My Fair Lady." (Or how about "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"?)I also objected to some of the manipulative, unconvincing twists and turns of the plot, which I won't divulge here. Yet I found each and every one of my objections being overruled, not by a film judge, but by the star of "Dancer in the Dark," the Icelandic pop star Björk. Her performance as the humble yet hopeful Selma, the young woman with a song in her heart that's also filled with pain, blew me away -- it felt so achingly real, I left the theater convinced Björk should be nominated for an Academy Award. (It's going to take me a while to forget the way she screams the line, "I can't breathe!") It was Björk who also wrote the music to the original songs, and while they're not to my taste, she at least embraces them with the same fervor as she does her character.I predict: Björk will be nominated for a best actress Oscar. You read it here first. (Of course, I could be wrong, in which case, you read that here first, too.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent acting, very challenging subject matter, questionable cinematography.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bjork makes a stunning dramatical debut in this heart wrenching drama by Lars von Trier. Thanks to a small cast, the film stays intimate with it's main characters (much like Drowning Mona) you are always at their side. The ending is especially worth the two-hour wait. The only fault I found with the film is the ultra-shaky handheld camera, which detracted from the drama.The other problem was the musical numbers, without which the film would not suffer in the tiniest bit, and bring it's running length back under control. In addition to adding nothing to the story, the songs were all shot on video with multiple cameras to save time and money, and the resulting video to film transfer is disqueting and cheapens the film. When used correctly (Natural Born Killers) the technique can add a lot to a picture, but not when so obviously used for certain shots. ("Oh look, the picture is soft with edge-aliasing, over-saturation and high-speed grain...it must be time for another musical number!")Bjork, make more films, Lars...stop using tired gimmicks in your cinematography and just shoot the scene! I give the film an 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally overwhelming film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I just came from the theater, seeing this brilliant masterpiece, I am still a bit shaken, this being an emotionally overwhelming piece of filmmaking, so I'll just state my thoughts as they occur, without order.1. Björk is fantastic as Selma. From her music videos, I'd never have guessed that she's such an extraordinary acting talent. She makes this character almost frighteningly real. For a large part, it was her performance that pulled me so much into this film. Kudos to Lars von Trier for making such a bold casting decision. I bet many Hollywood name actresses would've killed for this part. And who would've guessed that Björk, singer-songwriter Björk, was the one to portray the character this perfectly?2. Not since Schindler's List has any film overwhelmed me so much. I certainly don't measure the quality of a film by how hard it makes me cry, but since in this case (which by the way was the first time I ever cried in a movie theater) the emotions aren't manipulative, but instead sincere as hell, I make it a point to say that Dancer In The Dark, being an emotionally stirring movie, succeeds on all fronts.3. Beautiful songs (plus the extraordinary overture that plays, so unlike Hollywood, over a black screen) that enhance the respective plot points very well. Look for the enormously touching satisfaction and aching happiness in the song "I've Seen It All"...4. As in films like "The Celebration", the video cinematography is dizzying and irritating at first, but soon I came to realize that this is the only way that we can see this movie as Selma sees her world: blurred, hazed, shaky... Note that it is just in the musical sequences that the picture is clear and fully colored.There's much more to Dancer In The Dark than this, but suffice it to say: I agree with another user who commented earlier that this is, I quote, a "hardcore horror movie", in the best sense. A haunting film that the Academy shouldn't ignore at next year's Oscars- if they don't want to lose all the credibility that's left. Björk will be next year's best actress. Remember my words.10 out of 10 (and then some...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dancer in the Dark" possesses that deadliest of film traits - one that keeps enticing you on while it needlessly slaps you away. At the end you wonder who is more physically and emotionally abused, the main character Selma or the movie audience. The saddest part is that well meaning people put on this production without any intent to harm. And yet when you walk out of the theatre, you feel less exhilarating and more fatigued, less inspired and more demoralized. "Dancer in the Dark" is a copy of Lars von Trier's earlier 'Dogma 95' success, "Breaking the Waves". Yet in "Dancer", the close up features produced by the hand held camera make the film more nauseous than revealing and the Scandinavian-accented Selma (Bjork) makes her dialogue barely intelligible, especially when she is trying to sing. Throw in an excessive dependence on dream-like sequences that detract rather than reinforce the plot and "Dancer" is already in the hole three times. Just as the singing numbers pretty much ruined Woody Allen's "Everyone Says I Love You", in "Dancer", the musical numbers trivialize this movie - intertwined as they are with traumatic moments - the dangerous night shift at the plant, the close call with the train, the killing of Bill, the moments before the police come, the tension before the guilty verdict, and the fateful 107 steps leading to the gallows. What a desirable buildup of emotions wasted on silly frivolity. Having Joel Grey in an out-of-the-blue role merely cheapens rather than authenticates the tinsel characters they have all become (wasting brilliant performances by Catherine Deneuve and David Morse). How much redemption can come out of this film when the central focus, the fight to save Selma's son's eyesight, seem to matter less than social commentary on the death sentence and on prejudice against Czech immigrants. Indeed we don't even see the boy in the last quarter of the film. How fitting that "Dancer in the Dark" bonded so much with "The Sound of Music" - both fables about what might have happened to real people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film stands in line with Thomas Vinterberg's movie "Festen" (aka "The Celebration"). Selma's fight to save her son's eyesight is shown similar impressive as the first dogme movie. Music is only used sparsely in the musical like passages while the "rest" of the movie gains impressiveness through omitted background music. Although you anticipate the plot the movie nevertheless loses its tension. All in all this is a fierce pleading against death penalty and missing public health systems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infuriating, damning ambivalence. (Allusion to potential spoilers, but none explicit.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a (previous, at least) fan of von Trier's Breaking the Waves, and a quite passionate Bjork fan, I waited patiently for months for the US release of Dancer in the Dark. I left the theater feeling angry, as if I had been emotionally assaulted. Being an art-house cinema kinda girl, and one who certainly prefers a little provocation or difficult subject matter over the nine-millionth sequel to Scream or mauldin romantic comedy-of-the-week at the local megaplex, I thought I could handle, and appreciate, Dancer's harrowing narrative as, at the very least, redemptive at (golden)heart.Instead, I felt utterly manipulated and cheated as an audience-goer, and incensed at von Trier's (to me) lack of respect for his characters. Don't get me wrong, I don't propose a one-size-fits-all happy ending, but two-and-a-half hours of relentless sadism levelled at simple, naive Selma/Bjork was a hollow version of Breaking the Waves set to a catchy backbeat. Yet, for the first time ever, I wailed my way through a film, sobbing hysterically for the last twenty minutes. My tears were not of catharsis, however; they were sobs at injustice -- not just that perpetuated in the totally unrealistic and underdeveloped plotline, but that oozing from the arrogant, auteur/bad boy antics of the director.I want to hate this film, but the fact that it provoked such an emotional reaction in me, coupled with its truly creative moments (the beautiful, if overblown, conceit of Selma's musical numbers, full of luminous escapism), means I cannot. I want to love it, but the conscientious objector in me refuses. This sprawling misogynist melodrama can be summed up in one bubbleheaded phrase: capital punishment bad, Bjork good.And, is she ever. Her soaring voice sears the film in my memory, for better or for worse, its keening made all the more bittersweet by the intuitive knowledge that she, and not only the character of Selma, is feeling the agony.In cranky summary: an oftentimes illogical, cruelly manipulative, but emotionally riveting (and therefore innovative) film. It dredges up my easy hatred and begrudging admiration. Bjork (who has said in interviews that she would have preferred a less suffering-filled tale) deserves an Oscar; von Trier needs to lose the female martyr fetish, and fast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but I liked it. The story seems like something old D.W. Griffith would direct. The musical numbers are jarringly anachronistic, but I think that's good. If most people were to make up songs in their heads, the results probably wouldn't sound like what they hear on the radio. Their modern quality does tend to remind us that it's Bjork we're watching, not Selma, but that impression might fade after a decade or so, and this might be one for the ages. I particularly liked Catherine Deneuve and Siobhan Fallon; everyone else did well too, and Bjork might very well have deserved that Cannes award.Now I have a gripe to air. I scanned this page to see what other people thought of the film, secure in the knowledge that I'd seen it and couldn't have it spoiled for me. Instead I find that some people are busy spoiling BREAKING THE WAVES! Which I haven't seen! Unless it's one of those endings that appears at the beginning of the film with everything else being a flashback, I'm pretty @#$%! ticked off. I would like to implore those folks - and the ones who have been unexpectedly disclosing DANCER IN THE DARK's ending - to please put a SPOILER WARNING in front of remarks that need them.

I won't spoil the plot, but you don't expect to end up where the film takes you. There didn't seem to be a dry eye in the house. The music is slightly spoilt by Lars Von Trier's lyrics, but Bjork puts some life into the tunes. This has had an appalling critical response in the U.K. It put me off going for 2/3 weeks. I do feel that Bjork can arouse resentment in people. Perhaps the establishment (French, Walker, Norman etc) needs to go, and be replaced by some fresh blood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made me physically ill!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I can appreciate this movie for taking bold, cutting edge experimental steps, and was moved by the compelling story and solid performances, it is not enough to allow me to forgive it for making me physically ill! The shaky, hand-held camera work was worse than an amateur shooting home movies on a sailboat in a gale! After about 20 minutes of it, my stomach was queasy. After an hour, I thought I was going to have to go to the men's room to puke! So, I ended up just following the dialog through closed eyes. So, please, all filmmakers take note: You may wish to be self-indulgent and pursue your own vision, but using shaky-cam just for the sake of doing something different gets old really fast! It's like anything else: Use it judiciously, creatively, for a desired effect. Director Lars von Trier has succeeded in drawing accolades from jaded cineastes who have who like to belittle basic story-telling. But how far will this get you? The most important thing is: Don't Forget Your Audience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly memorable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly one of the most unique films I have ever seen. Director Lars Von Trier is pounding strongly on ethical and political issues such as the death sentence and the American juror system. Not surprisingly not all Americans like it. It is a cold gush in the face. The film begins awkwardly but picks up nice as one gets use to the "Blair Witch Program" like camera work. Up front and very personal, so to speak. This magnifies the emotional power. You start to feel like you know Selma (Björk) personally and at the end most people are deeply struck by her fate. The musical numbers are nicely intertwined and there Björk's singing talents explode. A truly memorable film that besides few acting setbacks (non-chemistry between Selma and her son) is one of the greatest made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless tragedy ... ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still don't know what to think of this film. Maybe I'm missing something. I revere Bjork as a goddess, but this movie just didn't touch me. Many actions of the characters seemed illogical (normally I don't mind this, but this was happening to the extreme), and contrived in the sense that I felt as though the director was trying desperately to make me feel sorry for the main character.The musical scenes were a refreshing and unique addition to the movie, although I was expecting an excellence of choreography and directing more along the lines of Bjork's "It's Oh So Quiet" music video; the musical numbers in this movie seemed very clunky in comparison to that masterpiece, but maybe they were supposed to be that way and I'm just missing the point of the film. (On the other hand, maybe Spike Jonze--the director of "It's Oh So Quiet"--should've directed this.)The colors and texture of the video were also disappointing for me, but that was probably Von Trier's intention... The muddy palette, along with the handheld camera and the digital video compression artifacts and the "cut &amp; paste" style of editing made the film seem more like a documentary, and in that sense the realism was enhanced, but at the same time ... the colors were just so vomitous, and the poor quality of the digital video made it seem like the theatre was playing a pirated MPEG version of the movie off the Internet. This isn't really a complaint; I guess it's just a matter of personal taste.Bjork's acting was superb, and so was her music. In fact, I think everyone in the movie did a fine acting job--it's just the script that made the film seem illogical and contrived to me.Maybe my expectations for this movie were just way too high, or I was missing something crucial when I watched it. Still, when I watch a very good tragedy, I don't only feel sorry for the main character, but I also feel like I've gotten this sort of "portrait of humanity," or been given something to reflect on--at the very least, something more than simply feeling sorry for the protagonist. With this movie, though, I just ended up wondering why the hell things hadn't gone differently, and as a result I felt as though the director had set up this "crash course" for Selma just so I could feel sorry for her, and nothing more.Still, maybe I'm just missing something and I need to see the film a second time to really appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different and difficult, but worth the effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to get into this movie at first. Much of it is done in a stylized realism reminiscent of 1970's movies, with jerky camera movements and editing, echoey sound, mumbled lines, and deliberately mediocre dialogue. But the realism serves to counterbalance what is fundamentally a very old-fashioned (practically Victorian) melodrama about a poor girl being crushed by society's indifference, and the synthesis of documentary-type immediacy and heart-string tugging is quite effective. Bjork's character is such a sweet little child-like dreamer, but with a very adult--even heroic--sense of responsibility as a single mom, that it would be hard not to fall in love with her. It's not an upbeat film, to put it mildly, but if you've made the effort to get into it, you'll be rewarded with a riveting and disturbing perspective on social injustice far more powerful and memorable than the bigger, slicker, self-congratulatory morality tales trotted out by Hollywood from time to time.</fullReview>

Then, the musical thing. At first it is moving to see how this woman is carried away by her fantasy, but after a while, frankly, it becomes inappropriate, disrespectful of human tragedy and totally illogic (and i mean the logic of the heart). SPOILER ALERT The other unbelievable element is: how could Selma not choose to avoid her tragic destiny by just telling the truth? You don't expect this pure-hearted, heroic woman to lie, to deny, to mistify herself. And then why would she anyway? How could she get to the point of concealing her identity while on trial? Whose good was it for? Nobody's, not even her son's. I understand her lying to the economy of the story and to the tragic twist the director wants it to have (Von Trier had already decided the story instead of letting the story develop itself with its own life) but I find it unnerving as a human being. It's not acceptable that such a tragic detsiny is justified by such an insubstantial issue (Selma's not wanting her son to know of the operation, I guess...). The movie is good for all that part when it is not openly absurd. Remember the saying: too good to be true? Well, this movie's too tragic to be true!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking the Wives, or, Pain Is from Heaven, or, Everybody Says I Hate You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writer-director Lars von Trier seems to have misread his primary cinematic inspiration, Carl Dreyer's JOAN OF ARC, as an S&amp;M porno movie. In one film after another, Von Trier crucifies a pixieish-simpleton heroine, then perfumes her death twitches in Robert Bresson cologne. When a schlock director like Dario Argento vomits forth all his misogynistic bile, one senses a crude grappling with the unconscious. In Von Trier's case, it's offensive because the same inchoate misogyny is wrapped in the flag of Spiritual Cinema. DANCER IN THE DARK ups the ante of Von Trier's BREAKING THE WAVES to the level of highbrow snuff cinema--call it THE UMBRELLAS OF SALO.The Icelandic singer-songwriter Bjork was cast as the heroine of this epic melange, which retains the essayistic feel of Von Trier's last movie, THE IDIOTS, while digesting some lowbrow forms: silent-movie melodrama and the musical set piece, to be precise. Bjork's Selma (a name that has very strong connotations for Americans, unbeknownst to Von Trier) is a Czech immigrant in the U.S. saving her pennies for an eye operation on her young son. (Ah, the old eye operation! Is this a wink at Douglas Sirk's MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION--or John Woo's THE KILLER?) Through contrivances too archaic to recount, Selma loses her pennies and gets in a whole heap of trouble--and when she needs escape, the movie flits into some brightly-colored musical serenades.Performed and composed by Bjork, these interludes are magical. They would seem to echo the stark contrast between reality and fantasy in Dennis Potter's anti-musicals, but they don't, quite. They're expressions of free-floating imagination and joy, like the colored-landscape chapter headings that were the only good part of BREAKING THE WAVES. Bjork's performance in these numbers is thrilling, but in the real-life scenes one feels acutely uneasy--as if we were watching an untutored person being tortured by the director into a reaction, rather than watching a performance.Von Trier is a fascinating, fastidious sadist, as cruel to his audience as to his heroines. He prolongs Selma's Stations of the Cross, even prolonging the age-old Phone Call from the Governor, in a way that has some people in the audience shuddering and sobbing. Using the emotionally raw genres he plays with here, Von Trier feels like a jaded drug addict who needs a new super-high: he takes the corny melodrama seriously only because it gives the movie a hyperferocious feeling. His muzzy video style has become maybe the world's most highly imitated form right now, but in the early, setting-up scenes, Bjork seems unable to improv with the more trained actors, and Von Trier seems at a loss as to how he can shape the scenes. The weaving in and out of the musical numbers is ingenious, but in the end the movie seems to be about nothing more than Von Trier's wanting to skewer us with the Passion of Selma. (Like P.T. Anderson's MAGNOLIA, DANCER IN THE DARK seems to have no subject matter beyond its own ambition.)Still and all, like Von Trier's repellent IDIOTS, DANCER IN THE DARK is never less than jaw-droppingly fascinating. And it suggests that--perhaps if he got off his girly-martyr kick--Von Trier could contrive the first truly original post-musical musical since Godard's A WOMAN IS A WOMAN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>original but illogical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bjork gives a surprisingly good performance and Deneuve is the most beautiful 57-year-old on the planet. I took the musical numbers as loving satire on the absurdity of the genre. It's certainly an original picture, but...the melodrama makes no sense in the logic of the universe we live in. (Spoiler Alert: read no further if you haven't seen the movie). Why doesn't Selma keep her cash in the bank where, obviously, it can't be stolen? Why would Selma put a "down payment" on her son's operation? Better yet, why wouldn't the doctor have offered to work something out with Selma if it meant saving her son's sight? Why would Selma refuse appeals on her death sentence? (yeah, yeah, it's all poetic that she doesn't but it belies "human behavior"--the title of a Bjork song). Why would't her lawyer file her appeal without the money if he knew it could save her life? (answer: the movie waned to villify the lawyer). Why was the $2000 for the boy's eye operation the only available funds in the entire area? Besides all of these logical fallacies, I just didn't buy the shooting scene--just did not ring true with what we know of human behavior. That scene, I suppose, is the crux of the picture.This is certainly a very original movie, in terms of style. However, the last fourth is so convoluted and so foreign to everything we know about the way people behave, that the intended three-hankie ending was unmoving for me. If so much of the behavior of Selma belies the logic of so much of what we know about human behavior, then it's not hard to remain unmoved by the tragedy that befalls her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful cinematic experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Dancer In The Dark for one reason, really: Bjork. I loved Bjork as a singer, and when she won best actress at Cannes I knew I had to see this movie. I'll admit, it was a somewhat shallow reason, but there it is. I saw Breaking The Waves, and I wasn't overly impressed with it. But there was no way I could have prepared for the raw emotion of this film. When it finished, I couldn't speak. I was so overwhelmed by what I had just seen that I didn't know how to react. This film is definitely the best of 2000, and it's the most powerful film I've ever seen. One note, this movie is not for everyone. If you like European art-house films, then go see it. If you see this because it's a musical, watch out! You'll hate it. Most of the bad reviews I've seen for this film give it bad reviews based solely on the fact that it "fails" as a musical. The musical numbers really aren't there to make it a musical, it's there to show how Selma thinks. It would be like putting musical numbers in Taxi Driver; it would be to show Travis' state of mind, not to entertain the audience. Another great thing about this film is the superb acting. All of the actors turn in great performances, with Bjork being a huge standout. It's a shame that she's declared she won't act anymore, because she was phenomenal. If you want to see a unique, and extremely powerful, film, see this. If you want a musical, go see Singing In The Rain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am the first to admit I didn't see any other Trier films. Maybe it's election year and all, but don't you just see the film is trying too hard to deliver a 'subliminal' political message? death penalty, (in)justice system, health care... After all, in european countries (and Canada) you could get an eye operation for free (despite a long waiting list). If it's an anti-american parody, it's a badly done one. (South Park style would be preferrable, Oops, excuse me :)The melodrama is too thin to wrap the message(s). I am voting for Nader but I don't need to see a film shuffle political slogan down my throat. The US setting (community theatre, US court and jail etc) a little bit cartoonish, maybe the film could be set in 50's instead of 60's. Did I mention the melodrama?The song and dance of Bjork almost made the film bearable, the charactor was escaping cruel reality, I was escaping non-stop handy camera motion (it made me seasick for the first 30 min.)Bjork's acting is fine, since this is her debut. But why does Deneuve in a role Whoopi Goldberg is good at? </fullReview>

The camera work is some of the most intense in recent film history. It is constantly pushed into the actors faces and at times shaken very violently. The Golden Dink award goes to Bjork for her gut-wrenching performance as Selma. This is truly a performance you should be REQUIRED to see this year. At the end of the film, don't worry, I won't give anything away - the audience could have heard a pin drop. Absolute silence. They also remained in their seats until every credit was finished rolling. Another noteworthy aspect of the film is its opening film sequence - absolutely stunning. This a beautiful, disturbing, very independent film. Bjork deserves her Best Actress Award from Cannes and many others to follow.</fullReview>

The run of emotions evoked from this film is pretty complete. I muttered something to a friend about this being the greatest movie I'd ever seen (a hyperbole, for sure, but still a sign of it's impact on me). It was however the most profound experience I've enjoyed in a theater since the Ice Storm. Now all I can say is see the film. You want a review..read on..but it really is the kind of movie that needs to be experienced, preferably in a theater with a good sound system to highlight Bjork's unbelievable music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just simply NOT the masterpiece everyone else on this site is saying it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'll do my best to avoid specific spoilers, but some indication of where this film ends up is probably going to come through. Odds are, though, you can probably tell that much from the ads.First off, let me say that I'm an enormous Lars von Trier fan. I've watched his "Element of Crime" twice, watched all nine hours of his "Kingdom" series on the big screen last year (and loved every minute of it), made sure to catch "Idioterne" on video when I was in London early this year (as it hadn't been released in the U.S. yet), and would say that his masterpiece "Breaking the Waves" is the finest film of the past two decades. Seriously. So of course I jumped at the chance to see an advance screening of his new film. However, "Dancer in the Dark" was a disappointment.The plain fact is that it's a rehash of "Breaking the Waves" all the way down the line. The only real difference is that "DitD" has none of the weight or ambiguity that "BtW" possesses. "Breaking the Waves" says, basically, that God and Love are worth dying for. "Dancer in the Dark" says that Eyesight and Musicals are worth dying for. Which of the two sounds like the stronger case? To approach more minor issues with nearly the EXACT SAME TECHNIQUES with which he approached major ones makes this feel like a BIG step back for von Trier. And how can we not make comparisons? Both films are about a quiet, childlike, self-sacrificing woman who gives her all for a loved one and comes to a difficult end due to the circumstances of a cruel world. Both films are shot in the same very distinctive widescreen, hand-held style by the brilliant Robby Muller("BtW" on film, "DitD" on digital video).However, where "Breaking the Waves" has a very specific sense of place, "Dancer in the Dark" takes place in a totally anachronistic United States which no one from this country will recognize. Where "Breaking the Waves" has character and story ambiguity (is Bess mentally ill or just blessed? is the ending tragic or triumphant?), "Dancer in the Dark" is all black and white. Bjork's Selma is a saint -- she's never mean or selfish or confused -- and her world is simply a very cruel place with no grace save for what she can create in her imagination. Bjork's performance is quite good, and I can't help but think that it could rank with Emily Watson's Bess from "BtW", if only von Trier had given her a character that complete to play."Dancer in the Dark"s only real innovations are its Musical Numbers, which usually just seem gimmicky. Some of them are endearing, some of them are moving, some of them are agonizingly awkward. They don't hurt the film any, but neither do they help to raise it up.In conclusion, I would say that despite my disappointment, I would still say that this is a film that should be seen. Film only reaches the level of art if it provokes people, if it elicits a response from its audience. This is something von Trier does very well, even in his weaker moments. This is certainly a film that will be the subject of contemplation and conversation long after you leave the theatre (which isn't something I can really say about many other films made these days). My recommendation, though -- to anyone who wants to see "Dancer in the Dark", or anyone who has already seen it and liked it (like the other people on this page) -- is that after you've seen this film, and you've had time to digest it, rent "Breaking the Waves" and see the heights to which Lars von Trier can really climb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clumsy melodrama or pure tragedy? Shite or triumph? Opinions and reviewers are polarized on this one: I found it one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. In a series of jerky cuts Von Trier's freely-edited Dogme camera appears to eavesdrop on Selma's life, while the loose &amp; compelling musical scenes with their crane shots and saturated light whip the viewer off into Selma's soul, establishing the gap between 'reality' and 'fantasy' and (therefore) the artifice of the whole enterprise. Here art does not conceal art but reveal it. In other words, you know you're watching a movie. But as a result, Von Trier has tapped into something simple &amp; deeply distressing. It's an extraordinary means of exposing the mechanics &amp; the seams of film-making in a film that turns out to have a seamless heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, unique, but disappointing (mild spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful story with beautiful acting and music. I was drawn in by the idea and was excited to see this truly unique film. I was impressed with Von Trier's look into the theme of escapism, and the extent to which it improves and damages our lives. I was touched by the total selflessness of the characters and pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the musical scenes. In the end though, my predominate reaction was disappointment. Unfortunately, Von Trier's style often prohibited me from being able to connect with the characters of the film. The film begins with a collection of short, disjointed shots, giving the film a hyper-realistic, documentary-ish, or even home-movie feel. Throwing most of the conventional camerawork protocols out the window, Von Trier's shaky, out-of-focus, or extreme close-up scenes were only part of my frustrations. It was Von Trier's confusing use of cuts, without any clues to the amount of time that has passed between shots, that drew attention away from the character and the story and forced viewers to spend too much time concentrating simply on understanding the events that are taking place. The film's message would be better served by subscribing to a few of the covenants of film-making that make it easier for viewers to understand what is happening, thereby allowing them to spend more time thinking about the characters, the story, and the ideas that the film is dealing with.Instead, the first hour of the film comes across like a random sampling of home-video clips. A second matter of personal opinion that prevented me from being able to connect with the film was Von Trier's refusal to explain selma's violent act in the film's climax. Violence, in any form, was so foreign to this character that I found myself unable to believe the scene I was watching. Seemingly out-of-character actions allow my disbelief to come crashing down and serve to disconnect viewers from the film and its message. The subsequent courtroom scenes also lacked the realism I required to buy-into the emotion. All along, it pained me to see how utterly simple it would be for Selma to change her miserable situation. My final complaint concerns the length of the film. As a huge fan of long movies, this is one of the few times I truly yearned for a film to end. All the short scenes of nothingness injected by Von Trier, combined with Bjork's beautiful (but often drawn-out) musical interludes, added up to a film that was much longer than the story demanded (almost 2 and a half hours). In viewing the film, it was clear that Von Trier has chosen to rebel against the trite, emotion-packed scenes we see so often today where you can see all that a character stands for in a violin-accompanied close-up on a teary eye. Unfortunately, he has replaced these scenes with slow-moving collections of shots that often fail to convey anything. As for the lengthy music scenes, after 5 minutes of song and dance, any continuation of these sections were simply for aesthetics' sake, which is something that Von Trier strives to avoid. By the end of the film, when the musical piece is most poignant and most important to the story, I was almost dreading another 10-minute tune. `Dancer in the Dark' and Dogme95: When I first became aware of Lars Von Trier's `Dogme 95', I appreciated the idea. I assumed the point was to remove the focus of film-making away from the visual aesthetics and towards the message or issues of the story. With Dancer in the Dark however, Von Trier has not accomplished this goal. His style of film-making detracts from the clarity of the story and thus, detracts from its message.With so many films like The Matrix where the story and the message take a back seat to the visual effects, I applaud anyone who strives to focus on real-life stories in a true-to life shooting style. Part of what makes the art of film so wonderful is that we can experience it and connect with it in much the same way we experience life. The reason why so many of us were excited about Dogme 95 is because the majority of films today have strayed from presenting their stories in a way that is consistent with the way our eyes and ears interact with the real world. Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg outlined a film-making style that abandoned the `ego' of focusing less on the story itself than on the style of telling the story. In real life, I don't pan out on a scene, flying up into the sky on a crane or a helicopter to the tune of violins. In real life, time doesn't freeze someone in a mid-air karate kick while I circle around them to a hip techno beat. Dogme95 is their attempt to bring film back to the basics of story-telling; their way of `keeping it real.' Unfortunately, in rejecting these approaches, Lars' seems to have adopted a style that is no more true to life. In real life, my eyes aren't shaking around vigorously, shoved in Bjork's face for an extreme close-up. In real life I don't black-out for undisclosed amounts of time, then awaken for a brief look that lasts just long enough for me to discover where I am. I suppose you could say the same for any film. My point though, is that this film seemed to continually slap me in the face with the reminder, `it's just a movie.' I feel bad criticizing a truly unique and gutsy film with such high ambitions, such great acting (Bjork clearly deserved Cannes' "best actress" award), and such a beautiful story. But I feel that Von Trier has allowed his ego and his rejection of modern film-making conventions to get in the way of the very thing he is trying to accomplish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary BUT... [Spoiler alert, also for Breaking the Waves and Europa]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a unique and extraordinary film, which left me with one overriding thought: what the hell goes on in Lars von Trier's head?? I've seen 4 of his films, and in three of them (this one, Breaking the Waves and Europa) an innocent woman dies a horrible death, while in The Idiots an innocent woman seems to suffer more than any other character. Yes, this is a man who enjoys depicting female suffering and abasement!The similarities between Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark are more prominent than simply that, as several other people have already commented. In Breaking the Waves Emily Watson's character is driven to the very depths of depravity, her suffering clearly having an allegorical interpretation. Yet at the end, rather than feeling it was redemptive, I thought von Trier was laughing at us! And now, he's repeated more or less the same trick, in a different setting. I kept feeling throughout the film that we'd been here before, and I wish he'd put a different record on.Still, I did say it was extraordinary, and it is. The song and dance routines are fantastic (in both senses of the word), and the songs themselves are magnificent; Bjork's performance is a marvel of naturalism: apart from one or two early scenes, I didn't think she was wooden. I thought some of the supporting performances were great: unlike some, I didn't have a problem accepting Catherine Deneuve as a factory worker, and her acting was very moving; Peter Stormare was terrific (especially after Fargo!); and the woman who played the prison warder was for me the best of the lot.So, recommended with reservations, though if you haven't seen Breaking the Waves and I haven't ruined the ending for you, do see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier's "Breaking the Waves" is perhaps the only movie to have ever brought me to tears in a sequence which lasts barely a minute. When I heard his next movie was to be a musical, I was overjoyed beyond words, and "Dancer in the Dark" is no disappointment. It is everything "Breaking the Waves" was, and more, and more powerful.Of the little I have seen of Von Trier's work, I've come to understood he works in very sharp contrasts. He will have joy one second which all too quickly becomes despair. What better way of visualising this than with big Hollywood musical numbers punctuated with harsh, dull, shaky handheld footage?The story is similar to "Breaking the Waves" - Bjork's character Selma is slowly going blind, meaning she will lose her job as a factory worker, which she is doing overtime to earn money for an operation for a son so that his eyes do not suffer the same fate. As she earns almost enough to pay, the money is stolen by a greedy neighbour cop who is having money troubles. Things go wrong, and he ends up dead, and Selma goes to jail to await death by hanging. She dies, like Bess in "Breaking the Waves", because she is 'good'.Yes, the ending is as bad as everyone says. If there is a cinema in the world where there was not the utmost silence before the credits rolled, well I'd be ashamed to be in it. There's no tears for this movie, just pure dispair, a feeling of being let down, but as the final title says "This isn't the last song unless we let it be." It's a small consolation, but what this movie is trying to say is, this is bad, but we only lose if we let it get to us. The songs in this movie will continue to come back in your head, so perhaps Von Trier succeeded in creating a tragic movie that will not go down. It's another masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspired and deeply, deeply moving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is quite possibly one of the ballsiest and bravest film directors on the planet. I had pretty much written him off after "Europa" as all style and no heart. Then I saw "Breaking The Waves" nearly ten years later; a film which emotionally pretty much knocked me into the following week. That film is still my personal choice for the best film of the 1990's. I know, big call, but I'm making it. Which brings us to "Dancer in the Dark". I was lucky to see this on my final day in London about two weeks ago while I was on holiday. It doesn't start in Asutralia for another five months. "Dancer" proves that "Breaking The Waves" was no fluke. Like that film, "Dancer" encompasses so many themes and issues about what it is to be human that are forever compelling and timeless; namely, the way that music can be such an incredible force in one's life; the bond between parent and child and the issue of the death penalty. Some people have accused this film of being cliched; far from it. The film possessed a remarkably fresh and haunting perspective towards said issues. I said to a friend about "Breaking The Waves" that the film would have only have been half of what it was without the performances of Emily Watson and Stellan Skaarsgaard. So it is with "Dancer". Bjork was a truly inspired choice on Von Trier's behalf and it is a shame that she has said that she'll never act again. She was truly heartbreaking; absolutely shattering as Selma. The musical numbers in the film were totally in context. This story is very much from Selma's eyes and her point of view, so they are very much part of her character. The moment where she starts to sing "My Favourite Things" for the second time in the film, for me, totally crystallised what had gone before. It is, without a doubt, one of the most deeply moving moments I have seen in a movie for an incredibly long time. The supporting actors were very much up to the standard that Bjork set. I was particularly impressed with both Udo Kier and Peter Stomare being cast totally against type; Stomare in particular was a beautiful performance. His scenes with Selma were some of the best in the film. What can I say? This barely eclipses "Magnolia" as my personal choice for best film of the year. I cannot recommend this film highly enough if you want to see something that will make you think and totally pierce your heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story grabbed me, and as I listen to the music almost 7 or 8 times a day, the images of Selma and her saga stay with me. The best part of the movie for me was the escape through the musical numbers. The story had some parts that I couldn't bring myself to believe, but overall I was glad to be moved and taken away by Bjork's brilliance onscreen and in her music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dancer In The Dark, winner of awards and loved by many critics is the single most biggest pile of rubbish that I've had the misfortune to see at the cinema. It really is bad. Hideously acted with all predictable plot lines. As much as I love Björk's singing voice the singy-dancy bits didn't seem to work for me. (and by Christ, if you don't like her singing then don't go anywhere near this film!)There's no need to make a song and dance about it (and don't do it again missy!)

In the end you don't know if you're supposed to cry or feel happy. It was the first film ever that I've stayed in my seat when the movie ends. It totally stopped me. Especially the end is contradictive when she starts to sing so beautifully that you don't think anything bad can happen and the thing that happens next makes your heart jump to your throat. The movie is so sad, beautiful and pure that I don't know what to think of it. I totally recommend this. This is the kind of movie you have to see even once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark is by far the best film I've seen in a few years. The film as a whole is absolutely flawless. Bjork is so unbelievable as Selma, a tragically manipulated and tormented dreamer. Not only was the film unnervingly riveting, perfect in every detail, but surprisingly entertaining. The plot never stops twisting and pushing forward, and the musical numbers are pure escapist fun. This film is so important because it taps into the theme that those who do good in today's society are often screwed by the system and in this case...well, I won't give away the ending, but it is heartwrenching. I can't think of a film that has had such a great impact on me since 1995's Dead Man Walking. YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark is a stirring if not perfect tribute to classical hollywood musicals. An ironic notion given Von Trier's modes and practices highly dictated by the treatise of dogma 95 are highly anti-hollywood. This dialectical relationship plays out very well in the film and results in a product that is engaging and in a sense a revolt. While it is easy to see why some might find it contrived or revolting, even they must applaud the performances and the gripping nature of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark moved me deeply. It's a tragic story with very few uplifting moments during the "normal" film. But then the musical begins inside Selma's head and everything becomes full of color and dancing. These beautiful songs, written and performed to perfection by Björk, are the moments where your heart is allowed to relax during this terrible story. Especially the song at the factory where the machines makes the rhythm of the music and the train song filmed with a hundred cameras all over the place are breathtaking.I also really enjoyed that Selma is rehearsing for the part as Maria in the musical The Sound of Music. This is one of the most happy musicals of all time - and also one of the best. But it almost broke my heart when Selma is trying to cheer herself up by singing "These are a few of my favorite things" at the time when she is in the greatest despair, with tears running down her cheeks almost not able to sing the next word. At that time the tears was also running down my cheeks. Because how can it be possible to turn this cheerful song into one of the most heartbreaking moment of any movie I have ever seen?Only a director like Lars von Trier would be able to pull a stunt like that. Just the idea of making a sad musical today is fantastic. But to persuade Björk to both write and compose the music, play Selma and perform the music in the film is fantastic. It has not been easy to make this film. we have heard about all the trouble between Björk and Lars. However, when you see the film you understand why. Björk is not acting the part of Selma - she is Selma. For an inexperienced actress that must have been very hard, and no wonder if she had some very rough times during filming. She did it beautiful, and deserved the prize for best actress at Cannes, as Lars deserved the Golden Palms. Who other than him, would dare to let the movie begin with five minutes of blank screen with nothing but music before the title comes on the screen?It is truly one of the great film which you will either love or hate, but you can't sit through it without getting affected one way or the other. That is a quality in itself. (10 out of 10)."In a musical nothing dreadful ever happens" Selma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! A powerhouse of psychological torment. (Contains one non-specific spoiler.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier's new film begins with a Rorshach-like ink-blot test image that evolves into many things and nothing -- at the same time. It is a unique cinematic moment, one that lingers for several unsettling minutes.The remainder of the film is as powerful, hypnotic and ironic as the image which precedes the two-plus hours of drama and musical."Dancer In The Dark" follows Selma (Bjork -- in her feature film acting debut), a musical dancer whose eye-blindness is worsening by the day. Her slow descent into visual darkness is accompanied by a slide into the enveloping moral darkness of the all-sighted people around her.Selma can see the world beyond her and around her, but cannot see the world right before her -- in both an optical and symbolic sense. She is trapped, confined by the contradictions of those who seek her solace and comfort. She is manipulated and framed by someone she confides in. When the moment arrives Selma is so loyal to a fault to this particular person that she risks her future in order to stay true to herself. What keeps Selma going is her desire to see life in refreshing, vibrant colors -- in other words, via the rose-colored lenses of the idealistic world that she believes exists. The musical aspect of "Dancer In The Dark" comes on slowly but is rich and alive -- in sharper focus and clarity than the heretofore Dogma95 von Trier trademarks: the drab color, natural light and high-speed edits and camera movement which compose much of this film. Selma could be living in the musical world and dreaming in the drab, reality world she is caught in. Or it could be the other way round. The musical world represents a naivete, a fantasy, an innocence and purity through which Selma lives out her fantasies and desires. She dances in the mind, in the heart and most of all, in the dark. Aspects of this drama/musical are disturbing, not just because of Selma's circumstances, but because she has a pure heart and trustworthy soul, a soul whose foundation is battered but not defeated. Her son, who also has problems seeing things clearly, proves to be the treasured being whom Selma works so hard for. Selma shields her son from the harshness and indignitiesof the real world and what she does for him is done in the hope that he can see the same world she sees through even clearer "eyes" than her own.The film's visual style is arresting and like all Dogma95 films -- disjointed, full of random imagery. The editing style is effective, adding atmosphere and an authentic feel to the characters. There are two memorable sequences in "Dancer In The Dark," one which follows the film's critical event. The balletic camera work and characters' choreography in thisparticular sequence has as much to do with the strength of Selma's vision and her fairytale notions about the world's machinations as the images themselves do. Lars von Trier's film parallels several moments in the 1999 film "The Green Mile" and it is interesting to note that actor David Morse plays as prominent a role in "Dancer" as he did in "Mile", though certainly for different reasons. Catherine Deneuve gives von Trier's film great weight and dignity in her role as Kathy, a character who believes she has Selma's best interests at heart. Joel Grey has an impacting cameo in a pivotal scene, while Peter Stormare is endearing as Jeff, a "Sling Blade"-type guardian angel who wants to make Selma happier than she insists she is.Stellan Skarsgaard makes a cameo appearance as a doctor. Most of all though, it is Bjork, who shines with an acting depth that deservedly won her Best Actress honors at the Cannes Film Festival last May. Bjork should be seriously considered for an Oscar nomination in 2001. The Icelandic pop sensation is central to scenes resembling the visual creativity she brings to her own music videos. Bjork also wrote the songs and musical score for "Dancer In The Dark," a film that intrigues, moves, disturbs and impacts in many other emotional and psychological ways.</fullReview>

The sad thing is that the academy won't notice her brilliance. They never award the right people. (Lost all faith in them after the Titanic disaster)The only problem I had with the film is the courtroom scenes. They just seemed a bit too focused on making the American justice system look like a joke.

Von Trier is at it again, pushing the envelope of traditional filmmaking with his cinema verite style and gut-wrenching dramatic scenarios. However, this time he goes one further.This is a musical. And while it functions well on that level alone, it also serves as both homage and criticism of the musical genre made famous by Hollywood.Performances by Catherine Deneuve, David Morse and Peter Stormare are excellent.

		<fullReview>Von Trier has made it again!Dancer in the dark is Breaking the waves, but cut down to the bare essentials and wrapped in a musical package. The story is an over-simplified melodrama, like an opera or a musical, which is expressing the different features of the christian Passion Play. It is however more of "filmed theater" than a "film" and dancer in the dark performs a breathtaking walk on the tight-rope between true emotions and pathetic melodrama, but most of the time manages to keep the balance. This is very much thanks to Björk's impressive acting. The singing parts are good and actually connects the different parts of the film in a clever way. Dancer in the dark is far from excellent but definitely a unique cineasticque experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has polarized more people than any other film I know. In the UK it has had universally bad reviews even from the "high brow" critics, so I went to see it with trepidation.First off let me say that I am a big fan of Dogme although I'm not overwhelmed by Von Trier (I rated "Festen" in my top 10 (maybe 5) of all time). The film starts in typical Dogme fashion, hand held camera, grainy video, poor editing etc - no surprises there!Where Dancer is different is with Bjork. For the first 45 minutes I was convinced this girl couldn't act and I mean really couldn't act. "Wooden" couldn't begin to describe her performance (Terence Stamp and Charlton Heston have nothing on Bjork during the early part of the film). Moreover, she drifts in and out of this Cockney accent which is unsettling to say the least.The watershed for me was the first musical number set in the factory (albeit after a few false starts). By using everyday sounds as a rhythm (the click of a factory tool, a train crossing some points, etc) both Bjork and the film comes alive and seems to find its context. I've never heard her music beyond a few minutes of MTV but it is suitably haunting and sits within the film brilliantly.The critics have complained about a number of things: Deneauve playing the world's most glamorous factory work, the late payment of the mortgage defence, etc but these are details and detract from a unique film.I won't say anymore except to say that Bjork's performance should be looked as a once in a lifetime opportunity. It's not hard to see why she had a nervous breakdown during filming or why she said she will never act in a film again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rarity these days, an ORIGINAL movie musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking one of the lost genres of cinema, the movie musical, and filming it with the new technology of digital video, Lars Von Trier, and the galvanizing Bjork (mark my words, as I write this on Sept. 12th, that Bjork will get an Oscar nomination, if not win Best Actress, in March 2001) create a film that reduced a jaded NY audience of indie film people to stunned silence when we left an early screening of it. Maybe some of them disliked it, as that seemed to be the case at Cannes a few months earlier for its world premiere. But this film makes me say something that I rarely say to any film not yet on video...I just can't wait to see it again. It's not perfect (too much shaky hand-held camerawork, the young boy not onscreen in the important final scenes) but what it does get right, are original, and i mean ORIGINAL musical segments, reminding me of "Pennies From Heaven", where a sad soul imagines themselves in Movie Musical Land. With the hundreds of video cameras set up at various angles, and the songs written and sung by Bjork in her own unique fashion, and the lush colors standing out from the washed-out colors of the non-musical story, I know I was seeing rare movie art, in the best sense of the word. To have musical sequences, as we start cinema's second century, shot with brand new technology, is to me a very good sign that the musical can live again. Not since "West Side Story" has a film musical made me speechless, and not since, not a surprise, "Breaking The Waves" has a story moved me so much in its final moments. Lars Von Trier, Bjork, and the excellent supporting cast have created a new classic. To those who scoff at this film, well, keep dancing in your own darkness. I'm not saying you're wrong, just that I feel sorry for those who won't let the music and the rhythm move them as they do for Selma in this story. You see these sequences as folly, the delusions of a simpleton. (As one of the characters says to her, dismissing the "stupidity" of people suddenly singing and dancing.) I see the musical moments as imagined here as the highest a soul can dare to dream. If it ends in tragedy, then at least it wasn't a wasted life.</fullReview>

Most of the songs sound too similar to each other (except for the last song which is done a cappella)and all of the songs are sung by the same character (Björk, of course), except for a couple of lines by other people.Secondly, Peter Stormare is not a singer.And why did Björk's character have a distinct British accent, when she is a Czech immigrant living in the U.S.?I'm a big fan of Lars von Trier, Björk and Peter Stormare but this film is so far off the mark it's ridiculous.What a bomb compared to "Breaking the waves".Oh, and one last thing. The guy who shot with the handheld camera...was he trying to show us what it would be like to see the world through Selma's eyes, since every single movement of the camera turned everything into an unfocused blurry mess (see for example the scene in the court)?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At Cannes, some said that Dancer in the Dark was perhaps the most emotionally devastating film they had ever experienced, while Variety, in an instantly famous hate-opus, and others called it `auteurist self-importance that's artistically bankrupt on almost every level.' My reaction fell somewhere between the two, seriously underwhelmed yet not seriously offended. Shot on video, the movie looks crummy and amateurish, like a film school remake of von Trier's 1996 legitimate masterpiece Breaking the Waves. Playing a blind factor worker in love with Hollowood musicals, pop star Bjork is satisfactory, though it is disconcerting to hear her repeat `I'm from Czechoslovakia' over and over in her broken Icelandic accent. Supporting actors Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, and Peter Stormare are all negligible.The movie's main problem lies in its awful musical set-pieces, all of which are technically inextricable and thematically worthless--instead of recreating the Hollywood musical numbers that his heroine fantasizes about, von Trier indulges himself, attempting to reinvent the genre and even going so far as employing an obnoxious 100 digital video cameras for a single scene. (Advocates of the movie give him great credit for this.)Von Trier's winning of the coveted Palme d'Or at Cannes was easy to call. All the chips were in place: it was his sixth time at Cannes, having come close but never won (and having been quite verbal about losing, even cursing jury president Roman Polanski in 1991 and throwing his token technical award in the garbage); the tragic heroine angle was right up Jury President Luc Besson's alley--von Trier has admitted the influence of Joan of Arc and on his work, and Besson is obviously no stranger, his screen biography The Messenger having been an epic flop the following fall; and most interestingly, the choice is history making, being the first digital video (albeit not a Dogma) to be awarded the Palme d'Or.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but OH GOD THE PLOT HOLES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay is not a good word to describe this movie. It is not bland or mediocre; rather it dips into both Oscar and Razzy territory... a lot. Lets start off with the positives:Interesting camera style, which at first feels artsy-fartsy, but works surprisingly well (except for in above shots), and immerses you into this world as if you were an unnamed characterAMAZING acting from all of the supporting cast. Bjork's performance was inconsistent (I'll talk about that later), but everyone else in this film was very, very good I can actually follow what's going on! While I love movies like 2001 (very few artsy movies are actually good, but some are), they can be very, very, VERY abstract (sort of their draw too, I guess), but this one was easily followable, without shoving everything in the audiences face. Now for the shitstorm:The plot holes and technical inconsistencies. Maybe you can chock this up to my CinemaSins nature, but I can't stand plot holes and inconsistencies, especially when they are obvious. And this one has a lot. For example, when Bill first shows off his gun, it is a revolver, and when we see it again in the film later, it is an M1911. While both would make sense for a police officer of the time (which Bill is), he is explicitly mentioned as having only 1 gun, his standard issue police firearm, which is also a major plot point of the film. There are also tons of inconsistencies (this is DEFINITELY NOT THE 1960s, despite the film claiming it as so), like the model of train and SEVERAL background issues. If you nitpick a lot, then this film will give you headaches and nightmaresThe writing. I may have said that the acting was superb, but the writing isn't. While the plot itself was very good, it was just handled very poorly. A good script has a plot that revolves around the characters, and fits with those characters. When a character does something in a good script, it feels like THAT CHARACTER performed said action out of a reason befitting of them (I.E. The joker's seemingly random actions in the Dark Knight fit with his character very well). These characters feel like they do thing for the convenience of the plot, which breaks the immersion set up with the great acting and camera style. Selma's stupidity. Okay, this one goes into the last issue I mentioned. Selma's IQ is very low (not saying Bjork's necessarily is, but Selma the character is about as bright as nylon is flammable). She is SO STUPID!! This is HIGHLY immersion breaking, and she is a disillusion and (unintentionally) irresponsible mother at best, and and a (this segment has been censored due to explicit use of profanity and offensive language. We apologize for the inconvenience, and will now resume the review. Thank you!) at worst. The verdict:Good acting and well-done camera angels lead to superb immersion. Songs that are varied in how good or bad they are. A terrible script that breaks most of the immersion set up by point one. Blatant inconsistencies that break the remainder of immersion left after number three. A lot of unbelievable circumstances that the plot forces these characters into against any sort of believablity. Final word: A motherload of potential, thanks to great acting and superb camera-work, wasted almost entirely by an atrocious script and so many plot holes that it puts the moon to shame. A good, but forgettable soundtrack to boot. Ultimately: wasted potential; this story needs to be revisited by a writer who knows what the hell he's doing. -5.5/10-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn You Von Trier.... Why Bjork WHY?!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The final in Lars Von Trier's "Golden Heart Trilogy", with hints of the Dogme 95 Manifesto. "Dancer in the Dark" was the first musical of the new millennium, that by the end becomes absolutely gut wrenching."The Golden Heart" trilogy in a nutshell involves the female protagonist to remain completely naive throughout the story, and virtually give all of herself up to and for the people she loves.Of course it was difficult to get two eccentrics such as Icelandic singer Bjork, and Danish provocateur Lars Von Trier, to work together completely (Search online for the stresses behind the scenes). Given the treatment of women from Trier's drastic career, "Dancer in the Dark" left me both confused and awed for the right and most definitely wrong reasons.Firstly the story is straight forward, simple and effective as with most of Von Trier's movies. People's motivations soon however change, ultimately for the sake of doing so to trap our protagonist in the most ludicrous of situations. Creating U-turns so sharp, they seem implausible and in these situations rightly so. Sadly our main character Selma (Bjork), is going blind and is trying to save her young son from this hereditary illness before the inevitable happens. To escape her dreary life she fantasises dancing in large Hollywood musical numbers, filmed with what was apparently a 100 camera rig setup (These sequences are very imaginative and superbly choreographed). Eventually the devastating absurdities of the narrative come to tear Selma's life apart, culminating in events that by the final act left me gob smacked and torn how to feel about any movie I've viewed in a long time.Originally brought in only to compose the music, for Bjork's starring role I'll sadly admit she isn't that good of an actress. She's a wonderfully talented musician, and I listen to her music frequently. But that is where I and many seem to agree, that her performance is something so much more different and unique (She definitely knows how to execute a dance number with finesse). French royalty Catherine Deneuve plays Selma's friend Kathy, who helps bring a sense of ground and reality to the situation. Other than that, a few of Trier's regulars help bring familiarity to the directors hand-held style of storytelling and rich sepia colours.Final Verdict: A twisted musical for the beginning of the new millennium. No matter the subject, Lars Von Trier continues to hold no bars. The soundtrack is very much Bjork's eccentricities, and her performance will carry you throughout most of the films many flaws and tribulations. Winner of the 2000 Cannes film festival's Palme d'Or and Best Actress Award. 7/10. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dancer in the Dark danced it's way into my heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen only two movies by the infamous Lars Von Trier and Dancer in the Dark is one of those earth-shattering movies(the other is Dogville).There's so much that will touch you in this movie and I can say that it is one of the only films that has made me cry. Bjork gives an outstanding performance as the main character, Selma, and she should have been nominated for an Oscar for her work.But the real key to the movie is Lars Von Trier's writing and directing. He weaves situations with such emotional intensity and leaves you questioning who, if anyone, does the right thing in so many of the scenes. The contrast between the shaky, grimly lit real world and the static, bright colored world of Selma's imagination where everybody dances and sings and "nothing dreadful ever happens" is simple, yes, but is extremely effective. And the final scene(spoiler) where Selma sings to the son that is not there but is hanged before she can finish is on the most effective and brutal that I've seen in recent cinematic memory.So many critics have said that they have problems with the plot, or that it is "implausible", even in the good reviews. But what so many of them can't see is that nearly all Musicals have implausible plots. So it's not the fact that the plot is implausible, it's that instead of the uplifting sort of implausibility that musicals often give you as an excuse to entertain you with colorful, fun songs for an hour and a half, Dancer in the Dark gives you a cold, raw implausibility. And implausibility might not even be the right word, because the things that happen in the plot themselves are not meant to be taken as realism, but rather the meaning about how humans bring despair and cruelty upon themselves is meant to show through. Perhaps those final themes themselves were too much for some people, and they acted like it was the supposedly unrealistic plot that they disliked instead of Dancer in the Dark's undoubtedly truthful messages.But regardless of all that, the film is no doubt fearless, and any film that has a director or writer or both who thinks up an interesting and experimental story they want to do and goes for it without compromise deserves some sort of merit in my book.Final rating: 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slow to get started, taking up a lot of time for character development, but before i knew it, i was completely sympathetic to Selma. She has few good, loyal friends, and the 'villain' is also a sympathetic character, not unreasonably evil but with motive enough for us to suspend disbelief a this actions. Selma is slowly going blind, and is a vulnerable character not only because of her hereditary disease, but because of her social vulnerability. She's very childish. The movie is a strange musical. Sound and Music are Selma's coping mechanism, and she floats between her reality and her musical persona. But the songs are not at the level of Bjorks talent and seem cursory and almost made up on the spot. but it's also realistic in its compositional simplicity. Rather than making her a musical genius, they show Selma as a normal musical enthusiast, with a strange voice and limited physical beauty.spoiler alert------------------------------------ When she was sitting in jail, the scenes are slow and realistic allowing us to really feel the pain that she is going through.

		<shortDescription>A punishing experience, but a master class in direction and performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark (2000) was director Lars von Trier's third film from his so-called "Golden Heart" trilogy; a triptych of films loosely inspired by the moral message of an Old Danish children's story. The story centres on a young and kind-hearted girl who enters the woods with only a small basket of supplies. As the story progresses, she meets various characters who each ask her to part with one possession, which she does, safe in the knowledge that they will benefit from the object far more than she ever could. Towards the end of the story, after having given away everything but the clothes off her back, she meets a young boy, naked and shivering. The young boy asks if she could lend him her clothes, which she does, only to then reveal himself to be a young prince, who whisks the girl off to his castle to be his princess for the rest of their lives. This message, that those who are selfless and are willing to sacrifice everything, seemingly without reward, had a profound effect on von Trier, who used the basic story to flesh out his critically acclaimed 1995 film, Breaking the Waves, as well his first film made in accordance with the Dogme 95 manifesto, his masterpiece The Idiots (1998).Like those films, Dancer in the Dark focuses on a naive and somewhat childlike woman, lost in a world she doesn't understand. If we compare it to the other two films in the series, then Dancer in the Dark probably seems like the least radical; almost recalling a straight Hollywood melodrama from the 1950's, which, I suppose, explains why von Trier decided to set the film in Washington State, 1964; bringing to mind the subversive aspect of all-American hospitality that would surface again in his following film, the controversial Dogville (2003). Within this framework, von Trier touches upon the notions of immigration, corruption, manipulation and exploitation; as Selma - a tragic heroine, who only wants to do the best for her young son - is ruthlessly used and abused by both the system and the state, as well as the people that she loved.In this respect, the film recalls the works of German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who also took on the various conventions of Hollywood melodrama and filtered them through a naturally European sensibility of irony and biting bitter cynicism, to create heartbreaking tragedies like The Merchant of Four Seasons (1972), Fox and his Friends (1976) and In A Year Of 13 Moons (1978). Von Trier's film is no less heartbreaking than those of Fassbinder, as he introduces us to a morally "good" character; in this instance, an immigrant factory worker who lives in a trailer owned by the town's sheriff and his gold-digging wife. Right from the start, von Trier is playing with the clichés familiar from Hollywood cinema of the film's particular era (1945-1965), giving Selma a son to look after and a handicap in the form a severely worsening eye-condition. It is this element of the story that gives the film its sense of direction, as we learn that if Selma doesn't manage to raise the required amount of money for her son to have an expensive operation, he too will develop the same ocular impairment as her.As is typical of von Trier's work, Dancer in the Dark rapidly spirals into the territory of abject misery, as characters make poor choices which inevitably leave them open to manipulation and exploitation from those around them. By the half-way point we start to get the feeling that thing's won't have a happy ending, but instead, will continue to plunge headlong into heartbreak and tragedy. It is at this point that von Trier introducing the musical element; breaking away from the muted colours and hand-held compositions of his cinéma-vérité-like plot-strands to give us a series of bold, colourful, beautifully composed musical numbers that attempt to externalise Selma's internal feelings of pain, doubt, anxiety and fear. Many will no doubt be put off by this odd combination of clichéd, soap-opera style melodrama with radical digital film-making; with von Trier's approach to the film fitting in with the style that he had been exploring since his legendary TV series The Kingdom (1994) and the aforementioned Breaking the Waves.Ultimately, Dancer in the Dark wins out for its sheer emotional power. The performance from Bjork, combined with von Trier's naked direction, is entirely raw and empathetic; finding pathos and warmth in this character that could have quite easily been shown up as a generic cliché. It is heartbreaking, with the honesty (or faux honesty as many detractors might see it) creating an overwhelming sensation that is further extended to von Trier's merciless direction, with that air of forced reality and his stark, Dreyer-like close ups that accentuate every emotion; and all backed by a string of excellent performances from the ensemble cast. By the end, you'll have already made up your mind as to whether or not the film justifies this approach, or whether it is instead somehow shallow and manipulative; as many of von Trier's harshest critics might suggest. For me however, Dancer in the Dark is a rare cinematic experience that places its emphasis on the emotional connection between director and star/character and audience, continuing von Trier's development as the greatest living filmmaker (besides Godard) and leaving us with this incredibly affecting, once in a life-time experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure not if everyone had a similar experience as I did watching this film, I was very inspired by the film and I reflected so deeply into what I did with my life.I am working for a non-profit organization in the California which were funded by the state government to take care of people who have developmental disabilities - mental retardation, autism disorder, etc. As part of the assessment process, I screen people for their eligibility for our services. Everyday, there are people just like Selma (who are obviously cognitive impaired) calling in for services. And I had just treated them like nobody - I thought I had good reasons, for they cannot understand you, and listen to you. This film has really inspired me to think beyond what I have been framing myself into.After seeing all the three films from Lars V-n Trier's Dogma 95, I am really astonished by the amount of deep understand Lars V-n Trier (somehow the v o n word is prohibited...) has with the disabled/ impaired people and bringing forth the unheard of in such a vivid, touching and professional film.I would strongly encourage anyone to see Lars V-n Trier's film, especially Dancer in the Dark.

		<shortDescription>Conclusively more realistic than the real life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can say with my all sincerity that 'Dancer in the Dark' is simply the best picture I've ever seen. The two-hour-long pathetic journey achieves to touch the deepest parts of the soul. The acts of the players, the dialogs and the genius camera-shots are all wonderful. The expression of the story is beyond reality. I can't understand how could a description-of-life become more actual than the life itself. I especially admire the marvelous performance of singer-Björk ,the leading-character. As acting introvert, innocent and amiable mother Selma, singer-Björk demonstrates us that she is extremely good at acting. With an ageless face and a tranquil mood daydreamer-Selma invites us her small world in the dark. Shy mother is ready to pay any cost for her son's good. Her passion to survive her son , surpasses her zeal to live. As being almost a blind Selma says "I just wanted to hold a little baby just in my arms" when she is asked "You knew he would have the same disease as you then why did you have him?". And at the finale her scream "I can't breathe" still resounds in my ears. This mournful masterpiece also was adorned with the songs of Björk that makes it a dramatic-musical even if musicals are generally funny. The song 'I have seen it all', that is performed by the accompaniment of the miners , should certainly be seen.The film captures you and the players' performances captivates you. When it ends it is normal to have teary eyes. You can be ensure that this movie converts the happiest day into a worst one. If you enjoy watching drama movies, I think 'Dancer in the Dark' is the best choice. Because it is astonishingly real and the roles are natural. Pain suits Björk's childish face perfectly. And there are beautiful songs of hers. Like a pause to breathe in a sea of elegy.Lars Von Trier, with the camera in his hands, presents to the world his best work.</fullReview>

Catherine Deneuve is wonderful as Selma's best friend, but comes across as a bit cold hearted at times which irritated me, but she is a wonderful actress and really consumed the role of Kathy. bjork should have won an Oscar for her performance, she was absolutely wonderful and Selma is in prison and singing into the ventilating duct was so emotional, and really plucks at the heart strings. IN conclusion i highly recommend this film to any one who likes a good drama that really makes you think and feel for the characters ( and anyone who has a crush on Bjork)</fullReview>

You end up so aware of the style, which is pretending to be naturalistic that it stops you getting into the movie.However said this, this simple movie about a immigrant mother going blind but working hard to save enough money for her son's own eye operation is brilliantly acted and certainly can be described as interesting.Yes, it is art house, and that means it is not made for everyone and going to see it will be a risk. Even though I think the direction spoiled much of the effect and the acting was sometimes great (especially Bjork) and sometimes mediocre, the over all effect is powerful.Did I mention that every know and them people burst out in song. Hmmm...a dogma musical? Once again, this sometimes work and sometimes is just stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really heartfelt film. It touched me deeply.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selma(Bjork) is a Czechoslovakian immigrant who comes to America hoping it will be like one of the beautiful musicals that she loves so much. It is to her. Even under the more dire circumstances, she still feels more free in her own little musical universe while in the US. Unfortunitely, she won't be able to hold on to her dreams of being in a musical much longer because she is going blind. Her blindness is caused by a hereditary disease that her own innocent son will have to endure. It is too late for her, but she has been saving up money in her own special little money box for an eye operation that will be just for her son. This way, he will be able to see what he wants to see when he grows up. She works in a factory for low income and has been saving it up for a very long time. Unfortunitely, the racism and greed of who she thought were her friends cause a hamper of her plans when her money for the operation is stolen by a neighbor. And what follows is an unending torture of psychological pain and agony and murder, all leading up to a deeply disturbing and grotesque finale that affects the hearts of even the most jaded film goers. To employ the idea of Selma's world being dark and sad, we as viewers are treated to two different film styles. The first is the Danish DOGMA 95' technique, which gives viewers more of a sense of realism that most films don't share. The style affects the film by giving it a much darker feel and oner so close to the world we live in that we feel the same pain as Selma and believe in the worlds that she creates with her mind and soul. The second is used much more sparsely, but the effects of it are undeniable. When Selma goes into her song and dance routines, the filter changes and gives us the same world, but much more colorful and beautiful. With this, we can share a sense of joy and feeling with Selma as she goes about her world where no pain and sorrow and misery can possibly ever happen, to us or to her. We have more of a sense of why she wants to be there by the fact that we become way too familiar with the real world and grow curious and anxious to see what kinds of things could happen the next time she goes there. It is truly awkward when we first go into her world, but when it ends, the viewer feels that Selma has made an accomplishment in herself. And Bjork!!! Perfect for the part. She was born for the role. Her looks and her voice are spot on for this type of role as Selma. Her voice employs so much curiosity and hope for the future. It all works. This film was directed by Lars Von Trier, the director of the very effective BREAKING THE WAVES, and the very creepy DOGVILLE. He has truly created a masterpiece that all should see, simply for the unique style and sense of morales. DANCER IN THE DARK is a truly tragic film that will affect many. the ending is one of the most heart breaking endings ever filmed and nobody will forget it.</fullReview>

The camera and cut supports this in long scenes without cuts based generally on dialogs, that makes you have that feeling that you are watching a document much rather than a film. There are no blasting special effects, the base story is presented in raw, even naturalistic way, which is time-by-time eased by Selma's musical dreams. Also the soundtrack is worth to listen. Most of it are naturally Björk's songs with great lyrics, full of emotions, just like the film. You'd really would have to have hippo skin not to be moved by the film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but mostly failed experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that at present I've only seen one other Von Trier Movie, "Dogville", and I quite liked that one. I can also in general live with depressing and disturbing movies. That is, unless they're depressing simply for the sake of it.This seems to be the case with "Dancer in the Dark". It's one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen, yet it mostly just failed to touch me. Throughout watching it, I couldn't help but feel that Von Trier was going to great lengths just to make everything as hopeless and bleak as possible just for the sake of it: the main character (played by Icelandic musical prodigy Bjork) is already getting blind, subsequently gets fired from her boring job, after which her life savings are stolen, and finally she inexplicably murders somebody, setting in motion a set of even more unbelievable events. None of what happens makes an awful lot of sense, with the the key scene in which she commits the murder being the most unconvincing of all.To a certain extent I can live with this since the movie has a slightly surreal tone and can, in fact, be considered as a fairy tale, but for the most part I felt I was just being manipulated into feeling something instead of being genuinely touched.I did think that is was a nice touch to include some musical numbers in the movie. The main character envisions her life as a musical, which leads to spontaneous outbursts of singing and dancing that occur at the strangest times. It's a cute idea, and I have to say that the musical numbers are nicely choreographed and fairly creative. It's a shame though that none of the songs is particularly noteworthy. The fact that some of the characters are obviously lip-synching doesn't help matters either.Technically speaking, I also found the movie rather poor. It is filmed entirely using hand-held cameras, which supposedly should make it look more natural, but ends up having the opposite effect. Very often, "Dancer in the Dark" looks very much like an amateur play, which is probably not how the director intended it. I've seen another Dogma-movie, "Festen", which did look very natural, so I'm not really sure what went wrong here, but that it went wrong is without a question.The fact that Bjork plays the lead character doesn't really help either. I think she's a very talented singer, but as an actress she's mostly fairly silly. The rest of the cast consists of some very talented actors like David Morse and Catherine Deneuve, who both do a good job, but on the whole the acting is not really that great.In the end, "Dancer in the Dark" comes across as something of a failed experiment. Von Trier tried something very different and mostly failed to make a good movie out of it. The plot is gravely depressing, but it seems to be put together only to throw as much sorrow at the audience as possible, without much cohesion or message. For some people that may work, but for me it very obviously didn't. The musical numbers are cute, but ultimately not that remarkable either. And Bjork's acting debut is also not really something to write home about.**1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

Her performance of Selma WILL drive you to tears. Though, I didn't cry all the last 30 minutes like with The Green Mile, this movie has bigger impact, since made me melancholic, almost depressive for the following day (!) Really, watch this movie. Even if you don't like Bjork, you'll just have to admit she's at least a wonderful actress.

She did sung just a song in 8 Woman and did a recording with music and lyrics by Serge Gainsbourg. And since I need to add a couple of lines to make 10 of them, I shall say Ms. Licari is quite a star in France and, oddly, in Asia.

		<fullReview>This film was an extreme experience for me; I went through so many emotions while watching it. I found myself at times quite angry at the main character (Selma) and then other times a genuine sympathy for her. She was child-like in her appearance and demeanor, which clearly evoked her somewhat naive outlook with people and life in general. We see her escapism from the mundane as song and dance sequences in the film to why I see her as a young child. The actress (Bjork) starring as the main character was without a doubt superb, you have to hand it to Lars Von Trier for extracting the best out of his actresses. He did the same with Nicole Kidman in 'Dogville' one of her best performances in my opinion."Dancer In The Dark" doesn't pretend to gloss over the reality of life; you can see it from the second the film commences. Trier gives his films a sort of surreal feel to them; somehow he places the audience as spectators peering in a window watching a glimpse of someone's life. He has the ability to tell a story visually, and with the talented casts he manages to accomplish this with astounding success. No wonder people are talking about him, I think he's a force to be reckoned with and as time pasts this will be affirmed by his directional talent and future films Most people like to feel emotion while watching a film and also to be able to relate to the characters. I think this element the director encompasses is what makes his films stand out. I'm sure it will leave an impression long after you've watched it. 8/10</fullReview>

The end result is just lame: unrealistic/ bad script, weak acting, largely unchoreographed musical scenes, mediocre direction, too much melodrama, and no philosophical premise to justify the proceedings.The fact that this film won the Palm d'Or at the Cannes festival is enough to never trust a professional critic again. The absurd and clinical interplay between the real and musical-fantasy scenes, the moral question of whether it's justifiable to have children, and the brutal ending sequence are the only redeeming features. Von Trier, capable for the best ("Europa", "The Idiots") and for the worst ("Kingdom 2", "Dancer In The Dark"), should learn to temper his artistic impulses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big strong man, and I boohooed like a baby. Bjork is a very good actress, as well as talented with her chords. Cant give it a 10 for the following reasons: seems like there could have been another ending here, another choice for Selma to make--realistically speaking. The choreography was a bit rough (for a musical) and the male singers were not as talented as the singers on the CD. While I am left in tears by the emotion of the movie, is this what I want in a film? Was the aim to shock us and make us mad? Why am I mad? Why did it have to end this way? I look for understanding of the material as well as entertainment in the plot, when I see a movie; this movie delivered a better appreciation for Bjork (who I knew nothing about, until I heard the Selmasongs--I love Orchestrated Songs), but thats it. While I am not for Hollywood endings, this ending is overly disturbing, and may have been better served with a Hollywood finish. Dancer tears at me, whenever I see Bjork's picture, when I see the title of the movie on paper or online, and definitely when I listen to the Selmasongs. I love the CD, but I enjoyed it more before I saw the movie. The 8 is for Bjorks performance! Outstanding--who was better that year? The story is incredible, but after the death of the cop, you can see the plot falling into an emotional abyss that takes everyone down with it. The horrific ending sticks with me and I don't think I will ever forget this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor logic, bad actors, very surreal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose this is not a bad performance for Bjork's first movie. But it is a stupendously stupid movie because it takes turns that clearly go against anyone's common sense. Very, very predictable and anti-climactic. I had to force myself to sit through this. This was like a bad dress rehearsal or something. These are the worst actors in the history of the world!!! They are like zombies! They would have been great extras in the Night of the Living Dead! Where did they get these people? This movie is like living in a parallel universe where no one knows how to express themselves and everyone in the town kisses Bjork's ass for some unknown reason. It's like the actors were looking to Bjork to carry this whole movie. I think everyone was on LSD when they made this movie, it gets extremely surreal as it progresses yet the characters' lives stay consciously sober. It was like the Rocky Horror Picture Show. There is an extremely huge amount of editing in this movie. It's like the actors couldn't get through their lines or something. Bjork does somewhat of a poor job acting blind. No one in the movie can pick up that Bjork is going blind even though she doesn't know where anyone is!!! In the first five minutes her theatre coach says to someone, "her singing is a little funny". Some total retard stalks her every day after work and asks if she wants a ride home, it's plainly obvious that there's only one thing that he wants but Bjork seems like he's just being polite. (He later takes part in one of the songs and can't hold a tune to save his life). The singing is dubbed and some of the lip-synching is real bad. When she found out her life savings had been stolen out of her house she showed no emotion. I didn't understand the trial because she could have easily told the truth and been vindicated but she chose to lie for some reason which was never disclosed. The director changes film (a more colorful film) during all of the song sequences which I thought was neat. The song lyrics are almost unintelligible and the songs bordered on moronic. It was like The Sound of Music meets The Ford Motor Company. One song and dance takes place inside the tool factory where Bjork works. Another takes place on a freight train (she is walking home along the train tracks) and she and a bunch of carpenters and lumberjacks sing and dance and do twirls on one of the train flatbeds and she sings a song about "I've already seen everything, what's more left to see?" Some of the dialogue was sung which was extremely laughable. The strangest part of the movie had to be when she started singing a duet with a bloody corpse whom she had just bludgeoned to death and he picks up a paint brush and starts painting the kitchen. He got up and sang "Go before the police get here" and her son was outside singing "you did what you had to do". Strangest thing I have ever seen. She goes up to a pond and tries to dispose of her bloody sweater and a bloody satchel, it's so obvious that she misses the pond and the satchel gets thrown right into the grass leaving evidence (which is never found by anyone!) from the murder. Walking to her execution she breaks out into a cheery song with lyrics that count her steps down the hallway to the chamber. The last scene was an extreme tear-jerker. Bjork really acted like she was being executed, it was the most frightening thing I've seen. The last two songs are extremely beautiful-the one during the credits is the most beautiful song I think I ever heard (better than anything Celine Dion has ever done). They did Bjork wrong in this movie, the poor logic ruined this movie. In the end, I don't think less of Bjork. She's still fantastic in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think any comment would do this piece justice. The first time I saw it I fell in love with it, and having seen it many times since the feelings are the same. I don't want to "hype" this movie, because I hate when people do that. I think I can say that it is an extremely poignant portrayal of humanity. Raw and wondrous, the movie effectively captures the gamut of emotions that are the human experience (i know it sounds like total crap, but IT'S TRUE!!!) Add the haunting sounds that Bjork wrote for this movie, and from the first musical number on you're enchanted... These words won't mean much until you see the movie, so get out there and get it. I wasn't really aware of Bjork or Lars von Trier (the director) before this movie. Now i'm obsessed with the both of them! blah blah blah, praise praise praise, just check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infallible crying reaction on this work of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being at the theater surrounded by a hundred people crying at once, during most of the movie. The guy next to me was crying his heart out, and so was I. Its inevitable. Its unbelievable. Its Amazing! I didn't liked musicals, so the only reason I went to watch this movie was for Björk, who Im a big fan of. As soon as the movie started, the incredibly talented Björk, suddenly became "Selma", and was no longer the famous musician, but a fragile blind and poor girl. As soon as you get used to the moving camera, and you get into the music, you get trapped in this incredible drama, connected to the feelings of the main character, Selma. Then you're there; you're inside the movie and there's no way out until its over. You dance with björk and then you cry as if you met Selma, as if she was your friend, your mom, your crush. You stop thinking in musicals as a ridiculous singing and dancing funny circus, and now you find the connection between everyday music in your life and your own matters and problems.Then You keep crying. Unless you're a completely unsensitive rock; a weird super macho stone; or you just don't pay a little attention to the film, you start crying and keep crying your heart out. And when you think you've cried enough, and that you're life may be miserable for a couple of days later... It ENDS, leaving a perfectly clear message that brings you hope and reflection. With this message on you, you can watch the credits and clean your face, soaked in tears. I remember going to the restroom after the movie, and being with all the men who saw it, old men, young men, grandpas, fathers and teenagers, all cleaning their throats and drying their faces, to return to the outside bright world. I've never seen such a strong reaction on most of the audience. But on the way home, you're happy.Outstanding performances by every single person involved in this movie. The best musical I ever seen, and one of the best Dramas. One of the best films I've seen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dancer In The DarkWow. I watched this breathtaking movie last night not expecting much and coming away riddled with emotion. It was one in the morning by the time it's 140minutes had finished and I was too tired to write but knew I simply had to capture something of how I felt before I fell into bed. This is what I wrote last night, 'I want to capture how I feel but I can't. It is insurmountable to describe the union with that character. The anaesthetising fear and uncontrollable emotion. Beyond any scope of understanding, but a precipice so vast that maybe there just had to be some reaction, some feeling. Because if there weren't, this immense event might go unnoticed. But it leaves the breath ripped out of my lungs and an overload of confusion and chaos. Far from dark nothings, flaming with burning colour, unsettling and nauseating. Devastating.'The film seemed strange and endearing to me for the first hour or so and I found myself getting frustrated with the filming and the sound quality though I think it helped me to feel through Selma and the way her world must have felt so disjointed and confusing. Amazingly, I didn't find the movie boring even though it was slow, I found it visually stunning and really intriguingly filmed. I found myself completely drawn in as it started to progress and suddenly everything exploded into an overload of emotion. I felt like I was being pushed to the back of the sofa with the energy and feeling coming from the actors, particularly Bjork (Selma). She was just amazing in the shooting scene and David Morse (Bill) was also wonderful. Their pain and angst was thrust into my own stomach and I felt their desperation and despair. Both people reacted in completely unexpected ways to the situation but I wasn't shocked or disbelieving, I felt I was living in their worlds and experiencing their lives and dramas. I felt completely physically gutted when Selma returned to find the money gone and I felt so much pain and anguish running through me as Bill begged to be killed and Selma fired shot after shot and, finally, her battering. I was cringing and shying away and also filled with complete compassion for both characters and their inevitable endings. Bill wanted to die because of what he'd done to Selma and because of his false premonition of his loneliness. He knew he'd done an evil thing and desperately wanted Selma to have the money back. I wonder whether his wife would really have left him or whether she truly loved him, as Selma tried to persuade him. Instead, his pride and insecurity required him to beg for his death because he could not give up the money. He was, in fact, trying to hold onto his emotional security and I pitied him so much for not realizing that he'd gotten it all wrong.All the way through the trial and when Selma was locked in her cell, I felt like my world was collapsing around me. I felt as though I couldn't breathe. I was her at that point. It was my legs that were refusing to carry me and it was my body uncontrollably spasming and my mind whirring with thoughts and my heart aching with love and loss. I found myself terrified of dying and of that final breath and violent fall. I couldn't believe what was happening and I couldn't comprehend the pain and fear I felt. I was confused at my feelings because I had hoped I was more impartial to death. Or, at least, felt I could cope and had little attachment to my life or the world, but when faced with the emotions and true feelings, I was terrified. And I can't work out what I was so wildly scared of. In fact, it worries me even more if I've become so attached to life that I feel a destroying passion to keep a hold of it.At the beginning of the film, I got a strong sense of Selma being very detatched and I spent a lot of the time wondering whether she was mentally or emotionally challenged in some way (that shows more than most people's emotional conflicts). I found her character quite simple and it felt like she didn't understand a lot of what was going on around her and was protected by many members of the town. It seemed a little too much to be wholly down to her ever diminishing eye-sight and more as though she were affected by Asperger Syndrome or something similar.The tag line for the movie is 'You don't need eyes to see' but I found this confusing as Selma was so desperate for her son to receive the operation, exclaiming, `No. He needs his eyes!' when Kathy states that 'He needs his mother'. For me, the tag line reflected the depth of feeling Selma was still entirely capable of without sight. But, I would have liked for her to have some realization of this too. This may well have been shown with her final song, `They think it's the last song, but they don't know us. It's only the last song if we let it be.' I couldn't help coming away still completely shocked by the enormity of what had just happened and, much as I wanted to believe that it wasn't 'the last song', there was an air of finality. The movie ended with me fearing the experience of that fear of violence and death and disappointed that maybe I'm not stronger or deeper after all.As I walked home, I felt gutted and distraught really. I felt profoundly affected and sad. It also made me recall a very different feeling two days ago on that very walk. A feeling of complete elatedness and joy and permanence. I thought I'd found the everlasting part of me and of the world and I was buzzing with the beauty and excitement and pure, orgasmic love of the world and it's creations. I knew that that came from within me and felt that I could withstand any physical endurance because of this spark inside me. However, now, I'm not sure that it would get me through that march. Those trembling legs and pleading wails. It made me wonder, 'What is the difference between that orgasmic energy and this energy?' When I tried to deconstruct each, they actually both contain amazingly similar characteristics. Both energies feel like a rush of richness through my body. Both make me want to exclaim and open my body up to the world and say, 'hey!' But one is through pain, and the other through joy. Both feel alive and electric and both feel like they are running so very deep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I rarely HATE movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, bad movies don't really affect me. I watch them, regret the time I wasted on them, and move on. I never write reviews for them either. A month after seeing this movie, I'm still infuriated by it.There are many different sides to Dancer in the Dark, and the only good one I can think of is the quality of Bjork's acting, she hits all the notes correctly (innocence, childishness, slight stupidity) up until the end, when she overacts horribly.Other than that, there are a few ways to interpret this film:Propoganda - The America of this movie does not exist, and even when something resembling it did exist, this is a blatant caricature of that time. Lars von Trier has never been to this country, yet brings in silly cold war/communism references and makes it look like the place was designed to break fragile innocent immigrants with accents. I watched this movie with my mom, who escaped communist Russia in 85, when I was two years old. She told me that this movie reminded her of America as portrayed in anti-US russian propoganda films.An exercise in sadism - Why would the leading character, Selma, be as childish, naive, and dumb as she is? Coming from an immigrant background, I can guarantee that no one like her would have ever made it as far as the US. The unlikely heap of misfortune and cruelties that are inflicted on her only seem possible because she is so unrealistically unprepared for adult life. The movie creates the fragile and innocent (saint like?) Selma, just so it can shred her to pieces, over several hours, and make us watch. So this movie is guilty of two counts of sadism, one to Selma, and the other to the audience, this much pointless suffering without any kind of point whatsoever is sheer sadism. I would have walked out of this movie had I not been glued to my seat by my disgust.Inept filmmaking - The combination of unlikely plot, unlikely characters, and the silly (mis)use of the camera and non-existent lighting completely shatter the suspension of disbelief. With crappy tear-jerkers like Titanic, I was annoyed with myself for letting emotion be aroused in me by such dumb films. For this film however, the movie made you focus so much on it's own disjointed external qualities that you never even get sucked into the plot. Thus, the only feeling I had while watching this movie was a seething hatred for whoever was responsible for it. About halfway through, I was wishing Selma a quick death so we could all get out of here.Seeing people cry during/after this movie was the worst part about the whole thing; it indicated that Lars von Trier had succeeded in his little experiment, people sucked this junk down and felt exactly what he wanted them to feel, for no good reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, I like movies to entertain me. This film just depressed me. I have great respect for all the actors in this film. There is however a weak link, a huge weak link and his name is Lars Von Trier. Honestly, to me this film looked like it was shot by a real directors' trained monkey with a camcorder taking random shots of out-take scenes! Wobbly, with tops of heads and limbs missing. All reminiscent of 'Punch Drunk Love' a film I loathed. I thought wobbly camcorder was over after 'Blair Witch'. I'm sure Von Trier is capable of real cinematography, so this was sort of bad on purpose, and that's disturbing! The actors were good up to a point. What I thought was odd was Bjork, I mean she's a fantastic actress, great at playing the real emotional scenes. BUT she doesn't look East European, not like any Chec person I've ever met, and she has an Icelandic accent with a hint of London twang. I think she's a good singer/song-writer and actress, but she just seems mis-cast and unbelievable. The rest of the cast is good, it's just that the whole thing winds up as depressing as possible, as un-uplifting as you could ever imagine. If you don't like Bjork's music avoid this film, I like it, so this was what probably kept me from giving the movie a really low rating, also the music scenes were a lot better shot than the rest of the film. 2/10 for direction, 6/10for screenplay, 7/10 for acting, 7/10 for music, 5/10 overall</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is one of the great danes, he's one of the reasons I love movies. Dancer in the Dark is a great drama. It is a part of his trilogy of the women who makes sacrifies(The Idiots;Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark). I've seen parts of his earlier work, very dark and also with a common theme for the first three, but not as lovable. But ever since I saw The Kingdom, I've seen his genius.Dancer in the Dark is one of those films that hasn't got a large audience, it's the same audience as those who loved Breaking and many of the french movies, and that's probably why many dislike the movie so much. Because it's not a straight Hollywood style movie that has a happy ending or keeps a clean sharp picture to symbolize the straightness that Hollywood and most of the world holds so dear.lars Von Trier never appeals to the large audience, he just hopes that he gets a Golden Palm Award, for him thats enough, that means more and probably should do, because large gatherings of people share their taste and in Cannes it's not the majority like the Golden Globes and Oscar. And this Film is that kind of film, it's a heartbreaking story about a mom who'll sacrfice everything for his son, and as always Von Trier finds the right actors for the parts this is is talent, directing the right actors in his stories.*SPOILER* I must admit I cried in the end of the film, until the silence, that is the enemy in this movie, was replaced by the incredible voice of Bj?rk. And not many movie can stop a person from crying so sudden without telling a joke.A 9/10 this movie surely takes home from this film lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lars von Trying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let us now praise the virtues of Lars von Trier. He incites in his casts the most astonishing performances; and his editing is dazzling. The point here is not that the style, based on frequent cutting, is unusual; rather that the judgment he shows in splicing together fragments is awesome, and through this skill he is able to convey the most intense emotions from the most banal, everyday, unhyped dialogue. Such is the effect that all of von Trier's films seem to be set in a world of their own, somehow both grimly realistic and sprectrally haunting at the same time; true yet creations of genuine imagination. And the flaws of Lars von Trier? Well, there's his choice of subject material. Maybe it's only through pushing at his limits that he is able to reach such breathtaking heights. But sometimes he pushes far too far. His famous works are all really horror films: he imagines a worst case scenario, and turns this into the high point of the story. Sometimes the result is extraordinarily affecting; sometimes just unbearably harrowing; sometimes so damn mawkish that you feel your intelligence is being insulted; while sometimes one suspects that it's just a wry joke the director is playing, laughing at our inability to refuse to take him seriously.So, in Dancer in the Dark we have a poor blind single mother, whose son is also going blind... and that's just the premise. We also have a Dennis Potter-style musical, based around a typically offbeat collection of Bjork songs, but whose themes make Potter seem cheery in comparison. And it's very long. It's a difficult film, more over-the-top than Breaking the Waves, less self-consciously cool than The Idiots. But such is the quality of acting and editing, it's a film to remember when easier viewing has long since faded from the memory.Dancer is the Dark confirms Lars von Trier as the most talented and provocative of contemporary film makers. Whether he makes great films is a much harder question to answer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of this movie is somewhat corny ? Selma (Bjork) plays an immigrant who is slowly becoming blind. Whilst working at a factory ? she is desperately saving enough money for an operation for her son ? so he won't suffer the same fate as Selma. She escapes the mundane of everyday life (and not so everyday life!) by going into her imaginary musical world.The use of the musicals are restrained ? I think there are only 7 songs on total?also it takes a little time before the first song is performed. Once the first song Selma ? it was a little overwhelming for me ? it just seemed like a really strange juxtaposition between reality and Selma's musical imagination. But once the film develops and you get more entwined in Selma's world ? you will fully believe these sequences.As Selma begins her downward spiral ? you just can't help being sucked into the whole `Dancer in the Dark' experience. Bjork's performance is dynamic ? her songs are excellent (maybe an acquired taste?) and her acting is earth shattering@! She brings a haunting fragility to Selma ? a sense that she is not in control ? that she has no other choice than to delve into her `world'.Lars Von Trier's camera technique IS effective ? although it will be off-putting for some. It divides the two realties between real life and Selma's world.The supporting cast are also in top form ? their acting (more traditional) seems to be in stark contrast to Bjork's style.I know this movie isn't everyone's `cup-of-tea' ? when I saw it at the cinemas ? some couldn't handle the brutal final scene (they walked out on it). It is just so intense ? it has to be experienced. Weeks after I had seen this movie ? I was still thinking about it!10 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be classified as a documentary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer In The Dark is obviously not meant to be a documentary or anything of that nature. But it could act as a documentary for people who want to immigrate to another country, to whose lifestyle they're not used to.The movie itself was touching, yet not flawless. I could say it would be flawless without the horrible soundtrack. Björk's acting skills surprised and stunned me big time in this movie. She's 5 million times better as an actress than as a singer :-) Another tiny flaw in question is the execution scene. I myself wouldn't want to see my best friend's breathe taken away really. But Kathy was there to watch her friend die. And NOBODY can sing knowing she'll die in 2 minutes. That was overimagination. But if you look at a huge long movie and can't find any other flaws than those, you can say it was flawless. The main theme including Selma's absolute love for her son, her miserable health, and facing an incredible betrayal that costs her more than she can handle, is absolutely fascinating. Actually something of such nature could very well happen to pretty much anyone, anywhere. The speech of the attorney general really put tears in my eyes. Pure misfortune making a murderer out of an innocent mother whose only aim in life is to give her son a nice life... If you watch this movie, please pay extra attention to the acting of Linda, Bill's wife. I think she's the best actor although she has a neglicible role. But then again, the casting is REALLY good in this movie so everyone's doing a good job.I give this movie a 9 out of 10. A must for every keen filmlover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice songs...shame about the video!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you browsed through the comments here, you'd think that Dancer in the Dark belongs to that group of movies that people either love or hate. My summary may give the impression that I hate this movie (and that I've always wanted to paraphrase a Not The Nine O'clock News song in a movie review, and this could be my best chance!). I don't. Nor do I love it.I'm not just doing this to be different, but to me, DITD is one of those movies that frustratingly falls between two stools. Parts of it seem woefully amateurish, particularly some of the early scenes. Others are genuinely impressive, such as the way the movie crosses over into musical. I kept trying to work out which was representative of the movie as a whole. Is it a good movie gone bad or vice versa?I honestly believe there's a good movie in there, trying to get out. The performances are fine across the board, including Bjork, who makes a spirited acting debut in a role that also allows her to shine in the musical interludes. And those musical interludes are quite simply the best part of the movie. Before I saw it, the idea itself looked like a brilliant opportunity for bringing 'the musical' up-to-date, with the post-modern twist of it being a tragedy.However, DITD is let down by a simplistic storyline taken straight out of a bad soap-opera (bad thing happen to good people, fair enough, but not when the bad things are this over-the-top with not even a hint of respite), sometimes action-movie-bad dialogue (which I generally don't mind, as long as its accompanied by an action movie!), and direction and cinematography that detracts from instead of enhancing the story (does there have to be numerous cuts in the middle of a short conversation?). It's therefore not a huge surprise when I say that I think the blame lies with Mr von Trier (what with him doing the writing and directing and all).Everyone is entitled to there own opinion and you, like most people it seems, will probably come down on one side of the fence or the other. You may even sit on it like I did. If you love it, it doesn't mean you're an artsy Dogme fanatic and if you hate it, it doesn't mean you're a Hollywood-obsessed person who hates anything original (big shock there, though some people's comments would have you believe otherwise - but hey, at least they're passionate!).The not-so-amazing revelation is that Dancer in the Dark is one of those bizarre movies that will always be at the top of people's Top Ten and Worst Ever because it has enough ammunition to support both points of view or even like me, leave you wondering what might have been.Do go and see it. At the very least it's guaranteed to provoke a strong reaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie because I love musicals and I also enjoy the acting of David Morse. I had heard a lot of talk about Bjork, so with the combination of these three elements, I figured it would strike my fancy.Within 3 hours, the movie was back at the store on the shelf. I have never been so disappointed in all my life. David Morse had no place being in that movie. He did not portray his 'style' of characters from what I have seen in the past. Bjork appears to be a wonderful lady, but for first impressions, this movie has turned me off. Why couldn't the camera be on a stand? The whole movie was shakey (literally) and von Trier's hand-held camera work was dizzying to the point of extreme distraction. There was no plot to this movie, and I dislike seeing handicapped persons being taken advantage of, as was Bjorks character. Above all, not only was it done by a Cop, but by a very close friend of hers. How sad. Will not watch this movie again, nor will I recommend. I will also think twice before seeing a von Trier movie just due to elements of my liking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major disappointment from von Trier.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off watching 'Dancer In The Dark' for a long time because of my intense dislike for musicals and my lack of interest in the hugely overrated Bjork. I felt I had to watch this movie though because of my admiration for Lars von Trier's movies 'Zentropa', 'Breaking The Waves' and 'The Idiots' and his mini-series 'The Kingdom', all of which I highly recommend.I'd love to be able to say I was impressed by 'Dancer In The Dark' but I wasn't. The movie covered similar ground to 'Breaking The Waves' but just wasn't as believable, involving or had any great depth. Compare Bjork's role here to Emily Watson's in '..Waves' - Bjork is just not on the same level, and I found her casting as a Hungarian immigrant simply ridiculous. David Morse ('The Indian Runner') impressed me (as he always does) in a strong supporting role. Catherine Deneuve ('Belle De Jour') was reasonable but wasn't really required to do all that much. Peter Stomare, who has irritated me in most of his post-'Fargo' self-parodic roles, is the best I've ever seen him in a low key sensitive portrayal. Finally it was amusing to see cult legend Udo Kier (a von Trier regular) and 'Cabaret's Joel Grey, but that's about it.The major stumbling block for apart from Bjork's acting was the second-rate songs. 'I've Seen It All' was the only one that wasn't forgettable. The rest sounded like they were improvised on the spot with very little thought behind them lyrically or melodically.Check out von Trier's previous work though, he is a major talent. Hopefully this movie is just a glitch and he gets back on track in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not one to cry at movies. Case in point, I did not cry that much to Saving Private Ryan, Ghost, and only a little bit of tears (although each tear evoked a lot of emotion) for Schindler's List. The last five seconds of Dancer in the Dark had me not only crying in waterfalls of tears, but bawling (is that how you spell it?) and heaving and coughing. That is pretty impressive considering that this outburst suddenly happened in the LAST 5 SECONDS of the movie! This is absolutely one of the most saddest and wonderful and different films I have ever seen!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark is a wonderful film with a wonderful vision. (I used the word vision on purpose.) It's rare to see a film full of fantasy set in such a realistic place, and it's great. I love everything about Dancer in the Dark. Bjork did an AMAZING job as blinding Selma. There is a moment in the film when you think,"Oh my god, no!" Then calm down because it's a musical and Selma can escape from the world in away I wish I could. After growing to love Selma and her dreams we are forced to watch Selma lose her dreams and be forced to see reality, and at the time she does, she is fully blind.Dancer in the Dark is a perfect movie and one of the best of 2000. I'm in love with Bjork's Selma in away I rarely am with movie characters. I hope that the director stays away from the Dogmatic film making and starts to play in this middle area more. ADVISE TO THE DIRECTOR: None, you did an amazing thing with this film. **** (FOUR STARS OUT OF FOUR)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amazing, original work of film, though very depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this film last night, and I've never let a movie get to me like this in quite some time. First off, I have to say that I am a huge fan of Bjork and her beautiful music, so this opinion may be a little biased. In fact, as I was about halfway through the movie, I realized that if it hadn't been for Bjork's starring role, I conceivably might never have given it a second glance; it's an "arsty" film, the rest of the cast is relatively new to me (save David Morse), and the film in general is one I would likely avoid due to it's depressing plot. However, I should also mention I wrote off Schindler's List for years for the same reasons before actually seeing it, and that's a big deal movie. Anyway, I still love this movie, though it is one I will most likely never see again, due to it's sad storyline. The plot follows Selma (Bjork), a single mother and Czech immigrant who is rapidly losing her eyesight due to a heridtary disease. She lives in poverty with her son, who is also afflicted with the same disease, but his sight can still be saved. Selma saves every last penny for an expensive operation that can save her son's sight, but she tells everyone she is sending it all to her father back home in Europe. She hides the money in a tin in her home. WARNING: SPOILER'S AHEAD! IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE STOP READING NOW!!!!!!!! Soon, we meet Selma's landlord of sorts Bill (David Morse), a local police man who has a wife who can't seem to stop spending money he doesn't have. Faced with the IRS taking his home, he pleads with Selma to borrow the money. She refuses him outright and he apologizes. Soon, he gets desperate and takes advantage of Selma's blindness to see where she hides her money. The next day as Selma goes to her tin to but the day's money in the tine, she discovers it is gone. She goes to Bill to inquire about her son, but she soon discovers that Bill has in fact stolen her money. Bill pleads with Selma to kill him, (he has been contemplating suicide throughout the movie) and she can have her money. Unfortunately, Bill's wife walks in on them and Bills tells her to run and get the police. Selma fights to get the money from Bill, but in the fight Bill's gun goes off and shoots Bill in the side. Selma, knowing what faces her, takes the gun and shoots Bill as he begs her to do. Soon, she finds herself on the run and ends up getting caught and put on trail. As the evidence mounts against her, with witness after witness, Selma eventually takes the stand. This is one of the saddest moments of the film. The prosecutor askes her: "Why did you shoot him" and she answers "Because he asked me to." You can see in her face that she knows what is going to happen to her, and that her words, whether she lies or tells the truth, will condemn her. As she is sentenced to death by hanging, she is taken off to solitary confinement until the time of her death. Her friends manage to get her a stay of execution, but when she talks with her new attorney who feels the evidence that she was saving her money for the operation may aquit her, she discovers that the amount the lawyer agreed to for payment is the exact amount she had saved for the operation. She fights heatedly with her friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) over saving her son or living and Selma refuses to live so that her son may see his grandchildren. As her last day reaches her, she finds herself in despair and can't walk. Her guard, and recent friend, helps her to the execution room where the noose awaits. Kathy goes up to her through the guards and yells that her son will see his grandchildren, and Selma finds it easier to stand. She faces her death with a song. The most original part of this film is that it is a musical of sorts. Whenever it gets too rough, Selma goes to a place of song and dance to make it through. The most haunting of numbers happens right after she kills Bill, where we see Gene (her son) riding his bike singing "you just did what you had to do". This song has been in my head since I saw the movie, and I can't shake this feeling of sadness about the story, and it's unjust ending. Rarely can a film do this to me, cause long lasting emotional fallout. I'm sure I'll get over it soon enough, but it surely speaks as to how the film moved me. Another amazing part about the film is Bjork's performance. For a woman whose acting experience is minimal, her acting is some of the best I've seen from even the best, Academy Award Winning actors of our time. The fact that she shares little to no interest in acting again is imaginable. After doing a film like that as your only experience, who would want to put themselves through that again??? She needs a good comedy to show her that not all acting takes as much of a bite out of your soul. I can imagine that the part of Selma had her depressed for months after the film wrapped. I know I would feel the same. I sincerely hope she reconsiders her position in the world of film. She has an amazing talent. And in closing, I sincerely hope that whoever reads this will consider going out and buying some of Bjork's music for themselves -- it has been described as an "acquired taste" (which I agree with) but it's well worth acquiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What made this film so special to me was how well rounded it was. I have never seen a movie that captured so many different aspects to film-making. I found the story to be superb, with unexpected twists and turns throughout. I enjoyed the cinematography...mostly because it wasn't filled with your normal "Hollywood" expectations. von Trier mixes the base of Dogme 95 beliefs (hand-held camera, real lighting, no makeup), but mixes the Hollywood special effects to create something beautiful. Even the harshest critics of the movie have to feel moved by the daring methods von Trier utilizes. The fact that it is a musical balances out the fact that it is the saddest story I have ever seen. Bjork's performance demands that you not observe her but feel through her. Her character says something to the effect that she loves musicals because "nothing sad ever happens." Yet this musical is a tragedy to the end. Whether or not you like this movie, I think it is an important movie to see. I have never experienced a movie that tore at my emotions, and for that, I have to consider it among the greatest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all in the silence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier's excellent deconstruction of the musical and the melodrama is one of the most powerful and beautiful films I have ever seen. The depth and emotion that Trier gets out of all the actors is nothing short of remarkable, the fact that he didn't get nominated for an Oscar has to be some kind of crime.Von Trier continues his semi-documentary style, but adding a fantastic juxtaposition with the beautifully filmed dance numbers that grow out of the industrial sounds of Selma's day to day life. Bjork gives one of the best performances any actress could hope for (let alone a none actor), finding the right blend of innocence and emotion within the character.David Morse is also strong, breaking away from his usual typecast roles and delivering a restrained villainy that we question ourselves. But the film belongs to Bjork and Von Trier, who craft a fantastic, enjoyable, even heart breaking films, but it's only as we reach the end of the that we no longer have the sounds and are left in the silence to contemplate what we've seen.Truly remarkable</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many ideas have been expressed on this movie. Let me add one more detail which has not been mentioned by critiques. There is also in it something about the rift between American values and European ones. Two continents drifting asunder.Money (for the blind to see and for the lawyers to perform), the pursuit of happiness seen through the evil glass of appearances and worldly possessions (the copper's family) and a justice system so efficient in bringing death penalty to the blinds... America is also the land of modern science (she came to it because she new the techniques existed there for her son to be operated), the land of dream and musicals where one can find good welcoming people (the warden and Jeff).Europe is something else. It recognized some good, even human values, in communism... (shock horror for an US jury of the 50's) and money may not be a "faire valoir" and a condition of happiness as evident as in the Mid West (I say... may not). Lars is definitely from this side of the Atlantic ocean and no wonder the Cannes festival choices are not always approved of in the USA. The two worlds are getting more and more different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has never been a film so utterly intense as this, so amazing, so phenomenal as Dancer In The Dark. Raw and realistic to the gritty extreme, Bjork quite captivatingly gives the GREATEST performance of the last decade, hands down and period! Not since the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (the Oscars) horrendous and non-justifiable oversight in NOT recognizing Madonna's brilliant performance in Evita (not to mention ignoring the whole film, for which they should all be ashamed) have they displayed themselves as so utterly ignorant! How dare they NOT nominate Bjork for her stupendous portrait and performance?! Julia Roberts should be ashamed of herself, that statue belongs to Bjork!!! When such over-hyped and lame films as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The English Patient, the throw-away Cast Away and any host of Hollywood drool films get nominated and films like Dancer In The Dark are ignored, you know the Oscars are not based on merit, they are based on something akin to high school popularity contests. See Dancer in the Dark, and then see if you can actually say Julia Roberts deserved that award without laughing out loud at the utter lunacy of the comment. It pulls all the correct emotional strings (without, thankfully falling into the milking shallowness of Spielberg) to deliver an impacting film like no other. You MUST see Dancer In The Dark it is without any doubt in my mind truely one of the greatest films of all time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dynamic Performance By Bjork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Altruism, benevolence, a mother's love for her son and pure, unadulterated evil are the key elements in one of the most dynamic and emotionally charged (as well as overlooked) films of the year (2000), `Dancer In the Dark,' directed by Lars von Trier. Icelandic singer Bjork stars as Selma Yeskova, a single mother living in a small town in Washington State, who works in a factory to support herself and her ten-year-old son, Gene (Vladan Kostic). Selma works her fingers to the bone, taking double shifts and doing whatever she can to save enough money for an operation Gene will need when he turns thirteen to correct an inherited, genetic condition that will eventually rob him of his sight. And Selma knows only too well the effects of the disorder; even as she works towards accruing the sum needed for the operation, she is coping with the onset of her own imminent blindness. Besides her son, her one passion in life is movie musicals, which she has loved since she was a little girl; she grew up with them, and now it is to them that she turns in her mind when life closes in on her and threatens to become unbearable. When she is overwhelmed and overburdened, she hears music in the sounds of the factory and finds rhythm in the work. In the musicals she finds the respite from concern she needs to carry on, escaping to a place where `nothing dreadful ever happens.'  Set in 1964 against a backdrop of the beautiful rural Pacific Northwest, the content of von Trier's film is so real and it is so visually engrossing that at times it's like watching a home video. And it makes you more than merely an observer of Selma's life; you become involved. You share the joy of a mother watching her son ride his first bicycle; you sense the `community' of her friends and co-workers who help make her life bearable. Von Trier successfully manages to avoid any maudlin sentimentality, and instead tells the story in a voice that is straightforward and creates an intense, emotionally complex and memorable film that ultimately takes you to a place that, in the beginning, you would never have dreamed possible. In a way, it all sneaks up on you, until suddenly you find yourself caught up and swept away in an emotional torrent. Discovering a great film is always exciting (and without question this is one), but when it includes an astounding new talent, as well, it is indeed a thrill. And such is the case here. For as Selma, Bjork quite simply gives one of the best performances of the year, and how she got passed over for an Oscar nomination is beyond me. A gifted individual, she brings subtle nuance to the character, and conveys a humanity of singular depth that makes Selma, and the fact that she is so adamant in her undertaking, more than real and believable. That the viewer is able to be drawn in and affected on such a personal level with this film is a direct result of Bjork's natural ability as an actress. Granted, von Trier led the way, and her co-stars (especially David Morse, in a terrific performance as her friend, Bill) provided invaluable support, but the real connection this film makes with audience is through-- and because of-- Bjork. The supporting cast includes Catherine Deneuve (Kathy), Peter Stormare (Jeff), Udo Kier (Dr. Porkorny), Joel Grey (Oldrich Novy), Vincent Paterson (Samuel), Cara Seymour (Linda) and Stellan Skarsgard (Doctor). Much of the strength of von Trier's film lies in the implied, as well as the overt aspects of it, and in the end, `Dancer In the Dark' will leave you with many things to ponder for some time to come, especially concerning those `gray areas' of the human condition. Rationale, motivation, the distorted priorities to which it seems so many people are prone, as well as proof of the existence of true goodness that many do, in fact, carry in their hearts. Emotionally devastating, this is a film that demands reflection. Unfortunately, it raises many questions to which--just as in real life-- there are simply no real answers. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendous Film For the Ages!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the term "Visionary" applied as a single word description for "Dancer In The Dark" and I certainly agree. I would go so far as to say that the film is light years ahead of it's time and space. It is overflowing with innovation, information, ideas and power. An instant classic that will be more widely accepted as such as years go by. Really. I don't just throw these words around loosely.One of the greatest aspects of cinema for me is finding a film that works on multiple levels, and "Dancer In The Dark" delivers in spades. How many levels are at play here? I don't know yet. "Blade Runner" is the only other film that has left me wondering (even after all these years) at the actual depth of expression it contains, whether it be intentional or accidental.SPOILER AHEAD!One of the more interesting levels (Interpretively speaking) of "Dancer In The Dark" is of Selma Yeskova as a Christ figure. She dies for the sins of everyone else. She has her disciples who love her dearly and two of whom even kiss her hands. She has Bill as her Judas. He betrays her for money and is responsible for her arrest, trail and execution. She both forgives him and asks for his forgiveness. She exerts a positive influence upon those around her - they are happier for knowing her and draw from her great strength. They even learn from her in many subtle ways. She "lives forever" by staying within the "Next To Last Song" at the moment of her death. So cool!I love this film and I love Björk's absolutely amazing film score and songs! The two death scenes are definitely disturbing but the film would suffer if their impact was lessened. I recommend it highly to anyone with an open mind who truly loves cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS I have never become physically sick from watching a movie, but through the genius of Lars Von Trier, I have now. I had no idea as too plot of this film, so my viewing was pure. I was an innocent child entering into Bjork's darkness. If this movie had of been done in regular format, it would have been ruined. Handheld camara was perfect. You learn the chaos of her existence and the other character's as well. The music was beautifully done. Especially the colors. When she would snap into the musical world, the colors became vibrant. Then, back to her dark reality, the colors became drab again. Pure genius. David Morse and Peter Stormare and two actors who always make you happy when you see them. Instantly recognizable. You actually feel the pain in Stormare's character. I felt his disappointment. Next the actual murder scene. I can't think of a single death scene ever in a movie, save The Green Mile, that disturbed me this much. First of all the acting in the scene was great, but, I think the camcorder feel made it seem like we were actually watching someone kill another human. I had cold chills. Of course as you continue on you sink more and more into Bjork's hopelessness and you actually want to stop watching the movie as you slowly become more upset. I slowly became nauseated as she was lead to the gallows. This was Bjork's best scene. Her terror became mine. As we waiting for the call to come back and she started singing, I was crying and crossing fingers that a stay would come in. I wasn't ready when they dropped floor. I jumped off the couch and almost had a heart attack. This was the most disturbing thing I had ever seen. I actually became sick. I'll end this as it started. I have never became physically sick from a movie until now. I give this a 10, but please view with caution, for you will be disturbed.</fullReview>

A shame, but no one cares. Dancer won at Cannes, the real awards. There's only one detail: the last song, and the last text about the penalty of death.

		<fullReview>"Dancer in The Dark" is about a mother, Selma, who will do anything for her son, Gene, so that he will not suffer from her disease ( which is going blind ). She moved to America from Czechoslovakia, so he can get eye surgery. But she has to work day and night in a metal factory to raise him the money for surgery. Her only escape from her tired and dreary life is her imagination where every little noise turns into a musical. In her mind, she can see and sing and dance and everything is happy. Just when she raises enough money for her son's surgery, everything takes a turn for the worse when her friend and neighbor, Bill, runs into financial trouble. Its Selma's own strength and will that gets her into the mess she winds up in, but its all for her son, Gene, so he can see his grandchildren.I can understand why people do not like this movie, but I other hand love this movie and was strongly moved by it. The use of digital camera might not have been the wisest choice. The editing in the beginning is choppy and the weird close-ups and shaky camera movement sometimes takes the impact of the scene away. The only time I think a person can really feel at ease technically and visually with this movie is during the dance numbers, because then the picture is brighter and of a higher quality and more steady. But I think that was the point. In Selma's imagination the world is brighter, higher quality, and steady. It's a better world. The songs are beautiful. If you sit back and close your eyes the lyrics bring tears to your eyes. Especially the songs "I've Seen It All", "Scatterheart", "Next To Last Song", and "New World". But the gem of the movie is Bjork's performance!! She plays Selma as a woman who has the entire weight of the world on her shoulders, who can still be happy and maintain a child-like view of the world. The moments when she smiles at the slightest happy things brought tears to my eyes. Her performance is dead on, and to have it not be recognized by the Academy is just WRONG! There was more heart and sweat and tears in Bjork's thumb then in all of Julia Roberts's cleavage and talent in "Erin Brockovich". But I believe that because this movie wasn't recognized that well except at Cannes just makes it more special. You have to discover it yourself because I think a lot of problems with movies lately is that they're really overrated or underrated and you go in a theatre or rent a movie thinking what people say and not really just sit back and enjoy the movie. Another reason why I don't think people like this movie is because of the intensity of it. Its emotionally exhausting, gut-wrenching, and doesn't leave you in a good mood. It makes you angry and hurt. And a lot of people don't go to see movies to feel horrid.I loved this movie. I hated watching it because it brings out a lot of sadness in me. I wouldn't recommend this movie to just anyone. It takes a person who appreciates the small things that actors do (like smiles or glances and emotion in words), not just someone who expects an actor to look good and says funny one-liners to move a predictable plot along. I think a lot of the magic that Bjork put into Selma comes from her actions and facial expressions. I recommend this movie to people who have felt sympathy for a fictional character. Someone who can take something from a movie and feel its power and not dismiss it as 'just another movie'. It's not for the faint of heart or the easiest of crier. If the sentimental moments of a romantic comedy get you broken up, this movie is definitely not for you. This movie is one-of-a kind and delightfully strange. It can only be embraced by a few people, almost like Bjork's music. It can be only understood and loved by a few people, but in my opinion it is wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly do not remember throwing away more than two hours of my life like I did watching this movie. Come on, what is so special about it anyway? It is no more than a (bad, long) videoclip, with a predictable, extremely melodramatic plot. I just thought that her soul was going to leave her body straight to heaven, she was going to be sanctified or transformed in a kind of Joan of "Dark". Poor cinematography, VERY poor acting (especially from Björk) and a story unable to really touch someone because it is so exaggerated, that everything gets unreal. And it doesn't have enough magic to become a good surreal movie. Every single bad thing that could happen to the main character does happen. Murphy's law at its best! I confess that, in the last hour of the movie (which seemed like the last eight) I started to laugh every time a song began. Much too dramatic, it became funny. I don't think that was Van Trier's idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Deception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very high hopes had been set on this 2000 Cannes Film Festival winner (I had missed the screening by a couple of days during my visit to the Riviera in May, so I was very anxious to view this "supposed" little gem), but I got out of the cinema with one of the worst headaches of my life.I fully agree that that this hand-held camera insanity must stop, the camera work was most annoying. Compared to the first Blair Witch Project and the Belgian film Rosetta, which gave "breaks" to our poor cinephile eyes by keeping the camera still and focused every 5 minutes or so, Dancer in the Dark was out of control.Yes, Bjork and Catherine Deneuve give emotional, inspired performances. I would certainly have enjoyed seeing them though, but the camera was always swapping back and forth from one physionomy to another. For the first 20 minutes, I thought "Gee, that's annoying, but it's sure to stop with the beginning of the musical numbers." Sadly, it didn't. Plus, I had enjoyed the album Selma Songs tremendously, especially the Thom Yorke/Bjork duo I've seen it all, but guess who delivers that powerful tune in the movie: the lead male character (shivers...).I would state that until the "incident involving the money" sequence (trying to avoid a spoiler here), the movie was quite good content-wise. After, it derails a bit though, handing us a few hard to believe bits.5 out of 10 for Bjork and Deneuve's convincing performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An effective film should make you forget you're sitting in a theater. This one was squirm-inducing with every turn of the plot. It wasn't that the story was implausible--it was utterly false at every turn.Bjork was amazing; the musical numbers were were suitably strange but interesting, jarring but effective. The supporting actors were better than they had any right to be, given the material they were working with.Someone else has commented: "I see it as a nearly complete condemnation of American culture and society." It could have been, had Trier troubled to give it a backbone instead of a tissue of lies. I see it as a nearly complete waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A flawed but rather wonderful movie about a young European girl in America (Bjork) who finds a fulfilling fantasy world in her music as she slowly goes blind. It comes as a shock to find this is a song and dance film but the audaciousness is breath-taking. Uplifting, unusual and not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, bad, bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a waste of time, energy and money. Excellent story and great acting is spoiled by the exceptionally horrible directing. The sweaty-semi artistic and wannabe musical style ruins the whole idea. The story itself is really not bad even if it is very surrealistic. The reason of surrealistic storyline might be that rich westerners try to make up a story of an eastern-block story. One can call it incredible stupid, but let's accept the freedom of art. Anyhow the story falls on face when the drama of Selma is taken to so high that poor Selma becomes a simple stupid women with good heart instead of a dramatic hero. The almost musical like style is a major mistake as the songs are childish and brainless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers in this review) Dancer in the Dark is a beautiful, sad film. Bjork gives her all to her performance. Catherine Deneuve, her costar once commented that Bjork couldn't act, she could only "be". And it is true, Bjork is literally Selma: fragile yet strong, childish, dreamy and heartbreaking. This performance was such an intense experience for Bjork, that she's sworn off acting, something very impressive, especially since Bjork never wanted to act in the first place.Catherine Deneuve also gives a stellar performance as Kathy, Selma's loving best friend who assumes the role of her protector. Her acting is amazing in a sweet, subtle and understated way. Deneuve is stripped off her real-life glamor to portray a French immigrant factory worker, and she does it impressively. Selma's and Kathy's beautiful, close bond is one of the touching aspects to this film. For example, in one scene, Kathy sees Selma trying to navigate her way home by using the rail tracks to guide her footing. Saddened by this, Kathy almost lets out a cry and tries to muffle it. Another example is when they are at the cinema, watching a musical. Selma can barely make out what is happening on the screen, so Kathy takes her hand and traces the dance steps on it and proceeds to kiss it.The film is unique, with the cinematography being one of the most obvious examples. It uses a lot of camera movements: right to left, distant-length to close-ups, all within seconds. Some people may see this as hectic, but I find it to be a great choice as it adds to the intimacy one feels towards the story and the characters.Other actors give notable performances: David Morse, who play the police officer neighbor Bill, Peter Stormare as sweet and lovestruck Jeff, Vladica Kostic as Selma's son who is the premise of Selma's tragic fate, Cara Seymour as Bill's superficial wife, and most notable among the supporting cast, Siobhan Fallon who plays the empathic prison warden who offers unexpected tenderness towards Selma.I have never been that fond of musicals, but Dancer in the Dark is an exception because song and dance do not dominate the whole movie, only in between ample space of plot. The musicals exist purely in Selma's head, who seek refuge in them when life gets hard, hence this prevents the film from being absurd.The film ends tragically. Some people report it took them a few days to recover while some admit to leaving the cinema disgusted - they hate it because they feel emotionally manipulated. And there are people like me who felt that they were indeed emotionally manipulated, but love the movie anyway just because it is so very beautiful. And the beauty of it does not only exist in the acting, the cinematography, the songs, the plot, etc but also in the very message of this film: that we, as humans, are equally capable of kindness and cruelty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A completely dreadful movie but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously with a 7.8 average on IMDb, this was a surprise to me when I felt asleep more than twice on this piece. Many will find this movie "artistic" and will critique that I should go rent Terminator 3 instead since I have poor taste ;).But from my perspective, this is a slow... tedious... boring movie filmed with an amateur camera. The camera works are enough to makes one seasick since it wobble all over the screen which also convey a very "amateur feel" to the movie (something that was though, probably intentional).The actors are OK, Bjork was interesting especially in her most intense scenes, yet the rest of the cast though are not particularly memorable.For the music (as this is somewhat of a musical), I would presume you would *NEED* to be a Bjork fan to appreciate. Personally not liking her music in the least (feeling her voice is off-key and annoying), it is poorly executed with silly lyrics. Basically, every time the musical bits started I would sigh in despair.*spoilers* Now, why is this not a "1" instead of a "2" to my opinion? Well, simply because of the "death scenes". Without revealing too much, but the two death scenes are... remarkable. The acting is top notch, the pain is overbearing, the situation completely dramatic and simply captivating in its horror.My Conclusion is to NOT see this movie other than for these two scenes (the finale being particularly intense). If you're a Bjork fan though, you might like it a whole more than I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dance, someone said, but no one said that life is beautiful here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dancer in the Dark" is not an easy movie to classify. It's sort of half fantasy, half indictment of America. I might have never heard of Bjork before this movie came out, but it's the sort of film that leaves you almost breathless. Bjork plays Czech immigrant Selma Jezkova - who interestingly looks closer to Asian - working in a factory in Washington state in the early to mid '60s. Expecting the good life when she immigrated, she instead lives a grim existence, but occasionally breaks out into song in her own fantasy world. But when tragedy strikes, everything changes...sort of.I know that Lars von Trier likes to make a point of indicting the US for various things (although I haven't seen his other movies). He certainly does that here, but it's hard to say to what extent he really succeeds. The truth is that the movie is so over-the-top that it's nearly impossible to tell what to make of anything. I understand that Selma would like to escape this drudge of a world that she inhabits, but are her fantasies all that realistic for someone stuck in a life like hers? Personally, I can't tell whether the movie is trying to be cynical or optimistic...although I would suspect cynical.Still, it is a movie that I recommend. Many of the scenes and musical numbers are quite impressive. Also starring Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, Peter Stormare (happy birthday, Peter!), Joel Grey (that's right, the owner of the Kit Kat Club), Zeljko Ivanek and Udo Kier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big kudos to Bjork and von Trier...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's your typical setting: a woman lives in a small town where everyone knows each other, everyone does hard labor, and everyone is money hungry. Realizing that this is a big melodrama doesn't take much thought, and director von Trier isn't shy to blatantly face this fact. "Dancer in the Dark" is a sort of psychology test. It asks just how long one can live in shame, and how far people will go to defend their honor.Lars von Trier doesn't hide the fact that he hates America. Unafraid to show the dark side of it, he often shows his characters isolated and withdrawn from the world, stopping at nothing to get what they want. But he doesn't do it so that it seems as though this is the only way the people are. He carefully places psychological elements in order to manipulate the characters to seem more bitter. In this case, he focuses on greed."Dancer in the Dark" is about Selma Jezkova (Bjork), a Czechoslovakian woman who moves to America in 1964 to pursue her dreams of being a musical actress. However, while in America she realizes her condition: she is going blind and there's nothing she can do about it. She has a son who is at huge risk of also getting the disease and to protect him, Selma slowly saves money for an operation. She does this all while going blind.I was skeptical about Bjork playing the part for a number of reasons. She doesn't look eastern European, she doesn't sound eastern European, and she certainly has never been in a large motion picture before. But then something happened, and from minute one of Bjork's presence I knew there was something about the performance that gets right down to your bones. Here is a movie that throws you in powerful emotion, and Bjork was able to pull it off. And then some.The story itself isn't very complex but it does represent how constricted a community can be, and just how hunger for power can only go so far. Like his later work, "Dogville" and "Manderlay", von Trier simply relies on the performances to drive the movie more than anything else. He and Bjork, though often hated each other on sets, pulled off the best performance of the year, and the most emotionally charged film since "Titanic". This is a movie that in my opinion was wrongfully snubbed at the Oscars for at least a Lead Actress nomination. But I digress, and the Cannes Film Festival win surely proves that Bjork can in fact, act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 20 minutes I was nauseous and dizzy. The hand held video camera is brutal and relentless in its constant swaying, jerking and tilting. But since I'm a huge Bjork fan, I persevered. I tried focusing my eyes only on the center of the screen, but that was no help. Eventually I was reduced to staring at the seat in front of me while I listened to the dialogue. It was then that I realized that the dialogue itself was rather poorly written.So I had to ask myself: what the !@# am I doing sitting in a movie theater, staring at the back of a seat and listening to corny dialogue for 2 hrs? I'm not *that* much of a Bjork fan. I walked out at the half-hour mark, stumbled to my car and spent 10 minutes rubbing my eyes.Seriously, the movie itself may have been tolerable, but the jiggly camera is merciless. Please save yourself the optic nerve damage, unless you truly wish to be drawn into the realism of going blind yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's everything I could ever hate about Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm probably alone on this view, but I hated Dancer with a passion. It was predictable, a bit pretentious and just goes to show that good cinema isn't allowed to be fun by any stretch of the imagination.I mean, when Bjork and her cop friend start talking in the first ten minutes, I KNEW where it would all lead up to. Basically the conversation, in a nut shell:Bjork: I'm saving up thousands of dollars for my son's eye operation. It's hidden in the kitchencop: I wish my wife wouldn't spend so much money....I'm so broke...All I could do was scream at how obvious the set up was. Two hours later, it all plays out as predicted, a crime everyone likes to slap on the "big budget" films.Maybe I'm just too mainstream, but I see no entertainment value, no value in its morality. I felt nothing but irritation at the cast trying to lead the story to its obvious conclusion. The ending was sooo schmaltzy it puts Bruckheimer to shame. Pearl Harbor gets slammed for being so over the top, but Dancer is just as guilty. Bjork's character has to be stubborn about the blindness just so the movie can meander it's way up to the most melodramatic death scene I ever shook my head at.Most people will read this and be unable to comprehend my reaction, Just as I cannot comprehend how others could find this film to be so moving. I am by no means advocating that the film needs a car chase or anything. Adding cliches is not the solution, a problem that makes many mainstream films mediocre.The problem with Indy filmakers like Von Trier is that they HAVE to be sooo "anti-Hollywood", to follow the notion that they have to "keep it real". a notion which is absurd at best, and unhealthy at worst. Certain people seem to think that good cinema must involve:1) Family strife. No real antagonists, just plain old everyday broken home atmospheres, cuz that's "keepin it real". I'm not asking for a goofy villain type, but I don't want to pay ten bucks to see cynical single parents struggling with their oblivious kids.2) At least one addict, wether it be money, drugs, sex. Addicts make good performances, I guess, cuz they're not fun.3) At least one person dies a gritty death, because, well....can't have any fun...4) No fun allowed, no witty banter, no hope for the characters. If there's any hope for the characters to be happy, it's just too Hollywood.A lot people can't understand my opinion, but there it is. "Dancer in the Dark" is just no fun at all, and I cannot relate to any of it. You can rave about its originality, its acting, the script, how it's so "real", so anti-Hollywood. But what's the point? I get up every morning and I have to work with people who are just as pathetic as these characters. Nobody has any sort of magnificence to them. No humanity. I have to put up with these people. Why would I pay to see a film about characters who are just as pathetic? Who's going to remember it in twenty years?? Can you quote lines from it?? Is it in ANY way significant to the evolution of film and entertainment?No, coffeehouse patrons of America, I must shatter what I consider to be a heinous myth. Films are primarily an escapist medium. Audiences want to forget about life for two hours, not be reminded. The good guy doesn't HAVE to win, but there should at least be A good guy type. You might scoff at that. If it were not the case, why was Dancer vitually ignored in theatres while Gladiator gets the big treatment? Why did Gladiator get the Oscar wins? Cuz "Dancer", in all seriousness, blows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overrated musical drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers Ahead)This film is like a day at school. Interesting, maybe, but do you really need it after the 10th grade no. In other words, while critics might have you believe this is the next best musical, I myself would think not. Now I know I can't speak for everyone, I'm sure there are many people who will love this movie, and I can't blame them. This film will probably make many eyes tear. But for me, if I want a tear weller (not gusher, nothing can do that), I'll stick to Pay it Forward.Writer and director Lars Von Trier tells the story of a Czechlovakian woman named Selma (though odd how a Czeck woman played good by Bjork resembles an eskimo) who's life is going downhill because of a hereditary illness (she is going blind and so will her son) and after trying to save up money to get her son an eye operation (this story could've been different if it had taken place now instead of 1964 thanks to new technology), it is stolen by her next door neighbor (David Morse) and then chaos ensues when not only she kills him, but they sing after the killing.Now, I think I could've respected this film a little more than I did, but I felt that when you add about a dozen or so songs in (which I am sure Trier didn't want because you might notice a different type of color in the musical scenes as it is in the non-musical scenes) a film that doesn't need them, it is crappy. Not that I'm saying musicals are all bad; films like West Side Story, South Park or even The Wall by Pink Floyd use the musical edge well. But when you use 50's musical/type formulas in a film with hand-held digital camcording for drama, the effect is lost in a way. With that out of the way though, this film is worth a gander, just as long as you don't take it as seriously as you would a hardcore drama. Good performances pull through though in some good photography and bad music scenes. B-</fullReview>

I always at least watch the whole thing. Give it a chance. Yet, this, by far has to be the worst movie I had ever seen. I wanted to throw myself off a bridge after watching less than an hour of this wretched waste of celluloid. The story is what killed me, Selma was so, entirely and completely out of touch with reality, I found it stupid. Beyond believable. I can stand idiotic tendencies, when it is presented by a character like Jay (and silent Bob) or Beavus and Butthead. But the naivety and simplistic logic and actions of her character made me want to kill innocent children and eat concrete. I highly suggest never submitting yourself to such a waste.

In fact, the hood is more for the officials who have to deal with the grisly spectacle in the first place! That apart, the moment of execution looks very phoney; the irony is that a stuntwoman is employed rather than a dummy, and it still just doesn't look right! Plus the fact that the last execution of a woman in the US was in 1937 - I am pretty sure that Washington State had done away with capital punishment altogether by the 1960s when this film is set. I could go on, but suffice to say that I'm surprised it was ever awarded a general theatrical release. Such pretentious drivel might please the Cannes set, but it ain't exactly Hollywood.

		<fullReview>Sorry, fans, but this movie is boring... I grew up watching Russian and European movies: they are beautiful and deep. I also like Hollywood classics: those movies are very well filmed and are very enjoyable. But this one... Too long, too boring, too dismal... The movie starts from nowhere, so for the first twenty minutes you have to guess what's going on and why it is worth filming. The woman is going blind from some mysterious disease which can be treated only by a surgery and only when you turn 13. And all your children will have the same disease. Is that for real? I guess most people have not heard about such illnesses, so why not give us some background? In fact, the movie does not explain anything. How does Selma know the exact number of steps from her cell to the gallows (obviously, impossible)? Why did her "friends" give the lawyer the exact amount she had for the doctor up to a cent (couldn't they add anything?) and why did he tell her how much he got?I guess it was supposed to be a fairy tale, but why did the director savor all the bad things? Because it's not Hollywood? But Hollywood is not the only place that makes movies after all.On the positive side, the acting was pretty good, though, on the negative side, the characters are quite flat (we do not learn anything at all about them by the end of the movie!).Don't waste your time or money. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not an admirer of Lars Von Trier's aesthetic. In fact I regard the majority of his output to be among the very worst examples of smug, pseudo-intellectual, navel-gazing pabulum ever perpetrated in the annals of contemporary cinema. All in all, without wanting to come across as some kind of pompous ass myself, I feel his enthusiasts are entirely too easily enthused. Don't be duped - this is not the groundbreaking avant-garde tour-de-force Von Trier and his artsy-fartsy cronies are clamouring to pass it off as. I am interested in experimental film and filmmakers who attempt to redefine the language of cinema. However, although I can perceive intellectually what Lars Von Trier was attempting to do with this film I had absolutely no feeling for the characters, nor did I find any of the sentimentality to be genuine. That's the best I can say about it. I felt NOTHING .... except anger. Anger at what I believed to be a painfully affected exercise given undue praise. I am very familiar with Dennis Potter's remarkable teleplay 'Pennies From Heaven' and felt that Von Trier borrowed so heavily from it that it is only a step or two from theft. At the very least I would have liked to have seen some kind of acknowledgment that there are more than a few small similarities between Von Trier's film and PFH. Regrettably none has been forthcoming. Some might say it is a homage .... I don't. A simple soul who seeks to escape a painful and miserable reality by escaping into a world of song-and-dance? A character who by dint of cruel fate meets their demise (a kind of martyrdom?) on the gallows ..... embraces death, in fact. Sorry, but there are far too many crucial similarities for me to take this film at all seriously. Want to be invigorated by the possibilities of the cinematic medium? Want to be challenged, disturbed and profoundly moved? Stick to anything written by Dennis Potter and ignore this dire mediocrity. 'Pennies From Heaven' (the British miniseries, now, sadly difficult to get hold of) is a masterpiece - this isn't!</fullReview>

Now I know that they are central to the whole theme and the fact that Selma lives her life by using music as a form of escapism, but I feel that the musicals could have been done differently, perhaps a little less frequent.And perhaps not almost completely at random also.I'm almost certain i wasn't the only person in my class waiting for the officer to drop Selma whilst she was singing.

		<shortDescription>feeling dirty and used</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I see a Lars von Trier film, I feel like he has tried to manipulate me into feeling something. The film Dancer in the Dark examines some pretty serious issues - love, greed, guilt, what it's like to be poor and the death penalty, to name a few. While I agreed with much of what the film seemed to be saying about these things, I really, intensely hated the way that the film presented its case. The problem with Lars von Trier is that the way he makes his films is deliberately intended to make them feel more 'real' than the typical Hollywood production. There aren't big car chases, or fist fights, or explosions, or people doing extraordinary things and the camera is hand-held and shaky in the style of a documentary. What results is a film that presents a story as if it could actually be based in reality, while the film contains no more 'truth' than something from Hollywood staring Arnold Schwarznegger. Lars von Trier films seem to me to be the left's equivalent of those Hollywood films where the good looking hero dishes out the pain to a scarred bad guy with a European or Middle-Eastern accent (who probably smokes), before raising the flag and crying "God Bless America". Both types of film are propaganda of sorts and both are equally insulting to the intelligence. I think Lars von Trier is an extremely talented director and Bjork in Dancer in the Dark was fantastic and I loved the music/dancing scenes, but I still felt dirty and used at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i like Björk, love musicals, admire &amp; have seen several Dogme-certified films, and heard good things about this movie. but i found it unworthy of watching through to the end.no problem with having one's emotions tugged or even eviscerated, but the stakes were low. Selma is just so doomed. i don't know what brand of glue another poster was on when they said this was a feminist or man-hating movie-- that's just silly. there's really nothing empowering about it, and no 'natural enemy'. the women were not feminist models (what about the wife of the cop or Selma herself? fatal na?veté and screeching high-maintenance hysterics are not definitions of strong women)... unless one feels that factory workers are all strong, dunno.***SPOILERS*** the part where i yelled "aw, c'mon!" at the TV in disgust was where Selma &amp; Bill fight and i think he asks her to shoot him. that was the deal-breaker for me. that was when i stopped the player and put the little movie back in its little case and wondered why the story couldn't have been more redeemable instead of ridiculous.i wanted to find out what i missed, so i researched what happened, and became very grateful that i stopped where i did. otherwise my disenchantment with the storyline would have decayed to an all-out disgust of the director &amp; artists' contributions.i can accept it's a matter of taste. while i'm not a demander of feel-good endings, there has to be some credulity re: the actions of the characters. i don't sympathise with stupid characters, so i lost my connection to Selma at that point. and i couldn't suspend by disbelief any further without having a rocket ship to put a crane into and hoist to the moon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is somehow wrong... A Danish director makes a movie about Czech immigrant played by Icelandic singer, whose best friend is an American woman played by French actress.Note - being Czech is underlined by ONE Czech conversation - in the middle of movie Selma and doctor say "Good morning" in Czech to each other. Then they keep on talking in English even though they are both Czech. That`s it. This movie is desperately begging for tears, all it asks the audience for is CRY. Cry because poor Czech girl is almost blind, cry because he has a boy that may be blind too, cry because bad cop stole her money, cry because lawyers don`t want to help her, finally cry because they`re going to hang her. This movie - as most Trier`s movies - is pitiful and unabitious as to plot, it has a predictable screenplay and cheap ideas. I give 2 out of 10, but if it wasn't for outstanding performance by Bjork (the songs were great) I wouldn't vote at all as there`s no ZERO available. It made me feel so BAD, that by the end of the movie I wanted to shout "HANG HER AND LET ME OUT!!!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it hadn't been for my girlfriend I would have walked out of this film. And that would only have been the second time in my life... I'm pretty new to Von Trier. I know his reputation and status, but until recently I didn't know his work. A few weeks ago I saw Breaking the waves on TV and was impressed, so when it came to picking a movie last night we chose Dancer in the Dark.After Breaking the waves and some great reviews here we expected quite something. The film tries to be two things: a moving drama and a musical. The problem is that the musical scenes are so absolutely dreadful that they completely spoil the drama part. And the drama part is so serious you can't take the musical bits as a parody.The last scene could have been a pretty moving one, if only I could have taken it serious. Instead I was very happy it finally was the last song and I could head for the bar.I'm not a big fan of Bjork (I still prefer the Sugarcubes), but her acting really isn't bad at all. If only the rest of the cast could sing as well as she can act....</fullReview>

I suggest you read their comments too and make a judgement as to whether or not to watch.If you really have nothing better to do, it just might be worth the risk of wasting 2 hours of your life to watch it Perhaps they should remake and recast her.No wonder shes never going to act again.save your money and by one of her CDs instead</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bjork pwns, an engaging experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the weirdest/quirkiest and also most fascinating people on the Earth: Bjork. Well, based on her work and interviews of course. She's so innocent and spirited, like a child, in her own dreamland half the time but also one of the most uncompromising and exploratory artists/musicians I can think of. Unique and powerful music (for me at least). At times almost hardcore I reckon; most of her music is far from fluffy or cute although she can certainly do that as well. Anyway, she carries a lot of the weight (?) of the film and it works very well. I guess everyone's beautiful but her character's sad/lonely beauty stuck out for me.Anyway, what do I know? I find it surprising that anyone could dislike this movie (or Lars von Triers' style). The cinematography wasn't distracting or self-conscious at all for me. It effectively got you in there, intimate wid dem characters. Like a documentary. It doesn't generally seem to follow the rules of Hollywood (for example you can't tell how long shots (or gaps between spoken lines) will last)). It's more akin to real life. Natural and intuitive. No conscious rules.According to Ebert (and probably common sense), the plot isn't very appealing or realistic by itself. But who cares? In terms of performances, they're so natural. It doesn't seem like acting at all. A couple of moments I found quite shocking and all the shifts in pace just seemed right. Y'know, like tension builds up, emotions are running high, something suddenly happens, there's an adrenalin rush, time's starting to mess about, you make quick choices and might end up bringing out side of yourself that you didn't know existed, and then eventually it's over and you feel kind of blank, gradually the heart-rate lowers and the real world comes back into focus, you're lost for words, sort of frozen to the spot, no idea what to do next. For instance.Why do we watch movies? I don't know if this movie changed me but it had a deep effect on me. I don't know if I really learned anything. I certainly enjoyed observing various details (that seemed truthful and spontaneous because of the style), and just taking it all in. I loved the music. Worth seeing for the music alone if you ask me (but the style won't appeal to all). Plus, if you like anything a bit off-centre or dreamy or "different", this is pretty much a must.Who isn't afraid of death? I liked how this movie sort of tackled the situation (facing death) pretty head-on. An average of, what, 3 deaths occur in the average movie? But when do they actually bring you to ponder it or really feel it? This one doesn't offer up any particular answers and its "point" is left open. You gotta bring it. But it follows through so determinedly that you can't avoid it. It's pretty scary, really. And unforgettable.Personally, I was reminded of times when I almost wish I didn't have any emotions. We didn't choose to be born and hence to potentially experience pain and/or death. One could argue you become responsible for yourself soon enough but it still seems somehow unfair in certain ways. But I guess life can also be fun so it's balanced and we should just make the best of it and be grateful to have it at all. Perhaps the problem is people *do* shut off their emotions (due to fear (of death or illness or in general)) and that's why they become "boring" and eventually kick the bucket. Stupid generalising's a bad habit of mine...Back to the movie, I see it as quite an experience. In terms of escapism, it's very effective in taking you on a journey. Only partially is it a fantasy though (the songs). Otherwise it is very dramatic. I enjoy the dark intensity because I'm interested in acting, taking myself to emotional extremes and whatnot. Its sincere and the filmmakers come across as talented and experienced. It tackles some "tough" subjects. It laid down some pretty vivid memories for me. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 (that I can think of) was that it is still comparatively artsy; it doesn't have the universal appeal that movies like The Dark Knight or The Godfather have. It doesn't really have their complexity or ingenuity either but it's got originality and power. And 'thas the stuff of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Director Dancing With Himself...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't know about you, but I always cringed when Dean Martin would start singing in those old Martin and Lewis comedies; and my flesh would crawl whenever Bing Crosby opened his puling puss during a hilarious Bob Hope movie.Nothing's changed. It's not that I don't like musicals, or even musical numbers ? hell, Jesus Christ SUPERSTAR is a classic, Johnny Depp brought a modern razor flair to SWEENEY TODD, and SOUTH PARK: BIGGER LONGER AND UNCUT is a triumph that even Academy Award-winning composer, Stephen Sondheim, acknowledges. I just can't stand DUMB musicals. Lars von Trier's DANCER IN THE DARK has so much to offer as a drama ? and keeps putting its foot in the puddle of Dumb Musical. There is so much high-browed commentary and hype about the artiness and influences and filmic ingenuity of this movie that everyone seems to forget that if it does not entertain, it fails. This is not a high-browed commentary - that would put it in the same league as the film itself: self-indulgent, art-house, mildly retarded and strangely psychotic. Selma (pop singer, Bjork) is a single mother who immigrates to America with her young son in 1964, believing - as so many do - it will fulfill her dreams of glamour and excitement. Instead, she finds herself working a dead-end job in a factory with a friend, Kathy (underused Catherine Deneuve), living in a trailer on a policeman's (David Morse) property and fending off the advances of a big dumb galoot (Peter Stormare). She is also slowly going blind. She discovers her son is suffering from the same ailment - which can be cured for the right dollar amount. Welcome to America. Selma is so enamored with Hollywood musicals that she fantasizes she is IN them at odd intervals, writer-director von Trier throwing large old-school production numbers that will either put you to sleep or have you on your feet applauding their audacity. I don't think I snored. "In a musical, nothing dreadful ever happens" ? guess she's never seen Les Miserables or Miss Saigon. And I guess the crucifixion in J.C. SUPERSTAR was a walk in the park. One night, Selma and Bill confess secrets to each other: he tells her he is broke and fears his materialistic, shrike wife (Cara Seymour) might leave him; she confesses her escalating blindness and shows Bill her candybox cash savings for her son's operation. And David Morse, whom we find hard to visualize as a bad man at the best of times, does a bad, bad thing... DANCER IN THE DARK won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, so it is by no means a bad movie. We all like a little envelope-pushing when it comes to art, until the envelope-pushing becomes the sole point. Von Trier seems to contemptuously thumb his nose at as many filmic conventions as possible, yet uses established story tropes to hook us: the desperate friend who needs money; the infantile, trusting woman saving money for an operation; the frustrating courtroom scenes where Selma keeps a silly promise at the cost of her life and where a few simple arguments from her lawyer would have saved Selma's neck. And there's that flesh-crawling courtroom musical number. Sorry, but von Trier is simply dancing with himself. In a sense, the musical numbers hammer home Selma's disconnection with harsh reality. For all those people who believe that love is as portrayed in a Julia Roberts movie or that success is as portrayed in a rock star biopic, Real Life is waiting to tell you no. "In a musical, nothing dreadful ever happens." Not counting the musical itself... How do you solve a problem like Selma? A flibbertijibbet! A will-o'-the wisp! A clown!--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

Either the main character is a nice, albeit whimsical lady, or she's a psycho as well.Up till this point, the movie could have gotten a 7/10 depending on where the story went. Now a 5/10 is about as generous as I'm willing to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulative, horrible &amp; boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDb, now you can imagine how annoyed I was by this movie. I don't understand why everyone loves it, is it because the execution scene makes them cry? or because the incapability of the protagonist makes them pity her? I don't know. They didn't work for me.First of all, the whole storyline is awfully manipulative. A woman with a disease that gradually blinds her gives birth to a child while she knows he'll have the same problem. Then goes on a mission to save money for his operation. She's half blind, working with machines that could kill her for the sake of her child. This is where the director lost my sympathy for Selma. If she really cares about her child, she should stay alive to be able to save more money. Just the fact that she was poor and miserable couldn't fool me into having sympathy for her.Besides the director failed to get my sympathy for Selma because I never know why she didn't stay with her family, why did she immigrate and why is she not choosing a less dangerous work? I find her stupid and I have no sympathy for the stupid.What Selma is looking for is not sympathy but pity. People offer to help her, she refuses. She refuses to get a lawyer, refuses to defend herself in court by saying the truth. So why pity someone that doesn't want your pity/help/sympathy? She unreasonably wants to be on her own, so let her *be* on her own. I have to say that the execution scenes were moving (up to that point I wanted to give this movie a 1). But it was irrelevant to the whole storyline, it could have been any convicted person. No difference for me.I like Bjork's music, but her acting was awful. I don't know if we were to believe she's semi-retard or not but she's definitely not as good an actor as a singer. This is not to mention how awful the musical parts were, my ears were almost bleeding.In the end, Selma was a stubborn, stupid daydreamer who killed someone for no apparent reason and refused to defend herself in the court. Do I find her a heroine? No. Do I have sympathy for her? No. Did she annoy me and get on my nerves for almost 2 hours? Hell yes!</fullReview>

I found Bjork convincing in her role and the script ultimately touching. The songs were not what I'd expect of a musical, but then I wouldn't expect Bjork to star in one either. I found myself admiring the Bjork character throughout and felt great sympathy for her towards and at the end.Dancer in the Dark is 'different' to any musical I'd have expected.

		<shortDescription>A creative and emotionally powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unusual dark drama-musical film. The screenplay has some weaknesses, including Selma's character, however the visual creativity and Bjork's incredible acting performance make this a memorable and moving film experience. I have never seen an acting performance quite like the one Bjork gives in this film. It is unusual in technique and style, as Bjork is not a trained actress. Written and directed by Lars Von Trier, from Denmark, the film was shot in Sweden and Denmark, with the exception of one brief scene. This is because of Lars Von Trier's fear of flying. The story is set in 1964, in Washington, USA. Selma is a single mother of a young boy who lives on the property of a local couple. Selma works in a washbasin factory and is secretly saving money for an operation to save her son's failing eyesight. Selma is slowly going blind and wishes to prevent this from happening to her son. She has left her home country of Czechoslavakia because of the vision saving surgery available here. Selma has befriended the couple on whose property she lives and pays rent. The husband (Bill) of the couple confesses a worry and concern to Selma one evening as she confesses her secret of slowly going blind. Ultimately, Bill betrays her trust and sets up a very bad situation. Both Selma and Bill are weak minded and desperate people who will collide in a terrible situation of mutually opposing personal needs.A criticism of the film would be Selma's weak minded character put in a bad situation. Lars Von Trier has written similar weak female characters in his films prior to this, such as "Breaking the Waves" (1996). Some may not like the use of hand held cameras here, as in his previous films. There is also the unique setup of 100 stationary digital cameras used here, specifically for the musical daydream sequences of Selma. Overall, the film has the look and feel of a home movie/documentary. As her co-worker and friend, the esteemed French actress Catherine Denueve gives a strong supporting acting performance in the film. Two particular scenes in the film with Selma, are two of the most heart wrenching and anguish filled scenes I've ever experienced in a movie. These two scenes are indeed difficult and painful to watch. Though a creative, but slightly flawed film, Bjork's powerful acting performance is what is best about this film.Film music by: Bjork. Winner of the 2000 Cannes Film Festival Palm De 'Or (Best Picture) award and Best Actress award for Bjork.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The drastic changes between the story and the visionary scenes involving dance and music were truly wonderful. However, the film fails beyond that. The story was rigid and uninteresting demanding the actors continue the vapid story to its end without any imaginative quality. Stock writers must have been used to write the main narrative as it lacked anything of interest for the viewer or the actors. There are so many beautiful writers and directors in the world who can create the same themes that Lars van Trier projects, but with much better creativity and beauty. As much as I enjoyed the thought of changing between narrative and illusion and the execution of the latter in this film, the narrative was abusively dull and painful and boring to witness as a moviegoer.This is an addendum. After watching the film again years later, I find my earlier comments quite accurate. There are moments of useful content present (beyond the lovely illusion vignettes of Bjork) but the film is plainly awful otherwise. Are there really no filmmakers who can challenge and make an effective film? Oh. Yes there are. But they're not Lars van Trier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful, if overrated, film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark is known as one of the most traumatizing movies ever made. It follows the story of Selma, a beautiful immigrant workaholic who is impossible not to like. She is slowly going blind, and is struggling to make enough money to cure her son of the same genetic condition before he suffers her same fate. A beautiful, hopeful woman in a dark world, Selma often imagines her life to be a musical and daydreams when things become unbearable. And believe me, things quickly become unbearable. Selma is tricked into murdering her landlord, who has stolen every last penny she has saved for her son's operation. She is arrested and put on the fast track for execution, unable to create a believable defense because it would jeopardize her son's operation. Björk performs wonderfully, making her character so sweet and kind-hearted that you want to hug her and tell her everything will be okay. The rest of the cast also turns in an incredible performance. The musical sequences and brilliant and fun, and their contrast to what is actually happening allows the viewer to absorb the horribleness of her life much more effectively. Unfortunately, this film suffers from going overboard. The story is inherently sad enough, but the director seems to not want to err on the side of subtlety. Her trial is one-sided, her only friends turn on her, and events keep stacking on top of each other to the detriment of the film. When she is called a dirty Commie, you laugh at the absurdity of it instead of realizing the social implications the director intended. This film is beautifully shot and performed, and indeed it is difficult to watch. However the errors made by the director are so frustrating that you find yourself wishing this movie could have found it's true potential instead of being immersed in the film. Overall I give this film a 7/10.</fullReview>

The normal cuts and pastes involved in film, don't seem to apply. It's seamless.But I can say no more about mechanics. This film is an honest taste of life, filled with the passions of each character involved. (And it does much of this without dialogue...much to credit of the actors, as well as the writer, obviously humble, in a wonderfully, creative way.) This film examines the plight of every person on the globe, without ascribing too much blame on any party. It's easy to create adversity through characters that are obviously despicable, but much more artful to paint souls from chaos. This films aches the question...Is there order? And then, does it answer? I think it does...It says...It doesn't matter how fast you spin...It's how tightly you hold on.Much more to say......but watch the film -Brian Hillin (PROFOUND PRODUCTION)</fullReview>

Having seen it before everyone else, I knew that I was taking an enormous risk of people hating it and walking out. But the group stuck with it all the way."Dancer in the Dark" shocked us, including myself watching it for the third time that day. Several people were in tears. Others are shocked and amazed by the film's intensity and the songs' roles. We are really marvelled by how Selma (played by Bjork) sacrifices her life and her dignity for her son's vision and future. Overall, people in my group loved "Dancer in the Dark."This film is so intense and gut-wrenching that it does not gently tap my emotions. It penetrates into my heart like a sword piercing through a body in one blow. It fabulously depicts how people's conflict can break down love and community. It also challenges us to reflect on how much we can give ourselves to the ones we love the most."Dancer in the Dark" is not an easy film to sit through. I am glad that I did (more than once) because it is such a powerful film about love, sin, and dignity. This is a big risk, big reward film for people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true heroine, who acts unselfishly and with complete integrity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dancer in the Dark, a wonderful tragedy, is the most emotional film that I have seen in many years. The star, Björk, the pop singer from Iceland was originally hired to write the music but the director, Lars von Trier, was so impressed that he cast her in the starring role. It was her first and, according to her to be her only film ever, was magnificent in the role.Selma Yeskova (Björk Gudmundsdottir) is a very sweet young mother who is totally devoted to her young son. The musical aspects of the film are her fantasies about what life should be like. She is going blind and she has been working overtime and saving up money, as quickly as possible, to get enough to pay for an operation to prevent her son, Gene, from going blind from the same hereditary illness. Her closest friend (and protector) is Kathy. Jeff would like to woo Selma but she has a mission and so has no time for romance. Her neighbour and landlord, Bill, is a policeman whose wife spends money wildly believing that Bill had inherited a lot of money. Bill fears that if she finds out that he is poor and is deeply in debt because of her spending, she will lose interest in him. When Selma confides in him about her savings, he steals the money. She confronts him and tries to take back the money, which leads to drastic consequences.The story sounds very bleak but there are actually many very touching moments. Selma is a true heroine, who acts unselfishly and with complete integrity. Her life is grim but inspiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'm not sure anything I'm about to say would be considered an actual "spoiler", but I figured better safe than sorry. So anyway, just about everything that needs to be said about this film has already been said, so I just wanna make a couple points.First, most people seem to understand the significance of Bjork's performance. Personally, I'd go far beyond the "she's great" comments, and add that this is easily one of the top ten (or higher) performances by any actor in any film . . . ever. Not talking so much about the admittedly strange musical/dance numbers. I'm talking only about the rest of the film. Bjork is as close to perfect as is humanly possible. To those handful of people who don't understand what they're witnessing in this film, who have gone so far as to actually make negative comments about her performance, I don't even know how to respond. At first they made me angry, but now I just feel sorry for them.Also, the emotional quality of the film. Like a lot of other people who've commented on this, I VERY rarely let a film get to me. But there were a handful of scenes in this one that just . . . Actually one of the scenes is virtually unwatchable: When Selma is sitting on her bunk (on Death Row) trying to hear the music through the air duct, and starts singing "Favorite Things". It's hard to even write about it. Believe what others have said . . . do NOT expect to feel good after you see this film . . . not immediately afterwards, and maybe not for a few days.Finally, some people seem to have a problem with this film being somewhat "anti-American". All I can say is "Waaaahhhh!!" Are we that insecure as a nation that we can't take a little criticism? It's not like we don't (quite often) DESERVE the badmouthing we get, ya know. Especially right now . . . right now it's lucky we have ANY friends left in the world.Oh, and about my subject heading: Sometime the Academy Awards get it right, but more often than not it's like we see here. The movie as a whole should have at least been considered. And Bjork?! If this wasn't deserving of a best-actor (or "actress" I guess they like to say) nomination, then the award is meaningless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ack! I was disappointed. Odd, goofy movie IMO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it just wasn't what I expected, but I found Dancer in the Dark quite aggravating. The song and dance numbers were okay--although there were so many and they were so lengthy, that I found them invasive--but I was far more attracted to and interested in the regular story.The main character also got on my nerves--her wacky smile and weird looks and vocalizations. To me it was obvious that she was mentally challenged, and that made the courtroom scene and verdict very unbelievable. The horrible irony, the inevitability of the tragedy---this was absorbing. But not enough of the film was satisfying for me even though there were bright spots--such as Morse's character. I didn't think Deneuve was very good in her role at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a very good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've avoided watching this movie for years because I was told it's devastatingly sad and emotionally draining. True. And I'm very pleased that I finally took the time.This is a sad story. Its sorrow cuts deep. It tackles a number of serious subjects including poverty, illness, suicide, betrayal, murder, and capital punishment. But above all else focuses on betrayal.Selma, the lead character, is going blind. She lives in a trailer with her son who shares the same condition; though he doesn't know he too may become blind in the near future. She works in a factory and saves every penny for an operation to save her son's sight. She's makes the mistake of letting this secret out to the landlord of her trailer. Not good, because he's having money trouble. He steals. She kills. And gets death by a jury.But it's more complicated than that. Of course. She has a couple opportunities to spare her life, but chooses not to. This is the single most difficult area of the story. And this is where many people will throw their hands up and quit caring.The theme of Selma hopelessly choosing a direction of self-sacrifice to the worst degree will emotionally jerk the viewer. Like being on a small boat at sea, if you can't stomach the waves, you may get a little sick.This may be a good time to mention that this film a musical. That this film is also melodrama. Interesting combo. Most people are use to the regular melodramas such as Schindler's List or The English Patient. But this is way different. And the music is beautiful; ties the movie together. What an original and wonderful idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big winner here, particularly if you like you happen to like innovative music and don't mind "passion projects". The film is original and brilliant, yes, but undeniably depressing as well. The pace is really uneven which actually helps out, just as you're starting to wonder when things are going to get interesting, they get far more off the wall that most are prepared for. This is all managed while a tragedy of human greed, love and desperation is laid out to make us all feel, well, quite crappy about the human condition, sorry for Selma, and kind of angry. 'Dancer' and its makers deserved all the golden statues it got (and most of the ones it didn't). As I don't want to be responsible for anyone jumping over their balconies, so I feel obligated to warn you that this is really, truly not a feel-good romp of musical goodness. Maybe pass on hiring this one next video night if the whole point of films is to cheer oneself up over a weeks worth of salty snacks. Try 'Waiting for Guffman' instead your concerned about 'Dancer' bringing on the tears. It's no wonder Bjork swore off acting after making this film. I'd have lost it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film during a Visual Theory and Technique class on my campus. I didn't know what to expect at first. It started off as being a very realistic film, which was boring me on one level, but as soon as the film went into Selma's vision of the world around her, I felt a deeper connection to the character and her ideals.Selma's love, dare I say obsession, for musicals really brings out my feelings for her. Then there's her devotion to her son and the well being of his future life over her own life in the present.When compared to the dulled sense of color in reality, the presence of saturated color in the musical portions of the film really brings out the beauty of Selma's feelings for musicals and the faith she has in the American ones since "nothing bad ever happens in them." It's all very beautiful, the viewers are seeing her musical world not through the vision of her eyes, but of her mind where increasing blindness cannot follow.I am also impressed with how the film comments on America's legal system and criminal justice.Overall, it's a beautiful film, though it can be confusing for those who aren't into the fantasy world of musicals since the story cuts between reality and what Selma is seeing in her mind. Unless one is in synchronization with Selma's thoughts, the musicals can be very strange and out of place in the film, causing a reaction going along the lines of "What the..." or "Not again..." Despite that, I would not like anyone to miss out on this film if they every have the opportunity to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very strange film. People dance in a factory for no reason. People dance on a moving freight train for no reason. This is carrying artistic license too far. The story line makes the heroin allow a friend to force her to kill him. Even though she is totally blind she doesn't want anyone to know it. I didn't watch this film to its conclusion.What amazes me is that this is the same author/director who wrote and directed Breaking The Waves which was an outstanding film to say the least. Evidently success went to the authors head and he began to think everything that came from his pen was brilliant stuff. Unfortunately such is not the case. So you have been warned.

		<fullReview>The only thing disturbing about this film is how bad it is.I know what makes an audience cry - just needlessly victimize a character and keep it up for an entire film.. throw in a few clichés and away you go. Wow. I could get a fluffy bunny rabbit, slowly torture it on the screen and that would make you cry, wouldn't it?I think that this film shows nothing but contempt for its audience. It is meant to be a vehicle for Bjork's singing, but even that is handled in such a pretentious manner it ruins it for me.The plot was incredibly thin and predictable. Are we really meant to believe what happens on the screen? It's set in America, and it is so obviously not in America at all. Bjork's accent is terrible. The film is incredibly anti-male; all male characters are seen in such a one-dimensional, negative light. Feminist radicals would have to love this film!Von Trier's Dogma95 ideals were in full force but instead of creating compelling cinema, it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Can't wait to watch it in 20 years time and see how badly this has dated.I found this film shallow and cynical, and also somewhat stifling... in the end I was pleading - put her out of her misery please! It did not move me or make me cry, the only emotions I got was that of detachment and boredom, plus relief once the whole sham was over. This film was so overtly manipulative, I just could not get into it.Disappointing. Could of been something special.</fullReview>

I enjoy an intellectual aspect as well as good direction, cinematography and acting. This film had none of that. I can only assume that it has risen to fame on the over-inflated reputation of Lars Von Trier. It lacks drama and the storyline is depressing, character motives are bizarre and non-sensual, direction and hand-held camera-work is shonky and the acting is DIRE. Catherine Deneuve is the only exception in a array of otherwise stilted, wooden performances. I respect Bjork as a musician, but in future she should rather focus her talents in that area.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DANCER IN THE DARK (2000) ***1/2 Bjork, Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, Peter Stomare, Vladica Kostic, Cara Seymour, Jean-Marc Barr, Zeljko Ivanek, Udo Kier, Stellan Skaarsgard, Vincent Paterson. Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's daring, `Dogma'-tic depiction of sacrificial lamb in the form of going-blind, single mother/factory worker Czech immigrant Selma Jezkova (Iclandic pop singer Bjork in an outstanding, memorable film debut - and reputedly last time on the silver screen) circa 1950s Washington state, borderlines mysogynistic sadism and placating the adage of ignorance being bliss in this tragic quasi musical. &gt; Riveting and maddening at the same time (largely thanks to the audacity to jump to haunting musical moments out of nowhere) it is unique in its deliverance of a semi-innocent character that one feels needs some type of protection from her doom and a righteous anger as the script betrays her along the way. Fantastic use of film stock color depletion/enhancement (the latter during the musical moments) by cinematographer Robby Muller and von Trier (employing over 100 digital cameras) gives the fairy tale quality a punch of surreality. Deneuve gives another beautiful performance as Selma's best friend and co-worker who tries to keep her charge from harm. Operatic and Greek tragedy in delivery with some humor sprinkled makes for a cringe-worthy, throat constricting time by the film's heartbreaking climax and unmistakably memorable ending that will haunt you long after viewing. Tough to watch; impossible not to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So fragile, your eyes might break it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We open with Selma (Bjork) rehearsing a dance number from "The Sound Of Music" for the first time. She struggles with synchronizing the dance movement with the vocals, and looks quite clumsy. This scene can summarize the rest of the film: A helpless, tattered woman trying to make ends meet. Selma emigrates from Czechoslovakia in an attempt to find a doctor to perform eye surgery on her son, Gene. She finds herself working in a factory, obviously being exploited in her unfortunate disposition. Her landlord also exploits her after attempting to guilt-trip her into lending him money that he eventually takes it from her. Later, Selma ends up on death row, trying to make sure promises are kept, and Gene gets his surgery. There are some holes in the story, but those put aside, this movie is flawless.Bjork gives the performance of the decade, hands down. She sacrificed her body and soul, and lent them to Selma, living and breathing through her for a year of her life. She truly comes to life on screen, shining, and begging for attention. What makes her character interesting is how much sympathy we feel for her, despite her extreme selfishness. As she's exploited, she in turn, exploits other people, but for just causes. David Morse evokes emotion from the viewer, along side Catherine Denevue and Peter Stormare. A spectacular cast.What pushed the film the most, was it's wonderful post-Dogma cinematography intertwined with more conventional, live performance camera work. Selma's life is captured through a hand held DVcam, giving the film a documentary feel, and in turn, lends itself to intimacy. When we cut from real life, to her daydreams (the musical aspect of the film) we switch to a color rich, stable, beautiful conventional filming, that emphasizes the distinct line between reality and imagination.This film demands a lot from the viewer, in the sense that one has to sit through the whole thing. It's extremely heavy, and has traumatized myself, and several other people I have spoken too for several days. This film isn't for everybody, it doesn't stop for anyone, and is unrelenting, but it wouldn't be the same if it weren't. This is a film for anyone who loves to escape into worlds that spill with emotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incompetence misconstrued as talent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With my expectations raised after the praise this movie received at Cannes, and based on some of the glowing reviews to be found on this and other sites, I was prepared for a challenging and innovative piece of filmmaking. Instead what I saw was a work teetering on the edge of incompetence, whose bare integrity was bought through the inclusion of the talented Bjork.The jittery camera work, location lighting, rough editing, video tape(?), and unconvincing writing are all parts of Trier's purported desire to get beyond Hollywood production values, beyond the slick and high-dollar setups whose economics (usually, anyway) go hand in hand with dumbed-down and empthy themes. The idea apparently is that once you've freed yourself from the constraints of traditional filmmaking, you free yourself up to capture more spontaneity and authenticity. Also, this allows the independent film maker to pursue his/her vision without the compromising and everpresent threat of running over budget, a notorious problem with most film productions.Nice in theory, but in von Trier's practice, an execution that ruined his film, in my view. The camera work continuously calls attention to itself and often defies the natural attention of the viewer. Instead of presenting us with a new attentional logic (an interesting idea in theory), the effect is that of a 10 year sneaking his dad's camera out of the house to film his friends play the role of actors on a set. The point is to have fun at the moment, not worry about how the film will look when it's shown. It's as though the camera operator hadn't previously seen the script. Once again, an intriguing idea in theory, but in this case it had a decided feeling of amateurism.The script was remarkably poorly written at points and immediately envinced memories of grade B movies and first draft scripts I've read and critiqued. Situations and emotions at a number of points were thrown in either unearned or outside of any inherent logic in the story.But then, here's the biggest mystery--it's popularity with some critics. This can be explained in part by the common desire on the part of the sophisticated film watching public to experience greater authenticity, truer drama, better acting and risk-taking in the making of films. von Trier's violation of standard film making practices has the theoretical appearance of such a film, and this "optical illusion" probably swayed some early critics, but this appearance is easily confused with the reality. Sometimes what passes for originality is merely a series of mistakes.von Trier's iconoclasm is not matched by an equivalent directing or screenwriting artistry. Maybe he has it in him yet, but this film is a showcase of how NOT to make a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Dancer in the Dark about three days before Gladiator cleaned up at the Oscars. Generally the Oscar luv-in isn't something that really concerns me (they're industry awards dahling) but the idea that a brilliant, pioneering film like this should barely register on the existence scale while a cardboard cutout, Russell-Crowe's-beard vehicle walks off with all the plaudits did leave me somewhat slack-jawed. Thank goodness for Cannes, such as it is.Ignore encouraging comments about the rebirth of the cinematic musical in Moulin (yawn) Rouge and Woody Allen's Everybody Says I Love You, this is how to make a musical at the 20thcenturydammerung. The music and its irrepressibly adjunct choreography feels fresh and dovetails into the narrative and its complicated moral and emotional layers. The acting can be a bit odd sometimes but Bjork is the pick of the bunch, surprisingly (a fact honoured by the Palme jury).8/10. Take tissues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What next? Dirty Harry: The Musical (Aka Dirty Harry Sings and Dances)?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A new breed of skilful and immensely talented movie directors, at the top of their creative powers, unleash their cinematic panoply onto the moviegoer without remorse, probably thinking that the whole corpus of video clip aesthetics can translate smoothly to the big screen. This was tried with mixed results by the French Nouvelle Vague in the 50's and early 60's. Thanks to those filmmakers, the film syntax was widened, no doubt, but nowadays only a handful of those movies are remembered as a rewarding experience.Dancer in the Dark, an aesthetical descendent of those streams, is a schizophrenic film that finally defeats itself by its incapacity to decide if it is death row drama, a musical, a portrayal of the American Dream turning sour or a harrowing depiction of moral predicaments. At the crux of this film, there is an interesting heartrending story, which, alas, is thoroughly marred by excruciating jerky hand-held camera work and editing (? la cinéma vérité or kinopravda), confined mise en sc?ne and the most inane and ill-timed musical numbers put on screen since the 1973 version of Lost Horizon or that epitome of musical idiocy and self-importance, which is The Apple.What next? I'm afraid that musical versions of Dirty Harry, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Silence of the Lambs -directed by Quentin Tarantino or John Woo I'd venture- might premiered in due time. Yet I'm looking forward to them, as they could reach the status of guilty pleasures or the midnight cult circuit. That would not be the case with the annoying Dancer in the Dark, which is not even kitsch.Surprisingly decent acting by pop singer Björk -whose thespian credentials pale when compared with the infamous swan-like outfit she flashed during the 2001 Oscar ceremony- and from the rest of the cast redeem the picture and step up its rating from a downright turkey to a 2/10.Proviso: If the musical scenes were to be removed (sort of a spectator's cut!!) the rating might be improved to a more than generous 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although very long, Dancer in the Dark is brooding, moody thought-provoking genius. It is sad and depressing, but meaningful, strewn together with great filmmaking by Lars Van Trier. Bjork stars as a woman named Selma. She is a timid and quiet woman trying to support a son working at a factory and carefully saving her money so her son can have eye surgery. It is a genetic problem; Selma is going blind, little by little, herself. After being taken advantage of, Selma goes on a long journey into the dark, which branches away from reality and she goes into her own world of musical fantasy. These scenes are of my favorite in the film. Bjork's original music is standout, and the cinematography changes to a lighter shade (on a very indie-looking DV). I loved Dancer in the Dark. As hard to watch as it is (especially its deeply disturbing final shot), it makes for one of the very best films of 2000.</fullReview>

The trial is like in a dream and not realistic at all. Selma must sing and if she can't sing she is hopeless. This movie has plenty of misplaced pathos and Selma has the psychology of a child of eight years old. When the movie was finished I took a deep breath and thought: thanks, it is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, but Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One cannot expect from Lars von Tier to do conventional movies - he is one of the best European directors. This film combines the melodrama with the musical story, with a candor reminding some of Woody Allen movies. However, the setting is much more realistic, and the story more direct and true than Allen's stories. I am not amazed that the movie did not succeed in the US, and American viewers do not seem to enjoy it. It is not only because it's such an European movie in psychological depth and pace, but it also shows in a not so good light the way the American society 'integrates' the new comers who do not fit in the competitive profile to be considered fit for the American way of life.Much of the film lies on the shoulders of Bjork. In my opinion she is fantastic in this movie. I do not care that she is not an actress, and maybe she will never play in another movie, or will not make a role of this level. What counts is that she is perfect in this film, in the role of the Czech immigrant, fragile and strong at once, candid and devoted.9/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stark, dark, serious film, with a wonderful performance by Bjork.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I made a comment on "Dancer in the dark" almost a year and a half ago, before I saw it, based on Bjork's performance of a song during a televised awards ceremony. My comments were not very complimentary because Bjork is certainly not a traditional singer. She has a very strange style, and makes some very strange vocal sounds at times. But then I thought more about it, and she is not too different from the great "singer" Bob Dylan. He can't sing either, but has a place in music history as what I call a musical poet. Bjork also has a place, and truthfully I came to enjoy her singing as I watched the film, because it fit her odd character so well.The film is stark, her character is going blind, all she values in life is her son, and trying to save up for an expensive operation that will save his vision. The jittery camera movement did bother me, some of it was unnecessary, while some of it amplified the mood of the film. But overall, now that I have seen it, I give it high marks, and a film that should be seen and studied by anyone who wants to be a serious student of film. Whether you like it or not, it is a very interesting film.Bjork's performance is truly outstanding. She must be a born actor, because she has no real film experience. The story is not so plausible, the script is so-so, there is virtually no background music, except during the 3 musical numbers integrated into the film. But Bjork's performance is in itself a good reason to see "Dancer in the Dark." Critic Ebert has a very accurate review of the entire film.</fullReview>

The difference between "touching" and "maudlin" is the amount of melodramatic effects involved.This movie is a scam from A to Z. The plot is silly, and Bjork's ingenuousness is FAKED. This girl hasn't got a spark of freshness in her: she's just a weirdo who thinks that ambiguity can replace talent. She would like to appear as the female version of David Bowie, but she's not.The pity is that I love European movies (along with American movies). But after this one and its incomprehensible worldwide success, it's odds on that many other European directors will try to use the same easy tricks.

But in the same moment I understand why people hate it.But in the end I´m more than glad to see, that the film made it into the IMDb's Top 250 list..For all those, who dare to watch the movie... Be prepared...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Includes spoiler.For the first time in my life I had the sudden urge to throw a movie across the room. "Dancer in the Dark" is everything a film should strive not to be. What bothered me most was the length of this awful, awful script. Two and a half hours of Bjork's character, Selma Yeskova, is pure torture. Selma is dull, dimwitted, and above all, downright ANNOYING! I jumped for joy when she marched to the gallows.I am deeply bothered that this movie earned so much praise from critics. Yes, Bjork's acting was beautiful, but her character was too annoying for anyone to care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard good things about this movie and especially the performance by Bjork. It was just horrible. I was never interested in the story, never interested in the characters. There was a artistic reason for the musical scenes to pop up from time to time but it was just laughably bad when they started to happen. I can't believe I watched the whole thing. I was happy about the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, absurd junk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without explaining to much of the plot behind this idiotic film this is what I can say.This movie INSULTED my intelligence. The musical numbers totally destroy the films mood, and Bjork is forced to sing with actors WHO ARE NOT SINGERS!! It was so drawn out, predictable, and absurd. The film went downhill SO fast, they make her a ridiculous tragic character beyond belief. Also when Selma is suppose to be at peak blindness, she still makes eye contact when she's talking to people (yeah that's believable).They OVERLY demonize her character in the courtroom, for the only purpose of which I think is to make everyone who saw this film think in absurdity. Now Bjork was good in the film (with what little she could do to save this garbage), and I do like her singing. She has a powerful voice and I enjoy some of her work a lot, BUT this film's story and drawn out premise is ridiculous, and goes on to long. This movie is also SO PREDICTABLE from beginning to end. By the time we got to the courtroom I kept saying to myself, JUST KILL HER ALREADY... I felt nothing for her and wanted her dead like all the other people who made this junk. It's no wonder people at Cannes were booing when they gave the Palm D'or award for this, now that's a tragedy.Rating 2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly emotive &amp; sometimes harrowing, but ultimately a superb film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Björk but shied away from seeing this movie as the plot of the film seemed sickly sweet &amp; for fear of finding out her acting may be lame. On an impulse I went to see it at the close of it's general release, and I'm so glad I did.The film has been described as a musical but I would disagree. To me it had an almost documentary feel due to the wobbly, slightly de-saturated. camera shots &amp; jump cuts. The musical elements are daydreams that just happen to be set to music.Initially the whip pans and jump cuts were distracting but you soon get accustomed to it. Interestingly enough the daydream (musical) sequences were all locked off shots and the colour vibrant.Dancer in the Dark is certainly not a feel good movie, but is extremely emotive. It's impossible not to feel sorry for Björk's character ?Selma' as she spends all her days &amp; nights working to save money for her sons eye operation before she herself goes blind from a hereditary disease. Björk is supremely suited to the role of Selma IMHO. Her child like innocence &amp; totally self-effacing attitude is exploited by one of the characters, which leads to a particularly harrowing twist in the film. All the characters are believable and the acting superb, the 140 minutes runtime of this movie sped by.Dancer in the Dark is definitely one of the best films I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to set your sights to one of the best films of the year 2000: Director Lars von Trier's masterpiece `Dancer In The Dark.' Even though the movie is somewhat of a musical, I definitely do guarantee that you have not seen this tone of movie song-and-dance before. The film stars singer Bjork as a factory-worker and a single mother who is at the brink of going blind. Her mission is to raise enough money for a visual operation for her son so he does not have to experience the same darkness that blinds her life. Bjork's acting in the movie has transformed her from pupil thespian to grand actress. Her work is the best acting I have seen so far this year. I was also not blinded by the fine work of the supporting players: David Morse, Catherine Deneuve, and Peter Stormare. And lets not forget Lars. Academy voters would be off-key if they don't recognize director Vons Trier's work. So step your way into your local movie theater and see the light of `Dancer In The Dark.' ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't bring it together: Catherine Deneuve and the hand-camera!... But this is not the only dissonance in the movie. On the one hand, I can understand the fascination effects (for the Cannes jury, for instance): This is something new, a whole genre (the musical) reinterpretated. And (some of) the musical scenes are really superb. But, on the other hand: it's nearly an hour, until the first of such scenes begin! And, the same complaint as for the director's "Breaking the Waves": the message (weak woman is dying for something, anything, everything else) plays with the form of christian conviction, without really hold its essence of religious sense. And, by the way: Bjoerk is not "a Goddess". 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from the music, which is at best only fair, this film suffers from a horrible script, an absurd plot, weak acting (save Bjork) and a totally unbelievable ending. I was really anticipating watching this film--I normally enjoy von Trier's work (Europa, Melancholia, Breaking the Waves) and was sucked in by the high 8.0 rating and all the awards it won. But now checking the other films that the fans of this movie liked, I should have been much more suspicious of the high rating. I have also now read some of the glowing reviews of those who felt this was a masterpiece. Clearly, their brains work much differently than mine and there is no accounting for taste in movies or music or any other form of entertainment--e.g. I can't watch a vampire, horror, or destruction film, regardless of the rating. I can honestly say was among my very worst film experiences. So base, I had to add this to IMDb--my very first entry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know this film was a musical, despite a singer as lead actress, and it was unusual to find out it was directed by Lars Von Trier (The Kingdom, Breaking the Waves, Dogville) who I knew more for shocking films, but this one was in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die and I was up for it. Basically, set in the 1960's in Washington state, young Czech mother Selma Jezkova (Golden Globe nominated singer Björk) has a great passion for musicals, and is rehearsing for the part of Maria in The Sound of Music, but she is slowly going blind due to a hereditary degenerative disease, this also affects her job working in a factory. She lives in a mobile trailer home, on the property of the local sheriff Bill Houston (David Morse) and his wife Linda (Cara Seymour), with her twelve year old delinquent son Gene (Vladica Kostic) who always seems ungrateful, talking to the sheriff she reveals her secret that she is losing her sight, and her life slowly goes downwards. Selma gains some positivity from her close relationship shy but persistent fellow factory worker Jeff (Peter Stormare), and friendship with fellow factory worker Kathy nicknamed Cvalda (Catherine Deneuve), but of course unable to see she is vulnerable to manipulation and getting by. This is evident when she is seen by Bill storing amounts of money in a tin she keeps in the cupboard, she is saving this money for an operation for his son who will develop the same effects of blindness as her, but Bill steals this money, and demanding it back he refuses to give the money, but he wants to die and tells him shoot him, she does do so. Selma gives the money to an institute where he son can have an operation, and then she is caught by the police for the crime of murder, questioned she only reveals the smallest details, and eventually she is convicted and given the death penalty, and Jeff and Cvalda get her money back to get a good lawyer to help free her. She refuses this help and would be rather die than have her son go blind, prison guard Brenda (Siobhan Fallon) does her best to comfort her as her fear of death gets closer, and even walking to the gallows she finds the ability to break out into song as she hugs other prisoners. Selma gets to the gallows, but suddenly collapses and is forced to be strapped to a board, as she becomes hysterical she is told by Cvalda that her son's operation was successful, being blind she is permitted at her request to be hanged without a hood, and in relief she sings, but is hanged before finishing. Also starring Cabaret's Joel Grey as Oldrich Novy, Vincent Paterson as Samuel the director, Jean-Marc Barr as Norman the shop foreman and Udo Kier as Dr. Porkorny. Björk is best known for her unusual eclectic style of singing in great songs like "It's Oh So Quiet" and "Play Dead", but she also proves a good acting talent as she plays the tragic victim to blindness and justified crime, the supporting cast is well chosen as well, what really makes this song and dance picture different is not just the picture quality, but being filled with happy and catchy tunes during dark subject matter, it is a terrific musical drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music, Original Song for "I've Seen It All" (also nominated the Golden Globe). Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holistically flawed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Been basically tracking this film down for a while and believing it was out of circulation in the UK at the moment, was delighted to find it in FOPP.Adored Breaking The Waves and after widening my movie diet in recent years to take in more 'challenging', foreign or so-called experimental fare, awaited this with baited breath. Sadly, I have to say that the accolades and high-ratings conferred are completely baffling. I don't know what else was out that year, or what could have perhaps seemed fresh or ingenious but overall it was too incoherent to enjoy even with some effort.At first the story seems credible but bit by bit becomes unstuck as each decision or display of feeling trumps the next for naivety. Compounding matters is the fact that the film begins to inject into the seemingly solemn hard-luck tale a jarring sense of ethereal whimsy, and 'music is all that we need' sentimentality.Abstracted from the film's story, Selma is sweet and pure but, like others have said, it is almost impossible to feel sympathy at the end. Someone mentioned that it was perhaps intended as a statement against the death penalty but for me it is too much of a caricature to realise such an ambition. When you read that she is 'accused' on the DVD box and see her first encounter with the cop, the whole thing is so predictable as to feel trite. Maybe it was an experiment in some sort of surreal tone but it feels superimposed, unlike, say The Science of Sleep, where the on screen invention reflects dream-like creativeness which is a trait of both characters in a film about dreams.Sometimes I feel it's easy to label something pretentious, indulgent or sentimental. Surely we are all pretentious when we get the chance? But in this case, if being sentimental is the 'unearned' emotion, then I would say that there's an element of that here. Overall, it just wasn't for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once seen, absolutely never forgotten.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dancer in the Dark" is one of the ultimate films that divides people. Some think that the film is manipulative and implausible, while others are awestruck and incredibly moved. When I first saw it, I had practically no knowledge of what the film was about and had virtually no preconceived ideas. When the film was over, I was not only fascinated, but stunned for days afterward. "Dancer in the Dark" is a film that has affected me more than anything else I have ever seen. What Lars Von Trier has created is the greatest example of on-screen emotion ever.The central character is Selma, played by Bjork in the role she was born for. Selma is a single mother from Czechoslovakia who has migrated to America with her young son, Gene. They both have a genetic disorder that will eventually cause blindness, and Selma is working herself into the ground to save money to organise an operation to save Gene's eyesight. When things get too much for Selma, she incorporates herself and her surroundings into daydreams of Hollywood musicals, which is her way of coping with her circumstances. Selma's landlord Bill is going broke and is afraid his marriage will be threatened if his wife Linda was to find out. He confides in Selma and, when they have both exchanged their secrets, Bill starts to get ideas of borrowing the money from Selma, which brings about serious repercussions."Dancer in the Dark" is absorbing, ambitious, beautiful and emotionally assaulting. It is a very artistic and pure film. It is so unconventional from other films, and is therefore not very popular. It is filmed using the Dogma 95 guidelines, which were established in Europe. These guidelines focus on making films in a relatively basic way. Hand-held cameras, natural lighting and shooting on location instead of using sets, are a few examples of the criteria. This technique is not something every audience will accept. A good deal of viewers will be put off by the sometimes chaotic camera-work and jumpy editing. But for those who can see it as an art form, it is a very welcomed style.This is certainly a film that deserves more recognition. Fans have heaped praise on it, but it seems in some ways, the film has almost been forgotten about. Even taking into consideration that the film may not be a hit with mass audiences, it's difficult to believe that this film is not available everywhere. But whether you love or hate it, it's boldness and originality cannot be denied. Lars von Trier is a director that is to be applauded. He is not afraid to be different, and "Dancer in the Dark" is impossible to forget.Bjork is a woman of incredible talent, and she is absolutely amazing as Selma and deserves all the praise she has been given. Lars von Trier and Bjork did however, clash during production, and the disagreements did take their toll, as some of the musical scenes let the film down slightly. But overall, the film is an overwhelming knockout. It is the kind of film that could make almost anyone cry like a baby. Oddly enough, my first response to the film was not tears. Though I felt almost traumatised and wondered how I managed to sit through it, I just didn't cry. The tears did come however, on repeated viewings.If you love art house films or are looking for something that is out of the ordinary, "Dancer in the Dark" is worth watching. As upsetting and unpleasant as it is at times, it is a film that should be seen, if you can handle it.</fullReview>

Come on, how much drama can a movie take? And besides all the depressing storyline, we also have to tolerate Bjork's screaming whinnings (that some people may consider music, but I don't). Everytime I hear her singing it sounds like a cat's being killed by a bulldog or whatsoever.Sometimes I think that no one enjoys or understands this kind of movies, but it is cool to say that you liked it , cause it makes you look kinda intellectual.

A critically acclaimed and much lauded film, "Dancer..." is a musical drama which demands the audience suspend disbelief at the whim of the director as opposed to being emotionally enticed and seduced. For those who can make the "buy in", the film will prove a powerful and compelling watch. For those who cannot, it will likely fall flat. Either way, one thing is clear.

		<shortDescription>The least significant of Von Trier's trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen almost everything produced by Lars Von Trier, several times, I have to admit some excitement at the chance to see his latest work.After the first 10 minutes, the film appeared flat to me and I was thoroughly unconvinced by Bjork's acting which diminished the film completely. It is not until the last 1/4 of the film that I felt that Bjork had gone beneath the surface of the character. I also had the very strong impression from her changed pallor and skin tone that Von Trier and/or the part had broken her psychologically. The acting is raw but without finesse.I later thought about Bjork's performance in comparison to Emily Watson in "Breaking the Waves" and Bodil J?rgensen in "The Idiots". Bjork's performance has a patina of "celebrity" and little else compared to the other 2 women who managed to wrench intelligence and passionate all-consuming devotion from their respective characters. They both had the necessary skill and emotional strength required to carry these central roles. Naive, yes but there was something else going on, some life force nurtured by the naiveté. In Bjork's character and acting, the naiveté is turned into an incomprehensible silliness without dimension.I found it painful at times to watch her amateurish performance and recalled the final scene in "Europa"/"Zentropa" with the lead character's slow drowning. Bjork gives us 100 minutes of on-screen drowning.I also found frustrating the move towards "White-Americanisation" of this work - a lack of serious intellect that infuses everything that Von Trier does. It might make it popular in the US but leaves me cold, like most of their fast food. For example "The Idiots" (performed in Danish) is the most serious in trilogy which just goes to show how dumbed-down English speaking audiences are in their film diet. Is it the English language that is becoming dumbed-down in film or just the scripts being produced?Standout performances were smaller parts of Peter Stormare as Jeff and Katrine Falkenberg as the prison guard, Suzan.One positive note from this film. I hope many people go to see it due to its apparent accessibility and enjoy it. With a bit of luck they will then go to the video store to watch "The Idiots" and "Breaking the Waves" to complete the trilogy and see the truly great cinema Von Trier is capable of with real actors rather than pop stars.With his long coveted Palme D'or under his arm, I am looking forward to more Von Trier brilliance demonstrated by his other work.I give this one 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dancer" has to be one of the most emotionally draining films to watch.I will skip the spoilers.I stayed clear of viewing the film, fearing that it would be yet another movie tailor-made for a singer who wanted to take a shot at acting, with bells and whistles attached to distract from their poor acting ability.Nothing could be less true when it comes to "Dancer in the Dark". It's candid-style feel, its silence, demands its performers to fill up the void with their talents. If you can't act, this is NOT the film you would want to take part in. Every fiber of your being is splayed out for audience viewing. Bjork either knew she could do it, or just took a gamble. It payed off enormously for us the audience, and for her.The story is simple, yet complicated. The characters are gray, but colorful. The film, not classified as a drama, nor a musical, nor a horror film, but somehow it manages to be all three, and balances nicely."Dancer" is simply an indescribable movie. Most will skip its classification and instead go straight to notarizing how many nerves it hit in them personally.How Bjork did not receive an Oscar for her performance, let alone a simple nomination, is blasphemous. "Dancer in the Dark" was ahead of its time, and had it been released now, when independent films are the mainstream, Bjork would have swept the Oscars.Bjork not only delivered on acting duties but she also delivered the film's soundtrack, and title score, a score that deserves a place right up there with those of "Star Wars" and "E.T." Word of warning: You may feel spent by the time you get to the conclusion of the film. It will stick with you awhile after viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...And the Oscar for this year's dumbest movie goes to Dancer in the Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch a lot of movies. Some I like, some I don't like. Very few of them have the ability to make me mad. However, Dancer in the dark made me mad simply because it was so stupid. I haven't had my intelligence insulted this badly since I watched NBC's Saturday night lineup. Six reasons why this movie sucks.1) It could've been told in 30 minutes (with commercials). There was no reason to stretch this boring plot over two hours. Pointless. It would've sucked in 30 minutes as well, but at least you would waste less time.2) The music. Ugh. I thought the worst thing about Bjork was her face. I was wrong. Her music surpasses that on the ugly scale by about 300 notches.3) The whole situation was stupid. Let me get this straight: Bjork was going to abandon her son and die because she made a promise to a man who held a gun to her head and stole every cent she owned? Her love for her only child was surpassed by her loyalty to a guy who tried to kill her. I think most mothers would respond the same way to this situation. Yeah right.4) The courtroom scene is so stupid. The Three Stooges "DisOrder in the Court" is a more accurate portrayal of the courtroom process.5) The music. I know I mentioned it before, but it really sucked.6) This is one of those movies that you're supposed to like. It's not a big Hollywood movie. It's supposed to be an artsy film that touches the soul, hence it's cool to like it. Listen up people, there is nothing cool about this movie! Yes, it's artsy. Yes, it sucks.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I am glad I've seen it only because now I can tell everyone I know how awful it is. In closing, let me say, "DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!" Not even on a bet. You're friends might tell you it's good. Don't listen. Real friends wouldn't tell you to watch Dancer in the Dark. I'm you're friend, and I'm telling you, don't watch it. You'll thank me later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Lars Von Tier movie i have seen, may be the last one. What is wrong with this movie? It's not the presentation, everything is filmed and shown over the top. It's not the music, catchy tunes with silly lyrics that aren't either good or bad,"just what there is" is exactly what they are. It's not the acting, every time Björk come into scene, i fell i need to hug her and tell her everything is gonna be alright. And all the cast is just splendid. It is all about the plot and the message, once the weird rural paintings vanish the first scene shows you exactly what this movie is all about.

		<fullReview>There is nothing that speaks against Dancer in the Dark apart from the fact that it made me feel miserable. The idea of making a musical is indeed charming, given the topic of the movie, as well as the broader context behind it.However, i started asking myself what drives Lars von Trier in trying to convince us how bad mankind is. During the movie i've seen his persistent effort to prove that. And it worked.The actors offer a fine performance, even Björk, whom i doubted the most. But again the feeling remains that the director wanted us to feel bad, although with the same determination he could have made a romantic comedy...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful tale about the big dream of America. I've first known the music, and listened it with so good feelings. makes me dream so well... The album is fantastic, but now when i understand what this 107 steps mean, I don't know whit what kind of feelings will i listen to it. The music talks about somethings else than what happens. Otherwise, it's just life. No one is evil, no one is perfect, just people, stubbling all around. The policeman's wife is my favorite, when she's in the court. She tells the truth, she's honest, but in the same time she's lying, the truth is not what she says. But what is truth. Someone is to blame anyway. This film smells like life. Loved it. Another great film from Lars von Trier!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't believe the emotions and sincerity Bjork put into every scene. She made ever scene seem to believable, like she had been acting for years and years. Bjork is a pro and should be rewarded for her skills and accomplishments at every opportunity. The supporting cast in this film deserved acclaim, as well. So many great performances!This film takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotions, with great cinematography throughout. The subtleness of the scenes evolving into climactic musical productions was brilliant and keeps the viewer riveted to the screen. Bjork's enchanting and mystical voice was enough to woo this viewer from beginning to end. A masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left my heart feeling throngs of emotions after the movie..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third Lars von Trier movie I've watched, and like the other 2 movies (Manderlay and Dogville), it left me with emotions that quietly surged in my heart. I found it slow moving at first, though as the film goes on, I didn't really want it to end. There were scenes whereby Director Lars von Trier had cleverly inserted in musical instances so as to break up the melancholy nature of that scene, as well as to add depth to the emotions which Selma is feeling. I've noticed that the musical sequences occur at instances whereby Selma feels uncomfortable or saddened or traumatised... it's when things are not comfortable that the musical sequences are added in.. it's like Selma actually runs into the world of the musical when dreaded things happen. Bjork is brilliant as an actress. She totally amazed me with her acting, her expressions, her ability to totally be in the character such that you would not know that it's some other person. Her songs are so haunting it just served to add an added element onto the film. I love the film, but as another reviewer mentioned, it's not a film i'll want to watch again anytime soon. Not until my emotions subside... which i suspect will take some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you hated Bjork before, you simply cant after seeing this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely one of the saddest, most tragic, unfair and moving film of this decade. The epic masterpieces like Lord of the Rings -trilogy or Kill Bill volumes (which are great movies in their leagues), could never move like this one.Danish Lars von Trier is one of the most interesting directors at the moment. His own dogma-movie Idioterne (Idiots) have probably made many people feel sick, but he has also given us some great cinematic moments to experience.In one of von Trier's best known movies, Breaking the Waves, there's been some excellent work on casting. The star of the film is a religious and naive girl in 70s Scotland, played by Emily Watson. She's one of the most sympathetic character's ever seen on screen. Similar character is then seen in Dancer in the Dark, four years later. The actor is Bjork, and she's at least as good as Watson. If you hated Bjork before, you simply cant after seeing this movie! Bjork plays Selma, an immigrant in America, in the year 1964. She has a rare disease, that would make her blind eventually. She doesn't want her son to have the same destiny, so she works all day and tries to get the money to fix his eyes.As Selma is nearly blind, all she has is music. She can make music in her head from any sounds she hears. In a way the movie could be a musical, but its too heavy to be watched as one. Selma's only friend is played by fantastic actress Catherine Deneuve (who by the way starred the musical, Umbrellas of Cherbourg in the year 1964). This is a very heavy movie to watch, and its hard to say what mood you should be on when you do it. But no matter what kind of mood you on, it will make you want to cry.Lars von Trier is at the moment working on his America-trilogy, which started with Dogville. He directed his Europe-trilogy before he had such popularity, what he has today. Highlight of that trilogy is unarguably the movie named simply Europa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must-See Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the musical number "I've Seen It All" online a few days ago, and after reviewing the scene about five times, and reading several different reviews, I went to B&amp;N the next day and bought this movie.Selma, the protagonist of the story, is a Czech who comes to America in order to be able to work and pay for an operation for her son, who is afflicted with the same eye disease where blindness is inevitable. Selma is a particularly proud woman, one who keeps her promises, even if they are made to unsavory people, and tries to protect her son from the truth - that she will go blind, and so will he - even to the very tragic ending of the tale.I love the camera work. The scenes that show Selma's reality are filmed on a hand-held digital camera, with less color than the musical scenes, supposedly symbolize the deterioration of Selma's vision. In the musicals scenes, the colors are vibrant and glowing, with various set cameras at interesting angles.Bjork's voice took me a little while to become accustomed to, as I am not a fan of her music, but she sang very emotionally, which amazed me, and added to the film quite nicely.I was sobbing violently by the end of the film, and was even surprised to see my brother (whom I have never seen quite so sad) sniffling and speaking with a wavering voice. This is a movie that I have recommended to everyone I have seen since I got this movie several days ago, even strangers at the check-out line.Go see it. =O</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still an immature writer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is, as of yet, a mindless writer. Or maybe too mindful of a writer. It sort of amounts to the same. Nonetheless, and it must be said as well, he is not too-shabby a director. This film moves heroically and it is beautiful to watch. The acting is superb, the hand-cam (although redundant) can be, at moments, used perfectly to invoke tension and create true cinematic ecstasy. All these things are wonderful. They envelope you. They are claustrophobic yet overpowering. He has already demonstrated his talent in many other films. He is inventive and stark. He conjures emotions in his films and that is a talent of few. The only problem is that he seems to be able only to conjure up, in his writing, one or two of these such emotions. He is intense, yet very limited. It seems he has very little to say after setting an insistently hopeless tone to his plots, which renders them stale with any distance. At first glance, I thought Dancers in the Dark was powerful thematically as well as cinematographically, but when I sat to watch a second time there was no way in hell I wanted to finish watching the movie. I did, which only made me angry and mistrust what I had previously liked. I have seen his other movies again since then. It has been a terrible disappointment. If he were a violinist, he would spend not only one movie, but several movies in a row without ever playing the A or E-strings. It seems he could spend a whole career composing minor diminished sevenths. Thus it is very difficult not to notice that he is manipulating every second of his movies. It is senseless to call a movie-maker, or an artist of any kind for that matter, a manipulator. It is the essence of his work. Yet, when the manipulation is overt, when his moves and decisions appear as obvious as, let say, seeing a crew member walk across the scene, things cannot be taken seriously. This is a manipulative piece, not because it manipulates, but because it seems like it does. Worse - it feels like it does. And in this respect, all the astonishing talent he may have looses out dramatically. This is not sad material. This is not melancholic stuff. The screenplay becomes like the drug that inhibits Trier's cinematic genius, his drive for tragedy, his pessimism. It is not pessimistic. It is bland. It ends up caged and claustrophobic, not to the viewer, but to the movie itself, and in all my second viewings I became uninterested. Was it shock-value what first worked on me? I don't know. It is my opinion, now that I have had the opportunity to see many Von Trier movies, that the literary intensity which he does have, this over-burning of his little head to write the perfect sadness, the perfect reality, just amounts to deep failure and infects the whole of his end result, which otherwise, and in great contradiction, is worthy of praise. I feel he'll be remembered, yes. And that he'll even be what one calls 'influential'. A little like the picaresque was for Spanish Literature, glorified by many which is obviously totally fine by me... but we await the true Quixote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the fact that I'm not a fan of musicals, I must admit that I loved this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody who is at least a little bit interested in the 'alternative' cinema and who is able to watch movies that don't necessarily need to contain a lot of big action shots, fast car chases or explosions, are already familiar with the name Lars von Trier. His name is some kind of label, a guarantee that the quality of the movie will be good, no matter how weird it may seem at first (think for instance of 'Dogville' which looked like a theater play). That's also why I already had this movie on my 'To-See'-list for so long. I really wanted to see it, but because it was never shown on television (this isn't the kind of movie the average commercial station wants to broadcast), I had to wait until today.Selma is a Czechoslovakian immigrant who has moved to the USA in order to get specialized and very expensive eye surgery for her son Gene. She is a single mother who works day and night in a factory in order to raise enough money so she can save her son from the same disease she suffers from. Her vision is deteriorating fast, she will go blind soon and she knows that he will face the same faith unless he gets that crucial operation in a couple of months time. The only reason why she can cope with all that misery is because from time to time - even though it's only for a short moment - she pretends to be in the wonderful world of the musicals that she likes so much. But when a desperate neighbor falsely accuses her of stealing his savings and shots are fired, her life takes a dramatic turn...Despite the fact that I was really looking forward to this movie, I was also a bit reluctant to watch it. That had nothing to do with my expectations. For once I didn't fear to end up disappointed, because I expected too much of it in advance. No, I had a few doubts about this movie because I knew this was some kind of musical and I'm not really a fan of that genre. Also the fact that Björk played a role in this movie didn't make me look forward to it. There are more singers who believe that they can act, but in reality are awful in it, and I feared the same might happen in this movie. But now that I've seen it I must admit that I was completely wrong to doubt about this movie. It was everything I wished for and even more.The acting for instance - including the performance of Björk - was outstanding. But she wasn't the only surprise. Catherine Deneuve too was very nice and interesting in this movie. I can't remember ever having her seen in another non-French movie, but in English she is just as charming. Normally I would make a remark about her obvious accent, but you could also see her as just another immigrant who worked in the same factory. That's why it never bothered me. But not only the acting was good, so was the entire script. At first I had a problem with the musical parts (remember my difficulties with the genre), but as soon as I started to realize that this wasn't a depiction of the reality, but instead one of her day dreams, I must say that I liked it.At first this movie seems to go for a happy ending, but that would have been a too easy option. Lars von Trier chose to give it a very powerful and emotional ending instead, but despite what you might fear, it's never corny. The entire script has been well-written, the acting is very good and offers some very nice surprises and the directing is perfect, although I'm convinced that some people might find it difficult to keep watching those nervous images that were shot with a hand-held camera. But don't let that be a reason not to watch this movie, because it is more than just a pleasant surprise. I give it a well-deserved 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing 'Dancer In The Dark' in a movie premiere several years ago, and being quite affected by it (the same with Zentropa). After that, I saw it open the Vancouver International Film Festival. I loved the movie once again, but one thing that I remember about that, is how many people left the theater in the middle of it, as if this wasn't their type of entertainment, and they're right, as DITD isn't for everyone.This film is all about Bjork essentially. She plays Selma, an immigrant who lives in a trailer whom she rents from a nice couple while she slaves away at the steel plant to raise enough money for an operation for her son's eyes. She dreams of this, and oh right, she also dreams of big Hollywood musicals. You see DITD is a musical in itself, and I can't say that I've never seen a musical that has music so organic to the story as Dancer In The Dark has. I mean, listen to the machines in the plant, listen to the train tracks. I haven't heard anything like this before, and the only movie I've seen it done since was Zatoichi, the blind swordsman.Filled with a great cast you probably never would see in a movie like this (Catherine Deneuve! Udo Keir! David Morse!) and although they don't quite reach the universe Bjork seems to be in throughout the course of the movie, they pull their weight. I really love this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this film a joke? Did the director decide to make a version of The Office and smother it in thick icing to feed it to fools as some deep, heartbreaking, sorrowful drama? Bjorks acting is ridiculously bad, and before you think this is a hater of her music having a rant, I'm not at all. I even have some Sugarcubes stuff in my collection having followed her so long. But this movie? It's bloody hilarious. I sat thinking I was watching the wrong film given all the wailing praises of it as being emotionally draining, horrific, and sad. Yes, it's sad alright, sad that so many tried to read into it's dull existence and see something that wasn't there. Is it just possible, that once a director gets the reputation for being so damn wonderful then his fawning sheep will baa along with anything he makes? Is that what's happened here? No one, and I mean no one, acts like Selma (Bjork) does in this movie. Like some sort of moronic child missing half her brain. This persona has carried Bjork (herself) through a long part of her musical career, where she acts all quirky and pixie-like but you quietly watch her and think to yourself, there's no way she gets on like this in real life. It's all an image she's concocted to project a cutesy little- girl-lost to the audience, so maybe this director bought it too, given that he's just thrown her in front of the camera and let her act quite dreadfully as (for all intents and purposes) her Bjork "character". How the hell this movie got so many 8, 9, and 10 ratings astounds me, It's absolutely dire, and this is from someone who likes her music. I felt nothing but the strong desire to laugh throughout the entire film. Truly a joke of a movie that made suckers out of thousands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American high school students laugh at the films of Hitler's speeches. They are told how his charisma allowed him to enchant the German people and lead them to war with the world, but they don't understand it because he doesn't appear charismatic to them. Indeed, if/when fascism comes to America, the charismatic leader will not act like Hitler, he will act American and conform to American ideas of what America should be. As someone who has known more than a few Germans, and has traveled and studied in Germany, I still do not understand the appeal of the mono-testicled Austrian. And although there are things I know about German history, politics, culture, etc. I still will not claim to fundamentally understand the German people. Lars von Trier has never been to America, but still condescends to possess the damning insights which may not heal us, but are surely intended to make us feel ashamed for simply being American, not for any cultural, historical, or political insight. Dancer in the Dark, a New Zealand film made by a Dane and starring an Icelander bares less resemblance to America than 300 does to ancient Greece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What seems to divide most people into the 'Loved It'/'Hated It' camps is that the plot is poured on a little thick. The melodrama didn't bother me; the story would have been right at home in Douglas Sirk Land. The problem that I had with 'Dancer in the Dark' was the execution. First and foremost, digital video is just awful, and making anyone sit through two hours and 20 minutes of it is unforgivable. The editing style serves no purpose other than to alienate the audience. And the musical numbers-what I had expected, as a Björk fan, to be the highlight of the film-were jarringly out of place within the context of the rest of what was taking place in the movie and were downright laughable. Von Trier has his followers (although Lord knows why), but I'm guessing even some of them would admit that he just does not have the chops to direct and/or edit musical sequences.Kudos to Björk, though, for turning in an extremely likable and sympathetic performance.</fullReview>

During dialogue scenes the camera would wander around as if the director didn't know it was turned on, or was perhaps unaware that he was making a movie. When people were speaking, one saw more of coat racks, elbows, and car doors than faces. More than half an hour of this was maddening.The camera work might have worked to some sort of effect had not the dialogue been poorly written. The characters in Dancer in the Dark were flat, seemingly drawn from an upper class European's ideas about American factory workers.The one bright spot in the movie was Bjork and her musical scenes. I read that Bjork was so disillusioned by the rigors of making this film that she never wants to act again. What a waste.</fullReview>

The Movie tries desperately to elicit a response that it comes of cheap. I can see a pattern in the Ralf von Trier movies: Take human misery an just shock people.If you have human misery as your theme then it should be believable or the audience will reject it. Because when confronted with difficult situations in life or in movies people will stop just having fun and start logically assessing if this is even possible.So here are a few points that bothered me: How can bill(the policemen) not have any friends or family to ask for money.

		<shortDescription>Bjork: The Falconetti of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinema of Lars Von Trier continues to be adored by ones and hated by others. This important figure of European cinema loves to collate his own fears, anguishes and revolts through his movies. The world of Von Trier is rough and wild, where we can never be comfortable and where is no redemption. There are no happy endings to soften the public. The reality is tremendous and unbearable, when we go down to the purgatory of human nature. As we follow Selma, a Czechoslovakian immigrant in the United States, we see a woman who fights daily to give her son the life that she can never have, while she is loosing sight until total blindness. The cause is a genetic disease that could be stopped with a surgery. But the surgery is expensive and she can only save for one. As the time passes she depletes herself in the factory where she works and dreams about musicals. In a way, is like her rough life could change into a everlasting all-singing and all-dancing number on some Hollywood classic musical. It's this passion that makes Selma's life bearable and that guides her in the worst times to the fantasy of a world where people sing and dance and where the joy never ends. When she returns to reality, the love for her child is the only thing that keeps her moving, working till exhaustion, even when her sight is almost gone. And when we think that this sacrifice will be rewarded, the life of this martyr is invaded with treason and deceit, beyond our worst thoughts. Since Dryer's The Passion of Joan of Arc that we couldn't see an expression so full of suffering. Bjork is the Falconetti of our time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable with good moments but not as emotional, meaningful or as inspired as the director thinks it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selma is a Czechoslovakian woman living in America with her son. She works at a factory and relieves the monotony by making music from the rhythms of the machines etc. She works day and night to save money to afford an operation for her son to treat a degenerative disease that would otherwise leave him blind in later life. However her eyesight is failing due to the same disease. When her neighbour steals her money, Selma accidentally kills him and faces losing everything.This is my first experience of the work of Lars von Trier although the dogma style of which he is so famous is not new to me. To complain of the style of the film alone is silly and I prefer to judge this on the basis of any film. On that note, I found the plot to be interesting on paper but only passable on film. It moves along reasonably well and is engaging but is not as good as it could have been. Part of this is that Selma is so saintly and perfect and the `tragedy' so tragic that it feels simplistic and unbelievable. It's a shame but everything is so `tragic' and simple that it fails to really spark as a story (witness Bill's calm measured plea's to Selma to see what I mean). That's not to say it lacks emotion ? the ending is very moving ? but most of it is too saintly and unreal to involve.The musical numbers are a nice touch that helps the film move along but they are not as clever and as fantastic as the director thinks it is. For a `fantasy' scene they are very ordinary and lack the spark and fun of a musical number. I found myself thinking of Woody Allen's musical numbers in `Everybody Says I Love You' and remembering how fun and well designed they were. Here they don't add very much to the film and, where Woody's use of actors singing (almost) all their own lines worked well, here some are awful.Björk is very good in the lead role. Overlooking the saintly nature of her character she does a really good job making the audience like and believe Selma. Deneuve is very good but is sadly underused. A host of American faces add weight to the film but mostly not much else. Morse is a good actor but his character is not real and is too emotionally detached. Stomare is good but dammit he cannot sing a note! A few other faces do good jobs in support.Without the necessary emotional acceptance of the plot and emotional involvement in normal characters the film becomes depressing rather than moving. It is still passable but the music numbers add nothing of value to the film. Many people will rave about the method used in the film and the deep significance the film has in their life but this is all very ordinary. The handheld style and cut edits are good at the start but soon the novelty wears off and it becomes a gimmick like on NYPD Blue etc.Overall Björk fans will enjoy her music and the plot will be sufficient to hold the attention, but is it as moving and emotional as advertised? Is it high art? The answers to both is unfortunately ? no.</fullReview>

She has a degenerative disease and is becoming blind. She works hard, including in the night shift, to save all the money she can get to permit her son Gene to be submitted to an eyes surgery when he reaches thirteen years old. Her unique entertainment is the theater, where she rehearses 'The Sound of Music' at night, and going to the movie theater with her best friend and colleague Kathy (Catherine Deneuve). Selma lives in a trailer rented by Bill Houston (David Morse) and his wife Linda (Cara Seymour). Bill is a police officer, who spends more than he earns, to satisfy the requests of his beloved wife. One day, Bill finds where Selma keeps her money and steals her. A tragedy happens when she claims her money back. First of all, what a surprise the magnificent performance of the Icelandic pop singer Björk! Catherine Deneuve is one of the best actresses in the world, and the rest of the cast is excellent, but Björk is really wonderful in this role. The direction Lars Von Trier is stunning as usual. But this sad and touching story of an immigrant in the land of the capitalism is marvelous. The injustice with Selma recalls the story of Jean Valjean. It is not usual to see the life of honest low class Americans in films; low class are usually presented as lazy, rednecks, losers, but not as hard workers as the characters of this story are. In most of American films, a small amount is never the problem for honest persons. But in this movie, all the drama happens because of US$ 2,056.10. The main character works a lifetime to raise this amount to save the eyes of her son; the police officer changes his concept of morality and ethics stealing this amount; and Selma can not afford this amount to pay for the services of an efficient lawyer. Very sad reality in a wonderful movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): 'Dançando no Escuro '(Dancing in the Dark')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly and untalented Bjork teams up with old Deneuve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When they will understand that nobody care about musical with ugly chicks like Bjork that don't know how to sing and act. I don't care at all about Deneuve in a factory and Bjork who is blind. Just imagine how this movie could be great with actress like Anna Nicole Smith, Julie Strain or Sandra Scream. Again, this film would have been so good with music that is good!Boring</fullReview>
