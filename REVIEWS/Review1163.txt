		<shortDescription>You've got to be a genius to make a movie this bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A misfire of inanities. This is a failure of epic proportions. You've got to be a genius to make a movie this bad. How does this crap even get made? What I really don't get is all the positive feedback. I love a good superhero movie. Not this. Lousy sound, worse editing, pathetic characters. I wish I had had my brain "Headered" before watching this. This is a type of movie that just don't know the way it's heading. It tries to be funny, emotional and spiritual at the same time, failing in all three.Script makes no sense at all. A mother who encourage her son on tie a turban (religious tradition), herself drinks alcohol, which is strictly forbidden in Sikhism. I mean 5 year old with a pencil &amp; paper could have wrote a better script than this trash. VFX was most unrealistic load of crap that one could see in there life time. Considering the budget on this thing, it could have been a lot better. The movie was boring, and the acting was pretty lame. Tiger shroff's acting was so awe-inspiringly wooden that it is basically a fire risk. I'm not even sure it's supposed to be a comedy.A Tip - to anyone looking for a decent Superheo movie. Stay clear of this one. I know i will in future. I think you can better spend time doing nothing or can keep on staring at a wall for 2 hours than to watch this ridiculous movie. Don't waste your time and money on this one. It's simply NOT WORTH it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I appreciate the massage given in this film regarding consequences of pollution and benefits of tree planting but it comes as a non creative tight slap, which I can't bear. Director Mr. Remo Desoza first thought of making a super hero movie then tried to make it different so he decided to make the hero coward and confused, then suddenly a divine power inherits him as it had shown many times in old age cinema, like hero is being severely beaten by villain then sparks comes from any God's statue into hero, inducing super power into him. Story by director himself is just like that. Screenplay by Tusar Hiranandani and director, comes in segment wise, all scenes have a purpose like comedy, emotion or love, to convey without any logic or fitting into the script. Yes, light scenes at least make you smile most of the time for sure like mother and brother grooming him as a super hero but then other scenes punches you on face wiping the effect of light scenes too. Dialogues by Akash Kaushik and Madhur Sharma are just OK. Villain is introduced in a desert, then he beats hero badly compelling God to give him super power than Villain disappears from the script and love and comedy take over. Suddenly villain re appears just before interval with some super bad powers because he had survived on pollution and filth. Crisis identity of Hero because of his eye covering mask, even his mother and girlfriend are unable to recognize him!! Movie wastes time to make it clear to heroine that her close friend and super hero are one, till she listens hero conversation with his brother discreetly. Action scenes are also dumb, just cable work and croma work is offered in name of action. When Villain screeches on ground then his back bone supporting armor erupts the land looks good but becomes repetitive in every fight, making it irritating finally. In pre climax hero brother decide to fight with villain even being aware that he can't do anything and his defeat will break people hope but he does because makers have to give some high voltage emotional drama but it looks so deliberate and stupid. Villain most of the dialogues with his typical accent will be big problem for mass audience and kids for sure, which film targets somehow. Film length makes already slow film unbearable. Start credit animation and making with end credits are more entertaining than the film. Performance wise Tiger Shroff is good. Jacqueline Fernandez expresses by laughing and jumping only. Amrita Arora as mother is very good, especially in climax emotional dialogue. Gaurav Pandey as brother is impressive. Kay Kay Menon is OK. Nathan Jones is just for his personality which he adds perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Flying Jatt Movie Review :Well first of, this is a Proper Superhero Film. In the sense, it doesn't just have a superhero costume and some punches and fights thrown about, they tried to make an over the top superhero flick. And sadly, failed miserable. Don't get me wrong, it's good to see Bollywood try different genres but giving these films to incompetent clueless film makers is such a waste of time and resources.Flying Jatt deals with the WORLDS first ever Religious superhero. With powers come villains and our superhero must defeat the villain. There isn't much to the story than that.We can't talk about Superheroes in India without a passing mention of Ra-One or Krrish. To be fair Ra-one was more sci-fi Terminator than Superhero. Krrish may have been inspired by Hollywood superheroes, but it had a tight script and awesome action sequences (with Bad FX) at least its heart was in the right place! But this movie? Let's start with the stupidity of His super power of touching a PICTURE of a person and then adapting that person's abilities. HOW? WHAT? WHY? Even if his powers are magical in nature, that's STILL stupid! His crime fighting includes stupidity such as blowing dust on criminals, as if somehow that would stop them, rescuing a rape victim and then leaving her at the stop of the crime (to be fair superman screwed up the same way in BvS) This movie takes inspiration from EVER single superhero film EVER made. Not just that, it blatantly rips off so many Hollywood movies. The film makers obviously think Indian audiences is illiterate and backward, because who in India would have seen Hollywood ke English films? It's not conceivable right? Except a few minutes back in the film, the hero's mother is shown seeing Avengers and Fantastic Four. Then why COPY X-men Days of future past's Quicksilver scene horribly? That scene is Epic and so memorable that they had to include a part 2 in the new X-men film. The movie is OVER long and the ending is SO stupid, so moronic and WHAT THE HECK, you won't even believe it If I say the ending. SPOILERS The ending takes place on the MOON! Our superhero flies the villain over to the moon and since moon is pollution free, manages to defeat him, while throwing him into the international space station AND a Russian (or what it Chinese) Rocket! (how are they breathing in space? who cares!) Huh? It ends with him looking at Entire earth, Superman Style. This is the movie when you mix wolverine, Superman, quicksilver and captain planet all into one and make the worst sort of mish mash!This movie takes its audiences to be buffoons with ZERO sincerity in its making or depiction of a super Hero. For that reason, this film gets a ZERO out of 10.Rating : 0/10. Cant recommend this film to anyone. Ra.one had its moments, Krrish had its heart in the right place. This one is just a mess. Stay Away !P.S :Credit where credit is due, the VFX for this superhero flick was not bad, especially the ending moon and space sequence was laughably stupid, but the VFX itself was NOT the issue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is\ bad, there was no scary moments but the story is really simple and easy to predict, if you don't have any film to watch and this comes up, I'd say go for it...the acting was pretty average also. there were some good scary scenes and some gore to the film. I just wished they would had a more complex story-line which would made it more cool but I was expecting a really good film but I was proved wrong. Watched it with my friend who is Remo's fan and she was thoroughly disappointed with the movie.The director of the film and the special effects team should not be given praise at all. Do not watch guys.Save your money for rainy days...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Toxicity is everywhere. And some folks derive their energy from a toxic environment. And who's responsible for the toxicity? All of us.A Flying Jatt is the story of a regular guy who has flying powers but also has fear of heights. He can fight a lot of people while at the same time he pays money for buying grocery and is actually a very decent person.Serious scenes are nicely done, and the funny parts are kept funny, there are no cross-overs. Nicely balanced!They've also talked about Sikhism to explain the concept of how people have started making fun of Sikhs (which is very unfortunate) and the 12 o'clock connection, the power of belief and faith.A very fun story about social environment, how evil and toxic can be derived from many sources but good has very few resources. Tiger Shroff is outstanding with his sincerity and action. He is extremely sincere, hard-working and honest towards his work and you can tell by the way he delivers. Nathan Jones is awesome as the antagonist, Raka.Kids will love this movie. You know why? Because kids know things we grown ups don't, they look for happiness in basic things that give them entertainment, some basic message and evoke their emotions. We grown ups read blogs, watch videos and go for classes on learning how to be simple and be like kids. We call it spirituality, kids call it being themselves.The way they eliminate evil is clean up the city; the antagonist (Raka) derives his energy from dirt and pollution. Think about it, a nice way to explain this basic concept to kids - keep your home, your area, your city clean. The way kids are going to see this movie is to learn the fact that if they want to avoid future Raka's, they have to ensure that their area, their city, their place is kept clean and pollution free. Could it have been better? Sure, it could've been, but its easier to write a review than actually executing a thought. If you believe you can make a better movie, why don't you do it.I know many people have called it a bad movie, I guess they appreciate only similar movies that are made in Hollywood, Deadpool for instance but don't appreciate the Indian Film Industry making movies on new concepts. So as an audience, please do not complain about the Indian Film Industry not making different cinema because you are the one creating more resistance to accepting and encouraging new concepts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Jatt fails to take of..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When will Indian makers use some original plot about super hero movies? Very difficult or impossible question to answer. Remo D Souza should stick to choreography and forget about direction or else he will be left with nothing. A flying Jatt has nothing that the viewers have not seen before. You have scenes pulverized from X Men movies to Superman even Jackie Chan movies. When audience can watch original with better handling why would somebody want to watch this. The director was confused regarding the category of the movie therefore, assuming he was trying the movie should have superhero with comedy and a love story with a social message. What we get is a curry that is garish and silly. Direction is bad. Period!Acting is pathetic -- Tiger Shroff should realize merely action cannot make his film work.Jacqueline should focus on dancing and looking pretty unfortunately, she is bad for these traits as well in the movie. Acting was never her specialty.Nathan Jones is good in his characterK K Mennon is wasted. Amrita Singh is decent.Too many songs and some were not even needed. Music is average. Editing is bad and movie lacks consistency. The movie has a god social message but executed very badly. I am not sure even kids will enjoy this movie.. Please do not waste your money on this one. May be wait for the movie be aired on any satellite channel which will be soon.. This Jatt does not take off..Script is bad acting is pathetic</fullReview>

It seems Indian writers are busy with giving only a copy of various Hollywood movies. I laughed when i saw the guy coming out of plastic, #copied from Indian serial Shaktiman, if you remember #plastica, creation of Dr. Jackal. One more place where we see a copy of x-men days of future past scene where quicksilver saves magneto and charles from cops. Seriously, writers haven't done anything of their own. I would love to acknowledge them with the fact that now-a-days people are watching Hollywood movies. Not at all recommended to watch...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like rest of the reviews I agree direction is weak, so is the plot but when they claimed that this film is very much made for children and they will enjoy it - why on earth they would use a 'Twerking' song?That's the problem of Indian films they let these sort of things slip even for the children films and blame on Hollywood films for bad influences. This was my 5th Indian film and noticed their Censor system is not good at all while they speak of High moral Indian cultures.In spite of noble sentimental values, I wish the superhero theme wasn't a religious propaganda. Instead stayed with pollution - Go green - and save the planet theme.The scenes are mostly copied from a few Hollywood films and definitely reminds us of great Captain Planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Total mess of a superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was supposed to be a superhero movie, but falls flat in every aspect. Director Remo D'souza, who is known for his dance-based ventures, brings a superhero film with a religious message but forgets what his forte is. There are so many flying cars in the action sequence of the films, you'd be forgiven for mistaking this to be a Rohit Shetty film. The VFX were very average which didn't match to the expectations. Sachin-Jigar's music was not so clever and didn't go on with the movie and a few portions of the movie are reminiscent of Hrithik Roshan's Krrish (the thing Tiger Shroff wears in his eyes). Kids might like the film considering it's a superhero flick, but 'A Flying Jatt' doesn't fly and sinks without a trace.</fullReview>

Some scenes directly copied from Man of Steel, X-Men Days of Future Past and many more. Indian scriptwriter doesn't have sense to make the movie perfectly. Before the killing of villain, jatt put his hand to earth to fly over the sky, in that time some magnetic powers surrounded in his hand, that is inspired from Man of Steel(2013). Tiger shroff acting is not OK. He is only suit for dance. Chemistry between Tiger and Jacqueline is not good. Amrita Singh acting is horrible. Gaurav Pandey's comedy is OK. Music also not good except beat pe booty.</fullReview>

A Flying Jatt from its trailer did not seem to be anywhere close to being a record breaker of the immature superhero films Bollywood has showered upon us.Starring the new boy on the block, Tiger Shroff as a blue bottle of the combined powers of Dead pool, Superman and Krrish is a delight for your toddlers but certainly not for you.Choreographer turned director Remo D'Souza plans a strong impression with his superhero flick after his dance drama series Anybody Can Dance and he terribly falters. A Flying Jatt is a naive story portraying a non-compliant Tiger Shroff performs and Jacqueline is.Tiger incredible stunts giving a positive message to protect the environment with some delightful songs and a simple-soft love affair ofDespite a loose plot, A Flying Jatt highlights the immaturity of Remo D'Souza as a director and story writer. The story is unaligned still manages to give you some giggles every now and then. Plot but and in a mess with a very old timidThe supporting line up of Jacqueline, Kay Kay Mennon, Amrita Singh and Gaurav Pandey manage to do their bit but do not help the cause much. Nathan Jones, the bad guy makes a standout impression and somehow helps digest the Flying Jatt in the incredible action scenes with the Flying Jatt.Tiger Shroff compared to his predecessor Bollywood superheroes Shah Rukh Khan, Hrithik Roshan and Abhishek Bachchan, Tiger Shroff begins ends up with decent momentum as a superhero. In contrast to Heroapnti and foot but on weak a Baaghi, our Flying Jatt certainly delights with his stunts and moves but his acting a skill still need tutoring.A Flying Jatt manages to fit the standard set by Bollywood superhero films, but on the whole is a dismal state of affairs. Definitely being the only Bollywood release of the week, you are not left with much choice other than the pre occupants Rustom and Happy Bhag jaayegi. To sum up and in accordance with our new review system A Flying Jatt is a Second Class Sleeper journey of two and a half hours</fullReview>

Script is cocktail of many super hero flicks like Krrish&#x200b; ( Dress and flying style), X-Men(Slow motion), Super-Man(Jacqueline Fernandez&#x200b; was flying on Tiger's toes) and Shaktiman (Pollution concern similar like Plastica). Action, comedy, choreography and music were good however Social message regarding pollution and visual effects were not up to the mark. Performance wise Kay Kay, Tiger and Amrita were good but Jacqueline disappointed. Gaurav has done fantastic job in supporting role. Song "Beat par Booty" was treat to watch in terms of choreography and music. Remo wanted to give all-around cinema which include dance, music , comedy but message about pollution has messed up script. Raka's dialogues must be dubbed or subtitle was must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bollywood is just not ready for this kind of genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ra One, Krrish 3, and Drona- superhero movies which have disgraced and disrespected Bollywood on a whole new level. Congratulations A Flying Jatt, you've managed to fall even below that. I get the fact that this movie had a noble message persuading people to save our planet but still, where's the moral support in this movie. Prabhu Deva and Farah Khan- choreographers in which they have disrespected themselves as film directors. Although Farah Khan made Main Hoon Na and Om Shanti Om but after TMK, things got worse. Remo D' Souza is finally in the same category. ABCD was a good film. But for this one, the direction and editing for this film was the main reason why I felt like throwing my shoe towards the screen. The VFX looked like the Govinda version of Superman from one of his 90s movies. The superhero scenes were choreographed very poorly and the characterization was very cringed up. The costume looked like Akshay Kumar when he became King in Singh Is Kingg. Tiger Shroff should leave the acting sector of the film industry. I mean technically his dance movies are a killer and his action stunts are phenomenal but he just can't act. Jacqueline Fernandez was like a kid in this movie I mean she had very kiddish instincts in the movie and she just couldn't leave the comfort zone. Kay Kay Menon was alright during 1st half but ending it just had to be a drag. Nathan Jones who played the villain Raka was like Sunny Deol in Ghayal because throughout the movie, he just shouts which was annoying. The songs were't that great except for Beat pe Booty which had good dancing sequences between Tiger and Jackie. Overall, this movie just failed to entertain and its completely pointless and cringe worthy. Don't spend your money on this atrocious piece of art and just use it to take your friends out for coffee, Focus on Hollywood if you like superhero movies. A message for Bollywood Choreographers.Continue dancing for films but just stay away from the movie cameras and the Director's chair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Hollywood films, we have so many super heroes ranging from Marvel heroes like Spiderman, Iron Man and Deadpool to the DC solid ones like Batman or Superman but apart from Krrish and to some extent Shaktimaan being the popular ones in India, will "A Flying Jatt" create a new genre of Super hero category in Bollywood ?"A Flying Jatt" tells the story of an ordinary Karate Trainer (played by Tiger Shroff) whose life turn upside down when he accidentally hits a extra-ordinary tree during a fight with bad-ass, Raka (played by Nathan Jonson). A super hero is born with the extraordinary power. However, he puts his power to a good use only when he meet his stiff competitor- the evil Raka , who himself inherits the power to destroy the world.Though he is five films year old, Remo has created quite an impact as director after delivering solid hits like "FALTU", "ABCD" and ABCD 2&#x2033;. However, he majorly disappoints with "A Flying Jatt". The problem with the film is that Remo created a mess with the super hero character which could never took off. The opening of the film is pretty decent and once Tiger Shroff gains the extraordinary power, the film is fun to watch. The way Tiger Shroff gains confidence and the his fight with the robbers in the bank is well- executed. After the second half , the film loses the steam and fails miserably. At one point of time, it become unbearable and you would love to leave the theater as early as possible. The screenplay is confusing and gives you headache. Art direction is decent. Cinematography is just about okay. Visual effects, which should be the highlight of the film, is decent at places but tacky most of the time. Action sequences are funny. Background score is bad. Music by Sachin Jigar is fine with "Beat Pe Booty" pick of a lot.Performance wise, it is Tiger Shroff who is only the silver lining in this messy drama. I feel he has not been utilized appropriately since his debut "Heropanti", "Baaghi" and now "A Flying Jatt". Tiger Shroff is definitely a star in making and the action star has done very well to build his image. Nathan Jone is fine as the evil Raka. Jacqueline Fernandez is used to add glamour. Amrita Singh overacts as Punjabi mother.Overall, "A Flying Jatt" is a BIG disappointment. Do not even take the risk of watching the film with your family let watching it alone. Poor 1/5.- Ketan Gupta</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie starts with a short movie on environment which everyone is amazed and has no clue as in why is it being played? (ALERT)There is a businessman Mr.Malhotra played by Kay.Kay.Menon who wants to buy a plot of land to construct a bridge from his factory. Plot of land is owned by Mrs.Dhillon played by Amrita Singh who opposes that. There is a holy tree in the locality which has divine power and is considered the reason for happiness of the people. Aman played by Tiger Shroff is a martial art teacher who loves Kriti (Jacqueline), who is a teacher in the same school and also lives in the same locality. Raka played by Nathan Jones is a evil assassin and works for Kay.Kay. Because of that holy tree Aman gets superpower and Raka also gets superpower. Will Aman save the world from Raka? This is what A Flying Jatt is all about. Only the Actors Amrita Singh and Tiger Shroff are worth watching. There are action sequence after Tiger Shroff got superpower which is every way identical to Quicksilver from X-Men Days of Future past. There are even scenes which can be relate to Sin City, Deadpool and Spider- Man. If you are fan of superhero movies, A Flying Jatt will hammer your brain because of repetitive story line. Neither the screenplay nor the music keeps you active throughout the movie. First half is a bit entertaining but the second half along with poor VFX and CGI effects is very dull.Overall the movie lacks a good story to make this superhero fly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Remo D'souza is known to be a fairly decent choreographer, his filmmaking chops definitely need a revisit as is evident from his latest feature which is less of a superhero action flick and more of a sermon on environment's annihilation by its dwellers.Aman (Shroff) and his alcoholic mother Bebe (Singh) live in a Sikh neighborhood surrounded by their own community members. Their for- bearers had been staying at this exact place for hundreds of years, which is one of the reasons why Bebe sends Malhotra (Menon), an unscrupulous businessman, back when he requests her to give up the land (for a hefty price, of course) because he wants to build a bridge through it. One other reason why Bebe is so adamant is that the land also holds an age-old tree which is considered sacred by the whole Sikh community. However, Malhotra has already planned his strategy against Bebe, and enlists Raka (Jones), a mutated mercenary, to teach her and the community a lesson. It is during Raka and Aman's first fight sequence that the sacred tree gifts him some supernatural powers and the rest is what one can easily predict.Aman, who is now known as Flying Jatt, has the power of self-healing and decides to pit against Raka and Malhotra especially driven by Bebe's emotional narration of her husband and his gang's story of bravery and valor. Meanwhile, Aman wants to get it on with Kirti (Fernandez), a half-dumb, half-pretty doll, who instead wants to get it on with the Flying Jatt. As one can assume, no one, except Bebe and Aman's close friend and future collateral damage, knows that Aman is the Flying Jatt. The half mask that he wears probably weakens one's eyesight.The plot is as thin as the next superhero flick. With a formulaic approach mixed with environmentalism, the narrative takes one on a field trip about the deterioration of nature because led by humans and eventually ends up accusing the audience of vandalism. Towards the end, in between action sequences that take place in space, there is a message that appears from the director about "mother Earth" and how "there's no alternative for her". With that, the film reaches exceptional heights of the definition of oversmart.Shroff has never impressed us with his acting skills, but if one is entertained by his parkour skills, this film might be fun. Singh is fine as the aged mother who uses popular Punjabi dialogues to admonish his lazy son and businessmen who come knocking on her door for land. Fernandez is exploited fully because all she does is wear colorful costumes and move a hip and swoon at her beau's superhero skills. Menon's performance is not the best he has done, but special appreciation for whoever selected the batch of stylish fibrous ties he wears.Overall, the film tries to make a good point, but ends up muddled due to its use of potboiling elements and awful writing.BOTTOM LINE: Remo's A Flying Jatt is only for kids. Wait for TV premiere.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again Remo comes with a half baked script and may be Tiger's star power will save this movie......A decent superhero flick....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most anticipated movies of 2016. After Heropanti and Baaghi Tiger's fans were eagerly waiting for this movie and they want a new avatar of Tiger Shroff. Director Remo is also given some interesting movies in his career as a director. That's why the movie's hype was overwhelmingly growing. Maybe this time, the director and the scriptwriter missed the opportunity to create a good superhero movie.Tiger Shroff is one of such actors who has already good numbers of the fan base and popularity in Bollywood. His previous two movies are commercially very successful and this is a superhero movie which is also very appealing. But the half-baked script and lots of plot holes may be will ruin this movie. The story has a good message but very choppy and sluggish writing of screenplay is the main minus point of this movie. performance wise Tiger was good, Jackeline was OK, rest of the cast are OK and the music was not up to the mark. The direction was very poor and editing was also very poor.This is a medium budget movie and there is two open week for this movie and Tiger has good numbers of a fan following. These two reasons maybe will save this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A FLYING JATT has the ingredients that make an interesting superhero film. A section of the audience might find the film's proceedings to be corny; however, the mass audiences and kids might take a liking for the film. At the Box-Office, the film has the potential to fly, though, not to great heights. The extended weekend will help the film reap dividends at the Box-OfficeMany adults will think that this is a kids movie well its not, seriously because it has so much action and loads of comedy heres my personal review about the movie.Acting rating: 4 Tiger sheroff: 4 Jacqueline fernandez: 4.5 Nathan Jones: 3.5 Kay Kay: 3Storyline rating: 4 entertainment: 5 content: 3.5Music rating: 4Cinematography: 4.5Editing: 3.5</fullReview>
